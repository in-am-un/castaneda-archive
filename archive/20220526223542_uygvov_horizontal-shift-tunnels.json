I got the impression the \"band of man\" was only 4 inches wide.\n\nBut it is in fact 1 foot wide.  He explained in more detail elsewhere, perhaps in one of his final publications where he wanted things to be more \"how to\" like.\n\nAnd there's also a mention that if you get too close to the neighboring non-human \"band of emanations\", it can screw with the assembling of those in man's band.\n\nIt's like \"electrical noise\" messing with your cable TV, if the cable gets too close to a huge motor that's driving your home air conditioning system.\n\nIf you shift 6 inches to the right, you are smack dab up against the band on the right.\n\nSo perhaps, we can only move 4 inches either way and still \"make sense of it\".\n\nHe didn't say precisely, but that's the kind of thing we can figure out ourselves.\n\nEventually.\n\nBut someone did in fact ask him, during the J curve lecture,  how many worlds could fit in that narrow band of man going horizontally.\n\nSomehow the answer 10,000 floated around.  Some of the \"inner circle\" women, typically hiding out behind the chacmools in front of the class and far to the right, might have spoken up.\n\nEllis might have in fact.\n\nThat place in the room was also reserved for visiting important people.\n\nThe 10,000 suggestion fell on silence from Carlos, until someone made a sound like, \"yes?\"\n\nTo force him.\n\nCarlos had a trick.  He could nod to agree, without it being obvious he wasn't just annoyed to have to answer it.\n\nHe could \"end the question\" without answering it, but no one realized he hadn't answered it, until later.\n\nI suppose I wondered why he didn't just tell us.\n\n8,172 worlds.  That's how many...\n\nOr maybe, \"It depends on how big your liver is.\"\n\nSomething...\n\nBut we got nothing.\n\nThere was another occasion when he implied, it was hard to count because the changes as it shifted could be very subtle.\n\nSo if someone's nose got as big as a clown's nose, does that count as a \"new world\"?\n\nHe didn't use that example, but he had something else.\n\nAnd now that I've seen how it works, it makes sense he didn't want to answer it.\n\nYou can in fact, when you get very near to Silent Knowledge, get a \"show\" on that topic.\n\nI don't want anyone to think the tunnel shown is a real feature, of real reality.\n\nTrue, it's similar to something else Carlos described.\n\nWhich is \"jumping grooves\".\n\nBut get that out of your mind.  This is not that.\n\nThis is a Silent Knowledge presentation method.  Just an \"analogy\" to help explain something I was wondering about.\n\nThe fact that it looks like a tunnel with \"furrows\" as the tunnel for \"jumping groves\" is said to look, doesn't mean it's the same thing.\n\nIt's closer to the Wuwonian city, than to the tunnel used to \"jump grooves\" and heal an injury by magic.\n\nFirst, SK mode is a \"thing\".  The assemblage point has moved right over the energy body's assemblage point, and thus they are sort of \"shining together\".\n\nYou get your own beam of awareness, plus the double's infinitely more powerful ability to create phantom worlds at will.\n\nYour tonal's beam of awareness is \"tainted\" with \"rational\".\n\nBut also with \"grief\", \"doubt\", \"worry\", and a host of other side effects from living in an organic body.\n\nThe double is \"daffy\".  Out to lunch.  Illogical.  A joker.  Totally confident in his ability to do anything.\n\nIf you put the two forms of awareness together, you get the \"purpose\" of our Organic self combined with the double's ability to perceive any realm.\n\nI don't know why, but it can result in a \"presentation\".\n\nSilent Knowledge is a \"presentation\". Very much the same as the talking lizards in the early books.\n\nThe presentation method comes from your current latent intent.\n\nI've been building a 6000 mile tunnel, which Fancy was quite pleased with last night.  She grew to full human size, perfectly formed out of pink light.  And solid.  Not transparent as usual.\n\nThen she \"flowed\" like she was wearing a lot of baggy indian clothes, and the breeze from the tunnel blowing \"things\" into my room, was also blowing her.\n\nSo I was slightly \"tunnel obsessed\" last night.  Before the picture you see occurred.\n\nIt started with me trying to use my fixed tensegrity routine to get all the way to Silent Knowledge, in one repetition.\n\nThat's a tall order!  My routine can't take more than 15 minutes even if I do all of the movements with no pauses.\n\nWith normal pauses, 30 minutes.\n\nMoving the assemblage point the entire way on the J curve, is normally a 3 hour job.\n\nBut I seemed to have succeeded.\n\nI was in an amazing \"phantom room\" with lots of very nice details, standing on what looked to be a very real floor, made of shiny glowing golden grass or moss.\n\nI had both preliminary \"qualifications\" for Silent Knowledge.\n\nWhitish light, and phantom room.\n\nI couldn't believe my luck.\n\nI looked up, and there was the \"magical object\".\n\nAn \"object\" appearing that close to silent knowledge, is in full color.\n\nEarlier on the J curve they tend to be pinkish, or bleached out and nearly colorless.\n\nThis had VIVID colors, despite being a very odd looking thing.\n\nI heard a voice.\n\n\"There are 6 moods of darkroom.\"\n\nI didn't realize where it was coming from, until I reached up to make sure my magical object was really there and it turned its \"head\" to look at me.\n\nShit!!!\n\nI never saw that before.  Magical objects aren't supposed to have faces.\n\nI wondered...  I asked it, \"Are you some weird inorganic being, or a magical object???\"\n\nIt began to list the \"moods\" of darkroom.  That sort of answered my question.\n\nIt was a \"Silent Knowledge Entity\", who had substituted himself for the \"magical object\".\n\nMy \"map\" to silent knowledge was getting kind of mushy.\n\nHe finished telliing me the \"6 moods of darkroom stalking\".\n\nI had a pointless question in my mind.\n\n\"Six moods of stalking???  That's not right.\"\n\nBut it didn't answer.\n\nLater I realized, stalking applies to the use of our behavior to hold our assemblage point, or move it.\n\nNormally someone is talking about daytime interaction with other humans. So the \"moods\" help you to plan how to deal with others who threaten to undo your new assemblage point position.\n\nOr it lets you use other people, to move it yourself.\n\nBut darkroom was nothing like that situation.\n\nAnd yet, we do in fact need to \"keep our gains\" every bit as much.\n\nFancy was near, and gave me a lecture on how you can \"wear yourself out\" by only doing the same thing over and over.  You need to \"mix it up\", if you don't want to run out of dreaming attention.\n\nI got suspicious. Was I really in Silent Knowledge and was that weird thing in the air, which seemed to have a face, just a bizarre version of the storyteller guy?\n\nOr was it a visiting IOB, or something else?\n\nI had the magical object, so I looked for dream bubbles.\n\nThose 2 are the \"final steps\" before Silent Knowledge erupts into endless presentations of knowledge.\n\nI glanced to the left and saw that there were in fact dream bubbles spread all along the left side of the room.  Like someone had \"smeared\" them on the walls.\n\nBut to the left was my tunnel to south American, and Fancy was still doing imitations of Marilyn Monroe's skirt blowing up.\n\nSo I glanced right and noticed, there's a tunnel there too!  A \"dark\" tunnel, unlike my own tunnel made of pinkish energy.\n\nIn fact, it's a tunnel with dreams smeared on it.\n\nThe Silent Knowledge entity suggested maybe those are \"furrows\".\n\nI knew the implications of that, so I disagreed.\n\n\"It's just bumpy.  That's not a furrow. \"\n\nIt suggested it must be a furrow, because I could \"sink\" too far into it.\n\nThe weird object was right.  If I gazed at one of the dream scenes, arranged like a narrow door on the wall of the tunnel, I did in fact get sucked in.\n\nSomeone said, \"The Ally of Carlos already showed you that!\"\n\nIt was right.  In Bangkok, perhaps 12 years ago.\n\nI gazed at the furrows trying to comprehend what this thing really was, forgetting it didn't have to be anything special.\n\nI was in Silent Knowledge mode. It might just as well have been the storyteller entity making up stuff which came with a movie about the non-existent library of the Wuwonians.\n\nBut I was obsessed with \"what can that REALLY be?\"\n\nI used up my energy.  Everything started to fade, including the weird SKE with the face.\n\nAs it finally faded it scolded me for not remembering the 6 rules of darkroom stalking.\n\nImplying, I could have gone much longer if I'd heeded them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Horizontal Shift Tunnels", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ea8fy1meaw191": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ea8fy1meaw191.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a37a2c23e842df7f149d57da3880da4daa18bce0"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ea8fy1meaw191.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a29586781c15946846372eafab83407ceb14edf"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ea8fy1meaw191.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63cfa7efee1abe33913c521f343d7ab1e20b5b17"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ea8fy1meaw191.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892514e280ffbe5125d9bb10d28ec68120e17d9c"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ea8fy1meaw191.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9172051fba60fea88cdc4d7752855f9b22c623b"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ea8fy1meaw191.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5f8aa86180000885d5b0a388a1de2d5a12754b"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ea8fy1meaw191.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7448a66983a3c357f8f80c524cbfa6180f846a45"}, "id": "ea8fy1meaw191"}}, "name": "t3_uygvov", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oKYzK65hqVDMdmvt3kdMbgrHmkLxGz7FeLGY8baLnTU.jpg", "edited": 1653603419.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1653597342.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ea8fy1meaw191.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7448a66983a3c357f8f80c524cbfa6180f846a45\"&gt; The Tunnel went to the right with one to the left.

If I gazed at one of the dream scenes, arranged like a narrow door on the wall of the tunnel, I did in fact get sucked in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone said, &amp;quot;The Ally of Carlos already showed you that!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was right.  In Bangkok, perhaps 12 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed at the furrows trying to comprehend what this thing really was, forgetting it didn&amp;#39;t have to be anything special.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in Silent Knowledge mode. It might just as well have been the storyteller entity making up stuff which came with a movie about the non-existent library of the Wuwonians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was obsessed with &amp;quot;what can that REALLY be?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used up my energy.  Everything started to fade, including the weird SKE with the face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it finally faded it scolded me for not remembering the 6 rules of darkroom stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Implying, I could have gone much longer if I&amp;#39;d heeded them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "uygvov", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/uygvov/horizontal_shift_tunnels/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/uygvov/horizontal_shift_tunnels/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1653597342.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iabnt5n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iabdeve", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's the spot at the base of the neck, with those bones making a V shape.\n\nThe one that tensegrity form using fake \"bones\" manipulates.\n\nI can understand now why the old seers were reluctant to touch it with hands.\n\nThat may sound like superstition, but if you actually started to use it directly for intending phantom realms in darkroom practice, the nature of it would be altered.\n\nIt sort of makes sense to me now, that they were so obsessed with it.\n\nWish I had a video of that bone demonstration.

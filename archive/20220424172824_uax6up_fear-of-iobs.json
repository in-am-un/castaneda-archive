At that time, any day practice seemed impossible, but I quickly found a way to conscious sleep paralysis that lead to dreams and maybe some out of body experiences.  I created the sensation of rocking back and forth in my bed, and the sensations became so strong I could easily fall asleep consciously with little effort, and after a while of tolerating the dizzy, SP was all but guaranteed. Soon after I learned this, I think an IOB came to me.  Noises in the room, vertigo, sudden images in my minds eye when awake and watching TV etc... and I freaked out.  I stopped all practice, immersed myself in mundane things, and things got frightening.  I would have sensations at night of being picked up out of bed, shaken, nightmares, and several times woke up with scratches on my face.  I had a rock I found on a trip with my family the year before that was round, smooth, black with red lines in it that almost looked like a salamander, I thought it was interesting, and I kept it with me and used it as a fidget to occupy my mind when I was trying to work on silence.  One night during the crazy nights, it cracked while I was sleeping with it in my hand. I was sleeping with the light on, and at 16, was frequently tempted to sleep in the living room close to my parents room. \n\nPlease understand, I was a teenager then, and I'm still an idiot today.  I'm curious, and I try things.  I'm no warrior, no Toltec, etc. \n\nSo... last night, I was sitting on my patio last night, fire pit was running out at dusk, and I was gazing into the trees in the back yard, and I could easily see a face.  I see lots of faces when I gaze, I've assumed so far it's just something my mind cooks up and shows me as I'm close to seeing hypnoguagic images, which last a few seconds and then go or change to something different. Just images.  But this one persisted for almost ten minutes.  When we came into the house, watched some TV,  Honey excused herself to a shower.  I began to feel watched soon after, probably just me being silly I thought,  but when she came back to the room she was immediately aware of the same thing. Random new noises in the house, especially near the back door to the patio, and twice I heard what sounded like someone blowing into my ear, but without physical sensation. Nothing hostile per se.\n\nShe felt at ease, even described it as a warmth like a gentle camp fire, coming from the door to the outside, like she had a warm blanket on that arm. She's not into the Toltec/Olmec teachings, but she's an open minded individual with strong intuition who puts up with my silliness. \n\nI freaked the f out, it didn't scare me directly, but the memories of my teen years came flying back. I was concerned that my fear could make things bad alone, so I decided to duck out.   We watched TV until I was grounded back into the doldrums. \n\nI probably over reacted, but I did want to know, if I run into something nasty, what do I do?", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fear of IOBs", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_uax6up", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_ae6m0rud", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1650816654.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650814104.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been doing these practices for about a year and following the directing of the forum relatively closely.

I started flying for fun, and I could feel the 'clock ticking' in the sense that I didn't want to lose the dream.  It was a futuristic world with crazy looking tanks/machines/spaceships going down the street.  I wasn't interested though; only interested in my practice.  I thought/shouted intent, and used intent to move the machines up into the air and slam them down onto the ground.  \n\nI leapt up into the air to fly again, and soared into a nearby building.  Inside, where two IOBS .  Man... they were terrifying looking.  One looked like Uncle Fester - bald, fat, pasty, with sunken hollow eyes.  I remember vividly thinking, \"If this happened years ago I would have shit a brick.\"  Instead, they uttered, \"We missed you!\"  And I uttered back, \"I missed you too!\"  and off I went again.  Probably could've stayed and talked with them, but I'm very much into movements and shape-shifting and I love the physics of dreaming, love action/activity.  So I flew back out the window and landed on the street again. \n\nI flooded that dream with awe, joy,  and child-eyed excitement, and it was more than enough to shield me from any negative thoughts or fears.  I highly recommend it. I mean, you're fucking doing magic!  You can either be terrified, or giddy with wonder - in terms of what the IOBS respond too.  I advise to choose the latter, especially based on your post.  They love giddy joy, and they give you space.  Fear they love too, as you know...  avoid it by choosing giddy joy. \n\nI started looking for a scout.  I INTENDED looking for a scout, and asked how will I know which is the scout?  At that moment, I picked out one of the IOBs with bright glowing yellow eyes - totally different looking eyes than  all the others.  Couldn't have been more obvious. He motioned for me to follow, and I flew after him....\n\nAnd then I came out of it.  Fucked it up somehow.  Maybe some noise outside brought me out of it.  I dunno.  Will tackle it again.\n\nWith time ticking, and SO MUCH TO DO AND EXPLORE, isn't it such a waste to get bogged down in fear? I get the vibe you know this  already, but I recognize it helps to have confirmation.  Stay focused on your skills, your practice, your abilities and honing them, and less so on the content/characters of the dream.  After all, you can change the form of the IOBs if you really wanted, or the entire dream.  \n\nRemember, you want this, right?  You wanted magic, and you've found it.  Don't lose sight of how much you've wanted this your whole life, how it's the only practice in the world that shows you the path to real sorcery, and embrace it whole-heartedly.  Dive in with wonder, excitement, and even a sense of urgency because dreams can dissipate quickly sometimes, and you don't have much time to get over this first enemy.  So why waste time on fear, when there is so much more to do?\n\nI think if you adopt a sense of wonder, as an alternative to fear, it may help you.

But I'd hate to have to give up Japanese porn.\n\nSpeaking of which, Carlos had a warning about porn.  I don't remember the first part, but the last part was, \"pretty soon, you're looking at pictures of women being choked.\"\n\nI wonder how he knew that?\n\nI'll tell you what.  7 years ago I had a plan to try to perpetuate Carlos' knowledge, based on gathering a Nagual woman and her 4 winds.  I was going to take them to Taiwan and open a restaurant called, \"White People Food\".\n\nThe Tawanese aren't (yet) as ultra sensitive to such off color racial jokes, and would find it funny.  Especially if the food was indeed \"white people food\", like chicken fried steaks with lots of cream gravy.\n\nPlaced in the college district in Taipei, it would be sure to attract a lot of young people.     For entertainment, I was going to get a bearded brew master, put him in Jesus' robes, and call him, \"Party Jesus\".  Again, the Taiwanese would find that funny.  Sell some T-Shirts to advertise the place, saying, \"White People Food\" on the women's clothing.\n\nThe rooms would be sorcery themed without anyone realizing it, and I planned to invite guest lecturers for customers who wanted to listen in the evenings.   Reach out and find the most interesting magical figures, maybe even including cleargreen people.  The idea was to get the Taiwanese youth population interested in sorcery, but without the burden of Carlos' history.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't have enough power to manage the women, who have all gone off to have babies.  I have a very nice picture of  a double woman with her 1 month old on my cellphone.\n\nFortunately, I got an invite and noticed the internet.  That's where the action is.\n\nBut if I come up with a similiar idea as my original plan, and it's just as much fun, and I still have enough life left to pull it off,  I'll put your guy at the top of the guest lecturer list.

I don&amp;#39;t remember the first part, but the last part was, &amp;quot;pretty soon, you&amp;#39;re looking at pictures of women being choked.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder how he knew that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll tell you what.  7 years ago I had a plan to try to perpetuate Carlos&amp;#39; knowledge, based on gathering a Nagual woman and her 4 winds.  I was going to take them to Taiwan and open a restaurant called, &amp;quot;White People Food&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tawanese aren&amp;#39;t (yet) as ultra sensitive to such off color racial jokes, and would find it funny.  Especially if the food was indeed &amp;quot;white people food&amp;quot;, like chicken fried steaks with lots of cream gravy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Placed in the college district in Taipei, it would be sure to attract a lot of young people.     For entertainment, I was going to get a bearded brew master, put him in Jesus&amp;#39; robes, and call him, &amp;quot;Party Jesus&amp;quot;.  Again, the Taiwanese would find that funny.  Sell some T-Shirts to advertise the place, saying, &amp;quot;White People Food&amp;quot; on the women&amp;#39;s clothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rooms would be sorcery themed without anyone realizing it, and I planned to invite guest lecturers for customers who wanted to listen in the evenings.   Reach out and find the most interesting magical figures, maybe even including cleargreen people.  The idea was to get the Taiwanese youth population interested in sorcery, but without the burden of Carlos&amp;#39; history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&amp;#39;t have enough power to manage the women, who have all gone off to have babies.  I have a very nice picture of  a double woman with her 1 month old on my cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I got an invite and noticed the internet.  That&amp;#39;s where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if I come up with a similiar idea as my original plan, and it&amp;#39;s just as much fun, and I still have enough life left to pull it off,  I&amp;#39;ll put your guy at the top of the guest lecturer list.

It's probably related to the same mechanism that produces colors in the darkness, likely due to the eye\u2019s amplifiers being turned up.\n\nMore bathtub effects: rotate your eyeballs while they are closed.  Cough. Sneeze.  Rub your eyes.\n\nAnd a reminder for anyone new at this; the colors you see at first aren't magical. They don't really lead to the second attention.  But watching anything that puzzles the mind brings the second attention out, especially if what you\u2019re doing is monotonous and repetitious.  My theory is that sleep is a wide range of conditions, not just \u201casleep or not asleep\u201d.

All you have to do is see them vividly one time, and you're better off than the average person.\n\nThe average person never sees them in their entire lives and keeps pursuing cookies.   As they age, all they can do is switch to Church cookies. And Church cookies tend to be cheap.\n\nIt took me 4 hours last night to get into heightened awareness.

I just wasn't going to accept that some nights, I don't get to see them.\n\nIt was kind of odd.  While waiting for them to get bright, I didn't notice that the entire room had become purple.

It&amp;#39;s probably related to the same mechanism that produces colors in the darkness, likely due to the eye\u2019s amplifiers being turned up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More bathtub effects: rotate your eyeballs while they are closed.  Cough. Sneeze.  Rub your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a reminder for anyone new at this; the colors you see at first aren&amp;#39;t magical. They don&amp;#39;t really lead to the second attention.  But watching anything that puzzles the mind brings the second attention out, especially if what you\u2019re doing is monotonous and repetitious.  My theory is that sleep is a wide range of conditions, not just \u201casleep or not asleep\u201d.  Monotony bores you and you fall asleep, sort of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s not practical to use the bathtub!   All you have to do is see them vividly one time, and you&amp;#39;re better off than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The average person never sees them in their entire lives and keeps pursuing cookies.   As they age, all they can do is switch to Church cookies. And Church cookies tend to be cheap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took me 4 hours last night to get into heightened awareness. Before then, I couldn&amp;#39;t scoop or compress colors worth a damn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the memory of how bright the colors would become, and how much fun it is to toss glowing balls of colors, kept me going.  I just wasn&amp;#39;t going to accept that some nights, I don&amp;#39;t get to see them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was kind of odd.  While waiting for them to get bright, I didn&amp;#39;t notice that the entire room had become purple.

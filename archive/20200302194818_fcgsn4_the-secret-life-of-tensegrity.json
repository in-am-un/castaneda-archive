You\u2019re looking around on the ground for anything different. Something that\u2019s not supposed to be there, but is anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s searching for something coming from the second attention.\n\nOr \u201cenergy\u201d if you like. And if you find it, and sit there, you\u2019ll be energized!\n\nSounds like the long form of \u201cunbending intent\u201d, where you look up in the air to find energy you can scoop onto your body.\n\nIf this link goes away, it\u2019s just the pic I posted elsewhere as \u201cSo what\u2019s this Nonsense about Scooping Colors?\u201d\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=12m16s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=12m16s)\n\nBut you might offer this objection.\n\nOk, he\u2019s looking around for stuff on the ground.\n\nThat\u2019s not an exercise!\n\nExcept that crawling around on the ground redeploys energy as fast as anything else!  And it sure is exercise.\n\nJust try that for a couple of hours the way Carlos did.\n\nYou get the added benefit of the earth\u2019s emanations, the same way Genaro tried to hug the earth, and ended up swimming on it instead, around the height at which you would crawl.\n\nThere was also another main point of tensegrity in that \"finding your spot\" exercise.\n\nSomething that\u2019s part of any tensegrity move.\n\nThat point would be, doing something really stupid, despite the fact that it\u2019s clearly a useless activity and can\u2019t possibly produce the results promised.\n\nCarlos called that \u201cjumping\u201d.  He used that term to reference tasks he proposed for us, and the act of accepting the task without question.\n\nIn that unbending intent form I linked to above, Carlos certainly has those young people jumping!\n\nBut isn\u2019t that also unbending intent? You intend something and ignore the fact that\u2019s it\u2019s delusional, impossible, or pointless.  You continue to do it anyway.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why that series uses the word *intent* in the name?\n\nThere are more accounts in his books which contain tensegrity and aren't obvious.\n\nLet\u2019s take Zuleica\u2019s technique, to wiggle the fingers at the point of the second attention while scooping colors there.\n\nShe didn\u2019t use that on Josefina. Josefina didn\u2019t need to gather the colors into her body. She swished right into them, skipping all the steps Carlos had to follow.\n\nWitches\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t even ask me what Cholita\u2019s up to in her garden, but if you think it\u2019s just decorations you should see the axe and sledgehammer hidden at the start of that maze.\n\nWitches find their own way.\n\nDo we have to use the movement (tensegrity) that Zuleica taught Carlos to use, to restore his energy body?\n\nNo.  Of course not.  Zuleica had him in a small room, in absolute darkness.\n\nShe just didn\u2019t want him hopping around. If he\u2019d been doing that tensegrity long form, he\u2019d never have accomplished what he did by just sitting there, scooping and wiggling his fingers. It would be a constant search for whether he\u2019s about to bump into the wall.\n\nSince he was in heightened awareness there was no worry about falling asleep. So sitting quietly was fine.\n\nWe aren\u2019t in heightened awareness. So I highly recommend moving around at least a little, when practicing colors in darkness.\n\nOr you\u2019ll fall asleep.\n\nEven running man is better than nothing.\n\nYou can use whatever tensegrity you like to play with colors.\n\nLast night, I was scooping energy into my V spot when I noticed something odd. An \u201cintensity\u201d of the colors in front of me, scooped there by the tensegrity move. They resembled what I\u2019d discovered a night or two before, testing Cholita\u2019s claw technique which can be used to rewind dreams.\n\nI realized you can intensify the purple fog until it breaks into tiny fragments in front of you.  You just increase the fierceness of your gaze.\n\nYou insist it has to have more details, and so it does. Inorganic beings behave in a similar fashion. If you stare hard and insist on seeing details, they break up into tiny pieces.\n\nWhen intensifying colors in darkness, instead of just a blob of light  you end up with buzzing, vibrating pieces of purple energy.\n\nThey\u2019re held that way by your insistence. Or maybe will. Or maybe intent.\n\nI put that knowledge to use while continuing to scoop energy into the V spot.\n\nAt one point, I noticed a vertical bar or panel of light had formed in front of me. It was around 2 feet away, the same width as me, and the same height. The scooping action is what was producing it.\n\nAn inorganic being materialized in the concentration of lights.\n\nJust his upper half. But that was too curious to pass up!\n\nI\u2019d seen them show up to sample redeployed energy.\n\nBut not to watch!\n\nI tried another tensegrity move, and it had different results. A different flow of energy to watch.\n\nI returned to the V spot technique, and the inorganic being manifested again. He was in fact watching.\n\nI got a strange look from his eyes, and had a sudden realization about Tensegrity.\n\nIdeas just poured into my mind too fast to keep track of. I was *seeing* other possible ways in which Tensegrity could be used, both in daylight, and in darkness.\n\nAfter I realized each new thing, I noticed that the last one was gone. It was no longer comprehensible.\n\nThey weren\u2019t complicated ideas!\n\nThey felt ordinary.\n\nBut somehow, they were coming from the second attention and I was not going to be able to retain them.\n\nI had no choice but to break an important rule.\n\nNo light.\n\nAny light, and you lose the full hour you put in, to get your eyes used to the dark.\n\nI got my cellphone out to make notes.\n\nThe light was sure to disrupt all the time it took my eyes to get used to the darkness enough to see an inorganic being in that V spot move.\n\nBut I wanted the notes more than I wanted to preserve that advantage.\n\nI typed in as many as I could remember, then wasn\u2019t clear on one point, so I continued to scoop into the V spot, hoping to remember it.\n\nI left the cellphone on, and held it in my left hand. I kept it as far away as I could, when scooping with the right hand.\n\nAs I did that I noticed, the cellphone created a patch of twilight in the middle.\n\nWhile scooping, that area intensified the same way I\u2019d noticed you can intensify your gaze at colors in darkness. The vague purple smoke became a pattern of tiny tiles.\n\nIn other words, the cellphone was intensifying my gaze, automatically, due to the lighting change.\n\nBetween dark and light, there was a \u201csweet spot\u201d for seeing those details.\n\nI stared into the cellphone to add that note, and when I looked away I realized I\u2019d burned the cellphone into my eyes.\n\nThere was a purple rectangle visible on the wall. Left overs from the bright cellphone screen.\n\nI continued using the move, and realized, if someone hasn\u2019t yet learned to see colors in darkness, they could use their cellphone to help!\n\nIn fact, the Fire Kasina folks, led by Daniel, do just that with candles!\n\nHey Daniel!  Cellphones too perhaps?\n\nCandles burn away.\n\nThat gave me the idea for \u201cCell Phone Tensegrity\u201d.\n\nJust do normal tensegrity, but hold the cell phone and keep it on.\n\nAnd do it in the darkness.\n\nBurn images into your eyes with the screen, and then while doing the tensegrity follow the after-images with your eyes, as if you were more advanced and could find colors in the darkness.\n\nIt\u2019ll give you a taste of what it\u2019s like once you don\u2019t need the \u201ccandle\u201d to gaze at after images.\n\nI got a little too carried away, and started to believe you could learn it all that way.\n\n\u201cAll\u201d being, assembling other worlds using Tensegrity.\n\nAfter trying a while I realized that the burnt after images might resemble the colors you can find, but they aren\u2019t the same.\n\nIt\u2019s only a good way to get a clue about how it might feel when you can find colors, and you manipulate them in darkness.\n\nAnd as the after-images fade, you can get practicing learning not to ignore subtle stuff. See how long you can hold them after the phone is removed.\n\nA half hour for one person I correspond with.\n\nThe main point is to watch them, in order to move the assemblage point.\n\nAnd that\u2019s half of what Tensegrity can do.  Move the assemblage point, using a visual display of colored lights and fine lines generated by the Tensegrity itself.  Combined with trying to use muscle memory, which helps to disturb the internal dialogue, and you have a full package.\n\nA way to cheat!\n\nThe tensegrity techniques might restore the energy body.\n\nAnd someone who can *see* might report about them to you, so that you can look where they described, and see if you can perceive that also.\n\nBut those are too obvious!\n\nThe bigger picture is that they give you something to watch, in silence.   And you don't even have to be very good at silence. They help with that also.\n\nWatching anything that \u201cshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d, in silence, moves the assemblage point.\n\nNot to mention, inorganic beings take notice.  While proof reading this, when I got to the part about the cellphone, mine fell off the cabinet where I had placed it,  5 minutes ago. It wasn't balanced on the edge. It was laying flat on the cabinet.\n\nIt fell to the ground just as I re-read how you might use a cellphone, to do Tensegrity.\n\nContinued\u2026\n\nEdited once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Secret Life of Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qhrfebh90bk41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 67, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhrfebh90bk41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c608db071b3ac92fd421c1a66cc2903b66bd61"}, {"y": 134, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhrfebh90bk41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787c3828e7f3ce4c2d22d9428ded40b1bbc0fe80"}, {"y": 198, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhrfebh90bk41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b37fc441f2a83c21c6805f13f47c129bdb18956"}, {"y": 397, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhrfebh90bk41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20bdad10fde085c22dbbec2f0c5c99ffd78bfebd"}, {"y": 595, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhrfebh90bk41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5ba260faaf8f20a774e438da0bbbc74532aa979"}, {"y": 670, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhrfebh90bk41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b6ae55c55f3ac085b23b9edbb1942538c1cfce4"}], "s": {"y": 975, "x": 1571, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhrfebh90bk41.jpg?width=1571&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dba66523e79e190e76014565ddc590ef4ffa4526"}, "id": "qhrfebh90bk41"}}, "name": "t3_fcgsn4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 9, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=736&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 459, "scrolling": false, "height": 344}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "3 Times Unbending Intent Long Form", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=736&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 344, "width": 459, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "sheeehan111", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pt7n2273_PU/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/sheeehan111"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=736&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 459, "scrolling": false, "media_domain_url": "https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/fcgsn4", "height": 344}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/INtYMK8sGjFWdFwtFj2QrKx-aXMflAj-55utsQdmY1k.jpg", "edited": 1583186473.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1583174898.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qhrfebh90bk41.jpg?width=1571&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dba66523e79e190e76014565ddc590ef4ffa4526\"&gt;The Ending of Cholita&amp;#39;s Latest Spell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Cellphone Tensegrity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pop quiz: What was the first tensegrity move taught to Carlos by don Juan?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding your spot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it.

Left overs from the bright cellphone screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I continued using the move, and realized, if someone hasn\u2019t yet learned to see colors in darkness, they could use their cellphone to help!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Fire Kasina folks, led by Daniel, do just that with candles!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey Daniel!  Cellphones too perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Candles burn away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gave me the idea for \u201cCell Phone Tensegrity\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just do normal tensegrity, but hold the cell phone and keep it on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And do it in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Burn images into your eyes with the screen, and then while doing the tensegrity follow the after-images with your eyes, as if you were more advanced and could find colors in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019ll give you a taste of what it\u2019s like once you don\u2019t need the \u201ccandle\u201d to gaze at after images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a little too carried away, and started to believe you could learn it all that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAll\u201d being, assembling other worlds using Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After trying a while I realized that the burnt after images might resemble the colors you can find, but they aren\u2019t the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s only a good way to get a clue about how it might feel when you can find colors, and you manipulate them in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as the after-images fade, you can get practicing learning not to ignore subtle stuff. See how long you can hold them after the phone is removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A half hour for one person I correspond with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main point is to watch them, in order to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s half of what Tensegrity can do.  Move the assemblage point, using a visual display of colored lights and fine lines generated by the Tensegrity itself.  Combined with trying to use muscle memory, which helps to disturb the internal dialogue, and you have a full package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A way to cheat!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity techniques might restore the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And someone who can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; might report about them to you, so that you can look where they described, and see if you can perceive that also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those are too obvious!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bigger picture is that they give you something to watch, in silence.   And you don&amp;#39;t even have to be very good at silence. They help with that also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching anything that \u201cshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d, in silence, moves the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, inorganic beings take notice.  While proof reading this, when I got to the part about the cellphone, mine fell off the cabinet where I had placed it,  5 minutes ago. It wasn&amp;#39;t balanced on the edge. It was laying flat on the cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It fell to the ground just as I re-read how you might use a cellphone, to do Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited once&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f79edeb57c35c261b9f0892086809d0ee7d2856b", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2562f4e90cb8b9b1343bfb633d0d54e36b73a5cb", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69d46aa151f94619fef8df683f98d420184d0684", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb58bd13fee1b5277d80dc70a957edf8269aeb4", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "_3SLIMHWFLwTypvnuOaJUYPqANWj5dR5MQLkUtw_PDI"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c812fe20-6005-11ea-a726-0e9c39b3b989", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "fcgsn4", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 42, "send_replies": true, "media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "3 Times Unbending Intent Long Form", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=736&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

She often plays soothing music during the night.\n\nI\u2019d been practicing silence before I got up, and if I closed my eyes there were purple skies drifting along.\n\nThe chanting intensified the brightness.\n\nWhile brushing my teeth I had a mini-dream of a woman sitting among others, chanting.\n\n\u201cNama Ooohhh Sahy\u2026\u201d\n\nThe voice rose and fell in harmony to the words. The music that accompanied the chant was beautiful.\n\nIndian for sure, but not sitar.\n\nIt reminded me of the Monastery up a mountain near Irvine. The monks gather in a large theater and chant.\n\nI tried to figure out if it was a recording, or if Cholita was watching a video.\n\nThen I realized, it was Cholita herself.\n\nShe was singing! The sound of her beautiful voice echoed out her bedroom window, and I could hear it in the yard, surrounding her fountain like the path she'd recently laid out.\n\nShe\u2019d lost all trace of her heavy Spanish accent. Cholita\u2019s accent is so thick, people even make fun of it.\n\nBut apparently not while she\u2019s singing.\n\nI realized that the sound of her voice was able to move my assemblage point.\n\nI have no idea where she learned that. As a scout type, she\u2019s driven to look everywhere. Her magazine rack in the living room is filled with nothing but travel magazines.\n\nI realized the same thing I\u2019ve been wanting to write for part 2 for the last 2 days.\n\nThat there are many ways to learn sorcery.\n\nOr in Cholita\u2019s case, witchcraft.\n\nBut what are we really trying to do here?\n\nAre we trying to summon spirits?\n\nSure! How fun is that?\n\nThe Dzogchen people even find that so fun that they make comic books about it.\n\nBut no, that\u2019s not the main thing.\n\nDo we want to learn to walk around like a Zen Master?\n\nYes, that too. Being empty is great! Especially after having that nagging voice in your head all your life.\n\nBut no, that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re after. The internal dialogue is a function of the position of the assemblage point.\n\nThere\u2019s only ONE thing we\u2019re trying to learn here.\n\nTo move our assemblage points, deliberately. Whenever we want to.\n\nI said deliberately.\n\nNot using some trick like silence plus scooping purple goo.\n\nBut to get to that ability, we\u2019ll have to scoop a few times along the way.\n\nOr stare at candles. Or look at pink light behind our eyeballs while forcing silence.\n\nOr even chant.\n\nThat\u2019s so that we can get to the intermediate goal, which is to be able to *see* energy in darkness.\n\n*Seeing* energy in darkness gives us a measuring stick.\n\nYou can\u2019t flatter yourself and pretend you have silence, if you can\u2019t see energy in darkness.\n\nAnd having that measuring stick gives us a warning sign when we start thinking again while practicing.\n\nThe colors fade away.\n\nOnce you can see those colors, you have the ultimate way to use them.\n\nWith tensegrity in darkness!\n\nWhat will happen?\n\nMagic!\n\nThat sneaky Carlos embedded magic displays in the tensegrity.\n\nI\u2019d dare to say, they\u2019re almost like YouTube videos. Each one is entertaining, and when it\u2019s over you\u2019ve learned something new.\n\nAnd it\u2019s so entertaining, you don\u2019t have to remind yourself to watch.\n\nThat\u2019s one hazard of my method. Randomly scooping colors, with no plan ahead of time.\n\nYou forget to watch. You get involved in what will happen, as if that\u2019s what matters. You want to DO something, not just watch, as you should.\n\nBut all that matters is to move the assemblage point.\n\nAnd watching those colors moves it faster than anything else I\u2019ve discovered. Fantasizing about \u201cdoing something\u201d does not.\n\nBut how come we don\u2019t know about this?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Carlos just come out and tell us that Tensegrity was a show to be done in darkness?\n\nGenerally, you could say that Carlos didn\u2019t like to give specifics. He preferred to show us something, and see what we\u2019d do with it on our own.\n\nBut in the case of Tensegrity, he was practically taunting us to do it in darkness.\n\nLook at that video link I included, at the timeline specified. Watch how the proper movements include turning the head, to follow the scooping hand.\n\nOne of the practitioners (is that the Orange Scout?) even forgets to move her head once, and it really stands out.  But on the next pass, she remembers.\n\nI had to discover that on my own. That you have to turn the head to simulate scooping the colors.\n\nLater on, no. But in the beginning, the head has to follow.\n\nCarlos put that information right there, in our faces!\n\nWe just missed it.\n\nBecause they were doing it in light, everyone got the impression that Tensegrity was an exercise used to restore the energy body, and that doing it gave a general feeling of wellness.\n\nThat\u2019s all true.\n\nAnd at the last workshop I attended, someone even decided to turn the lights down.\n\nAs a result of that, I assembled a great band of emanations.\n\nBut no one mentioned that in the long forms, there are \u201cEaster Eggs\u201d along the way.  Gifts you can only see in total darkness.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that they should be in there.\n\nThe old sorcerers used complex movements and rituals, to produce specific results.\n\nHow then could the tensegrity long forms fail to do the same thing?\n\nBut in order to see those clearly, you need a little boost from darkness. Even Silvio Manuel still needed the darkness.\n\nFor example, scooping energy into the V spot in daylight gives you the idea that you\u2019re building up your ability to make decisions.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll feel good afterwards.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing concrete going on there!\n\nIn darkness, it builds up a shield of light in front of you. A palpable surface forms, onto which you can gaze. Mine is around 2 feet wide, and 5 feet tall. It\u2019s fixed right in front of me, 2 or 3 feet away.\n\nEach scoop brightens it. It\u2019s a wall of light.\n\nGazing at a wall of light, coming from the second attention, is like gazing into a magic mirror.\n\nInorganic beings can manifest there. Or portals can open, giving a view of another world.\n\nIf that move were embedded in a long form, then as you approached it you\u2019d already have been watching dazzling displays of colorful light, swirling and forming into shapes, specific to the movements you were doing.\n\nThe displays would hypnotize you into watching closely. Watching will tug your assemblage point deeper into heightened awareness.\n\nWhen you got to the V spot movement, you might easily see that inorganic being each time.\n\nI got a visit from \u201cthe professor\u201d while doing it. I nicknamed him that because twice now he\u2019s appeared flaunting his \u201ccredentials\u201d.\n\nOnce threatening to haul me away for being insane (because he was solid and real and scaring the hell out of me), and once by smoking a professor\u2019s pipe, while frantically trying to explain how to open an ancient vault door which would soon appear.\n\nHe\u2019s one of Carlos allies. Since Cholita moved in, those appearances are extremely rare.\n\nHe triggered this post.\n\nBy designing opportunities to *see* inside the tensegrity forms, Carlos satisfied our desire to be \u201cdoing\u201d something, which is the biggest risk when scooping random colors.\n\nTensegrity in darkness, when you can *see* the colored light, would feel like you were walking along a magical path in the forest, and at each turn there was a new sight to behold.\n\nSomething \u201cto do\u201d along the way.\n\nIn other words, Carlos designed a system with built in mechanisms to prevent the mistakes we can make.\n\nThe biggest mistake is trying to \u201cdo something\u201d.\n\nCarlos gave us that \u201csomething to do\u201d. No need to think about it.\n\nThat leads to the main goal: To move the assemblage point deliberately.\n\nAs you learn what a shift of the assemblage point feels like, playing with colors in darkness, you eventually notice you can intensify your gaze until it produces rapid movement.\n\nCholita\u2019s Claw movement taught that to me.\n\nIt\u2019s essentially just \u201ctickling the web\u201d but with a huge dose of fierce concentration. The fingers are tensed until they begin to cramp, and they wiggle just slightly to insist that the thing in front of you obey.\n\nIf you have puffs of colored light, it\u2019ll break them into tiny pieces and you\u2019ll be pulled in.\n\nRapidly.  And you\u2019ll feel the assemblage point move.\n\nBut instead of blanking out, the act of concentrating on the pieces while cramping the fingers will keep you conscious.\n\nAnd thus, there\u2019s one way to learn to move the assemblage point deliberately.  Form a sustained concrete structure of light, and concentrate your gaze into it.\n\nI wanted to thank Cholita for the claw.\n\nDriving to get groceries last night, Cholita suddenly asked, \u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\nI told her I\u2019d tried out her claw movement, and it was amazing.\n\n\u201cOf course\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cAnd how did you use it?\u201d, she asked.\n\nI explained I had discovered I could rewind dreams with it, and freeze the people at the point I wanted.\n\nAll she had to say about that was, \u201cSo you can pick their pockets?\u201d", "edited": 1583358094.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fjhatp2", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part two:  Tensegrity In Darkness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke this morning to the sound of a beautiful woman\u2019s voice signing in Hindi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t make out the words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a love song.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was coming from Cholita\u2019s room. She often plays soothing music during the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d been practicing silence before I got up, and if I closed my eyes there were purple skies drifting along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chanting intensified the brightness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While brushing my teeth I had a mini-dream of a woman sitting among others, chanting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNama Ooohhh Sahy\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voice rose and fell in harmony to the words. The music that accompanied the chant was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indian for sure, but not sitar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of the Monastery up a mountain near Irvine. The monks gather in a large theater and chant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to figure out if it was a recording, or if Cholita was watching a video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I realized, it was Cholita herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was singing! The sound of her beautiful voice echoed out her bedroom window, and I could hear it in the yard, surrounding her fountain like the path she&amp;#39;d recently laid out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019d lost all trace of her heavy Spanish accent. Cholita\u2019s accent is so thick, people even make fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But apparently not while she\u2019s singing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized that the sound of her voice was able to move my assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where she learned that. As a scout type, she\u2019s driven to look everywhere. Her magazine rack in the living room is filled with nothing but travel magazines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized the same thing I\u2019ve been wanting to write for part 2 for the last 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That there are many ways to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or in Cholita\u2019s case, witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what are we really trying to do here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we trying to summon spirits?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure! How fun is that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dzogchen people even find that so fun that they make comic books about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no, that\u2019s not the main thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do we want to learn to walk around like a Zen Master?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that too. Being empty is great! Especially after having that nagging voice in your head all your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no, that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re after.

I wanted to see what happened if I only concentrated on the light show it produces in darkness.\n\nIt was taught early in the official formulation of private classes, so a lot of students learned this as a first technique.\n\nEspecially the students I like to call, \u201cFaction #3\u201d.\n\nThose are private class students who were not part of the inner circle.\n\nUnfortunately, this technique is not taught at workshops. Maybe because Carlos switched to long forms.\n\nHere it is.\n\nOnly the scooping and rocking of the hips matters. And the rocking is pretty subtle.\n\nStand with legs shoulder width apart.\n\nRock the hips back and forth very slightly, while scooping with the hands on either side.  Scoop towards the crotch.\n\nRocking means, your head stays focused on the middle, looking down just in front of your stomach,  while your hips turn left a little, then right, then repeat.\n\nThat will cause the torso to rotate a bit, but it\u2019s resolved at the shoulders so that the head can keep looking forward and down, where the hands are scooping.\n\nThe arms are comfortably at your side while scooping. Not out too far, but not brushing against the side of the legs as they scoop.\n\nLeft hand scoops from a few inches to the left, to the crotch. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s a puff of smoke around 1.5 feet in diameter on either side of your body, near the hips but a few inches out, and a tiny bit to the front. And you want to scoop a little of that smoke towards your crotch. But in the act of scooping, it\u2019s implied you can push it, and it will keep going. You don\u2019t have to lead it all the way to the middle.\n\nThe motion implies, something can be pushed and will pick up momentum.\n\nYou\u2019ll actually SEE that in darkness. No kidding!\n\nThen the right hand does the same.\n\nI looked, and the entire scooping motion of either hand is only around a foot diameter, at the most. It\u2019s all you can reach using just from the elbow down, which includes the hand and wrist, keeping the arms resting comfortably at the sides. Maybe the arms move out a tiny bit, but most of the scooping circle is from the elbow down.\n\nYou just scoop and rock. Left, right, left, right.   You'll have to coordinate which hand scoops when the hips turn. It's a natural movement, so if it's awkward, maybe you have it backwards.\n\nClearly, it\u2019s Zuleica\u2019s technique!\n\nScooping colors towards those vortexes there. The second attention's is just slightly to the side of that.\n\nAnd while scooping, trying to touch the floor with one of your tentacles. In Zuleica\u2019s instruction, once you scooped enough to fold up into your second attention, you tried to learn to move around by touching the floor with 1 of the 2 or 3 large tentacles you might have.\n\nAt least, Carlos had them.\n\nAnd Cholita also. I've *seen* hers.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve actually felt mine touch the floor on several occasions.\n\nIt\u2019s really weird! You literally feel as if your hand or foot touched the floor, but it's so far away that it's impossible. It can even touch the floor through the mattress.\n\nNow here's where I went wrong in my thinking about that technique originally, missing the most important aspect of it.\n\nHere's my thinking as it progressed, until I finally realized the truth. Tensegrity in darkness is awesome!\n\n1).  At first I thought what I\u2019d been told. I didn\u2019t think about what I\u2019d been shown, which was not the same as what I was told.\n\nI was told it's for restoring the energy body by redeploying energy. You do it, and you feel good. And maybe you'll save up enough energy, combining tensegrity with your awesome impeccableness, to get something interesting to happen.\n\nHow'd that work out for all of you?\n\nMe too. Not very satisfying.\n\nAnd it certainly worked even less for the rest of Faction #3.\n\nAll gone.\n\nI'm afraid, that's where cleargreen has been stuck for the last 20 years.\n\nIn the not very satisfying stage. Limbo.\n\n2). If you can see colors in darkness, you can verify that the Tensegrity is in fact redeploying energy. And maybe you can use that fact to move your assemblage point by gazing at the results around you.\n\nIn other words, I wasn\u2019t thinking that the tensegrity itself was designed to produce a \u201cshow\u201d.\n\nI was thinking it produced results, and I wanted to gaze at those, to move my assemblage point.\n\nThat worked better. If you keep that up for 3 hours, you can move your assemblage point all the way to stopping the world, which Carlos said was our main goal once he was gone.\n\nBut it still missed part of what he showed us.\n\nBy having practitioners follow their scooping and waving hands with their intense gaze, he was pointing out that we should be watching.\n\nWatching!\n\nNot wishing.\n\nCome on facilitators!   Stop wishing and start watching!\n\nSo I came to theory 3.\n\n3). The Tensegrity is a light show, designed to move your assemblage point due to the interesting patterns it creates, which make it easier to watch closely.\n\nCarlos has created a variety of extremely interesting effects in the long forms, all designed to teach us how to manipulate our energy body,  how to travel with it, teleport, and lure inorganic beings to come take a look.\n\nIf you\u2019re scooping colors in darkness using your own movements, mostly you just see swirls and puffs, and some general movement of a fog made from light, due to your hands scooping in it.\n\nYour own scooping movements aren\u2019t designed to produce very specific results.\n\nMy trick was to use that light show to locate a hypnogogic head, turn that into  an inorganic being assistant, and then watch her, playing in the lights.\n\nI increased the \"watching value\" by creating a little fairy.\n\nThat worked great!  The whole point is to watch colors, so that the assemblage point drifts far into heightened awareness.\n\nBut what if people just have no luck finding inorganic beings?\n\nI had 2 from Carlos, so I was at an advantage.\n\nPeople who haven't learned to lure them in, need something better than just vague redeployed light in the room.\n\nThat's what the Tensegrity is for!  It WILL move your assemblage point RAPIDLY, once you learn to watch that light show.\n\nAnd faster than  a 4 inch high Fairy!\n\nWatching that rocking and scooping technique, I noticed that a very solid looking ball of purple light, the size of a basketball, had not only formed in the middle, but it was being tossed back and forth by the scooping of the hands.\n\nI remembered the fire Kasina folks announcing they had learned to toss balls of chi around.\n\nThis technique was like a machine that continuously did that with no thoughts needed on your part, other than to keep doing the technique.\n\nWhen the left hand scooped it to the right,  the basketball of light kept going, even after the left hand was no longer touching it.\n\nA realistic looking object made of glowing purple light was right in front of me, going back and forth.\n\nAnd it's directional!  That means, it can't possibly be just an effect of how the eye works.\n\nMy hands had scooped out a clear patch in their scooping range, but outside that small circle they made was more purple fog.\n\nIt was as if the movement just scooped that area of an overall energy field,  into the middle, and it got stuck there as a concentrated ball of light.\n\nI could also see that as the hands cleared out their immediate area, some from outside that, further away from the body, was sucked over there to fill in what the hands had pushed to the center.\n\nConclusion: It\u2019s very hard to remember to just watch the colors you see in darkness. It\u2019s very tempting to want, \u201cto do something\u201d.\n\nBut that\u2019s a mistake. You need to watch those colors, because they focus the attention in the direction of the second attention.\n\nAnd into heightened awareness.\n\nBy making little light shows for us in the tensegrity, Carlos solved the problem of wanting \u201cto do something\u2019.\n\nViewing that, my assemblage point moved so fast that only minutes later I was standing in the middle of another world.\n\nI was also in heaven.  Heightened awareness feels great!\n\nI began to look around, to figure out which world I was visiting.  There was mostly dirt, and maybe some small bushy plants.\n\nCholita got up, went to the bathroom, and banged stuff around.\n\nI was back in this world.", "edited": 1583518438.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fjnzc5u", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night I tested the first Tensegrity move Carlos taught me in private classes.

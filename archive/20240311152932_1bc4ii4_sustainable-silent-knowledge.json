I had to use ChatGPT, and it's never much like what you asked for.  \n\n\nBut this gives the right impression.  \n\n\nI'm not sure where the yellow tint comes from, but it keeps coming up. And someone else saw it a few times.  \n\n\nSo imagine you are sitting up on pillows on the bed, having finished your Tensegrity routine for the evening.  \n\n\nWhich because you've been doing it faithfully, relentlessly forcing silence, now moves your assemblage point all the way to Silent Knowledge. Guaranteed, as long as you don't mess up the evening's practice with some other issue.  \n\n\nIf you gaze down, you can even see your energy body swarming you.  \n\n\nYou can actually feel the \"second attention assemblage point\" where it ought to be, and if you brush your arm around doing something else, you might even detect that point as some fabric or strings hanging in the air there.  \n\n\nZuleica said it would feel \"as thick as water\".  \n\n\nBut fabric might be another way to describe it. It moves easily, but you can clearly feel something brush against your skin.  \n\n\nBut you're sitting with your hands either down, or with your palms flat in preparation for smoothing the air in front of you.  \n\n\nNot sitting up like this in the photo, holding the glass pane.  \n\n\nExcept now you don't have to smooth the air with your palm.  \n\n\nTypically you would manipulate the sparkling Silent Knowledge fog by smoothing it around with your palms.  \n\n\nBut if you reach this \"yellow window\" stage, your silence itself is \"smoothing\" the Silent Knowledge fog.  \n\n\nFrom which any point in time and space might begin to play a video for you.  \n\n\nBut which video plays?  \n\n\nThat's where this \"yellow glass\" area comes in handy.  \n\n\nOr maybe it's just a flat spot in the SK Fog, which is centered around your gaze.  \n\n\nSo that you can \"smooth\" the twinkling fog just by sweeping slowly with your eyes, panning slowly left or right.  \n\n\nNow here's the \"fun\" part.  \n\n\nYou cannot perceive that \"flat spot\" unless you have ABSOLUTELY no thoughts in your mind.  \n\n\n\"Thoughts\" is the wrong word, but you'll have to figure that out for yourself.  \n\n\nNO WORDS for sure, but once all those are gone you can still have \"fantasies\" which don't use words.  \n\n\nThose have to go too!  \n\n\nThis \"flat spot\" can't tolerate that kind of turmoil. The turmoil of a full blown \"fantasy\".  \n\n\nMaybe it's Mary Ann from Gilligan's island floating in your mind.  \n\n\nMaybe it's the lottery ticket you didn't check for being a winner yet.  \n\n\nMaybe its Chinese ribs you plan to cook tomorrow.  \n\n\nNone of those can be allowed, if you want to have that \"flat spot\".  \n\n\nIt's nothing other than a \"clean link to intent\"!  \n\n\nBut consider \"syntactic commands\".  \n\n\nA concept which puzzled everyone in private classes.  \n\n\nAnd yet, it's so obvious to a sorcerer.  \n\n\nCarlos gave the example of \"My Butt is too Big!\"  \n\n\nIf you think clearly, you'll realize that a simple statement like that summons a huge, very complex reality.  \n\n\nWhere butt sizes are judged, people make snide remarks, lonely folks seek \"love\", and mirrors tell the truth about the size of your body parts.  \n\n\nIt's a hellish world!!!  \n\n\nBut even more than that, just about ANY statement which conjures up images, is a syntactic command.  \n\n\nA love song where the woman says, \"I'll be all right.\"  \n\n\nAs she sings about telling her lover to walk away, and don't look back because he'll see her crying.  \n\n\nIt's all contained in \"I'll be all right\".  \n\n\nA nonsensical statement, if you honestly look at reality. She's not in any danger of not eating or drinking enough.  \n\n\nWe already know her \"butt is too big\", or he probably wouldn't be leaving her.  \n\n\nShe has a place to live. So why wouldn't she be \"all right\"???  \n\n\nBut she's going to be depressed for months. Because \"the love of her life\" rejected her.  \n\n\nIt's the point of view of someone fully LOST in that \"not so nice\" imaginary place we call \"reality\".  \n\n\nIt's just a meaningless point in space, once you have many other choices.  \n\n\nPeople have asked why Carlos doesn't visit us more.  \n\n\nI've seen what looks to be him a few times!  \n\n\nAwake too.  \n\n\nBut the real question ought to be, would the REAL Carlos even visit at all?  \n\n\nThis place is an unpleasant obsession!  \n\n\nAnd a \"syntactic command\" statement invokes it, forcing your assemblage point to move to where that makes sense.  \n\n\nWhich is what makes it a \"command\". The syntax of the words force your assemblage point to move to a horrible place where it all makes sense.  \n\n\nThat's what causes the emanations to start transmitting trillions of feelings associated with the bundle of emanations where that reality resides, bombarding you with the blue line nightmare.  \n\n\nBlocking the sight of all other worlds.  \n\n\nBut if you can eliminate ALL fantasies from the mind, you arrive at \"next to nothing\".  \n\n\nThe emanations are not transmitting much at all, and you perceive the \"flat spot\". And the SK Fog.  \n\n\nIf you can find a \"sparkle\", that's a \"something\" coming from the emanations, and focusing your attention on that can cause a \"video in the air\" to materialize.  \n\n\nLast night I was watching \"beautiful alien beings\". Among DOZENS of other things which are now impossible to recall.  \n\n\nI got a show on \"non-human aliens\".  \n\n\nA weird looking person would materialize in a video, and as I gazed at them I realized I wasn't actually seeing what was there.  \n\n\nI was seeing what I expected a \"being\" to be.  \n\n\nIf I relaxed that, they started to get closer and closer to how they actually appear, until finally \"NON-HUMAN ALERT!!!\" erupted in my mind.  \n\n\nThey certainly were... And a lot nicer to look at in my opinion.  \n\n\nThey're weren't quite as \"organic\". Which is a messy business in all honesty.  \n\n\nLook... Let's admit it. Those buttholes aren't the best design one might wish for.  \n\n\nExcept maybe in the middle east and some parts of Africa, where I've heard (from a deployed Army doctor relaxing in a bar in Bangkok) that those are preferred.  \n\n\nThese aliens were so far beyond that kind of ugly detail, that they were simply \"very pleasing\" to look at.  \n\n\nMaybe their variety of evolution produced better results than our \"planet of the apes\" path.  \n\n\nBut that's not what I wanted to describe in this post.  \n\n\nThat's just what happens when you can sustain Silent Knowledge.  \n\n\nI was up to \"video in the air\" #15, deliberately counting them to make sure I could remember at least part of the night, when I noticed a pattern.  \n\n\nThe videos were not \"random\" at all!  \n\n\nEach one was \"about\" a single fantasy image I had failed to remove.  \n\n\nIt seems, very conveniently so, that you can retain just 1.  \n\n\nYou can have one single image in your mind, and still see the yellow \"flat spot\".  \n\n\nIf you have more, it's too \"noisy\" for the flat spot to survive.  \n\n\nBut with just one, the flat spot now becomes a way to \"smooth\" that left over fantasy flat, and it produces a video on that topic.  \n\n\nReliably.  \n\n\nA \"clean link to intent\" seems to partly mean, you can hold one single idea in your mind.  \n\n\nBut we're not talking about some delusional Buddha Boy visualizing \"the Golden Buddha on my head\".  \n\n\nThat's 1 million delusional fantasies.  \n\n\nNot one.  \n\n\nIt's a deal killer. With that much noise in your brain, you'll be lucky to get below the green line on the J curve.  \n\n\nWhat you're allowed to retain and still see that yellow flat spot, is as close to absolutely nothing as one could ever get.  \n\n\nThere's no meanings, no words, no fantasies, and certainly no desire to reach \"enlightenment\" and sit on your own little throne as a \"master\".  \n\n\nThe best thing about sorcery is, no one else will ever care about your \"achievements\".  \n\n\nSo you have to give up on that as a motivation.  \n\n\nIn fact, you'll be hated for practicing real magic.  \n\n\nAll that's allowed to be left in your consciousness, in sustainable silent knowledge, is an \"accidental echo\" of something you had fantasized about earlier.  \n\n\nMaybe even many hours ago.  \n\n\nIt's just a \"key point\" that didn't yet leave your mind.  \n\n\nAn \"about\", which is what the fantasy was \"about\". Except now only the \"about\" remains.  \n\n\nAnd with \"the yellow flat spot\" visible, any of those \"abouts\" in your mind selects the topic for silent knowledge.  \n\n\nThe video plays out, and the fantasy is \"resolved\".  \n\n\nAllowing another.  \n\n\nI resisted the urge to get a Chimp butthole picture to prove my point about our evolution going badly.  \n\n\nI watched a National Geographic special about a very peaceful form of apes, ruled by the females.  \n\n\nMan... They needed some cosmetic surgery down there. Their butt REALLY WAS too big. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sustainable Silent Knowledge", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"7vykaf6impnc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7vykaf6impnc1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30a071724fcb014a49081b41e05041dc1857e41"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7vykaf6impnc1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ef78e9214c3b542b955c50d71e2431bd3979010"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7vykaf6impnc1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e81f17da3b1dde5ee216c03df93c40cc7683110"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7vykaf6impnc1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9c3e088342a83a30a36d5dc6d1157816bbdcfe"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7vykaf6impnc1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=469d5912e39233a5b77317465b289b6abbd4ded7"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7vykaf6impnc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=308713ef77026dc42193d8f92397501fcb3e53db"}, "id": "7vykaf6impnc1"}}, "name": "t3_1bc4ii4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7odScbGC7QmeKEWo2ayE-DSGBrOrrtTtXvIjnohHHM8.jpg", "edited": 1710169118.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1710167372.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;![img](7vykaf6impnc1 &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t afford the time to draw this.

With that much noise in your brain, you&amp;#39;ll be lucky to get below the green line on the J curve.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you&amp;#39;re allowed to retain and still see that yellow flat spot, is as close to absolutely nothing as one could ever get.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no meanings, no words, no fantasies, and certainly no desire to reach &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot; and sit on your own little throne as a &amp;quot;master&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best thing about sorcery is, no one else will ever care about your &amp;quot;achievements&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to give up on that as a motivation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, you&amp;#39;ll be hated for practicing real magic.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that&amp;#39;s allowed to be left in your consciousness, in sustainable silent knowledge, is an &amp;quot;accidental echo&amp;quot; of something you had fantasized about earlier.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even many hours ago.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;key point&amp;quot; that didn&amp;#39;t yet leave your mind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;, which is what the fantasy was &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;. Except now only the &amp;quot;about&amp;quot; remains.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with &amp;quot;the yellow flat spot&amp;quot; visible, any of those &amp;quot;abouts&amp;quot; in your mind selects the topic for silent knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The video plays out, and the fantasy is &amp;quot;resolved&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allowing another.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I resisted the urge to get a Chimp butthole picture to prove my point about our evolution going badly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched a National Geographic special about a very peaceful form of apes, ruled by the females.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man... They needed some cosmetic surgery down there. Their butt REALLY WAS too big. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

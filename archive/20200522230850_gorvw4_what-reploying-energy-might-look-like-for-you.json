You can take that puff in your right hand, smash it into the left hand, pull the right back, and it stretches like taffy!\n\nBut when you first smear it on your body, then look for another puff to scoop up, you\u2019ll be a little disappointed.\n\nYou\u2019ll find that second blob, move your head and pretend to be scooping it, and when you get back to your body the first puff you stuck there will be so vague, it barely glows at all.\n\nBut, it will glow a tiny bit!\n\nAnd you'll still be in doubt.\n\nHey, you're seeing the colors now, so don't be too greedy!\n\nYou have to win the battle for \"directionality\".\n\nMake the wall of fog stop rotating, so to speak.\n\nFace the second attention right on!\n\nAnd if you keep it up (for months), those puffs will stay where you put them, as vividly as this picture.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a chill up your spine the first time you \u201csmear\u201d them down onto your body, and they double in brightness.\n\nYou\u2019ll be walking around like some guy who\u2019s so radioactive, he glows in the dark.\n\nBut why do it?\n\nIf you have to ask, go away.\n\nYou aren\u2019t interested in sorcery.\n\nBut it\u2019s still a good question.\n\nYou\u2019re \u201crestoring\u201d your second attention\u2019s energy body.\n\nZuleica said you could suck the light closer to your body.\n\nOr swish into it like crazy Josefina did.\n\nCarlos sat there tickling the area Zuleica told him to tickle, for months.\n\nI recommend a combination of Tensegrity (like this), and Zuleica\u2019s harp playing movement.\n\nBelieve it or not, eventually you do indeed find things \u201cAs thick as water\u201d, in the way of your wiggling fingers.\n\nMine are like cobwebs. But they are still super cool to find there.\n\nAs you wiggle those, and also redeploy puffs of color onto your body, the second attentions\u2019 energy body eventually becomes visible.\n\nYou\u2019ll see fibers of darkness and vague light, waving around the stomach area there.\n\nSome larger fibers even match the description of \u201ctentacle\u201d.\n\nThink of a woman with very long grey hair, blowing in slow motion in a strong wind.\n\nHow the strands of her hair whip around.  If they separated into much smaller strands.\n\nThat's sort of what the tentacles and fibers around the stomach area of the second attention energy body look like.\n\nHey, if you feel creative, try this!  New idea.\n\nCarlos had us lie naked in an ant trail, to learn what the cobwebs felt like.\n\nWhy not do the same for the eyes?\n\nMake a belt with strands of white yarn tied all around it. Tie a couple of black ones there too, and one bright yellow.\n\nIn a very dark room, but not so dark you can't see the yarn, get a very strong fan to blow on them from behind you. Neither down nor up, but straight out.\n\nMaybe you can train Mr. DoubleTake to accept that sight?\n\nI don't know, but it can't hurt.\n\nAnd there will indeed be a strand of bright yellow going through the mess on occasion.\n\nJust one or to, and not often.\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing sight.\n\nI've seen almost the entire energy body, when Cholita gets enough shopping to relax and let down her guard.\n\nThe one I see in darkness, and the one I see during the day on Cholita, match.\n\nA warning: This is what **I** see.\n\nNo one else seems to have gotten this far, except Carlos.\n\nWe know Carlos could see this because of the design of Tensegrity.\n\nIt's made to manipulate this stuff.\n\nHe once did a pantomime of someone looking for a tasty puff of color, finding it with glee in his eyes, then jumping up to grab it and pull it down, and place it on his kidney.\n\nHe did it standing right next to me, not 2 feet away with a grin on his face.\n\nAnd of course, Daniel Ingram's followers are doing stuff like this too.\n\nBut in the Castaneda community, we don't yet have a second view of this.\n\nYou might say, well there are 25 year practitioners out there! Of course others are doing this.\n\nNope.   You can tell because they're cagey about what they can do.  They talk like this: \"Well, when you're stalking, you recapitulate the thing and then...\"\n\nIt's nonsense designed to end the conversation so they don't have to admit, in fact they've learned almost nothing.\n\nSome who come here comment how \"open\" the discussion is.\n\nLike with Shinzen Young, the westernized Zen master.\n\nHe's refreshing because he just explains.\n\nTells precisely what he can do.\n\nWhen you find secretive people talking about stalking, you have people who have learned nothing.\n\nSo please, take what you get and share it!\n\nDon't be part of the \"secretive sorcerers of ineptness\".\n\nAn ego trip.\n\nBut also don't think to yourself, when you get something cool to happen, \"This isn't exactly what he described.\"\n\nDon't be a nasty inventory collector!\n\nTake what you get.\n\nAsk yourself, who the fuck else can do this?\n\nNo one.\n\nSo don't insist it has to look like what you expected.\n\nWhy did I say that?\n\nYou'll find out, if you learn to do this.\n\nWhen we get a few, we'll have a better idea of what's common and what's unusual.\n\nI suspect Carlos would have hated me doing this.\n\nHe didn't like Nagualist Newsletter either.\n\nBut that's because he didn't want anyone setting limits on other people by giving them a description which is not universal.\n\nI respect that.\n\nBut we're in big trouble here.\n\nIt's all fake out there.  Posturing, fighting, bullying, suing.\n\nInstead of learning sorcery.\n\nIt's all internal dialogue obsessed practitioners, trying to make themselves feel good by pretending.\n\nWell...\n\nMaybe that's only the men.\n\nThe women are like, \"Oh, it's wonderful!  I'm on a path with heart!  Thank you Cleargreen!!!\"\n\nYou're not on a frigging path with heart, until you can see real magic.\n\nThat's the \"heart\" part. The Nagual.  Daily you grow in knowledge, with endless wonders to look forward to.\n\nDoesn't that sound like the true path with heart?  Returning to what you were born to do.\n\nExplore the unknown.\n\nHugging and kissing your workshop friends is more of the same old crap.  It is NOT the path with heart.\n\nIt's the river of filth, with everyone pissing and pooping all over each other, because it's \"cozy\".\n\nWe need to encourage the real thing for a while.\n\nIf one of you who can see colors can use a drawing program, please show us what you see!\n\nYou don't have to wait.\n\nEdited five times.\n\nLast to add assemblage point of second attention.  It's not quite what it looks like, but it won't hurt to try to scoop those colors right into that funnel.\n\nYou'll be rewarded when your energy body starts to become visible.\n\nThen you'll get a book deal idea, and it'll go away.\n\nThat kind of thing is the hardest to see, all because of the \"book deal mind\".\n\nThe cooler, the harder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What Reploying Energy might Look Like for You", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"yybf8d1gpj051": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yybf8d1gpj051.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f57a1a822a98f3b0b893a7dbd9653638d01c06"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yybf8d1gpj051.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbb47430da7b2aead034d84f1747f506f3819b44"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yybf8d1gpj051.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=253d64b57a3f914e069a531a918edaee80e274ee"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yybf8d1gpj051.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8a593c318712f8dfddab66f61310fea46eda1bb"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yybf8d1gpj051.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d737552a87c292fbecba530362b0461d72b0792"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yybf8d1gpj051.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b686c76488d3a32aed638a0500da1a1682a914b3"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yybf8d1gpj051.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75ece6ea8870f4ea9b76b5ba2b16618457ac40a6"}, "id": "yybf8d1gpj051"}}, "name": "t3_gorvw4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 11, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=736&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Posturing, fighting, bullying, suing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all internal dialogue obsessed practitioners, trying to make themselves feel good by pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&amp;#39;s only the men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women are like, &amp;quot;Oh, it&amp;#39;s wonderful!

The Nagual.  Daily you grow in knowledge, with endless wonders to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that sound like the true path with heart?  Returning to what you were born to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Explore the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hugging and kissing your workshop friends is more of the same old crap.  It is NOT the path with heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the river of filth, with everyone pissing and pooping all over each other, because it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to encourage the real thing for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If one of you who can see colors can use a drawing program, please show us what you see!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited five times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last to add assemblage point of second attention.

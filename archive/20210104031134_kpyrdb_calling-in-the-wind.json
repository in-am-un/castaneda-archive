I do it all the time.\n\nI don't use an object.\n\nIt's an \"intent game\".  There are a lot of those in the books.\n\nDon Juan even had Carlos running away from the wind, as if it could attack him. He'd hide behind some rocks, have Carlos watch the bushes, and by the time they were finished with the game, Carlos was convinced the wind had it's own consciousness.\n\nIt's really just Zuleica's daytime gazing technique, \"Hunting for Power\".\n\nYou alter your relationship to the world, by realizing it is alive and aware, not a collection of rocks and stupid plants.\n\nThe final conclusion to this game is when you realize \"the spirit\" (intent) is out there, conscious, and has been watching  you all of your life.\n\nIt produces a very familiar feeling you've forgotten since childhood. Like \"bliss\", but far beyond it.  And even a little silly. Not completely serious.\n\nWhich is why intent can be invoked with humor done to accomplish an impossible task.\n\nThis particular effect is also why, all women are witches.\n\nYou can trust my witch friend Cholita on that one.    She's been on a rampage the last few days, cooking up some kind of spell I'll never figure out, until she springs it.\n\nShe was taught by other witches, but it's not really necessary for women.\n\nWomen notice these things, like the wind being manipulatable,  and try to turn them to their advantage.\n\nAnd because of that force *intent* (the spirit), ANY path you choose, produces some help from intent.\n\nYou just want to pick carefully, because it doesn't discriminate. If you want to be  a Jehovah's Witness going door to door, it'll  figure out how to help you once in a while.  But you're being helped into a very limited pathway. Not a pleasant place to be.\n\nIntent is sort of like a foreigner for a babysitter of an infant.  He's from such a far away place, he has no sense about what Babies ought to be allowed to do.\n\nSo when the baby crawls out to play with the poop in the toilet, intent will help him out, by lifting the seat to make it easier.\n\nBut it only helps when it sees  you have been trying hard for a sustained time, are really focused on what you are trying to do, and if it's a tiny bit bold and funny of you to even attempt it.\n\nUnfortunately, intent has little common sense.  Don't tell her I said that...\n\nIf you want a much longer pathway which produces amazing magic and joy, that's the \"Intent of the Sorcerer's of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nDemons...  I just love to say that to newbies.  It's not really demons, but that's what every religion thinks when they first encounter them.\n\nYou use the energy of spirits, to venture into deeper layers of reality.\n\nOr to frighten your friends.  They were not very nice back then.\n\nThey created that path over eons, long before any religion we've heard of.\n\nAnd it has grooves in reality still there.  You just hook to one of them, and it's like railroad tracks leading to the destination.\n\nThere are also some fine \"fibers\" in the hands.  Little yellow streaks you can project.\n\nYou have to be absolutely silent. No thoughts at all. With eyes open, you raise the left hand to form a claw, and circle it going forward and then down and back up along the chest to repeat it.\n\nThe claw scoops up \"things\" from the air.\n\nI like to use it to accumulate \"dark energy\".  Because that helps get to where you can sense the lines in the hand.\n\nDoing that in the dark, in PERFECT SILENCE (ok, women can cheat a bit), and there will come a time when you can reverse the palm to face your eyes, and see flashes of light.\n\nThe yellow (could be whitish to some) are those \"lines in the hand\".\n\nOnce you can see them, sit cross legged, still in darkness, and try waving your little fingers around 8 inches above your bare legs.\n\nWhen the 'assemblage point\" moves to the right place (sort of like going past \"Enlightenment\" by a few inches), you can feel those lines touch the skin.\n\nI was doing that last night using the palms. I still haven't discovered the precise location from which those lines come.  Our teacher died too soon.\n\nLittle fingers works, but the heel of that palm does too.  You can also use them to open \"energy portals\", from which you can extract nuggets of particular colors of energy.\n\nKungfu masters learn to blow candles with those lines.  Make them flicker from a distance of 16 feet.\n\nOr at least, they used to hundreds of years ago. \n\nNow days, probably not. I searched many years. Never found one who could actually do that. They always said people in the past did it, and they were someday going to practice until they could do it to.\n\nBut like everyone else, t hey never get around to it.

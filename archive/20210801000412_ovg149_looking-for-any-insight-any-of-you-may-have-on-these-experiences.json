[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI've been around for a little while but haven't been as active, one of the primary reasons is I want to only post when I feel there is some real substance/questions that might help me and maybe others.\n\nI've mentioned before that I have some sort of being, I don't label it because I don't want to assume anything.  I have called it an IOB in the past, others said they thought it might be a flyer, and now I'm thinking I might just have a ghost as well as occasional archon/astral parasite type being, which I am not sure, but I think IOB's are the same as astral parasites?  Any opinion on that would be appreciated.\n\nSo every single time I am getting closer to going to bed and really even if I just turn the lights off and lay down trying to get ready for sleep (even if I may be a good hour away from actually falling asleep).  This thing will hop on the bed, crawl around, do various things to my body or energy body, like pulsing on my left big toe, which seems to be a common thing lately, or left calve, or kidneys.  It also will basically join me and influence my dreams, occasionally try to possess me.  Sometimes I'll wake up in the in-between and a few times it has rolled me out of my body and taken me somewhere, but I can't say definitively much about it being anything spectacular or even different from this waking world reality.\n\nSo, for about the past year I've been meditating before bed, eyes closed in dark room, I can do eyes open as well... but it's just a lot easier to really tune into the subtleties with my eyes closed.  I know Dan might say he would recommend eyes open, and I'm thinking of finally moving that direction more in the near future, but the closed eyes have allowed me to really tune into what I can only best describe as the etheric dimension, and at first I discovered a few things that over this past year I've learned more about.\n\nFor instance, I've discovered that as I get visuals, a lot of times I might see a face manifest in front of me and then as I lose the visual, the entity will hop around me, like it's trying to re-adjust and re-connect with me in a way that I might be able to see again.  Or, I might see a ball or object fall in my minds eye and at the same time feel an energetic vibration as if the object was real, but at the same time I can only really describe this sensation as an inner world sensation.  Other times I might hear a noise like a click or other random noise that is in unison with the visuals. \n\n I also want to mention that seeing isn't the most prominent thing, as I've discovered it definitely is perceived by paying attention to my feelings, and often as I pay closer and closer attention, it's like the feeling will open up a dimension that will then allow me to see whatever it is, but which mostly feels like a visual representation of energy, so it's not like the visual is even accurate as to what it might actually look like.  Just a visual representation based off my own vocabulary.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is that if I am doing such meditation where there are people in a nearby room, or just nearby, the energy of their communications/interactions always flows in unison with what is happening on this etheric plane, if there is energy mounting, when it is released they all suddenly yell out in excitement at whatever it is they are doing... if the energy is moving slowly and going through some sort of ordeal, their communication will get more silent and drawn out.  It is always perfectly in unison however.  Not only that, but (with very little skill at this point in my practice) it can most definitely be influenced by me.\n\nI was just listening to \"A Separate Reality\" audiobook again, and towards the end Don Genaro is trying to get Carlos to *see* and Carlos mentions hearing and feeling a giant boulder fall down behind Don Juan's house, and says that even for an instance he could have sworn he actually saw one, but it was more like a fleeting perception.  This sort of sparked a Eureka moment with me and made me want to get on here and ask... well I don't even know how to ask, but I guess... is perceiving this etheric reality exactly what is being mentioned when the Don's talk about *seeing*?  \n\nAnd most importantly, can anyone point me in the direction of some practices/exercises that you think might be most beneficial to getting more proficient with working with and influencing this layer/level of reality?  My first thought/intuition on it is gazing, it's weird how the whole concept of gazing continues to develop inter deeper insights/understandings/meanings to me over the years.  At first I didn't understand the point of it.  But I'm thinking now that, it's learning how to perceive this layer of reality?\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading, and for any input! \n\n(I labeled this as silence, as that's the most accurate thing I can think, as it's silence that leads to all of this being perceived, but there might be a better flair)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Looking for any insight any of you may have on these experiences", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ovg149", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_5rco1mpq", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1627769052.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been around for a little while but haven&amp;#39;t been as active, one of the primary reasons is I want to only post when I feel there is some real substance/questions that might help me and maybe others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before that I have some sort of being, I don&amp;#39;t label it because I don&amp;#39;t want to assume anything.

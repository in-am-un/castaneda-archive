They're the  famous trees that were producing fruit at the wrong time of year and don Juan said it was because they sensed the lineage would be leaving to freedom soon.\n\nBut what readers possibly didn't realize was, elsewhere it criticized the old seers for turning themselves into trees so they could live longer.\n\nSo those trees were in fact old seers.\n\nApparently the reason that lineage knew it was because they were \"rescuing\" old seers whenever they could.\n\nTake Manfred.\n\nThought it was a talking dog?\n\nOr maybe one of those magical second attention deer?\n\nNope.\n\nOld seer.\n\nSame as the death defier.  The lineage was involved in rescue missions!\n\nSo when you're fantasizing about how fun magical dogs would be, keep in mind it was actually a toothless old seer, maybe one the locals knew 8000 years ago as \"Barking Fred\".\n\nBut how did he turn into a dog?\n\nOr did he body snatch a dog?\n\nAnd can you really turn into a tree?\n\nWell, shapeshifting actually works!\n\nI've not only done it, but I can kind of see how it works now.\n\nIt's the same as being shoved through the ticket office.  Carlos was shoved by don Juan, and ended up a mile or two away at a street market, on next sunday.\n\nNot this sunday.  He was thrown by the push all the way to a different day.\n\nThe last, the next.  Carlos didn't know.\n\nAnd he simply walked back home.  From next sunday, back to today.\n\nSmoothly, continuously.\n\nAt no point did he go to sleep or wake up.\n\nThe same happens in darkroom down in the deep red zone.\n\nIf you shapeshift it seems perfectly normal and \"seamless\".  And yet, you could explain it all away if you theorized that while you were outside chasing cats at night, you were actually still standing in your darkroom in a daze.\n\nExcept, if you fell asleep standing up how come you didn't tumble over and bump your head? Maybe even break your neck.\n\nOr for that matter, how can you watch a real window materialize on your wall, look outside and realize there's a breeze of refreshing air coming through the window that can't possibly be there, and so you take a \"leap of faith\".\n\nLiterally.  You run and leap out that window.  And land safely on the other side, on what seems to be a different planet.\n\nYou can do that!   I have multiple times,  under different scenarios.\n\nPlease don't any beginners visualize any of us doing something, and then repeating it exactly the same.\n\nThat kind of pretending is how other fake \"magical systems\" bamboozle their gullible followers.\n\nBy letting them jump to wrong conclusions, which are self-flattering because if their \"master\" is as powerful as a God, so can they be some day.\n\nIt's  a very ugly tendency of students to glorify their teachers. And has created most of the false impressions that other systems actually have the magic they imply they have.\n\nWhen they have nothing more than minor meditative effects.\n\nAnd it's typical of con artist teachers to let their students make up stories about their amazing powers.  It's good for business!\n\nFind a useless former college professor turned Yogi in diapers sitting on a throne, and you'll also find followers have made up stories about his amazing psychic abilities.  Often to see secret things about them in particular.  The guru used his amazing magic, for their benefit!\n\nMother Teresa must have had endless stories about the miracles she performed.  Each complete with an \"eye witness\".\n\nSeveral have even told me that in the Eastern Bloc, some believe Reni has risen to sainthood through her recapitulation efforts.\n\nNaturally.  That's what \"followers\" do.  One would wish they would follow the magic they claim to want, but it's rarely the case.\n\nIn the case of shapeshifting, don't self-flatter, don't exaggerate, and don't allow others to jump to conclusions.\n\nIt's enough to be able to do it for real.  You don't have to pretend you can repeat it on demand.\n\nThat's just not how we learn.\n\nMaybe sorcery is a lot like bowling.  Bowling has a good element of chance in it, so that even the worst beginner can knock down all the pins in one roll from time to time.\n\nLikewise, lucky golfers can randomly get a \"hole in one\".\n\nUnless you're the evil political cult leader Kim Jong Il of North Korea, who got a hole in one on his first try.\n\nHe had eye witnesses.\n\nOr else...\n\nThe point being, please ignore anything you hear about gurus and cult leaders.  Followers are lying dogs.\n\nSo back to shapeshifting.  Which you should never exaggerate but will be happy to discover it actually works.\n\nFrom my point of view, it's like that ticket office story from \"Tales of Power\".\n\nThe tonal, which is your perception of your physical body, can \"shrink\".\n\nMeaning you pass into the double, and become so irrational you no longer care about your physical body having limitations.\n\nYour double can be or do anything.  Just think to your dreams.\n\nIt would not be earth shattering if you dreamed you were under attack and suddenly had the strength of a giant gorilla.  Tossing your enemies around like rag dolls, and breaking their backs by lifting them into the air and bending them in half.\n\nBut other times you try in sleeping dreams to repeat a superpower you remember from an older dream, and can't do it.\n\nYour dream enemies only laugh.\n\nWe KNOW the doing of shapeshifting inside sleeping dreams,  and we even know that it's very hard to repeat.\n\nIt's not really all that different in waking situations.\n\nAnd to do it you shrink the tonal until the rationality of physical matter is not a concern.\n\nOnly the reasoning and purposefulness of the tonal awareness goes along with the other half.\n\nYou shapeshift by changing to the double. Your other half.\n\nWhich explains the incidents in the books where no one was around.  They switched over to a magical situation, seemingly in their normal body and fully awake doing ordinary things, but when the magic became extreme there was no one else around.\n\nCarlos and La Gorda on that bridge is a good example.\n\nBut also when La Gorda opened an escape route for her and Carlos to get away from the allies, the same sort of weirdness happened. When it was over they were back where they started. Despite having left the room.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's unreal. It just means, the double goes where it likes and there's 10  thousand alternate copies of any level of reality if you shift horizontally along the J curve.\n\nJust don't let it worry you.\n\nThe double can \"tune in\" and find this copy and be as solid and real as anyone else.\n\nWe know that from the stories in the books.\n\nAnd I've seen Cholita do it multiple times in her dreaming double.\n\nMight even have done it myself, except how can you know?   You just experience walking around as \"real\".  But in your dreaming body.\n\nYou almost don't figure it out until the next day when you begin to think about the contradictions in the timeline,  which you can barely recall.\n\nWe also know that the old seers turned into jaguars because they left us nice jade figurines.\n\nAnd because those Old Olmec Seers are now almost universally agreed by anthropologists to be the mother of all mesoamerican shamanism.\n\nMeaning, all that the native tribes have in the americas is from the Olmecs.  It's just mutated over time.\n\nAnd shapeshifting is one of the commonalities between shamanism systems.\n\nBecause shapeshifting is easy.\n\nThe hard part is \"tuning in\" to the \"real world\".\n\nSo that you are in the same copy of reality as you normally are.\n\nLet's go over how to shape shift to illustrate the process.\n\nYou have to drop your assemblage point all the way down to the bottom of the lower back.\n\nIt's called, \"The Shift Below\". We call it, \"the deep red zone\".\n\nKeep in mind it's moving along the outside of the egg but we talk about it as if it were superimposed on your actual body.\n\nBecause Carlos did that when he explained the J curve, after letting us know it was actually located a few feet back.\n\nHe moved his finger starting on the left shoulder blade of a young woman, and explained the J curve there as if the assemblage point were located on the skin.\n\nNow, trees have a massive egg shell.   Possibly 50 feet in diameter in some cases.\n\nAnd don Juan commented that their assemblage points were very low.  Far down below the ground.\n\nAnd they lived a long time maybe even because their \"gap\" was sturdier.\n\nYou can actually protect your \"gap\" from the onslaught of \"the tumbler\" by burying yourself.\n\nBut we can't move our assemblage points as far down our back as a tree can.\n\nOur egg is only around 12-15 feet in diameter, if even that.\n\nExcept, we can stretch our eggs!\n\nThe Tensegrity magical pass \"Stellar Hatch\" does that.\n\nBoth up into outer space to bring down awareness from stars (which works extremely well), but also you gaze \"2 stories\" down and look for a glow way down there.\n\nThe size of a baseball according to the instructions given with that magical pass.\n\nBut wait!\n\nOur assemblage point is ALSO the size of a baseball.  Carlos told us so, and even made a diagram of it.\n\nThat egg shell and Nagual's dent diagram.  There's a baseball size but with some lines around it, showing it glows brightly over the width of man's band which is 1 foot thick.\n\nSo when you gaze down at the start of stellar hatch looking for that baseball sized glow, wouldn't that stretch your egg down the right distance for a tree's assemblage point?\n\nAnd you even look for your own to be down there!\n\nAfter that you project that baseball of glow all the way into outer space.\n\nIt's your assemblage point that your guiding with your gaze!\n\nConsider the mashing energy single movement to \"drop the assemblage point\".\n\nYou turn and look behind you down through the floor, while your palms point down in the front and back and you bend backwards a tiny bit to gaze through that like it was a window into a tunnel.\n\nThis is all mostly speculative on my part, but one thing is for sure.  You can very much see a baseball sized blob of intense sparkles and you can indeed see it 2 stories down below the floor.\n\nAnd then project it so far out into outer space that you can't see it anymore.\n\nIt not only works but when it returns a bunch of golden light follows it down, and you can end up with a \"visitor\" on the floor.\n\nA very real looking one, shaped very much like a sun.\n\nThere's nothing ordinary about the inorganic being you bring down with Stellar Hatch.\n\nIts behavior is unique.\n\nMeaning, you really did stretch up there and bring down some alien awareness.\n\nKeep in mind, stretching the egg shape is what both the old seers and new seers do for their final task.\n\nThe old seers changed into smoking pipe shapes. With the bowl down by their feet and the curved \"stem\" part you inhale from going back behind their head and shoulders, increasing their access to the more exciting regions of Man's band of awareness normally not reachable by us.\n\nYou might say that instead of being limited to having their assemblage point up at the blue line, the blue line now extends into \"negative\" depth ranges far above and behind the shoulders.\n\nThey \"turned in on themselves\" going backwards to access \"the Human unknown\".\n\nThey shapeshifted to experience it.\n\nBut what happens if you stretch it 2 stories below you to the depth of a tree?\n\nAnd then do those movements from this tree pass. The ones that make you feel sort of \"tree like\".\n\nAs you picture your \"tree limbs\", won't that send awareness into your own memories of tree branches?\n\nDoesn't that simply inject some glow of awareness into the emanations, making it more likely they'll \"reskim\" a reality with more emphasis on trees?\n\nIt's the same as turning into a crow.  You feel the beak coming from your nose, the wings from your ears, and your chin turns into your feet.\n\nYou visualize a crow and make it \"feasible\" to believe you are mutating into one.\n\nBut with your assemblage point shifted so far down your back into the red zone that it's no longer impossible to just \"picture\" yourself as something else.\n\nThat's how the red zone is!  Any physical magic at all is possible down there.\n\nThe assemblage point shifts horizontally, you pass into  your dreaming double,  and the tonal \"shrinks\" away.\n\nSo that the rules of solid matter no longer seem to apply.\n\nSeem to...\n\nThat's the tricky part.\n\nTurning into a bat look to be the same. Nyei has a demo video where she puts her hands on her ears and flaps them like bat wings.\n\nJulian used to turn into canine forms with Soledad and La Catalina.\n\nCarol Tiggs turns into a fly.\n\nThey told us you need someone to \"introduce\" you to each type of shapeshifted form or the results are not convincing.\n\nBut all that does is add the energy of awareness of the person introducing you, into the awareness you light up by visualizing wings or a beak coming out.\n\nYou will still mutate without the second person to help guide the result.\n\nSo you'll become \"something\" even if you have no one to guide you.\n\nThat's enough for us perhaps.\n\nIf you want to try for a tree I suggest Stellar Hatch until you can visibly see that assemblage point two stories down.\n\nI do that nightly.\n\nThen do the tree form.  To put some of your awareness into past memories of trees.\n\nIt makes some aspect of trees glow, in the emanations.\n\nAnd finally use the \"dropping the assemblage point down\" pass after the tree pass. It's in the picture being done by Miles.\n\nWatch that glowing ball form down there, as you wait in silence to see what dream you end up in.\n\nIn silent knowledge even curving the back alters the appearance of the phantom realm around you.\n\nI tried all this just now several times, but so many other things happened that I wasn't able to keep my attention on that.  And I didn't remember the entire tree form.\n\nI have bigger fish to fry than just turning into a tree!\n\nAnd, something you will discover yourself.\n\nWhen you reach the level to turn into a tree, good luck remembering things.\n\nYou'll be gazing directly at intense \"treasures\" of the magic realm, able to sustain the view, and even play with it.\n\nAnd remember NONE of it the next day.\n\nSo to use an analogy, in order to turn into a tree for real, you have to enter a magic cave filled with \"forgetfulness gas\".\n\nAnd you'll KNOW you have to do that.  That to do magic at that level,  you have to risk the effects of the forgetting gas.\n\nI don't know the cure for that.  But it's one reason Carlos was obsessed with note taking, even in his advanced stages of  understanding.\n\nBecause, the best magic happens when the assemblage point has moved so far that you're no longer completely human.\n\nBut it totally makes sense that turning into a tree would work, and it doesn't hurt people to hear why.\n\nMost importantly, it doesn't hurt beginners to realize that you can combine tensegrity forms to achieve an impossible goal.\n\nCombine 3 in this case, in order to turn into a tree.\n\nBut don't forget about that magical gas that removes the most vivid experiences from your mind.\n\nYou can always \"forget\" and go back to your ordinary life.\n\nThat's how we got into this mess in the first place.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How To Turn Into A Tree", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shapeshifting"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"zv1qpuybi1ea1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dea428fc7d67af0fc9b0d37a12abaf209f5e95df"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=642ecbf2e5be8a92345f0ec3f31a3fd701441791"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbc3da7b307d5d1ec1b0520463b4393bff90b1ae"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffbe2c9d869e89c4aa0a54db79b4f11e5fdd8ee0"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91901d03bab9d7344cfe8911ea69d79b54ce885e"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36676694c1d15476be66fe97743a9abb0d9c4fa7"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8ed96c43860a8d92993ee5abcf1354f6bc7d77d"}, "id": "zv1qpuybi1ea1"}}, "name": "t3_10k38ys", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shapeshifting", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_-av9_sG9s2p2rGM3fJ0F7kGULC8LPIsw3oOpw6CBy8.jpg", "edited": 1674587324.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1674559310.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f8ed96c43860a8d92993ee5abcf1354f6bc7d77d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zv1qpuybi1ea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f8ed96c43860a8d92993ee5abcf1354f6bc7d77d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you really turn into a tree?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan&amp;#39;s lineage had at least 2 who had.

Your other half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which explains the incidents in the books where no one was around.  They switched over to a magical situation, seemingly in their normal body and fully awake doing ordinary things, but when the magic became extreme there was no one else around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos and La Gorda on that bridge is a good example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also when La Gorda opened an escape route for her and Carlos to get away from the allies, the same sort of weirdness happened. When it was over they were back where they started. Despite having left the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s unreal. It just means, the double goes where it likes and there&amp;#39;s 10  thousand alternate copies of any level of reality if you shift horizontally along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t let it worry you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double can &amp;quot;tune in&amp;quot; and find this copy and be as solid and real as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know that from the stories in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve seen Cholita do it multiple times in her dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might even have done it myself, except how can you know?   You just experience walking around as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.  But in your dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You almost don&amp;#39;t figure it out until the next day when you begin to think about the contradictions in the timeline,  which you can barely recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also know that the old seers turned into jaguars because they left us nice jade figurines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And because those Old Olmec Seers are now almost universally agreed by anthropologists to be the mother of all mesoamerican shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, all that the native tribes have in the americas is from the Olmecs.  It&amp;#39;s just mutated over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And shapeshifting is one of the commonalities between shamanism systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because shapeshifting is easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard part is &amp;quot;tuning in&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you are in the same copy of reality as you normally are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s go over how to shape shift to illustrate the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to drop your assemblage point all the way down to the bottom of the lower back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s called, &amp;quot;The Shift Below&amp;quot;. We call it, &amp;quot;the deep red zone&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind it&amp;#39;s moving along the outside of the egg but we talk about it as if it were superimposed on your actual body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because Carlos did that when he explained the J curve, after letting us know it was actually located a few feet back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He moved his finger starting on the left shoulder blade of a young woman, and explained the J curve there as if the assemblage point were located on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, trees have a massive egg shell.   Possibly 50 feet in diameter in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don Juan commented that their assemblage points were very low.  Far down below the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they lived a long time maybe even because their &amp;quot;gap&amp;quot; was sturdier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can actually protect your &amp;quot;gap&amp;quot; from the onslaught of &amp;quot;the tumbler&amp;quot; by burying yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can&amp;#39;t move our assemblage points as far down our back as a tree can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our egg is only around 12-15 feet in diameter, if even that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, we can stretch our eggs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity magical pass &amp;quot;Stellar Hatch&amp;quot; does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both up into outer space to bring down awareness from stars (which works extremely well), but also you gaze &amp;quot;2 stories&amp;quot; down and look for a glow way down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The size of a baseball according to the instructions given with that magical pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But wait!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our assemblage point is ALSO the size of a baseball.  Carlos told us so, and even made a diagram of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That egg shell and Nagual&amp;#39;s dent diagram.  There&amp;#39;s a baseball size but with some lines around it, showing it glows brightly over the width of man&amp;#39;s band which is 1 foot thick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you gaze down at the start of stellar hatch looking for that baseball sized glow, wouldn&amp;#39;t that stretch your egg down the right distance for a tree&amp;#39;s assemblage point?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you even look for your own to be down there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that you project that baseball of glow all the way into outer space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s your assemblage point that your guiding with your gaze!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider the mashing energy single movement to &amp;quot;drop the assemblage point&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You turn and look behind you down through the floor, while your palms point down in the front and back and you bend backwards a tiny bit to gaze through that like it was a window into a tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is all mostly speculative on my part, but one thing is for sure.  You can very much see a baseball sized blob of intense sparkles and you can indeed see it 2 stories down below the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then project it so far out into outer space that you can&amp;#39;t see it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It not only works but when it returns a bunch of golden light follows it down, and you can end up with a &amp;quot;visitor&amp;quot; on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very real looking one, shaped very much like a sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing ordinary about the inorganic being you bring down with Stellar Hatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its behavior is unique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, you really did stretch up there and bring down some alien awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, stretching the egg shape is what both the old seers and new seers do for their final task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers changed into smoking pipe shapes. With the bowl down by their feet and the curved &amp;quot;stem&amp;quot; part you inhale from going back behind their head and shoulders, increasing their access to the more exciting regions of Man&amp;#39;s band of awareness normally not reachable by us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might say that instead of being limited to having their assemblage point up at the blue line, the blue line now extends into &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; depth ranges far above and behind the shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &amp;quot;turned in on themselves&amp;quot; going backwards to access &amp;quot;the Human unknown&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They shapeshifted to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what happens if you stretch it 2 stories below you to the depth of a tree?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then do those movements from this tree pass. The ones that make you feel sort of &amp;quot;tree like&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you picture your &amp;quot;tree limbs&amp;quot;, won&amp;#39;t that send awareness into your own memories of tree branches?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that simply inject some glow of awareness into the emanations, making it more likely they&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;reskim&amp;quot; a reality with more emphasis on trees?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same as turning into a crow.  You feel the beak coming from your nose, the wings from your ears, and your chin turns into your feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You visualize a crow and make it &amp;quot;feasible&amp;quot; to believe you are mutating into one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with your assemblage point shifted so far down your back into the red zone that it&amp;#39;s no longer impossible to just &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; yourself as something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how the red zone is!  Any physical magic at all is possible down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assemblage point shifts horizontally, you pass into  your dreaming double,  and the tonal &amp;quot;shrinks&amp;quot; away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that the rules of solid matter no longer seem to apply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seem to...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the tricky part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turning into a bat look to be the same. Nyei has a demo video where she puts her hands on her ears and flaps them like bat wings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julian used to turn into canine forms with Soledad and La Catalina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs turns into a fly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They told us you need someone to &amp;quot;introduce&amp;quot; you to each type of shapeshifted form or the results are not convincing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all that does is add the energy of awareness of the person introducing you, into the awareness you light up by visualizing wings or a beak coming out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will still mutate without the second person to help guide the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ll become &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; even if you have no one to guide you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s enough for us perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to try for a tree I suggest Stellar Hatch until you can visibly see that assemblage point two stories down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do that nightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then do the tree form.  To put some of your awareness into past memories of trees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes some aspect of trees glow, in the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally use the &amp;quot;dropping the assemblage point down&amp;quot; pass after the tree pass. It&amp;#39;s in the picture being done by Miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch that glowing ball form down there, as you wait in silence to see what dream you end up in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In silent knowledge even curving the back alters the appearance of the phantom realm around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried all this just now several times, but so many other things happened that I wasn&amp;#39;t able to keep my attention on that.  And I didn&amp;#39;t remember the entire tree form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have bigger fish to fry than just turning into a tree!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, something you will discover yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you reach the level to turn into a tree, good luck remembering things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be gazing directly at intense &amp;quot;treasures&amp;quot; of the magic realm, able to sustain the view, and even play with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And remember NONE of it the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to use an analogy, in order to turn into a tree for real, you have to enter a magic cave filled with &amp;quot;forgetfulness gas&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll KNOW you have to do that.  That to do magic at that level,  you have to risk the effects of the forgetting gas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know the cure for that.  But it&amp;#39;s one reason Carlos was obsessed with note taking, even in his advanced stages of  understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because, the best magic happens when the assemblage point has moved so far that you&amp;#39;re no longer completely human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it totally makes sense that turning into a tree would work, and it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt people to hear why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt beginners to realize that you can combine tensegrity forms to achieve an impossible goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Combine 3 in this case, in order to turn into a tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t forget about that magical gas that removes the most vivid experiences from your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can always &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; and go back to your ordinary life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how we got into this mess in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1c61d6d2-b164-11ee-bd2c-26b3935f0eda", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "10k38ys", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 43, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10k38ys/how_to_turn_into_a_tree/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/10k38ys/how_to_turn_into_a_tree/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1674559310.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5on89y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1674570365.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10k38ys", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Dan is referencing \u201cForcing the Assemblage Point to Drop Down,\u201d the 28th pass in the Westwood series, and the second pass in the *Dreaming* sub-series, detailed on page 121 of the book Magical Passes (see the Wiki\u2019s [Booklist page](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/booklist/)).\n\nThe Tree Form is in the Other Beings (Tensegrity) sub-section/category and in [The Recapitulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/tensegrity/recapitulation/) section where it is aka \u201cFacing The Oncoming Time.\u201d\n\nAnd Stellar Hatch is demonstrated in the second of the official DVD videos (\u201cRedistributing Dispersed Energy\u201d) produced back in the 1990\u2019s, [at the 45 minutes 19 seconds](https://youtu.be/7A8PVXRL26g?t=45m19s) position", "edited": 1674574832.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j5on89y", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan is referencing \u201cForcing the Assemblage Point to Drop Down,\u201d the 28th pass in the Westwood series, and the second pass in the &lt;em&gt;Dreaming&lt;/em&gt;

These included \u201csevere beatings, blows from heavy and sharp objects, and strangulation-- all without a sign of injury, or even the slightest trace of wounds or bruises.^36 \u201d\n\n\u200bThe Jansenist, while under the examination of \u201crespected members of society,\u201d  manifested abilities such as: \u201ca twenty year old (who) leaned against a stone wall while a \u2018very strong\u2019 volunteer delivered one hundred blows to her stomach with a thirty pound hammer.\u201d To test the force of the blows the hammer was struck against the stone wall, wherein it shattered on the first try.^37 Another example was another women \u201cconvulsionaire (who) bent her back in an arc until (it) was supported only by the sharp point of a peg.  She then asked  that a fifty pound stone be dropped from a extreme height onto her stomach.\u201d  \n\nAs to why these women submitted to such unspeakable punishment they said that \u201cit relieved the excruciating pain of their trances.^38 \u201d\n\n\u200bWhat explains this?

They just go the \"Psychonaut\" route to build up the feeling of entitlement.\n\nWhen they come here they can't understand the difference, and so they can't manage to learn because only 1 in 100 will even find the time to practice.\n\nAnd a remote viewer or drug user has only the same chances as that original 1% of those who come here.\n\nHaving done \"remote viewing\" doesn't put them in the top 1% of people who will make a serious effort.\n\nIt only puts them into the top 5% of attention seekers in this subreddit.\n\nYou're going to turn out the same.\n\nMight as well go elsewhere to save yourself some time.\n\nDoesn't matter if you suddenly turn polite as you did with Techno.\n\nYou'll never learn.\n\nEven if you dabble a bit, you still won't learn.\n\nWe've seen the \"reformed drug users\" too.

No fees, no donations, no church.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhists alone ought to swarm  here from all corners of the world, to finally get to see some actual magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, we have virtually no takers.  1 in 100 who join the subreddit will try, maybe only 1 in 500 will reach the deep red zone and barely make it to the other side of  the body on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s looking these days like, in fact we&amp;#39;ll be lucky to create the 10 real sorcerers I had originally hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(before I die)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So everyone who understands what&amp;#39;s going on in here watches new people with great interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the new people don&amp;#39;t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were already taking bets in private chat on how long you in particular would last.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You seemed promising, for a delusional shroom user with delusions of grandeur.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, it may turn out that drugs ruin anyone&amp;#39;s chances to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the very way we see here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t agree with that small point, dear comrade&amp;quot; type statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drug users are lazy &amp;quot;comrade&amp;quot; types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They come in here to &amp;quot;get some respect&amp;quot; for their accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(getting high)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go read of it in the wiki on the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They go nuts and get a big ego from the drugs, without having done any work to fix their very nasty internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so they can&amp;#39;t see when people try to help them in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We see the same with &amp;quot;Remote Viewing&amp;quot; people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who does that too much can&amp;#39;t learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because remote viewing is about pretending your results from ordinary dreams and random visions, bragging about them to your remote viewing buddies as if they were real magical experiences, and together they all create a big support group for fake magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Result is that they feel &amp;quot;entitled&amp;quot; to lie about their results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as drug users I suspect.  They just go the &amp;quot;Psychonaut&amp;quot; route to build up the feeling of entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they come here they can&amp;#39;t understand the difference, and so they can&amp;#39;t manage to learn because only 1 in 100 will even find the time to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a remote viewer or drug user has only the same chances as that original 1% of those who come here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having done &amp;quot;remote viewing&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t put them in the top 1% of people who will make a serious effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only puts them into the top 5% of attention seekers in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re going to turn out the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might as well go elsewhere to save yourself some time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you suddenly turn polite as you did with Techno.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll never learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you dabble a bit, you still won&amp;#39;t learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve seen the &amp;quot;reformed drug users&amp;quot; too.

Don't go to sleep.  Just gaze at the ceiling, looking for things that are floating above you.\n\nOdd things can happen!  Stuff that when it happens you're thinking, \"Man this is great!!!  And to think I almost didn't do it.\"\n\nBut then later, you can't remember what was so great about it.\n\nOther times,  you simple materialize in a location where other people are practicing sorcery also.\n\nWho you ask?\n\nPeople you know!\n\nBut forget about that doing you any good. It probably won't make any sense.\n\nAnd you won't remember clearly.\n\nThe picture on the upper right shows 5 people sitting on a shelf, doing some technique.\n\nThey were there, among the others.\n\nI asked what they were doing, and someone asked if I didn't remember the \"Stillnesses\".\n\nThey're 5 different techniques.

Quite a few readers picked up on this and voiced opinions ranging from, \"Who cares if they don't like it?,\" to, \"Please send me back my submission material if the reaction is negative.\"\n\nBefore I discuss their reaction, I'd like to say that WE care if Carlos' group doesn't like the newsletter. It's perfectly fine to take the stand that we are on our own and need every advantage...\"\n\n\"..the gist of the thing is that their group has in fact read the newsletter and finds it to be mostly nonsensical. We heard comments about particular parts of the newsletter, indicating someone had actually taken the time to turn pages (something I didn't expect).\n\nI was told that the objections aren't based on our efforts to share information; they aren't trying to keep information from people. But they are concerned that readers won't be able to wade through the junk and find the valuable stuff. And the valuable stuff might not be all that valuable, and certainly not that plentiful. The atmosphere is not strict warriorship, people are half into things, and the open forum aspect seems to have backfired. It seems that at least one person in Carlos' group got the impression that we were endorsing other Nagualist groups. Let's face it, some of these groups are questionable. I can see how Carlos' group, working extremely hard to provide consistent training for people with an interest, wouldn't be too happy to see their information mixed in with the questionable stuff. All of their hard work could be jeopardized.\n\nIt was suggested to me that the function of the editor is to screen submissions, and that I had not done that well. Unfortunately, someone would have to be trained or selected by Toltec Artists to do that. I could do it, but I have a Fart's point of view.\n\nThen there's the question of whether it's good to centralize the information source at all. It certainly makes it easier for all of us, but consider this: Carlos' group has the pick of any esoteric magazine they wish. Each magazine would be happy to have a new interview for publication every month. Despite this, they switch magazines (making it difficult for us to find the information), even popping up in such unlikely places as Details.\n\nWhile Magical Blend\u00a0seems the most logical place to put such interviews (they even photocopy sold out issues with Carlos interviews and sell complete sets on request), Toltec Artists has elected to place their next interview in a different magazine. I've been told that\u00a0Details\u00a0is out of the issue with the Bruce Wagner interview, and won't do anything to provide it for people. Rumor has it that this is Carlos' favorite interview. Of course, someone who really wanted it could get a photocopy at a library (not likely in 2021!).\n\nCarlos' group isn't necessarily concerned with accessibility. Their behavior is unpredictable, uncentralized, and irregular; exactly what it ought to be, but the opposite of this newsletter. It's not really clear if they want us to share lecture notes. On the one hand, we received a big NO about printing that radio interview transcript. And yet we were told that they weren't trying to keep us from sharing information...\"\n\n\"...Another fatal flaw with the newsletter was discussed with me. Here we are, trying to break away from the social structure, and in doing so we're making new friends and building a \"feel good\" support group.\n\nDon Juan was worried that his lineage would get trapped simply because they got too mixed up with the mood of the death defier. And here we are forming a secret society. To be perfectly honest, I've worried about this too. How do you have an information sharing newsletter that doesn't turn into a focal point or substitute for peoples displaced tendency to seek out the solace and company of other people?

And since they also had limited circulation to begin with...we would be sh*t out of luck if nobody had preserved them when they were still \"hot\" and accessible.\n\nRough estimate is around 80-90 interviews and articles, with some form of direct input, done over 30 years in multiple languages/countries.", "edited": 1635781361.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hiw0nzd", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this group topic, and the perils/rewards, the introduction to the last issue of Nagualist Newsletter was recently on my mind, &lt;a href=\"http://sustainedaction.org/_nagualist/_NNL5/Last_issue.htm\"&gt;http://sustainedaction.org/_nagualist/_NNL5/Last_issue.htm&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...We wanted to warn readers that a reaction from Carlos&amp;#39; group to the newsletter was eminent. Quite a few readers picked up on this and voiced opinions ranging from, &amp;quot;Who cares if they don&amp;#39;t like it?,&amp;quot; to, &amp;quot;Please send me back my submission material if the reaction is negative.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I discuss their reaction, I&amp;#39;d like to say that WE care if Carlos&amp;#39; group doesn&amp;#39;t like the newsletter. It&amp;#39;s perfectly fine to take the stand that we are on our own and need every advantage...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;..the gist of the thing is that their group has in fact read the newsletter and finds it to be mostly nonsensical. We heard comments about particular parts of the newsletter, indicating someone had actually taken the time to turn pages (something I didn&amp;#39;t expect).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was told that the objections aren&amp;#39;t based on our efforts to share information; they aren&amp;#39;t trying to keep information from people. But they are concerned that readers won&amp;#39;t be able to wade through the junk and find the valuable stuff. And the valuable stuff might not be all that valuable, and certainly not that plentiful. The atmosphere is not strict warriorship, people are half into things, and the open forum aspect seems to have backfired. It seems that at least one person in Carlos&amp;#39; group got the impression that we were endorsing other Nagualist groups. Let&amp;#39;s face it, some of these groups are questionable. I can see how Carlos&amp;#39; group, working extremely hard to provide consistent training for people with an interest, wouldn&amp;#39;t be too happy to see their information mixed in with the questionable stuff. All of their hard work could be jeopardized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was suggested to me that the function of the editor is to screen submissions, and that I had not done that well. Unfortunately, someone would have to be trained or selected by Toltec Artists to do that. I could do it, but I have a Fart&amp;#39;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the question of whether it&amp;#39;s good to centralize the information source at all. It certainly makes it easier for all of us, but consider this: Carlos&amp;#39; group has the pick of any esoteric magazine they wish. Each magazine would be happy to have a new interview for publication every month. Despite this, they switch magazines (making it difficult for us to find the information), even popping up in such unlikely places as Details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While Magical Blend\u00a0seems the most logical place to put such interviews (they even photocopy sold out issues with Carlos interviews and sell complete sets on request), Toltec Artists has elected to place their next interview in a different magazine. I&amp;#39;ve been told that\u00a0Details\u00a0is out of the issue with the Bruce Wagner interview, and won&amp;#39;t do anything to provide it for people. Rumor has it that this is Carlos&amp;#39; favorite interview. Of course, someone who really wanted it could get a photocopy at a library (not likely in 2021!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos&amp;#39; group isn&amp;#39;t necessarily concerned with accessibility. Their behavior is unpredictable, uncentralized, and irregular; exactly what it ought to be, but the opposite of this newsletter. It&amp;#39;s not really clear if they want us to share lecture notes. On the one hand, we received a big NO about printing that radio interview transcript. And yet we were told that they weren&amp;#39;t trying to keep us from sharing information...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...Another fatal flaw with the newsletter was discussed with me. Here we are, trying to break away from the social structure, and in doing so we&amp;#39;re making new friends and building a &amp;quot;feel good&amp;quot; support group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan was worried that his lineage would get trapped simply because they got too mixed up with the mood of the death defier. And here we are forming a secret society. To be perfectly honest, I&amp;#39;ve worried about this too. How do you have an information sharing newsletter that doesn&amp;#39;t turn into a focal point or substitute for peoples displaced tendency to seek out the solace and company of other people? Only Toltec Artists could tell us how to do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take it from someone who&amp;#39;s trying to collect and collate that haphazardly scattered information: we are indebted to the people that did do so back in the day, because most of that information would be totally inaccessible to someone trying to do it all &amp;quot;cold-calling&amp;quot; In 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the publications to which Carlos, Florinda, and Taisha gave interviews have folded.

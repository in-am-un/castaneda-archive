The warrior inside sort of, and the war is with the \u201cself\u201d that used to fill my being, the parts that aren\u2019t in line with where I\u2019m headed. Being impeccable in my own doings inside.  It\u2019s inner stuff, not outer.  Has nothing to do with anyone else.  It\u2019s a feeling.  The books help me get through a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a very personal journey for each of us and doesn\u2019t help anyone to spew it all over the posts here but there is definitely something to it.  I needed something to guide me there and I chose the books.  No one outside of me has any idea what\u2019s happening inside.  The only new way I act with people and situations now  is just not giving as much of a shit about anything, and enjoying being alive more.  Sort of\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  that picture in the original post sort of sums up that feeling.  It\u2019s hard to describe but it\u2019s a little uncomfortable to be honest.

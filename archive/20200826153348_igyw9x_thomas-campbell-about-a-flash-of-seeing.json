Like most kids that age, he had frequent spontaneous out-of-body-experiences (OOBE). We would go out-of-body together \u2013 I would go by and join him \u2013 we would have a blast. One time we were exploring the oceans together when a huge whale approached us. As our bodies slipped easily through the whale, Eric\u2019s head for some reason bumped against each of its ribs, one after the next. It frightened him a little; typically we did not interact with our surroundings. We came back immediately.\n\nEric usually had total and clear recall of our nightly adventures. We would often discuss them in the morning \u2013 it was great fun for both of us. Exploring the larger reality turned out to be an excellent father and son activity, though perhaps somewhat unusual. Do not misunderstand me. I was not warping Eric\u2019s tender perspective, or jerking him out-of-body. At about five years of age, most children naturally and spontaneously have lots of OOBEs. I was merely joining him so that we could go together. It was comforting and reassuring to Eric to have me along \u2013 he was going with or without me. I was able to structure the experiences to be both fun and educational (such as exploring the oceans).\n\nInstead of denying and discarding his experiences as foolish dreams (typical parental reaction), I was shaping and sharing them with him. He thought it was cool and looked forward to our outings. Eventually he was no longer a natural, and our forays into the wilds of nonphysical matter reality (NPMR) ended as easily and naturally as they had begun. He, by the way, now has an advanced degree in aeronautical engineering and to this day clearly remembers bumping his head on those whalebones.\n\nI have always been a sleepy head \u2013 nine to ten hours a night is about right for me. Yet by spending so much time in altered states where my body was deeply relaxed, if not officially asleep, I got by on two or three hours of sleep per night \u2013 night after night after night \u2013 year after year.\n\nAt work, I was exceptionally productive, but becoming stranger. I was spending almost as much time in NPMR as I was in physical-matter reality (PMR), and it showed. I soon earned a reputation for being an absent minded professor. PMR and NPMR seemed to blend into a continuum and I found I could live in both realities simultaneously; it was no longer a matter of leaving one and going to the other. Now, it was merely a matter of shifting and splitting my focus \u2013 I lived and was continuously aware, sentient, and conscious (except when sleeping) in both reality systems simultaneously and permanently.\n\nAt first, I could only sequentially (albeit quickly) switch between them. Then I learned to engage mentally in NPMR on one thing while carrying on a conversation and driving a car (or motorcycle) at the same time. Most of the time there was no confusion between reality frames, but now and then, for a few seconds, until I forced myself to differentiate between them and get my bearings, I was occasionally not sure which reality I was in. Both were equally real, they were just different and had different functions. I began to marvel at the mind\u2019s capacity for parallel processing.\n\nFor one relatively short (about six months) period, I was spending more time in NPMR than in PMR. I was a space cadet and obviously needed a keeper. Luckily, being a physicist, and maintaining high professional productivity, I could get by with being eccentric. Nevertheless, I soon realized that I needed to regain a better balance. With a little experimenting, the optimum balance was obtained. I remained eccentric, but didn\u2019t need a full-time keeper to remind me of what was coming next in PMR.\n\nWith the two realities so completely inter-mixed, I began to notice connections between the two. One spring day while walking back to the office after lunch, I noticed that golden-white foam was draped over the trees in a nearby park. A quick reality check indicated I was solidly focused in PMR. \u201cWow,\u201d I exclaimed with mild surprise, \u201cthat is really pretty, but what is that stuff?\u201d By now I was so used to being amazed by the larger reality that what was normally strange had become strangely normal. I studied the white foam; it had the texture of cotton candy. It connected all the trees into one large luminescent mass. It reminded me of a grove of cypress trees along the Gulf coast loaded with glowing Spanish moss.\n\nI thought it was very interesting but had no idea what it was. I wondered if other people could see it. I made an effort to be obviously looking at something. A few passers-by turned their heads to see what I was looking at and then went on about their business without any noticeable reaction. I knew that they must not have seen what I saw because what I was looking at was not ho-hum in the least. It was massive and beautiful. If others could see it, there should have been a crowd forming.\n\nI went back to work, and looked out of my third-story window to see if the light-foam was still there. It was. I closed the door to my office and began to study the phenomenon I was experiencing. I discovered that I could make it disappear and reappear by adjusting the state of my consciousness. Within a few days, I noticed that everything living had this fuzzy light around it, and that there were strands of this nonphysical cotton candy connecting everything to everything. What about inorganic matter, I wondered. I moved my attention to buildings, telephone poles and power-lines.\n\nTo my astonishment, there was a smaller more uniform close-cut off-white light around everything! The light around the power-lines was in motion and bushier than what was around the poles. I was incredulous and I looked repeatedly to make sure. I shook my head, then closed my eyes and opened them again. What I saw remained the same. I had hypothesized this odd light as some representation of life energy. Buildings, telephone poles, and wires with life energy? I knew I had to throw that idea out. The light around the wires danced. I immediately wondered what I would see around an electrical appliance. Would inside things have an aura too, or was it related to sunlight? I looked at the clock on my wall. It not only had light around it, but the light was highly structured and in steady motion. I looked at my programmable calculator and saw a finely structured complex pattern. I turned it on and set it to work \u2013 the patterns changed and scintillated as it worked. Now I was amazed all over again. What was I looking at?\n\nWithin a few days I noticed that people had auras around them that changed and scintillated as their owners talked to me about important things in their lives. A movie theater not only contained ordinary people, but also rows of swirling colored forms. I could turn all of it, or any of it, on or off by shifting the state of my consciousness. Years later, I would only need to shift my intent.\n\nThe connections linking living things became visually obvious. I could literally see that everything was connected. Even inanimate things such as clocks and computers had their complex moving nonphysical energy pattern. This same experience did not happen to Dennis. Perhaps he did not immerse himself in the exploration of NPMR and its theory to the extent that I did. I was extreme in my dedication to the effort. We often grew in different ways at different times and had usually, eventually, ended up with similar experiences. We were in this thing together and I had discussed my experiences \u2013 seeing energy forms \u2013 with Dennis as they happened.\n\n(*continued in next comment)*", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kgkmhqp", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thomas Campbell about a flash of seeing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the OP title of this post, and the content was:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fragment of the book My Big TOE, Thomas Campbell (famous physicist about the days of work at the Robert Monroe Institute):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My son Eric was about five years old at the time.

He's \"edited\" his accounts to make a better book deal.\n\nI have to do the same when I write here, but I try not to mislead.\n\nJuann knows what I'm talking about. You tell the truth, but sometimes there's so many other things going on that you just have to leave those out.\n\nSometimes, to make the story flow well, you have to leave  out an entire half hour because you got distracted, then later returned to what you were doing.\n\nCarlos explained this in class, when complaining about the me-too naguals.\n\nHe said, \"They talk about the second attention as if it were the first attention!\"\n\nSo, while your story might have you discover an amazing dreaming object on the floor, like a magical clock with hands that are actually hands, which you put on the bed to play with,  you leave out the fact that while reaching down to pick it up you saw an entire city of naked female elves under your bed, and tried to lure them out with a piece of candy  for a full half hour.\n\nFinally realizing that wasn't going to happen, especially since they'd turned into red puppies oozing black slime, you go back to picking up the clock.\n\nBut you don't mention that in your account.\n\nYou can sort of judge me-too nagual lies, by how orderly they are.\n\nWhen they probably shouldn't be.\n\nCarlos explained this shortly, in his books. He wrote that he did his best to give the feeling of the flow of ordinary reality, but in so doing he had to alter the experience of heightened awareness a bit.\n\nAlso, in the second attention you pick up history.\n\nNot just images or places you travel to.\n\nAny skilled lucid dreamer knows about this.\n\nAlong with the new reality, come new memories!\n\nIt's not the first attention.\n\nThat's why we're used to memories being stable.\n\nWe always return to this precise spot of the assemblage point, to be in the 1st attention.\n\nSo we believe memories are facts, stable, and  unchanging.\n\nBut in the second attention, both the facts and the memories are controlled by the new position of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd it's not stable!\n\nYou pick up knowledge along with the fun visit to the Whale ribs.\n\nAnd with no obvious reason you should have, from a \"normal\" point of view.\n\nCampbell seems to have no conscience in that regards.\n\nHe's not interested in educating people, so that they can duplicate what he does.\n\nAt least, not in this account.\n\nHe seems to care more about making himself and his son look good.\n\nHis tale is inspiring, but also possibly damaging.\n\nDon't anyone expect the second attention, especially when sharing it with a second person, to be like an alternate copy of the first attention.\n\nThere isn't enough shared *intent* holding it together like that.\n\nI'm extremely lucky that Cholita has \"lost her mind\".  \n\nThat's how she puts it, as if she's hoping to locate it any minute now.\n\nI don't have the means to try to validate shared dreaming with her, so I don't end up with beginners doubts, when I notice that shared dreaming is more like a percentage, than a simple yes or no.\n\nWe could say, 15% shared dream, 85% personal, beats placebo in a controlled double blind dreaming test.\n\nIf you get to 15%, you succeeded!\n\nI'm afraid, the drug companies are sometimes allowed that low of an effectiveness rate, if there's nothing else available.\n\nIt's the same way with Allies and how you view them.\n\nIt's 10% them, 90% you.\n\nSo while Fairy is actually a triangular tube in a pinkish world,  it's ok if you prefer to see her in a  sarong, with scary makeup.\n\nWhen you get to 60% actual vision of a stable reality,  you're probably near to as good as it gets.\n\nUnless you want to move there. Then you can get to 100%.\n\nYou can sort of hear that in Carol Tigg's accounts of shared dreaming with Carlos, if you listen carefully.\n\nCarol Tigg's accounts are \"weirder\" than those of Carlos.  Probably because she doesn't worry as much about making it flow better, as a bragging male would.\n\nAll males like to brag.  It's biological.\n\nMen are designed to show off for the women.  They have to prove their DNA is worthy of offspring.\n\nSo, Carol Tigg's accounts of shared dreaming have slightly more weight to me, than Carlos' accounts.  She doesn't have the same ax to grind as a male.\n\nEach person who goes into waking dreaming, even when there are 2, has a vote in how to interpret raw energy like that.\n\nTwo is simply not enough *intent*, to force everyone into the same view of energy.\n\nOr which direction to go.

You tell the truth, but sometimes there&amp;#39;s so many other things going on that you just have to leave those out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, to make the story flow well, you have to leave  out an entire half hour because you got distracted, then later returned to what you were doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos explained this in class, when complaining about the me-too naguals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;They talk about the second attention as if it were the first attention!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while your story might have you discover an amazing dreaming object on the floor, like a magical clock with hands that are actually hands, which you put on the bed to play with,  you leave out the fact that while reaching down to pick it up you saw an entire city of naked female elves under your bed, and tried to lure them out with a piece of candy  for a full half hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally realizing that wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen, especially since they&amp;#39;d turned into red puppies oozing black slime, you go back to picking up the clock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t mention that in your account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can sort of judge me-too nagual lies, by how orderly they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos explained this shortly, in his books. He wrote that he did his best to give the feeling of the flow of ordinary reality, but in so doing he had to alter the experience of heightened awareness a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, in the second attention you pick up history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not just images or places you travel to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any skilled lucid dreamer knows about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with the new reality, come new memories!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the first attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re used to memories being stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We always return to this precise spot of the assemblage point, to be in the 1st attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we believe memories are facts, stable, and  unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the second attention, both the facts and the memories are controlled by the new position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not stable!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You pick up knowledge along with the fun visit to the Whale ribs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with no obvious reason you should have, from a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Campbell seems to have no conscience in that regards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s not interested in educating people, so that they can duplicate what he does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not in this account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seems to care more about making himself and his son look good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His tale is inspiring, but also possibly damaging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t anyone expect the second attention, especially when sharing it with a second person, to be like an alternate copy of the first attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t enough shared &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; holding it together like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m extremely lucky that Cholita has &amp;quot;lost her mind&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how she puts it, as if she&amp;#39;s hoping to locate it any minute now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the means to try to validate shared dreaming with her, so I don&amp;#39;t end up with beginners doubts, when I notice that shared dreaming is more like a percentage, than a simple yes or no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could say, 15% shared dream, 85% personal, beats placebo in a controlled double blind dreaming test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get to 15%, you succeeded!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, the drug companies are sometimes allowed that low of an effectiveness rate, if there&amp;#39;s nothing else available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same way with Allies and how you view them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 10% them, 90% you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while Fairy is actually a triangular tube in a pinkish world,  it&amp;#39;s ok if you prefer to see her in a  sarong, with scary makeup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get to 60% actual vision of a stable reality,  you&amp;#39;re probably near to as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to move there. Then you can get to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can sort of hear that in Carol Tigg&amp;#39;s accounts of shared dreaming with Carlos, if you listen carefully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tigg&amp;#39;s accounts are &amp;quot;weirder&amp;quot; than those of Carlos.  Probably because she doesn&amp;#39;t worry as much about making it flow better, as a bragging male would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All males like to brag.  It&amp;#39;s biological.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men are designed to show off for the women.  They have to prove their DNA is worthy of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Carol Tigg&amp;#39;s accounts of shared dreaming have slightly more weight to me, than Carlos&amp;#39; accounts.  She doesn&amp;#39;t have the same ax to grind as a male.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each person who goes into waking dreaming, even when there are 2, has a vote in how to interpret raw energy like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two is simply not enough &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, to force everyone into the same view of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or which direction to go. Once you&amp;#39;re exploring in phantom worlds, even if some have their own energy, you can just as easily pass from one to a different one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a companion, they might not follow you there at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost and found Cholita in dreaming endlessly, until I finally had to give up on tracking her, and use remote viewing from above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose if two dream travelers pick up the intent of some other group,  such as picking up a real ancient city which had thousands of inhabitants, the 2 could see things the same way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d be using the intent of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, with just the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of 2, it seems unlikely to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/igyw9x/thomas_campbell_about_a_flash_of_seeing/g2x6viu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1598457575.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_igyw9x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g2x5oqx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Luisyelsol", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1598457006.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_igyw9x", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3x9578py", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "this is awesome!!!  \nnow i want to navigate with my 5yo.

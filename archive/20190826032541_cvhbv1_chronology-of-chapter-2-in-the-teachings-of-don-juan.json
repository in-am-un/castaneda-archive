Yeah I think I&amp;#39;ll be okay - my journey thus far has challenged basically everything I&amp;#39;ve believed so far in my life and I&amp;#39;m getting used to that.  Most recently - recalling memories that I can&amp;#39;t really attribute to my life (as this vessel has experienced it, anyway).  Fun and frightening stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my favorites quotes so far which has been certainly applicable to me (as a Marine combat veteran) - &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war, wide-awake, with fear, with respect, and with absolute assurance.  Going to knowledge or going to war in any other manner is a mistake, and whoever makes it will live to regret his steps.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_cvhbv1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/cvhbv1/chronology_of_chapter_2_in_the_teachings_of_don/ey5oout/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1566836758.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1566836758.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ey5jtoe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ey5ilba", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I do think it's a subtle tool he might have employed to subconsciously aid in becoming comfortable with the eventual experience of non-linearity, something that everyone will experience as they progress.

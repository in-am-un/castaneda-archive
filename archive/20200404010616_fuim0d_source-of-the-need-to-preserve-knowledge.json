extraordinary and so baffling that  they forced me  to a  total  re-evaluation of  myself.

He  was  first laughing so hard that  his  body shook as  in a  convulsion, then he  began kicking, and finally the movement  of  his  legs  became  coordinated with a  paddling movement  of  his  arms, and don Genaro started to slide  on the  ground as  if  he  were  lying on a  board fitted with ball  bearings.

His  movement  had  been  executed  with  such  precision  and  skill  that  he seemed  to  be  a  weightless  being,  a  wormlike  creature  that  had  turned  on  itself.  When  he  was  on the  ground  he  performed  a  series  of  unearthly  movements.  He  glided  just  a  few  inches  above  the ground,  or  rolled  on  it  as  if  he  were  lying  on  ball  bearings;  or  he  swam  on  it  describing  circles and turning with the  swiftness  and agility of  an eel  swimming in the  ocean. \n\nMy  eyes  began  to  cross  at  one  moment  and  then  without  any  transition  I  was  watching  a  ball of  luminosity  sliding  back  and  forth  on  something  that  appeared  to  be  the  floor  of  an  ice-skating rink with a  thousand lights  shining on it.\n\nThe  sight  was  sublime.

Just take the right edge of your right hand, and down onto the forearm on the same side, around 4 inches.\n\nIt's essentially the \"rising block\" part of the arm, emphasized in Japanese Karate.\n\nIt makes a very sensitive surface for feeling stuff.  It's also quite sturdy, as Cholita has proven over and over, beating me with stuff and requiring me to use that part of the arm to block her.\n\nI suspect it's so sensitive because when we try to sneak into a cave through a narrow crack opening, we lead with that part of the arm so that our flesh isn't scraped off.\n\nWave it around very slowly,  as if you wanted to use it to push on some dusty (not sticky) cobwebs, but were afraid to touch them with your fingers due to COVID19 worries, so you use the side of your hand and forearm.\n\nAnd you'll catch some if you are silent.\n\nYou'll catch them even if you aren't silent!\n\nBut you'll be so lost in fantasies that Mr. DoubleTake will be easily able to block them.\n\nHe just tells you, \"Yea, think about that some more!  That was awful, wasn't it?  How can people be like that?  Why can't they be more like you?\"\n\nA little cobweb tickling the right edge of your hand is easy for Mr. DoubleTake to block.\n\nI've also seen \"specialty\" lines.\n\nFirst kind, you actually see them during recap.   It's not silence which triggers that, since during recap you're telling yourself stories.\n\nIt's having the assemblage point be very flexible, from having practiced scooping colors for a few hours, until you reach heightened awareness.\n\nWhich (for new people) is literally like being in Fairy Land because of all the wonderful things you can see.\n\nMost likely way one of you will get to see that, is what I said, you're practicing for a long time.\n\nBut you notice half the work of getting silent was due to some specific memory.\n\nSo you sit up to recapitulate it.\n\nAnd you get to see the fibers!  They stretch from your own torso, out into the distance.\n\nAnd you can actually inhale and exhale them.\n\nI'd say, last time I saw that there were 10 visible fibers, but only one or two at a time are easy to focus on.\n\nAnother specialty fiber is the red kind, used for flying.\n\nI'll always wonder, if I hadn't read that they were red, would they have been a different color?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nBecause Carlos told me not to read his books anymore, and because he had new information in the last 3, I was able to perceive some things he mentioned in those books, and it looked just like what he said.  I didn't realize that  until someone asked me a question which required me to read those 3.\n\nI figured, the ban was temporarily lifted and read them.  I was quite pleased to see that his description matched what I'd discovered on my own.\n\nAs for the lines of any form, I believe those are the key to seeing energy directly.\n\nThe puffs are the key to dreaming.  And certainly that will lead to everything.\n\nBut the lines are quite different.

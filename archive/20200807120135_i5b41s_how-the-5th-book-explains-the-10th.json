Primitivization and distortion of concepts that's the way to profonation of knowledge.\n\nThe meaning foreign in this context sounds like \"external\". The word comes from the Latin foraneus - which means \"outside\" (foris - outside, literally \"outside the door\"). About word installation (composition), the meaning comes from \"place\" and \"position\" (literally: in place (standing) among others, by type - in a row). Etymologically, installation is synonymous with inauguration and induction. The meanings in other contexts are interesting: get into position, lose power, put in a stall. As for the word installation, it means composition, a special arrangement of various objects (elements). We are not talking about \"installation\" in sense that it is sometimes understood - installing a disc on a computer or something similar. Installation do not translate as \"device\". Computer analogies in everyday thinking create a false association and make wrong understanding. Literally translated as \"external composition\". The meaning of foreign installation is seen as \"external influence\" (on our mind) or \"foreign construction\" (in the mind). In his lectures, Castaneda also used the synonymous term - imposition (external composition).\n\nSimply, this is not own mental \"composition\" inside our mind, but created under the influence of external factors. In terms of meaning, this concept is too close to the *common sense* (**this is confirmed by the quote in the first message of topic**), but from a specific view descriptions by brujo (another glossing). In a way, it is synonymous by concept of \"emotional mind\", which wastes energy by blindly reacting to external factors and influence of crowd routines. It is important becouse that concept makes a clear indication to the cultivation of consciousness through our own mind. Not a reject off mind, but on the cleansing of the mind from external influences, from ideas alien to our mind.\n\nAnd here we find that in reality we need to development of our own mind, our own understanding, as the position on which consciousness begin to grow (mind and consciousness are different things). Change the composition of mind, start thinking yourself from inside, and not wait for someone to do it from the outside. If you don\u2019t think yourself, they will think of you.

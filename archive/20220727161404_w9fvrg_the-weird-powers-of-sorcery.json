Carlos has \"pre approved them for beginner consumption.\"\n\nSo here's the topic:\n\nIf you can be absolutely silent, so silent that it's even a little \"bizarre\", giving you a feeling you haven't had since you were 5 years old, you can start to perceive what's actually going on.\n\nAnd it's not what you think!!!\n\nWe aren't running around in a physical reality, trying to find the best donuts for the lowest price.\n\nWe are in fact, stationary in space.\n\nAs if we are in a virtual reality, like in \"The Matrix\".\n\nBut this isn't theory!  You can learn to perceive that.\n\nYou just have to \"hack into your own data stream\".\n\nAnd you can watch the raw feed.\n\nIt's not as \"linux\" oriented as those monitors in their hover ship, where they see weird symbols flowing in vertical lines.\n\nBut it's pretty weird...\n\nNot only that, but you can \"hack\" into someone else's data stream.  \n\nYou won't perceive how they feel about it. Just the raw sensory info flowing directly to them. Which will be difficult to interpret, and you'll have the \"feeling\" you are near them, arguing about things. \n\nBut they'll be right there!!!  Visibly, tangibly. No pretending involved.\n\nSorcerers don't mess around!\n\nWe don't \"visualize a golden buddha\".  We melt them down for scrap and make something more useful out of it.\n\nSomewhere in the books is a quote from don Juan admitting that the emanations themselves create our stream of sensory information.\n\nMeaning, you don't actually taste that donut you have in your hand.\n\nIt's just fake taste data projected by the emanations, in response to the \"harmonics\" of your awareness flowing into them.\n\nAnd here's everything I could find while trying to locate that original quote from don Juan.   \n\nSearch word, \"Sensory\".\n\nOften you can't find something you saw two weeks ago.  But these have some \"clues\" about this situation.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Silent Knowledge Publication \\*\\*\\*\n\nHe explained that what human beings ordinarily take for perceiving is rather the act of interpreting sensory data. He maintained that from the moment of birth, everything around us supplies us with a possibility of interpretation. This possibility turns in time into a full system by means of which we conduct all of our perceptual transactions in the world. He was convinced that not for an instant do we have the opportunity to conceive the possibility of perceiving the flow of energy directly. For don Juan, and other sorcerers like him, what transforms an average man into a sorcerer is the act of canceling out the effect of our interpretation system and perceiving energy directly.\n\n...\n\nIf the assemblage point is displaced to another position, another set of energy filaments goes through. Sorcerers feel that this new set of energy filaments cannot possibly give a view of the same world; that by definition that world has to be different from the world of everyday life. Since the assemblage point is not only the center where perception is assembled, but the center where interpretation of sensory data is accomplished, sorcerers feel that it will interpret the new influx of energy fields in very much the same terms in which it interprets the world of everyday life. The result of this new interpretation is the view of a world which is strangely similar to ours, and yet intrinsically different. Don Juan said that it is only the interpretation of the assemblage point which accounts for the sense of similarity, and that energetically, other worlds are as different from ours as they could possibly be.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Collected workshop and lecture notes \\*\\*\\*\n\nHL: It is said in Europe that in your books there is always a critical position, very western, and that is supposed to create a need for don Juan to explain you. Or on the other hand, you clung to western sensory norms because you were very afraid of staying in that non-ordinary reality.\n\nC.C .:Both views are correct. When faced with perceptual dissolution, one is so vulnerable and so weak that there is no way to describe the sensation, the urge to comfort oneself. This is important when one is dealing with the unknown; it is a telluric, biological fear that has no name.\n\n...\n\n\u2022 The assemblage point can move:\n\nFrom deep meditation\n\nFrom drugs\n\nFrom high fever\n\nFrom senility\n\nFrom sleep deprivation\n\nFrom sensory deprivation\n\nFrom natural sleep\n\n...\n\nIt is this change that Don Juan called evolution. He argued that the social order sees reproduction as a biological command and that it is time to take into account another biological command: evolution. For him, the sign of this premeditated evolution in a human being was the universe. We \"see\" ourselves as energy fields, as \"luminous eggs\" as he put it, meant that we had succeeded in canceling out the system of interpretation which only allows us to see the world as we already do. .\n\nFor example, when we take into consideration the sensory data of the building that houses \"the stock exchange\", all that our senses capture is the presence of an architectural structure that we call edifice, which in itself is already an interpretation. However, the action of total intentionality which causes us to perceive the purse as we do is an act of pure interpretation, since in order to perceive the purse we have to appeal to our civilization. Don Juan said that if our interpretation system is maintained in force, we must all be Involved in cynical and deceptive maneuvers of perception that we must put an end to. Unless we devote every heartbeat to this task, we ourselves become the victims of this blackmail.\n\n...\n\n(1) We are perceivers, who can only construct by perceiving. (Florinda said that don Juan repeated this incessantly-- the reason for endless repetition being that eventually something gets accepted on a bodily level, as much as our previous conditioning has become accepted as bodily truth.)\n\n(2) When we try to perceive there are lots of obstacles, because in everyday life we don't perceive, we interpret. \"For example, we interpret from what we see now that we're in a tent. Sorcerers know that interpretation is the basis of what we do with sensory data. Intellectually philosophers have understood this well. Edmund Husserl, a German philosopher, said that to arrive at the truth we have to 'bracket' meaning and suspend judgment, i.e., stop interpreting. When Husserl's students asked him how to do this, his response, in German of course, was, 'How should I know, you pricks with ears? I'm a philosopher, goddammit.'\"\n\n(3) Sorcerers know how to suspend judgment and how to get back again.\n\n...\n\nSorcerers have been doing this for thousands of years. It's the only way to see a human. We can't see us as an aura, or as a \"cerulean light\", those are just explanations/interpretations. There is only one way to walk, bipedally. But, how long does it take us to learn? Years. So it takes years to gain...or regain actually, the capacity to see energy as it flows, without interpretation. The moment we interpret, we have the world of everyday life. We gloss agglutination of detail into single units of endless glosses. It took us forever to learn to agglutinate \"room\". Within \"room\" we can take a \"wall\", etc, as smaller and smaller units of glosses, ad infinitum. This is the way we've learned to interpret sensory data as perceptual solicitation and come up with the world of everyday life.\n\n...\n\nThe seers who lived in Mexico in ancient times believed that human beings taken as conglomerates of energy fields are held together by some energy, some force, some power, that cements those energy fields into one single energetic unit. Those seers taught from generation to generation up to the present day that enhanced awareness is the end result of canceling out our system of interpreting energy as sensory data. This system, which is taught to us from the moment we are born up to the time that we become experts in handling it, gives us as a consequence the coherent perception of the world we know. To cancel it out means that we can perceive energy directly as it flows in the universe instead of interpreting it as sensory data. An outcome of seeing energy directly as it flows in the universe is the perception of a human being as  a luminous sphere, that is to say, as a conglomerate of energy fields held together as a luminous ball.\n\n...\n\nHe explained that what human beings ordinarily take for perceiving is rather the act of interpreting sensory data. He maintained that from the moment of birth, everything around us supplies us with a possibility of interpretation. This possibility turns in time into a full system by means of which we conduct all of our perceptual transactions in the world. He was convinced that not for an instant do we have the opportunity to conceive the possibility of perceiving the flow of energy directly.

The result of this new interpretation is the view of a world which is strangely similar to ours, and yet intrinsically different. Don Juan said that it is only the interpretation of the assemblage point which accounts for the sense of similarity, and that energetically, other worlds are as different from ours as they could possibly be.\n\n...\n\nDon Juan Matus told his disciples that human being as organisms perform a stupendous maneuver which, unfortunately, gives perception a false front; they take the influx of sheer energy and turn it into sensory data, which they interpret following a strict system of interpretation which sorcerers call the human form. This magical act of interpreting pure energy gives rise to the false front\u00c2 : the peculiar conviction on our part that our interpretation s stem is all that exists. Don Juan explained that a tree as we know tree is more interpretation than perception. He said that for us to deal with tree, all we need is a cursory glance that tells us hardly anything. The rest is a phenomena which he described as the calling of intent: the intent of tree, that is to say, the interpretation of sensory data pertaining to this specific phenomena that we call tree.\n\n...\n\nDon Juan explained to his four disciples that those shamans, or sorcerers, as he called them, discovered through practices that he could not fathom, that it is possible for human beings to perceive energy directly as it flows in the universe. In other words, those sorcerers maintained, according to don Juan, that any one of us can do away, for a moment, with our system of turning energy inflow into sensory data pertinent to the kind of organism that we are (in our case, we are apes). Turning the inflow of energy into sensory data creates, sorcerers affirm, a system of interpretation that turns the flowing energy of the universe into the world of everyday life that we know.\n\n...\n\nWhen human beings are perceived as conglomerates of energy fields, a point of intense luminosity can be perceived at the height of the shoulder blades an arm's length away from them, on the back. The seers of ancient times who discovered this point of luminosity called it \"the assemblage point,\" because they concluded that it is there that perception is assembled.\n\nThey noticed, aided by their seeing, that on that spot of luminosity, the location of which is homogeneous for mankind, converge zillions of energy fields in the form of luminous filaments which constitute the universe at large. Upon converging there, they become sensory data, which is utilizable by human beings as organisms. This utilization of energy turned into sensory data was regarded by those sorcerers as an act of pure magic : energy at large transformed by the assemblage point into a veritable, all-inclusive world in which human beings as organisms can live and die. The act of transforming the inflow of pure energy into the perceivable world was attributed by those sorcerers to a system of interpretation. Their shattering conclusion, shattering to them, of course, and perhaps to some of us who have the energy to be attentive, was that the assemblage point was not only the spot where perception was assembled by turning the inflow of pure energy into sensory data, but the spot where the interpretation of sensory data took place.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDarn... I'm going to stop there.  I need to get in some animation practice today.\n\nI didn't realize this topic was so vast and well spelled out! We just glossed over it.\n\nNow where's that donut???

Don Juan said that it is only the interpretation of the assemblage point which accounts for the sense of similarity, and that energetically, other worlds are as different from ours as they could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan Matus told his disciples that human being as organisms perform a stupendous maneuver which, unfortunately, gives perception a false front; they take the influx of sheer energy and turn it into sensory data, which they interpret following a strict system of interpretation which sorcerers call the human form. This magical act of interpreting pure energy gives rise to the false front\u00c2 : the peculiar conviction on our part that our interpretation s stem is all that exists. Don Juan explained that a tree as we know tree is more interpretation than perception. He said that for us to deal with tree, all we need is a cursory glance that tells us hardly anything. The rest is a phenomena which he described as the calling of intent: the intent of tree, that is to say, the interpretation of sensory data pertaining to this specific phenomena that we call tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan explained to his four disciples that those shamans, or sorcerers, as he called them, discovered through practices that he could not fathom, that it is possible for human beings to perceive energy directly as it flows in the universe. In other words, those sorcerers maintained, according to don Juan, that any one of us can do away, for a moment, with our system of turning energy inflow into sensory data pertinent to the kind of organism that we are (in our case, we are apes). Turning the inflow of energy into sensory data creates, sorcerers affirm, a system of interpretation that turns the flowing energy of the universe into the world of everyday life that we know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When human beings are perceived as conglomerates of energy fields, a point of intense luminosity can be perceived at the height of the shoulder blades an arm&amp;#39;s length away from them, on the back. The seers of ancient times who discovered this point of luminosity called it &amp;quot;the assemblage point,&amp;quot; because they concluded that it is there that perception is assembled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They noticed, aided by their seeing, that on that spot of luminosity, the location of which is homogeneous for mankind, converge zillions of energy fields in the form of luminous filaments which constitute the universe at large. Upon converging there, they become sensory data, which is utilizable by human beings as organisms. This utilization of energy turned into sensory data was regarded by those sorcerers as an act of pure magic : energy at large transformed by the assemblage point into a veritable, all-inclusive world in which human beings as organisms can live and die. The act of transforming the inflow of pure energy into the perceivable world was attributed by those sorcerers to a system of interpretation. Their shattering conclusion, shattering to them, of course, and perhaps to some of us who have the energy to be attentive, was that the assemblage point was not only the spot where perception was assembled by turning the inflow of pure energy into sensory data, but the spot where the interpretation of sensory data took place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darn... I&amp;#39;m going to stop there.  I need to get in some animation practice today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize this topic was so vast and well spelled out!

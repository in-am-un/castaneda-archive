Sure, they try things.\n\nBut you always come out ahead from it.\n\nThe most worry seems to exist in people who haven't got any magic at all in their practices. It's all in their head, and they aren't doing anything that's going to fix that.

What a good \"man of knowledge\" they are.  Because they hate IOBs.\n\nAbsent knowledge, they love to fuss around and speculate. Especially about the old seers being evil, and inorganic beings being dangerous.\n\nIt reminds me of what happens to wealthy people.\n\nEveryone around them is suffering so much (river of filth), that they latch onto anything they can use to get more attention.\n\nLittle things they can brag about.  Stories they can tell.\n\nThey start focusing on anyone around them who they believe has money.\n\nAnd their children.\n\nAnyone who's perceived to have more money than average can tell you about it. It's sinister!\n\nBottom line: If someone is going on about how evil the old sorcerers were, or how dangerous IOBs are, they have no sorcery knowledge at all.\n\nThey're just playing sorcerer to get attention.\n\nI'm always trying to shame the men into being more open to actually learning.

Sure, they try things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you always come out ahead from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most worry seems to exist in people who haven&amp;#39;t got any magic at all in their practices. It&amp;#39;s all in their head, and they aren&amp;#39;t doing anything that&amp;#39;s going to fix that.  But they like to bully those around them into also pretending they have bad ass sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And hating the IOBs is one of their only things to show off.  What a good &amp;quot;man of knowledge&amp;quot; they are.  Because they hate IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absent knowledge, they love to fuss around and speculate. Especially about the old seers being evil, and inorganic beings being dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of what happens to wealthy people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone around them is suffering so much (river of filth), that they latch onto anything they can use to get more attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little things they can brag about.  Stories they can tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They start focusing on anyone around them who they believe has money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And their children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#39;s perceived to have more money than average can tell you about it. It&amp;#39;s sinister!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: If someone is going on about how evil the old sorcerers were, or how dangerous IOBs are, they have no sorcery knowledge at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re just playing sorcerer to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m always trying to shame the men into being more open to actually learning.

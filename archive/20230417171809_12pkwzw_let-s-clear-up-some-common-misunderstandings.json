Like the Buddha, Yogananda, or Lao Tzu.\n\nAbsent the ability to teach actual magic to followers, they resort to exaggerations and false narratives.\n\nThe OPPOSITE of what allows humans to do real magic. Honesty is #1 if you want to learn to break the laws of physics.\n\nTo see this horrible tendency to copy the hype orientation of outside systems and substitute hero worship for real magic, one need not look any further than what all the bad players out there said when Carlos died of cancer.\n\nBy the way, he outlived the life expectancy of a man born in Peru in the year he was born, by more than 30 years!\n\nAnd beat the average Russian male lifespan when he died, by 4 years.\n\nYet, the Russians were among the first to jump on the anti-Carlos bandwagon, some speculating it was all of those drugs damaging his liver.\n\nLook...\n\nDon't you guys know about \"Raves\" and Grateful Dead concerts?\n\nDon't they have those in Russia?\n\nDid your mom warn you about liver cancer as a result of \"raving\" too much?\n\nNo.\n\nBecause it's not a serious risk. Addiction to painkillers that contain tylenol is a much bigger threat to your liver.\n\nOr taking advantage of the corner newspaper, cigarettes, and vodka stand for lunch each day, in Moscow.\n\nTHAT causes liver cancer.\n\nNot \"raving\" once in a while.\n\nThe amount of drugs don Juan fed to Carlos don't cause liver cancer.\n\nAsk the local indian tribes around LA, who's favorite shamanism brew is Devil's Weed Tea.\n\nI guess it will be hard for most of my readers to connect what I just said, to some of these misunderstandings I'd like to clear up.\n\nAt least if you aren't able to move your assemblage point away from self-pity daily.\n\nFor at least a few minutes.\n\nHere's some common misunderstandings, which have a universal theme.\n\nIf you read the books well, all of them, you'll almost immediately realize there's a universal thread here.\n\nAnd I can't afford the time to locate all the relevant information in the books, to \"prove\" it.\n\nYou ought to know all that yourself by now. I'm just trying to get you to see, what you will learn through experience some day.\n\nFirst, Mad Prophet, a witch, had an Ally she called \"Ren\". It's japanese for Lily.\n\nHer ally came to me, with me not realizing it belonged to a witch in the subreddit.\n\nIt was sitting on a lily pad in a calm little pond or stream.\n\nAnd she was so happy to be there, I suggested I should call her \"Lily\".\n\nLily proceeded to teach me, after telling me verbally as the dreaming emissary that she was going to show me how to \"leave the darkroom\".\n\nMy darkroom is locked, for fear of Cholita.\n\nIf I leave it, it's through something solid like the walls or the ceiling.\n\nBut I didn't catch that part of what she was showing me.\n\nI missed the lesson entirely.\n\nI posted about what she taught, but it essentially violated the laws of physics every time.\n\nLeaping through the ceiling and zipping at 4 billion light years per second, to land on distant planets.\n\nNot asleep, not in closed eye meditation.\n\nPhysically leaping, while doing tensegrity.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nThat's the point people miss. And I missed it at the time.\n\nHere's another example.\n\nHow can Cholita lift me into the air with one finger?\n\nAt least a foot, maybe 2. I'm so frightened at the time, it never occurs to me to look down and estimate how far off the ground my feet are.\n\nAs for moving solid matter, Cholita can move up to 2 ounces just by gazing at it.\n\nThat's not the same thing as lifting an adult male with one finger.\n\nBut it is the same thing as the lessons Lily was giving me, which are also present throughout the books.\n\nThe key is the chapter from Tales of Power entitled, \"shrinking the tonal\".\n\nThat is NOT yet another obscure story from the books, seemingly unrelated to all of the other stories.\n\nIn fact, the books are NOT a collection of random stories. They all link together to form a very clear picture of what sorcery is.\n\nIf you hear otherwise you have a bad man on your hands, who has ulterior motives for confusing what was written by Carlos.\n\nIt seems like the books are just random stories due to all the bad men trying to cash in with some unique \"angle\". Like trying to apply the chinese concept of \"will\", to the kind of will mentioned by don Juan.\n\nThe two being entirely unrelated, especially since the chinese idea is total nonsense.\n\nBut men find things outside our system, and try to use it to cash in, by pretending they can teach or explain the mystery of sorcery to others.\n\nIt's always a truly horrible angle that they come up with, I might add.\n\nLike the evil Lujan Matus, self-proclaimed Nagual, saying that our 8000 year old Olmec sorcery comes from 2500 year old Buddhism.\n\nTruly delusional, but it fooled enough for him to believe he could make a living cheating our community.\n\nIn that story about shrinking the tonal, don Juan sees a chance to do that for Carlos and propel him into the Nagual.\n\nWith his reason intact!\n\nIt's no good to go into the nagual, absent any reason or purpose.\n\nWe do that all night long.\n\nThe trick is to smoothly transition from your waking tonal awareness, into the full on experience of the double.\n\nIn the phantom realms it's able to explore.\n\nThe ticket office incident looked perfectly normal to Carlos. Don Juan simply teleported him, is what he thought.\n\nAnd Don Juan was \"there\" with him at the destination, but as we find out later he was in fact not.\n\nCarlos was the only one perceiving what he saw. Don Juan tried to warn him over and over, but it was so real, Carlos couldn't notice the truth of the situation.\n\nIt wasn't until later that he realized he was not actually transported a mile away to the coin stands.\n\nIn fact, he was transported to a different day.\n\nTo a different time and place.\n\nBut he walked back smoothly from that coin market, to Alameda park.\n\nThere's your key.\n\nYou can smoothly transition into your double, and somehow it's fine by the tonal.\n\nIt doesn't fall over in the ticket office, and get a nasty bruise on its head.\n\nIn some odd way, it can \"ride along\". It \"shrinks\".\n\nThe old seers used to bury themselves, shrink their tonal, and then live on for thousands of years.\n\nTrapped as inorganic beings, but not trapped in the inorganic being's world.\n\nOr they turned into trees, or some other equally implausible way to manipulate physical matter and sustain life longer than our 100 years.\n\nSo Carlos being pushed into \"next sunday\" a mile away, was not actually what we interpret it to be.\n\nHe was switched to his double, smoothly.\n\nLa Gorda did the same for Carlos when they were trapped in a room with the Allies coming, and she used the \"Sliding Door\" Tensegrity pass to open a portal, so they could escape.\n\nBut here's the key. Don't miss it.\n\nWhen it was over, they were back where they started.\n\nThey left in the Nagual, but returned to where their tonal had started.\n\nLa Gorda's flying is the same way. She took Carlos flying by grabbing onto the \"red lines\", a trick don Juan used to leap over houses.\n\nBy the way, you have the tensegrity pass to find those red lines!\n\nYou just haven't realized it yet, because you can't \"see energy\".\n\nBut if you go read that account carefully, you'll notice that after it was over Carlos realized he had fallen backwards onto the ground.\n\nAnd that didn't agree with what he experienced of the flying up into the air.\n\nIt's also what happened to me each time Lily taught me to \"leave the darkroom\".\n\nI left!\n\nFor hours in at least one case.\n\nBut I always found myself back in the room, later on.\n\nI switched to my double, but when my rationality and reason wore off and I was continuing only on the double's awareness, I lost track of the memories.\n\nThey only resumed when I was back where my tonal body had started.\n\nMore cases:\n\nThe little sisters run on the walls, later admitting nothing like that ever happened before and it must be Carlos.\n\nCarol Tiggs pushed me backwards into the entryway to the inorganic beings realm. I literally fell into a dirt tunnel under Dance Home.\n\nSame thing.\n\nHow about when the little sisters decided to attack Carlos, and suddenly he knew how to kick them in the assemblage point of the second attention?\n\nHe switched to his double smoothly, and his double knew how to battle the little sisters.\n\nHow about leaping off the cliff?\n\nGo read carefully! Was he practicing leaping to his death, or joking around with Genaro on the ledge of the cliff?\n\nBoth at the same time!\n\nOr maybe back and forth, seamlessly.\n\nHow about when don Juan stopped the car of Carlos from starting, while Genaro looked on and laughed?\n\nCholita can get Little Smoke to move small objects for her, and there's certainly plenty of ways an ally could prevent a car from starting.\n\nBut the key there is the amusement of don Juan and don Genaro when it finally started and Carlos drove away in it, them riding along.\n\nHis car didn't start, in the Nagual.\n\nNot in the tonal world.\n\nBut when it did start it was still in the Nagual, and Carlos believed he was driving it as if nothing were out of the ordinary.\n\nI'm not sure what don Juan actually perceived while riding in it. Not what you'd think.\n\nHow about Vicente giving Carlos 3 plants to take into the desert and water, and suddenly 3 weird people showed up with a broken car on the side of the road?\n\nThe ritual of watering the plants combined with Vicente's 3 allies, was enough to pull Carlos into his double.\n\nTonal reasoning intact.\n\nI could go on and on, but it's sort of like \"bursting your bubble\" to reveal how much of sorcery actually works.\n\nJust keep it in mind when you reach the level for real shared dreaming.\n\nDon't expect a perfect match when later recalling the details to each other.\n\nIn fact, it's unlikely to be a perfect match. Not even a \"very good\" one most of the time.\n\nSo the next time you start to fantasize that sorcerers are like movie superheros, think again.\n\nThat's a very \"human\" view of reality as a cozy place, with predictable results.\n\nWhen in fact, reality is not like that at all.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Let's Clear Up Some Common Misunderstandings", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6c4ds7s4hgua1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd33a7dccf200af057dc6ef58a7f8d76194abad"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4ac9df06e0061441ad16ee5ec9e31fc5405086"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d600a96fc6855f90978e3871043192c943b43de5"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc26a1f05577bfbebd3af82130b70e7011649a9a"}, {"y": 639, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adf558796c77485c86fc8cad1a110cc5dfca36c0"}, {"y": 719, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8a2e3985ceb62063c1c709b1bdc6cdc024c7d65"}], "s": {"y": 1333, "x": 2000, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eea5914a4077ef95296221ed610c9251894daba1"}, "id": "6c4ds7s4hgua1"}}, "name": "t3_12pkwzw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/RZacvy-SQtN8WjGAbFN3M_cDF6kLmGYO4ngTEDoG3bM.jpg", "edited": 1681745827.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1681744689.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=2000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eea5914a4077ef95296221ed610c9251894daba1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/6c4ds7s4hgua1.png?width=2000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eea5914a4077ef95296221ed610c9251894daba1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tendency to imagine sorcerers are like batman or superman, and never lose or make a mistake is counterproductive to learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what outside fake magical systems do, to build up hero worship for men who don&amp;#39;t deserve any.

She took Carlos flying by grabbing onto the &amp;quot;red lines&amp;quot;, a trick don Juan used to leap over houses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, you have the tensegrity pass to find those red lines!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just haven&amp;#39;t realized it yet, because you can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you go read that account carefully, you&amp;#39;ll notice that after it was over Carlos realized he had fallen backwards onto the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that didn&amp;#39;t agree with what he experienced of the flying up into the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also what happened to me each time Lily taught me to &amp;quot;leave the darkroom&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For hours in at least one case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I always found myself back in the room, later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I switched to my double, but when my rationality and reason wore off and I was continuing only on the double&amp;#39;s awareness, I lost track of the memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They only resumed when I was back where my tonal body had started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More cases:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little sisters run on the walls, later admitting nothing like that ever happened before and it must be Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs pushed me backwards into the entryway to the inorganic beings realm. I literally fell into a dirt tunnel under Dance Home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about when the little sisters decided to attack Carlos, and suddenly he knew how to kick them in the assemblage point of the second attention?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He switched to his double smoothly, and his double knew how to battle the little sisters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about leaping off the cliff?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go read carefully! Was he practicing leaping to his death, or joking around with Genaro on the ledge of the cliff?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe back and forth, seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about when don Juan stopped the car of Carlos from starting, while Genaro looked on and laughed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita can get Little Smoke to move small objects for her, and there&amp;#39;s certainly plenty of ways an ally could prevent a car from starting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the key there is the amusement of don Juan and don Genaro when it finally started and Carlos drove away in it, them riding along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His car didn&amp;#39;t start, in the Nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not in the tonal world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when it did start it was still in the Nagual, and Carlos believed he was driving it as if nothing were out of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what don Juan actually perceived while riding in it. Not what you&amp;#39;d think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about Vicente giving Carlos 3 plants to take into the desert and water, and suddenly 3 weird people showed up with a broken car on the side of the road?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ritual of watering the plants combined with Vicente&amp;#39;s 3 allies, was enough to pull Carlos into his double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonal reasoning intact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on, but it&amp;#39;s sort of like &amp;quot;bursting your bubble&amp;quot; to reveal how much of sorcery actually works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep it in mind when you reach the level for real shared dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t expect a perfect match when later recalling the details to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s unlikely to be a perfect match. Not even a &amp;quot;very good&amp;quot; one most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the next time you start to fantasize that sorcerers are like movie superheros, think again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a very &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; view of reality as a cozy place, with predictable results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact, reality is not like that at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "12pkwzw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 74, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/12pkwzw/lets_clear_up_some_common_misunderstandings/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/12pkwzw/lets_clear_up_some_common_misunderstandings/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1681744689.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jgr1it6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jgouv4l", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The \"Devil's Weed\" shaman out at Morongo, John, was said to have converted to Christianity, the last time I visited that tribe around 10 years ago.

There is great strength where there shouldn\u2019t be, and there are constant rituals\u2026(eating shit, eating throw up, studying you to best know how to \u201cget you\u201d, all this coming from a messed up mind that you can\u2019t do anything about. This has been a horrible chapter of my life. I research constantly how to protect my self from the constant barrage of their assistant entities. I cannot find a way to protect myself, and I sleep here too. I literally have to look into the eye of a dark being fully manifest and ask her if it wants another cookie. And since it knows I can see it that causes issues and it\u2019s only goes to destroy. There\u2019s your magic. And these old people never read canasta or Muktananda. It just is. And all of my research shows there is nothing I can do. I will be doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false,

And now it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;part of us&amp;quot; in some weird way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like being raised by catholic nuns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can rebel all you want, but even 60 years later you&amp;#39;ll still have the &amp;quot;nun influence&amp;quot; at the base of your personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can reduce that influence of physical matter, but even the old seers had to bury their flesh body to protect it while their awareness became more like an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They needed a container, in addition to containing the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they only did that it seems, when they were getting too old to keep living.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it wasn&amp;#39;t an &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the inorganic beings kidnap our double first. They only go back for the physical matter later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They consider the physical matter part to be just an inconvenience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one they can&amp;#39;t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God only knows what they do with the physical matter!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope &amp;quot;House of a Thousand Corpses&amp;quot; is not on their streaming media list.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afterall, they do like tunnels!  And evil clowns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well then, if you can&amp;#39;t live forever can you make yourself appear to be 30 years younger?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the double for sure. Cholita does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the flesh body?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably not.  You can come close to giving the illusion of that, and Cholita does an excellent job once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even taunts me on those days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t go by what you read in the books, because it could easily be that nearly all of the lineage members we read about were in their doubles at the time they looked far younger than they ought to have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly Genaro and Zuleica were virtually always in their double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Emilito might not even exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you cure any illness?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos couldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;d been in a lineage, and so not using up all of his energy trying to help lost causes (us), maybe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t know that for sure and none of us are in a protective lineage situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_12pkwzw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/12pkwzw/lets_clear_up_some_common_misunderstandings/jh05xhu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1681992517.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jh03qll", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Fine_Ad3410", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1681991209.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_12pkwzw", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_eor92y5x", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "So does the body actually disappear when you shrink you tonal and fly for days or weeks in your double? \n\nFor example in Carlos story in the market, when he went into his double by the coin stand.

I suppose I should call him, \"Paul\", in honor of the one  I saw while in private classes. One day Carlos had us practicing silence, and then asked us to try to *see*.  Either he or Carol was going to lend us some energy.\n\nI suspect, you inventory experts ought to remember an episode from the books, where don Juan did the same with Carlos.  He asked him to \"Try out his seeing\".\n\nCarlos did that sort of thing.  He tried to copy the sequence of events even from his books, in order to hook us to the correct *intent*.\n\nWhen he asked, I closed my eyes and forced the best silence I could. The space got jet black behind my closed eyes, as if it were no longer flatness, but now had a feeling of \"depth\".\n\nI knew that feeling. I had activated the second attention.  And since Carlos had lent us energy, my chances to have something cool happen had just gone up 1000%.\n\nA little gnat flew up from the jet blackness, illuminated by some invisible spot light. It was like a hollywood effect, in it's perfection. I could see even the tiniest details of the \"gnat\".\n\nIt hovered in front of my eyes and said, \"Hello!  My name is Paul.\"\n\nCarlos laughed when I told him.\n\nIt seems that gnat is back. Or his great, great, great.... grandchild.\n\nWhen I got home last night it would be the 5th night that gnat came up to greet me, as soon as I laid down on the bed.  It just says hello. Doesn't bother me more than 30 seconds.\n\nThis time I was determined to figure out whether it was an ordinary gnat, or something else.\n\nCan inorganic beings do things like that?\n\nThey do in the books. Pablito had that basket don Juan had given him.  It turned out to be an inorganic being, but it was hanging on his wall like a real object, for hours before he discovered that.\n\nCarlos had what seemed to be a talking Coyote conversing with him so long, it would be hard to believe it was not real, except for the bilingual talking part.\n\nI watched the gnat fly over.  Would it land on me,  or fly around randomly like a real gnat?\n\nNo, it flew right up to my eyes but did not land.  The same as the one back in 1997 had done.\n\n\"Fancy, is that you???!!!\", I asked.  I tried to flatter it, to see if that would expose what it \"really\" was.\n\n\"You're such a pretty little gnat!\", I told it.\n\nBut it just flew away.\n\nThat evening while sitting up on pillows, noticing I had gotten the abstract to populate the room a tiny bit, I saw the dreaming double.\n\nIt was leaving me, walking down a road somewhere off in infinity.\n\nA thought occurred to me.  The double likes activity!  Sitting up on the bed like a self-absorbed monk all night long, wasn't much fun for the double.  I remembered my #1 rule, which I'd been ignoring.\n\nThe best darkroom allows you to do Tensegrity. Carlos designed the Tensegrity to help us.  And to be visible.  And so, the truth is, he wanted us to do it in a dark room.  Possibly even all together.\n\nI have no idea what might come from that.  But until we have people who can get silent, we won't find out.\n\nAs soon as I started, I hit the jackpot.  The colors were absolutely brilliant, and both Fancy and Mystery came out to watch.\n\nI took full advantage. This picture might seem to be cool enough for one night, but it was actually only an afterthought.\n\nI only remember it because in the middle of the night, I got on reddit to post in the advanced discussion group about how it was best to be active in the darkroom, if you wanted help from the double. I was afraid I'd forget by morning.\n\nThat's what reminded me about this particular thing.  But in fact, the \"fishing\" was the most spectacular thing that evening. And I got the \"Gift to Maui\" pass to work a bit.\n\nAnd I just recalled this second. I saw some \"Abstract hamburger\" patties, which indicated the condition of someone's energy body.  One or two of the 4 square patties, each about 4 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick, had square holes in the middle.\n\nI was supposed to figure out how to put them together, to understand the situation. Or maybe, toss out the 2 that had holes, because they weren't worth putting any effort into.\n\nThe abstract is very weird...  That probably explains why inorganic beings like to trap us there.\n\nWhile stealing a little energy.  They like to get paid too.\n\nBut it's all forgotten by now.  What's done at 90% dreaming double, belongs mostly to the dreaming double.\n\nIn this picture, I decided to form a body for Fancy, to see if I could get her to dance.\n\nActually, that's not completely true. I just remember that also, on my second edit of this post.\n\nI was forming the body for the double.  But why, I have no idea. I suppose that means, the weird being that stepped out was related to him,  and not Fancy the inorganic being I was dancing with.\n\nNot only did I succeed in dancing with Fancy, but after it was over I scared the hell out of myself. I was so frightened, I turned on the lights, for protection.\n\n\"Paul\" flew up to my nose, to see if I was all right.\n\nOr, turning on the lights woke him up and he smelled fruit or lemon juice on my breath.\n\nWho knows?\n\nEdited twice\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Weird Science: Make Yourself a Dance

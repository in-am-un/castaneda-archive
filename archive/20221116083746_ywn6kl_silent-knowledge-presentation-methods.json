Possibly you think you can get a job as a \"priest\" of Sorcery.\n\nDid you know virtually no priests in the church actually command any significant knowledge of the bible?\n\nIt's true!\n\nSeminary?  It's about how to run a church as a business. It is NOT about the religion.\n\n\"Priests\" are in it to lord it over others while pretending to be a \"good guy\".\n\nNot because of the details of their belief system.\n\nOr maybe you'll take a better approach to sorcery.\n\nTry to learn it by eating more oatmeal to reduce your cholesterol.\n\nOr by not consuming sugar because Carlos couldn't tolerate the nasty behavior of \"sugar eaters\" around him.\n\nI'm making fun of a special type of inventory warrior.\n\nThe \"Active inventory experts\".\n\nWho are the nearly same thing. Someone confused into thinking you can \"learn\" sorcery, but who take it one step further.\n\nBelieving themselves to be working hard by denying themselves things, or doing some ritual each day, to represent hard work.\n\nBut in fact, they're working uselessly.  It's not going to help.\n\nThey pick the easiest items in their knowledge of sorcery factoids, and try to do those.\n\nYes...\n\nCarlos had us stop eating sugar.  Even fruit.  For what I had thought was 3 months, although eventually someone told me everyone else only did it a week.\n\nAnd didn't I get the memo?\n\nThe likely truth was, Carlos was just trying to get Ellis to stop taking so many prescription drugs.\n\n(don't ask).\n\nBut if you want to be \"sugar free\", just go keto.  That's even further than Carlos ever imagined.\n\nAnd people on ketogenic diets may be thinner and get to eat more bacon, but they don't become sorcerers.\n\nLikewise you can't \"leave your friends and family\" to become  sorcerer.\n\nOr \"erase personal history\".\n\nOr \"live life as an impeccable warrior\".\n\nBelieving those will work is a total misreading of the books.\n\nAnd in all that, where's the magic?\n\nThink it'll just come along because you got on Santa's \"nice list\" instead of remaining on the naughty one?\n\nThat's the essence of religious confusion.  The search for Santa Clause, out there somewhere.\n\nAnd Santa sees you when your sleeping, knows when you're awake.  Knows when you've been bad or good...\n\nYou get the point. There is in fact a super intelligence out there, and it will indeed come to assist you.\n\nBut it also comes to assist ants, moths, and inorganic beings who live in hives on frozen methane ice moons.\n\nIt's not human!\n\nIf you begin to be swayed by the con artists out there who have shaped our social structure, based on claiming some very human like higher intelligence wants you to behave a certain way, you'll be unable to learn sorcery.\n\nAt least, not by the only method we so far have available here.  Womb dreaming aside.\n\nLet's go over the history of how sorcery has been learned across the ages.\n\nBefore the Olmec \"old seers\" there was sorcery all over the planet.\n\nIt was just called, \"maturing as a human\".\n\nIt wasn't unusual, and it certainly wasn't a method to achieve status among others.  There weren't many \"others\".  And no benefit to being on their good side.\n\nIt was just another skill like making flint blades, building structures, or learning to stalk prey.\n\nThere was no \"river of shit\" socialization forcing rules into your thought process to cause you to avoid or seek specific complex socially acceptable ways of looking at things.  No brainwashing.\n\nSo if you were  hunting,  you might discover sorcery naturally. Without even realizing it's different than other things.\n\nPerhaps because the beloved old man of 40 years old, showed you (prespeach peoples here) how he seeks out prey  so successfully.\n\nWith his eyes closed and at distances too far away to see with your physical sight.\n\nAnd as a result, like Luke in Star Wars learning about the force for the first time by putting on that blast shield that blinded him, yet he was able to anticipate shooting practice drones, the ancient seers just learned magic the same way they learned anything else.\n\nBy trying to copy others who were successful, while having to learn the \"how\" themselves.\n\nMagic was no different than club making.\n\nAnd as a result they developed a \"natural\" relationship to \"intent\".\n\nNothing to cloud their vision of it.\n\nWhen they tried to summon magic, they weren't thinking, \"Wait till my book comes out! This will really floor them!!!\"\n\nOr, \"I'll show my mom and she'll a have to admit I wasn't a fool all these years for believing in magic.\"\n\nThey had no such concerns because they had no language, and no large population of people surrounding them to cause them to obsess over social status.\n\nIt was just them, trying to reach a successful balance with the environment.\n\nThen along came language and screwed that balance up.\n\nLanguage is a great \"tool\" to allow knowledge sharing.\n\nBut it has a negative side effect.\n\nIt's like a bad old western where everyone has a belt with a six shooter at their hip, and bullets all along the leather strip.  Mostly it's to hold their pants up, but they come to identify with wearing it and the power it gives them.\n\nThat's a dirty link to intent.  It's unnatural once it evolves that far.   If you don't see the \"book deal\" in a \"Six Shooter\", you need to think more metaphorically.\n\nAnd language is what created the beginnings of a social swamp.  Pressure to conform, leading to everyone behaving badly.  And suffering the consequences of that.\n\nOf the \"opinion consuming\" river of shit.\n\nSo there was some kind of decline in ancient sorcery as a result of language.\n\nBut along came the Olmecs and found a very nice place to live where food was plentiful, the weather was very nice (Mexico doesn't freeze over for months the way Proto-Siberia did), and the \"old seers\" came into existence.  For thousands of years, they perfected magic, and the sharing of it through language.\n\nThey were sorcerers who were storing magic into \"language structures\".\n\nBut still without the \"book deal mind\".\n\nThe thing is, our assemblage point can move to so many locations in the vast dark sea of emanations that the number of realities available to us is unlimited.\n\nBut pre-language no one could become much of an \"inventory warrior\".\n\nThere was no inventory to accumulate, because each person just lived and learned and grew.  And making lists of facts in the mind, was impossible.\n\nThey couldn't try to extract a life of experience from another person using words.\n\nThey had \"direct links\" to intent.\n\nLiving.\n\nBut the old seers evolved in a swamp of  words and took advantage of it, to add to a \"knowledge base\".\n\nIt's a messed up link to intent.  But they realized that to make the best magic work, they had to drop the language for a while.\n\nRemove that flow of words in their mind.   So they avoided the main pitfall of being an \"inventory warrior\".  Never actually doing any of the inventory beyond just memorizing the description.\n\nIf you do that,  drop the words but seek the results, you get to play directly with intent.\n\nAnd being intelligent itself,  intent begins to teach you things.\n\nThe dreaming Emissary is kind of a con artist.  It just helps you learn from intent as you could if you had risen to the level of a \"seer\".\n\nBut before you rose to that level.\n\nIt gives you \"previews\" of what you ought to be doing yourself, but haven't yet mastered.\n\nThe Men of Knowledge, the ones who were only interested in profiting from the scraps the old seers could communicate to them, used rituals.\n\nRituals, drugs, and inorganic beings.  With those they could get a spirit to channel silent knowledge to them.\n\nSeeing.\n\nAnd they got some stunning results!  The talking lizards ritual, the moth dust that brings humans as shroom shapes.\n\nWe read an endless flow of those in the early books.  Most readers not realizing, it's not the drugs at all!\n\nIt's ritual + spirit + power plants.\n\nThe power plants by themselves are not going to get you anywhere.\n\nSorry Psychonauts.  You're very confused.\n\nGoing to a rave party every single night never turned anyone into a sorcerer.\n\nBut you can go that route if you want to.\n\nThe route of the Men of Knowledge.  As long as you have all 3 elements.\n\nUsing rituals and spirits to channel silent knowledge \"early\".\n\nBefore you got that far.\n\nTrouble is, we don't know the rituals.\n\nTo go that route, you'd have to uncover some new ones.\n\nAnd to do that, you have to avoid the drugs because no one can get that high daily, without frying their brain.\n\nAnd sorcery is a daily practice.  Has to be.  The road to the coolest stuff is very long.\n\nBut the road to cool stuff you can visibly see, as a beginner, is not.\n\nDarkroom is one such road.\n\nThe  puffs are  pieces of your second half.    The part not stuck in your organic matter.\n\nThat can \"channel silent knowledge\" for you.  The edges of the puffs are like the dreaming emissary if you use them in a routine.\n\nPuffery (Tensegrity in the Dark) is the routine.  In that routine intent starts to store.\n\nWhat you saw before becomes \"naturally\" expected.  Not expected for a new chapter in your book, but just expected because you saw it before and it's nice.\n\nFor example you saw a brilliant puff you could hold in your hand.\n\nThat's now \"expected\".\n\nYou're letting intent \"store\" into a ritual.\n\nOnce you can hold it like that, it begs the question \"what on earth is this thing made of?\"\n\nSo you gaze into the edge where it's thinner, and see crystalline dreaming details.\n\nYou see stuff in the puff!\n\nAnd from now on you realize you can expect to be able to do that.\n\nIntent is storing into a ritual.  You're creating a \"Man of Knowledge\" ritual from scratch.\n\nWhat we must do, because we don't have anyone around to show us.\n\nWe got to read about those in the books. But all of those ritual used drugs, and all of those needed a specific inorganic being who also knew the ritual.\n\nOn our own we must create containers into which intent can store our natural, uncomplicated \"expectations\" of magic.\n\nSuch as Tensegrity.  It's all containers!\n\nLet me inject here that Zuleica advised Taisha to \"hunt for power\" everywhere she went.\n\nThat's the very same thing I'm telling you here. It starts as preposterous, but then if you force that internal dialogue off while doing it, so that the assemblage point can move, you do indeed find tiny bits of magic out there.\n\nSort of like \"natural gazing\".  Where you get the benefits of organized gazing at a specific thing like fern shadows, but by treating the entire world as if you were gazing at it.\n\nIntent stores into that, the same as it does into \"puffery practices\".\n\nDown at the red zone on the J curve is where the Men of Knowledge wanted to be.\n\nAnd they could, because that's where power plants push you.  To the deep red zone.\n\nBut not beyond.  Only deep silence can get the assemblage point to switch sides on the body.\n\nFor \"seeing\" it has to move to the side that the dreaming double uses.\n\nOut at the far purple zone, you start to become aware of how this all works.\n\nYou finally have access to silent knowledge, without the need of assistance.  Don't need an inorganic being, and don't even need the puffs.\n\nYou've merged with it, perceptually.  Because the assemblage points are now in alignment.  Your normal one has moved to the front, about 4 feet away.  It's beam is shining into the right side of your belly, where and at around 18 inches it passes through the assemblage point of the double.  The two beams of awareness are \"aligned\".\n\nSo you now have the ability to perceive all knowledge on demand.\n\nCarlos started to call it \"Silent Knowledge\" at the end because he learned how we gloss over things.\n\nHow we  ignored that you have to learn to remove your internal dialogue.\n\nFrom the Eagle's gift poem:\n\nI am already given to the power that rules my fate.\n\n(meaning, you are letting intent store into your life container)\n\nAnd I cling to nothing, so I will have nothing to defend.\n\n(you gave up on book deals in order to clean your link to intent)\n\nI have no thoughts so that I will see.\n\nThat's the line everyone ignored!\n\nSo Carlos combined our favorite thing to pretend, namely that you can \"see\", with a reminder of the third part of that rule of the eagle.\n\nI \"have no thoughts\" so that I will see.\n\nAnd if you have thoughts, you won't.\n\nSeeing is knowledge flowing to you about anything you need to know.\n\nSo Carlos changed to calling \"seeing\", \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nTo remind us to get to work.\n\nWhen you reach that state where you can perceive SK directly, is where you become a master of the \"Silent Knowledge Presentation Method\".\n\nWe were taught about those!\n\nBut all we saw was \"talking lizards\".  \"Mushroom shapes\".  \"Traveling on Flowing Water\".  \"Hunting for Power\".  \"Learning from the dreaming emissary\".\n\nI'll add in the new ones Carlos hid in the tensegrity.\n\n\"Gazing into the edge of a puff to find crystalline details\".\n\n\"The crystalline dreaming fog\".\n\n\"Translocations\".\n\nI could go on, but it would just be items from that J curve railroad track diagram.  Pictures of cool stuff you can see if you practice.\n\nOut at the end of the J curve you bypass all that.\n\nYou're working directly with intent.  You can create a new \"Man of Knowledge\" ritual anytime, in a couple of days.\n\nI have some astonishing ones I do, which only animated videos will do justice.\n\nI kind of concluded a while ago, watching one of my rituals create an entirely real world for me to walk off into, that there's nothing completely wrong with the desire to be an \"inventory warrior\".\n\nExcept that, we can never understand the \"factoid\" we memorized, based on words.\n\nBut an animation?\n\nThat sort of satisfies the desire to see that for yourself, so that the new inventory item doesn't become fodder for a book deal.\n\nYou saw it with your own eyes.  But in a video.\n\nAnd you can't take credit for it and try to use that idea to con money from others.\n\nBecause they've either seen the same video, or will soon.  And if you cheat them and they find out you got it from a video, you'll get the opposite of what you wanted.\n\nYou're get negative attention, instead of the positive kind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Silent Knowledge Presentation Methods", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"nqaf29gzub0a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=112d6cf22fd23cd6464e15fb01d48321e3937dc9"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c39525d16a55582487e6b7989af07d4bb161fee1"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dfee3183bb23c481ed269cae85f3ddc7fd2cad8"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca1ae8822aed5b921c5a50f2009aa0327418c3ce"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb65d95b9f8ed60576cb573f944a90e5f9f2151c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cde5a33ee87b45df349e4636b9de9fa0ce0ef9a"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03c1ff9c82262e5055dfe3a79af3339b84856334"}, "id": "nqaf29gzub0a1"}}, "name": "t3_ywn6kl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 37, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EHt9SJ7uYqhb65JeMTgYOPZCTDVvW4I3fZqeDSLLEVg.jpg", "edited": 1668613244.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1668584266.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=03c1ff9c82262e5055dfe3a79af3339b84856334\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/nqaf29gzub0a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=03c1ff9c82262e5055dfe3a79af3339b84856334&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is super advanced stuff.

This will really floor them!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll show my mom and she&amp;#39;ll a have to admit I wasn&amp;#39;t a fool all these years for believing in magic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had no such concerns because they had no language, and no large population of people surrounding them to cause them to obsess over social status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just them, trying to reach a successful balance with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then along came language and screwed that balance up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Language is a great &amp;quot;tool&amp;quot; to allow knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it has a negative side effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like a bad old western where everyone has a belt with a six shooter at their hip, and bullets all along the leather strip.  Mostly it&amp;#39;s to hold their pants up, but they come to identify with wearing it and the power it gives them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a dirty link to intent.  It&amp;#39;s unnatural once it evolves that far.   If you don&amp;#39;t see the &amp;quot;book deal&amp;quot; in a &amp;quot;Six Shooter&amp;quot;, you need to think more metaphorically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And language is what created the beginnings of a social swamp.  Pressure to conform, leading to everyone behaving badly.  And suffering the consequences of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of the &amp;quot;opinion consuming&amp;quot; river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there was some kind of decline in ancient sorcery as a result of language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But along came the Olmecs and found a very nice place to live where food was plentiful, the weather was very nice (Mexico doesn&amp;#39;t freeze over for months the way Proto-Siberia did), and the &amp;quot;old seers&amp;quot; came into existence.  For thousands of years, they perfected magic, and the sharing of it through language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were sorcerers who were storing magic into &amp;quot;language structures&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still without the &amp;quot;book deal mind&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, our assemblage point can move to so many locations in the vast dark sea of emanations that the number of realities available to us is unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But pre-language no one could become much of an &amp;quot;inventory warrior&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no inventory to accumulate, because each person just lived and learned and grew.  And making lists of facts in the mind, was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They couldn&amp;#39;t try to extract a life of experience from another person using words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had &amp;quot;direct links&amp;quot; to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the old seers evolved in a swamp of  words and took advantage of it, to add to a &amp;quot;knowledge base&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a messed up link to intent.  But they realized that to make the best magic work, they had to drop the language for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remove that flow of words in their mind.   So they avoided the main pitfall of being an &amp;quot;inventory warrior&amp;quot;.  Never actually doing any of the inventory beyond just memorizing the description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do that,  drop the words but seek the results, you get to play directly with intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And being intelligent itself,  intent begins to teach you things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming Emissary is kind of a con artist.  It just helps you learn from intent as you could if you had risen to the level of a &amp;quot;seer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before you rose to that level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gives you &amp;quot;previews&amp;quot; of what you ought to be doing yourself, but haven&amp;#39;t yet mastered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Men of Knowledge, the ones who were only interested in profiting from the scraps the old seers could communicate to them, used rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rituals, drugs, and inorganic beings.  With those they could get a spirit to channel silent knowledge to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they got some stunning results!  The talking lizards ritual, the moth dust that brings humans as shroom shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We read an endless flow of those in the early books.  Most readers not realizing, it&amp;#39;s not the drugs at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ritual + spirit + power plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The power plants by themselves are not going to get you anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry Psychonauts.  You&amp;#39;re very confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going to a rave party every single night never turned anyone into a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can go that route if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The route of the Men of Knowledge.  As long as you have all 3 elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using rituals and spirits to channel silent knowledge &amp;quot;early&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you got that far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, we don&amp;#39;t know the rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To go that route, you&amp;#39;d have to uncover some new ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to do that, you have to avoid the drugs because no one can get that high daily, without frying their brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sorcery is a daily practice.  Has to be.  The road to the coolest stuff is very long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the road to cool stuff you can visibly see, as a beginner, is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom is one such road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The  puffs are  pieces of your second half.    The part not stuck in your organic matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That can &amp;quot;channel silent knowledge&amp;quot; for you.  The edges of the puffs are like the dreaming emissary if you use them in a routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Puffery (Tensegrity in the Dark) is the routine.  In that routine intent starts to store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you saw before becomes &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot; expected.  Not expected for a new chapter in your book, but just expected because you saw it before and it&amp;#39;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example you saw a brilliant puff you could hold in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s now &amp;quot;expected&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re letting intent &amp;quot;store&amp;quot; into a ritual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can hold it like that, it begs the question &amp;quot;what on earth is this thing made of?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you gaze into the edge where it&amp;#39;s thinner, and see crystalline dreaming details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see stuff in the puff!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And from now on you realize you can expect to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent is storing into a ritual.  You&amp;#39;re creating a &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot; ritual from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we must do, because we don&amp;#39;t have anyone around to show us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got to read about those in the books. But all of those ritual used drugs, and all of those needed a specific inorganic being who also knew the ritual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On our own we must create containers into which intent can store our natural, uncomplicated &amp;quot;expectations&amp;quot; of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as Tensegrity.  It&amp;#39;s all containers!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me inject here that Zuleica advised Taisha to &amp;quot;hunt for power&amp;quot; everywhere she went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the very same thing I&amp;#39;m telling you here. It starts as preposterous, but then if you force that internal dialogue off while doing it, so that the assemblage point can move, you do indeed find tiny bits of magic out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sort of like &amp;quot;natural gazing&amp;quot;.  Where you get the benefits of organized gazing at a specific thing like fern shadows, but by treating the entire world as if you were gazing at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent stores into that, the same as it does into &amp;quot;puffery practices&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Down at the red zone on the J curve is where the Men of Knowledge wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they could, because that&amp;#39;s where power plants push you.  To the deep red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not beyond.  Only deep silence can get the assemblage point to switch sides on the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; it has to move to the side that the dreaming double uses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out at the far purple zone, you start to become aware of how this all works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You finally have access to silent knowledge, without the need of assistance.  Don&amp;#39;t need an inorganic being, and don&amp;#39;t even need the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve merged with it, perceptually.  Because the assemblage points are now in alignment.  Your normal one has moved to the front, about 4 feet away.  It&amp;#39;s beam is shining into the right side of your belly, where and at around 18 inches it passes through the assemblage point of the double.  The two beams of awareness are &amp;quot;aligned&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you now have the ability to perceive all knowledge on demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos started to call it &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; at the end because he learned how we gloss over things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How we  ignored that you have to learn to remove your internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the Eagle&amp;#39;s gift poem:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am already given to the power that rules my fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(meaning, you are letting intent store into your life container)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I cling to nothing, so I will have nothing to defend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(you gave up on book deals in order to clean your link to intent)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no thoughts so that I will see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the line everyone ignored!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos combined our favorite thing to pretend, namely that you can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, with a reminder of the third part of that rule of the eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &amp;quot;have no thoughts&amp;quot; so that I will see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you have thoughts, you won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing is knowledge flowing to you about anything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos changed to calling &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To remind us to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you reach that state where you can perceive SK directly, is where you become a master of the &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Presentation Method&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were taught about those!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all we saw was &amp;quot;talking lizards&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Mushroom shapes&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Traveling on Flowing Water&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Hunting for Power&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Learning from the dreaming emissary&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll add in the new ones Carlos hid in the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gazing into the edge of a puff to find crystalline details&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The crystalline dreaming fog&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Translocations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but it would just be items from that J curve railroad track diagram.  Pictures of cool stuff you can see if you practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out at the end of the J curve you bypass all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re working directly with intent.  You can create a new &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot; ritual anytime, in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have some astonishing ones I do, which only animated videos will do justice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of concluded a while ago, watching one of my rituals create an entirely real world for me to walk off into, that there&amp;#39;s nothing completely wrong with the desire to be an &amp;quot;inventory warrior&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that, we can never understand the &amp;quot;factoid&amp;quot; we memorized, based on words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But an animation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sort of satisfies the desire to see that for yourself, so that the new inventory item doesn&amp;#39;t become fodder for a book deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You saw it with your own eyes.  But in a video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t take credit for it and try to use that idea to con money from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they&amp;#39;ve either seen the same video, or will soon.  And if you cheat them and they find out you got it from a video, you&amp;#39;ll get the opposite of what you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re get negative attention, instead of the positive kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false,

Because they were &amp;quot;focusing&amp;quot; on the womb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s tonal awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many details the books of Carlos left out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can eventually fill them in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a surprising side effect of darkroom!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sleepwalking returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kids do that, but they get socialized out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first it&amp;#39;s a little bewildering, because the double takes over the body, and he gets obsessed with the tiniest details of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suppose turnabout is fair play. We love to take over his dreams, and don&amp;#39;t even feel guilty for hijacking him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you find yourself sitting up on the bed, staring at &amp;quot;magic stuff&amp;quot; on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sleep walking, even in children, often centers around a tonal obsession attempting to be fulfilled by the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like going to the kitchen to get food that isn&amp;#39;t really there, as a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might be a good idea to sleep on matts the way don Juan&amp;#39;s group did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The control the double has over our physical body is kind of poor.  Might fall off the bed into some furniture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect it&amp;#39;ll turn out that converting to the double the way Cholita can, is part of a more &amp;quot;analog&amp;quot; process with sleepwalking in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, if you use tensegrity to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four Gates dreaming brings the double out from inside dreams, so maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t lead to sleepwalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But tensegrity lures him to come merge with or surround your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ywn6kl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ywn6kl/silent_knowledge_presentation_methods/iwmbgwq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668623060.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iwm7050", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "weirdoddozzy", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668621273.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ywn6kl", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_bbiupq89", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I'm guilty I Gave up my family (in hope to get noticed by santa) but continued my masturbations/indulgents.

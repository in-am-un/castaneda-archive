Whatever you're thinking, it's not like that.\n\nThat's the problem.  The second attention isn't fixed.\n\nOur waking world is fixed by billions of people perceiving in common, for shared purposes of enhancing the imaginary idea of a \"self\" at odds with the world, running around trying to manipulate human situations, in order to get more stuff and more attention.\n\nMore endorsements.\n\nBut the second attention has no meaningful endorsements.  And you can manufacture stuff out of thin air. It's no longer in short supply\n\nAs for seeking attention from other beings, the inorganic beings are like stalker boy or girlfriends.\n\nIt's flattering once in a while, but you soon find it stifling and only want to get away.\n\nIt's cold out there!\n\nAnd that's the help I got.\n\nThe dreaming emissary showed up, in response to a \"concern\" I had.\n\nAbout showing things, that aren't fixed.\n\nHow do you explain to someone that the beam of awareness can't look like the particle fountain someone created for an animation program?\n\nThey won't really get it.  They might understand that you only have so much time to make things like that, and the amount of programming to produce a better looking \"beam\" would take up all of your time, making it impossible to produce more than 1 of those per 3 or 4 years.\n\nThat's the length of time to learn how to produce special effects inside software that's been evolving for 50 years.\n\nAnd how would that work?  You go into darkroom and work your buns off, until you can actually see that beam?\n\nIt can be done!  But the silence level needed is mind boggling.\n\nLets say you halted all progress learning other things, which is a big loss since intent gifts you for your hard work, with different magical demonstrations.\n\nOne you fixate on one,  you don't get the flow of new stuff.  It would be like interrupting don Juan when he taught you his first impossible thing, and insisting you couldn't learn anything else, until you \"mastered\" that.\n\nDon Juan would likely just write you off as unteachable.\n\nBut if you could view the beam, maybe like Da Vinci with the Mona Lisa modeling for him, what would you do?\n\nLook at the beam, then back at your oil painting, and fix what's wrong.\n\nThen look back at the beam for more changes.  With the idea that eventually  you'll get it right.\n\nYou look at the hues.  Is it amber, orange, or yellow?\n\nYou examine the red levels closely.\n\nAnd just as you turn to brush a tiny bit more red onto your oil painting of \"the beam of awareness\",  the actual beam you've been ***seeing***, turns solid red.\n\nYou feel a shock.  That can't be right!\n\nSo it turns green instead.\n\nThat's the problem with the second attention.  It isn't fixed.\n\nIt's a \"reskimming\" of the dark sea of awareness, with your own awareness flowing in there to select just a fragment of what's in front of you.\n\nMostly through habit.  We were taught as children, what to perceive.\n\nBut when you're in the second attention we don't have that kind of training.\n\nBut that's too much to put into a video.  It has to be really simple, and shouldn't even be stated like that.\n\nOnce you state it, the inventory experts get excited, and start memorizing facts so they can steal attention from others.  Based on their \"great knowledge\".\n\nSo while worrying about that just a tiny bit, but with my energy body very vividly visible stuck to my torso, a woman walked up.\n\nThe dreaming emissary.\n\nI've been ignoring inorganic beings, but I make an exception for anything that shows up when I reach silent knowledge.\n\nShe had on a big silly hat.\n\nI commented, \"nice hat\"!\n\nBut it had already changed into a different hat.\n\n\"Blue\", I said?\n\nBut the had was red now.\n\nI looked at her face.  \"At least you're beautiful every time!\"\n\nShe now had a deep cut in her left cheek, with stitches made of metal wire.\n\nI understood.\n\nAnd I realized, the inorganic beings do speak.\n\nBut they also don't speak.\n\nWe only speak, to communicate understanding.\n\nThe inorganic beings can transmit the understanding without the words.\n\nAfter all, that was our natural state as humans, for our first 250,000 years or so.\n\nLanguage is thought to be only 50,000 years old.\n\nBut in silent knowledge, which is what the inorganic beings use to teach us (they can bring it to you before you are capable of reaching that far), anything you are viewing like that, is a topic.\n\nAnd any curiosity about an aspect of the \"topic\", will alter the topic.\n\nIt's the same as the woman who kept changing in response to examining her.\n\nThat's the trick you can use in 4 gates dreaming, to identify a real scout, versus a phantom being.  Stare at them, to see what they ultimately change into.\n\nSo if you receive the \"understanding\" from the dreaming emissary, wondering how that got there brings the words.\n\nThe words, come AFTER the understanding.  Just because you expect there's no understanding without words.\n\nSo at the end of the animation, I'll have TPW (tensegrity policewoman), find herself in the dream world, with the emissary.\n\nAnd have her change like that.\n\nTo teach the audience indirectly, that second attention sights aren't fixed like that cartoon will be.\n\nBut, don't let that created doubt during darkroom.\n\nYou'd be surprised how concrete and real the energy body becomes, and how well those tensegrity movements to \"form\" it, really work.\n\nThey're \"treating second attention sights as real\", and shift the assemblage point sideways to make them more real.\n\nWhich always results in switching to your double if you keep it up.\n\nTricky Carlos!  And I believe there's at least 3 tensegrity forms that are designed to form the energy body, into the double.\n\nHe sort of took the hopelessness of trying to make the second attention behave like the first attention, and be reliable, and decided to use strikes and blows and \"smoothing\", to bypass the internal dialogue which tends to corrupt second attention sights by making them mutate to what's expected.", "edited": 1689583258.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jsaodl2", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got some help on this from the dreaming emissary!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beginners: don&amp;#39;t drool.

Stare at them, to see what they ultimately change into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you receive the &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; from the dreaming emissary, wondering how that got there brings the words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The words, come AFTER the understanding.  Just because you expect there&amp;#39;s no understanding without words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So at the end of the animation, I&amp;#39;ll have TPW (tensegrity policewoman), find herself in the dream world, with the emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And have her change like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To teach the audience indirectly, that second attention sights aren&amp;#39;t fixed like that cartoon will be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, don&amp;#39;t let that created doubt during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d be surprised how concrete and real the energy body becomes, and how well those tensegrity movements to &amp;quot;form&amp;quot; it, really work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;treating second attention sights as real&amp;quot;, and shift the assemblage point sideways to make them more real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which always results in switching to your double if you keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tricky Carlos!  And I believe there&amp;#39;s at least 3 tensegrity forms that are designed to form the energy body, into the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sort of took the hopelessness of trying to make the second attention behave like the first attention, and be reliable, and decided to use strikes and blows and &amp;quot;smoothing&amp;quot;, to bypass the internal dialogue which tends to corrupt second attention sights by making them mutate to what&amp;#39;s expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1519jo0/next_view_of_egg_animation/jsaodl2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1689582755.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1519jo0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jsblq7p", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1689603431.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1519jo0", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "New Title version of the video, and I changed \"egg\" to sphere, which was used a few times in the books.  \n\nAnd moved \"Ancient\" where Carlos liked to put it.

my dreams just because they kept trying to stop me from exploring.\n\nHowever,  unless you found your hands and did the first gate thing of looking from object to object, you should assume they're all just phantoms.\n\nYou're own doing.\n\nIt's the energy of looking at the hands, and then from object to object DELIBERATELY which \"compels\" the inorganic beings to send scouts.\n\nDon Juan's words.\n\nAnd it's not a \"path\" until you bring the tonal rationality into your dreams, to guide the double out.\n\nTo think all dreams are a path is a big misunderstanding of 4 gates dreaming.\n\nIt's actually very clever in its design.\n\nAnd you MUST find your hands, and look from object to object.  Or you aren't \"charged up with rationality\" so you can continue \"solving\" more gates.\n\nAs for scouts, the only way you can tell is by being lucid, as proven by finding your hands and looking from object to object.\n\nTHEN, you can easily identify scouts.\n\nJust stare at the phantoms one at a time.  A shirt button on the chest will do.\n\nIf they try to move towards you to stop it, point your finger at them like it was a knife.\n\nI always point though, and I try to gaze at them from at least 6 feet away.  So they can't lunge at me before I have them frozen in space.\n\nBut no more than 12 so they can't run.\n\nAnd stare!!!\n\nDon't allow your gaze to move off whatever you are looking at, even a tiny bit. Examine every tiny detail, to see if it changes.\n\nA phantom will distort and mutate and shake, and fall to the ground leaving a pile of clothes or rubble. \n\nAnd not even the clothes it was wearing. Any clothes. It's leftover phantom intent.\n\nA scout will burn open and reveal a light of some kind.  A bar, flame, or anything that won't go away.\n\nBut unless you found your hands to prove you brought in some tonal rationality, it's just a dream.\n\nEven if it's about your obsessions, which are sorcery oriented.\n\nNone of that applies to women.\n\nIF they go into dreaming using womb silence.\n\nNow, is all of what I said 100% absolutely always true?\n\nProbably not.\n\nBut we just watched the entire community completely fail for the last 50  years.\n\nNot a single person made any of it work.\n\nWitches did witchy stuff, but none rose to enough knowledge to realize they needed to help this community.

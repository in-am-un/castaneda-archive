It  was  not  a  headache;  it  was rather  a  very  intense  weight  in  my  ears.  I  felt  it  also  on  my  eyelids  and  the  roof  of  my  mouth.  I knew  I  was  feverish,  but  the  heat  was  only  in  my  head.  I  made  a  feeble  attempt  to  sit  up.  The thought  crossed  my  mind  that  I  was  having  a  stroke.  My  first  reaction  was  to  call  for  help,  but somehow  I  calmed  down  and  tried  to  let  go  of  my  fear.  After  a  while  the  pressure  in  my  head began  to  diminish  but  it  also  began  to  shift  to  my  throat.  I  gasped  for  air,  gagging  and  coughing for  some  time;  then  the  pressure  moved  slowly  to  my  chest,  then  to  my  stomach,  to  my  groin,  to my legs, and to my feet  before  it  finally left  my body. \n\nWhatever  had  happened  to  me  had  taken  about  two  hours  to  unfold.  During  the  course  of those  two  grueling  hours  it  was  as  if  something  inside  my  body  was  actually  moving  downward, moving  out  of  me.  I  fancied  it  to  be  rolling  up  like  a  carpet.  Another  image  that  occurred  to  me was  of  a  blob  moving  inside  the  cavity  of  my  body.  I  discarded  that  image  in  favor  of  the  first, because  the  feeling  was  of  something  being  coiled  within  itself.  Just  like  a  carpet  being  rolled  up, it  became  heavier,  thus  more  painful,  as  it  went  down.  The  two  areas  where  the  pain  became excruciating  were  my  knees  and  my  feet,  especially  my  right  foot,  which  remained  hot  for  thirtyfive  minutes  after  all  the  pain and pressure  had vanished.\n\nLa  Gorda,  upon  hearing  my  report,  said  that  this  time  for  certain  I  had  lost  my  human  form, that  I  had  dropped  all  my  shields,  or  most  of  them.\"\n\nConfusing!

I\u2019ve read (and sometimes reread) every one of your posts on here, and it has launched me right back into practice. So good on you for that. I appreciate your interpretations, especially since you were taught by him directly. Either you\u2019re a great teacher or Carlos actually sucked at it.

Scared the shit out of them. I feel bad about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I wasn\u2019t interpreting any of this through the lens of sorcery at the time. I didn\u2019t (and still don\u2019t) know how much of that was important or just indulging while in a state of psychosis. (I\u2019ll be piecing that one together the rest of my life.) but the results were clear. I was completely changed. Both physically and personality-wise. My back was healed. I was 10 pounds lighter. My allergies to both bees and strawberries strangely disappeared. And I was plagued with synchronicities for the next three or so years. This all happened about 4 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the recalling of the luminous egg that brought me back to the books. (I had been reading and doing the techniques since I was twelve. I\u2019m in my 40s now.) I tried to find clues in the books to help me piece together what happened but I couldn\u2019t really nail anything down. It wasn\u2019t until a few months back I discovered this sub and started reading your posts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ve described specific techniques very clearly and your interpretations of Carlos\u2019s teachings just hit home with a clarity they never did for me before. I\u2019ve read (and sometimes reread) every one of your posts on here, and it has launched me right back into practice. So good on you for that. I appreciate your interpretations, especially since you were taught by him directly. Either you\u2019re a great teacher or Carlos actually sucked at it. You\u2019d know better than me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I think I\u2019m in love with Cholita. She seems like my kinda gal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT/NOTE: meant to reply to Dan\u2019s question about my dreaming technique.

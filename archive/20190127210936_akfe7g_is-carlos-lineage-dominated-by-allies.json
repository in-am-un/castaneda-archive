I asked him what our connection was. He responded by saying the answer is complex, then elaborated.\n\nWe are actually composed of a collection of particles of awareness or soul particles, analogous to material objects being composed of a collection of molecules. Carlos experienced this directly:\n\n&gt;I was a myriad of selves which were all \"me,\" a colony of separate units that had a special allegiance to one another and would join unavoidably to form one single awareness, my human awareness. \u2014 *Tales of Power*\n\nUpon the death of a younger soul, the soul particles tend to fragment into subgroups, each subgroup having achieved internal harmony. Any one subgroup does not have enough \"critical mass\" to re-incarnate and so joins with potentially harmonious subgroups that were formerly part of another individual to prepare for the next incarnation.\n\nThis mixing and matching process continues for many lifetimes until a nearly harmonious collective is established. Old souls have very little fragmentation upon death. Instead, their goal is to strengthen cohesion until sovereignty is achieved. This marks the completion of the incarnational cycle, the purpose of which is to forge a viable sovereign being, cohesive enough to able to stand alone before Infinity without disintegrating and therefore free.\n\nOld souls tend to become altruistic, because almost everyone they meet they recognize as having some soul particles they once were joined with. Even though they are now separated, threads of awareness still connect them. This accounts for such relationships as soulmates, soul siblings and so on.\n\nMy guide concluded by saying that he and I are connected this way, which is why he chooses to guide me. He said, \"We are of the same soul, connected by threads of awareness.\" He and I, among others, are part of an oversoul which is itself seeking to evolve. Awareness is a fractal.\n\nI have not found precisely this view from any other source. Carlos' description above comes closest.

I asked him what our connection was. He responded by saying the answer is complex, then elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are actually composed of a collection of particles of awareness or soul particles, analogous to material objects being composed of a collection of molecules. Carlos experienced this directly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was a myriad of selves which were all &amp;quot;me,&amp;quot; a colony of separate units that had a special allegiance to one another and would join unavoidably to form one single awareness, my human awareness. \u2014 &lt;em&gt;Tales of Power&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon the death of a younger soul, the soul particles tend to fragment into subgroups, each subgroup having achieved internal harmony. Any one subgroup does not have enough &amp;quot;critical mass&amp;quot; to re-incarnate and so joins with potentially harmonious subgroups that were formerly part of another individual to prepare for the next incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This mixing and matching process continues for many lifetimes until a nearly harmonious collective is established. Old souls have very little fragmentation upon death. Instead, their goal is to strengthen cohesion until sovereignty is achieved. This marks the completion of the incarnational cycle, the purpose of which is to forge a viable sovereign being, cohesive enough to able to stand alone before Infinity without disintegrating and therefore free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old souls tend to become altruistic, because almost everyone they meet they recognize as having some soul particles they once were joined with. Even though they are now separated, threads of awareness still connect them. This accounts for such relationships as soulmates, soul siblings and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guide concluded by saying that he and I are connected this way, which is why he chooses to guide me. He said, &amp;quot;We are of the same soul, connected by threads of awareness.&amp;quot; He and I, among others, are part of an oversoul which is itself seeking to evolve.

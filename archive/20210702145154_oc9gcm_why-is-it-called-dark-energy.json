She pushed me into that tunnel, which allows bodily entry to the IOB realm.\n\nI'm not sure which body, but it seems to be the real one.

It's what Carlos told us to aim for, after he was gone.\n\nHer technique should end with jumping to the distant star, to land on something.  That requires the double.\n\nI suspect we have yet another in this subreddit who has brought out his double!  \n\nHe mentioned seeing 4 arms in chat.\n\nThat's surely double!     \n\n\nUnless you grew an extra set.\n\nOr unless your IOB is messing with your head.  But I don't think they do that sort of messing around. It's not beneficial to their goal to have you mistrust them.\n\nWhat Nyei's describing in her star technique,  can happen anywhere from the green line to what I like to call the pink zone now.\n\nI'd recommend to her to classify results and try to map them to the J curve, which came from Carlos.\n\nSo that people who succeed with her technique will be aware it works at multiple positions of the assemblage point, and learn to move through all of them by watching the magical results.\n\nDoing just one magic technique is Men of Knowledge stuff.\n\nWe want to be *seers*.  They move the assemblage point, and the specifics of what manifests along the way is not the actual goal.\n\nIf she doesn't like the J curve because people will associate it with this subreddit, she could map it as a simple map with little pictures along the way.\n\nClouds leading to the heavens? Steps on a path in a garden?\n\nOr map it as being specific stars, moving out into space to a specific location.\n\nMaybe map the J curve onto the Zodiac in some clever way?\n\nA linear progress of any kind will help those who succeed with her technique know, it's just as step, not the goal.\n\nIt would be cool to see Nyei force Reni to find some real magic too.  That would happen if Nyei had an increase in income from this technique. \n\nI'd send Cholita to her class to help give her income, but Nyei knows Cholita.\n\nAnd Cholita might beg to be saved from imprisonment in my home.\n\nCholita was very strange last night.\n\nI heard voices in the bathroom. It was \"Senior Baptisma\" arguing with a petty tyrant in a weird 1960s Mexican comedy voice.

It&amp;#39;s what Carlos told us to aim for, after he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her technique should end with jumping to the distant star, to land on something.  That requires the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect we have yet another in this subreddit who has brought out his double!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He mentioned seeing 4 arms in chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s surely double!     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you grew an extra set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or unless your IOB is messing with your head.  But I don&amp;#39;t think they do that sort of messing around. It&amp;#39;s not beneficial to their goal to have you mistrust them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What Nyei&amp;#39;s describing in her star technique,  can happen anywhere from the green line to what I like to call the pink zone now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend to her to classify results and try to map them to the J curve, which came from Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that people who succeed with her technique will be aware it works at multiple positions of the assemblage point, and learn to move through all of them by watching the magical results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing just one magic technique is Men of Knowledge stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to be &lt;em&gt;seers&lt;/em&gt;.  They move the assemblage point, and the specifics of what manifests along the way is not the actual goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she doesn&amp;#39;t like the J curve because people will associate it with this subreddit, she could map it as a simple map with little pictures along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clouds leading to the heavens? Steps on a path in a garden?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or map it as being specific stars, moving out into space to a specific location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe map the J curve onto the Zodiac in some clever way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A linear progress of any kind will help those who succeed with her technique know, it&amp;#39;s just as step, not the goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be cool to see Nyei force Reni to find some real magic too.  That would happen if Nyei had an increase in income from this technique. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d send Cholita to her class to help give her income, but Nyei knows Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Cholita might beg to be saved from imprisonment in my home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was very strange last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard voices in the bathroom. It was &amp;quot;Senior Baptisma&amp;quot; arguing with a petty tyrant in a weird 1960s Mexican comedy voice.  That kind of northern accent like Cantinflas often uses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So Senior, you want me to dance like this?  Like a campesino?  And should I also spin?  I&amp;#39;m sure that would please you, bastardo enfermo.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_oc9gcm", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oc9gcm/why_is_it_called_dark_energy/h3xq92k/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625331676.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1625331676.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h3wf7lt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h3upxku", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It is Nyei actually, i am long friends with her on Facebook and i do follow her posts and reactions.

Didn&amp;#39;t manage to make it have any visible lights on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, it&amp;#39;s probably not a good test to be trying to make your hand puppet have some visible lights on it, while a real IOB looks on giving suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems redundant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_oc9gcm", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oc9gcm/why_is_it_called_dark_energy/h3yp5im/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625350167.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1625350167.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h3y44i1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1625338908.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h3y2a5a", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "In case that link goes down, the title of the video is:\n\n\"Bridging Heaven &amp; Earth Show # 4 with the Chocmools of Carlos Castaneda &amp; Tensegrity Videos\"\n\nposition 34 min 25 sec\n\nDead Star Energy pass", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h3y44i1", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case that link goes down, the title of the video is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bridging Heaven &amp;amp; Earth Show # 4 with the Chocmools of Carlos Castaneda &amp;amp; Tensegrity Videos&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;position 34 min 25 sec&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dead Star Energy pass&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_oc9gcm", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oc9gcm/why_is_it_called_dark_energy/h3y44i1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625338908.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h3y2a5a", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1625337957.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_oc9gcm", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Here's food for thought on this topic, and fuel for Nyei's star gazing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP89xbIRTTk&amp;t=34m25s", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h3y2a5a", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s food for thought on this topic, and fuel for Nyei&amp;#39;s star gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP89xbIRTTk&amp;amp;t=34m25s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP89xbIRTTk&amp;amp;t=34m25s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oc9gcm/why_is_it_called_dark_energy/h3y2a5a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625337957.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_oc9gcm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}]

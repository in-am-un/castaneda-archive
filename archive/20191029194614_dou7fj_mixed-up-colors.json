My understanding of it is still poor, but it\u2019s worth preserving in case I'm not around much longer.\n\nLast night I found myself staring directly at my own second attention\u2019s energy body for a full 5 minutes.  I could examine even the tiniest details on it.\n\nNothing was missing. It was a complete \u201cthing\u201d. A dark thing, like the wind at night. And absolutely stable.\n\nThen a minute later, the entire memory was erased from my mind.\n\nI only got it back when I noticed my own dreaming double, sitting on the floor in front of me with a wicked grin on his face.\n\nI kind of like that guy.  You\u2019ll like yours too.\n\nBut you\u2019ll probably wonder if it\u2019s a good idea to turn your back on him.\n\nZuleica\u2019s technique for finding colors in darkness evolves.  It doesn\u2019t remain the same.\n\nIn the account Carlos gave he ultimately seems to have \u201cfinished\u201d building that energy body, and he rolls up into it.\n\nThat gives his second attention predominance over his first attention.\n\nBut Josefina swished into her color. She didn\u2019t go through the steps Carlos took.\n\nI believe that if we could see behind the scenes in don Juan\u2019s world, we might realize that his main trick was to get anything at all to happen in the second attention, and then imply that\u2019s what always happens.\n\nHe wanted to give the apprentice the feeling that he\u2019s on a known path, and making progress.\n\nIf don Juan admitted the truth in some situations, namely that the has no idea why that just happened and that the second attention is very mixed up, it wouldn\u2019t have been as effective.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s even true that ALL of the techniques in Carlos\u2019 books are random and unnecessary. That all you have to do is be silent, and let that soak in for a while.\n\nGiven silence, perhaps even the tiniest amount of *intent* is enough to select a path.\n\nIf that\u2019s not the case, then I\u2019d have to explain why Zuleica\u2019s technique produces precisely the results Carlos wrote about.\n\nIt\u2019s got to be *intent*.\n\nI got home from work yesterday, hoping that Cholita wasn\u2019t bent on murder.\n\nThat\u2019s my prayer while driving home; Let Cholita be less angry.\n\nI found her working in her garage, wearing tiny little shorts.  A stormtroopers thought crossed my mind.  She's trouble, but man it's worth it to see those shorts!  No wonder women are crazy. They don't **need** to be sane.\n\nShe came out and said, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d\n\nI responded, \u201cFine Honey, how are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good\u201d, she said.\n\nShe turned around, went back in, and locked the door.\n\nI noticed that her kingdom seemed to have gotten a little bigger. There was a new Wicca chair and some houseplants.  And she'd plastered the gaps around the frame of the new locking metal door I put on her garage.\n\nThe environment looked much like a nice hotel.  Everything was as spotless as it could be.\n\nCholita always hides the cleaning from me because as she said, \u201cI am not a servant! I\u2019m a woman of substance!\u201d\n\nAnd yet, she still has $200 credit with a cleaning crew she hasn\u2019t claimed.\n\nShe continued to make noises from the locked garage all night long.\n\nThat left me all night to practice gazing at darkness.\n\nI got an early start. After 2 hours of forcing silence in total darkness, I had what I wanted.\n\nI\u2019ve discovered there are at least 3 kinds of colors, or things you can see, in total darkness.\n\nThere are the blotches of color you can scoop.\n\nBut there are also fine lines and folds, which can be found on flat surfaces. They give the impression that you can see in the dark, and since they lie flat on walls and surfaces you can in fact use them to navigate the darkness.\n\nAnd then there's dreaming energy.  Cholita brought that to me.\n\nI had all 3 types, and I was silent.  Very silent.\n\nThat\u2019s a main benefit of having Cholita around. She forces me to be silent anytime I have to hang out with her. Her madness is intolerable if you have an internal dialogue. Even strangers we come across in malls tend to flee from us, once they hear Cholita speak.\n\n\"You'll all die in blood when the US government gets around to it, and you deserve it!!!\", she was shouting the last time we went out.\n\nBut I had the night to myself. The first thing I wanted to do with that scene was figure out why the dreaming energy could be so frustrating.\n\nHow can you feel like you\u2019re failing, when you have a dream materialized in your bedroom, and you can watch it play out with your eyes open and while wide awake?  Could anything be cooler than that?\n\nI sort of solved that mystery.\n\nThe dream is vague. It\u2019s just a hint of the *intent* of the dreamer.\n\nTo make it \u201creal\u201d, you have to add your own energy. Then the vague details become clear.\n\nBut to do that you have to be innocent. You can\u2019t interfere with the scene.\n\nThat means, you don\u2019t get the normal thrill of witnessing something magical.\n\nIt just \u201cis\u201d, or it won\u2019t happen at all. That\u2019s where the frustration comes from. You don\u2019t get what you wanted.\n\nIt\u2019s like crummy sex on a first date.\n\nMy next concern was to figure out if I could really *see* in the dark. I focused on the lines and folds, which were visible on all surfaces.\n\nThey moved. You couldn\u2019t really say that a line was located, \u201chere\u201d, because by the time you realized it was here, it was there.\n\nSome quantum physics might be useful here, to explain how the observer changes the observed.\n\nThe sum total of potential locations gave a hint of what was there.\n\nI could in fact \u201csee in the dark\u201d, but not well enough to be satisfying.\n\nI looked at the lines on the walls, wondering if they were the same thing as \u201cthe wall\u201d, a technique Carlos was emphasizing before he died.\n\nLooking at the wall of my room, and seeing that the lines and folds did in fact have details in them, I realized I was now looking into the inorganic being\u2019s realm.\n\nOr one of their worlds.  I suspect there are many.\n\nThis one had very dim beings living in it.  I got up and walked over to the wall, to try pushing and pulling on them. I got a few heads to barely materialize.  But mostly they kept to their \u201ctrue\u201d form, a collection of little lights.\n\nI couldn\u2019t pull them all the way to my world. They slipped from my grasp.\n\nAt that point, the benefit of having an inorganic being around became obvious.\n\nAll of the 3 types of colors in the room became intensely bright.\n\nIt was so bright and confusing that I couldn\u2019t think of anything to do but scoop it all onto my stomach.\n\nWhile I was doing that I wondered how many months of this it will take to finish forming that energy body?  For Carlos, it seemed to be only a few days.\n\nAs I pulled in more and more I could see a blob forming around my stomach and chest, made from purple light. I seemed to be \u201cstuffing\u201d more colors into a container.\n\nI blanked out.\n\nWhen I came to I was sitting up on my bed, on pillows, gazing down at the strangest thing I\u2019d ever seen.\n\nI seemed to be looking down towards my own torso, as if I\u2019d simply bent my head down to put my chin on my chest.  But it wasn't my torso.  It was an oval blob, covered in luscious dark energy.\n\nThe top of the thing I was looking at was completely visible.  I had to be 3 feet higher than I was, to get that kind of view.\n\nIt was a perfectly solid representation of what we all imagine the energy body to look like. Egg shaped, but perhaps a bit more compressed than you\u2019d expect.\n\nIt had fibers, bumps, and all kinds of details.\n\nI tried to see if there were whip-like projections, as I\u2019d seen on Cholita. And did they rotate the same direction?\n\nBut it was static.\n\nI looked closely at the details, and realized they were all moving.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t perceive the movements.\n\nI was stuck in 2 places at once. One view could see the details moving, but the other, the stronger one, could not.\n\nI watched the absolutely stable sight for several minutes, before I began to drift into unconsciousness.\n\nA sight like that is bound to move the assemblage point drastically.  Be prepared to pass out if you stare at something like that.\n\nI fought to retain consciousness. It was still there.\n\nBut I blanked out again and lost all memory of it.\n\nI found myself walking around, trying to summon an inorganic being.\n\nI managed to manifest some very dim hypnogogic faces on puffs of very bright color I had compressed with my hands.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t stabilize them.\n\nI returned to the bed to try something else. I wanted to look down, into dreaming scenes, to see if I could track down Cholita.\n\nSurely she was asleep by now.\n\nA very loud crash from the living room startled me.\n\nA shiver ran up my back, and my heart skipped a few beats.\n\nCholita wasn\u2019t asleep. She was moving heavy objects and one fell.\n\nI looked around to see what the effect of that fright would be.  Might as well take advantage!\n\nI saw a dark man sitting on the floor, at the foot of my bed.  He wasn't all black. He was simply, \"dark\", as if darkness was his true nature.\n\nI knew him!\n\nHe's always there. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s buried by thoughts.\n\nIf you can just slip down, past all the noise, he\u2019s there.\n\nIt was me!\n\nBut, a more capable, and possibly malicious, me.\n\nI could feel his confidence.\n\nHe could do anything!\n\nGo anywhere.\n\nTake any object.\n\nBreak into anything.\n\nNothing could confine him.\n\nThat\u2019s when I fully recalled seeing my luminous shell.\n\nI quickly did several thumbs-ups, to mark the spot in the second attention,  so that I wouldn\u2019t lose it again.\n\nIf not for my dreaming double, I\u2019d likely have no memory of it today.\n\nEdited", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Mixed up Colors", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_dou7fj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1572377765.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1572374774.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m mostly writing this so that I don\u2019t forget.

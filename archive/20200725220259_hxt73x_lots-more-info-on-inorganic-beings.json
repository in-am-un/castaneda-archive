Thought it would be a good reference to have. Dan, can we maybe pin it somewhere?\n\nSource: [http://www2.hawaii.edu/\\~jjudd/energy/partI/universe/inorganicb.htm](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~jjudd/energy/partI/universe/inorganicb.htm)\n\nThere's a ton of good information, like the different kinds of IOBs, which helps explain like why I'm dealing with some who are total assholes scaring the shit out of me in the middle of the night to use me like a food bowl.  (Don't worry, I'm good. Learning some defensive strategies, but that's for another post.) Others are more useful.\n\nFor convenience, here's the text from the webpage. Apologies for the formatting. Too lazy to fix.\n\n**WHAT ARE   THEY?**\n\nTHEY ARE FORCES NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL IN THE   NAGUAL. An ally is a force, a tension..just like in   the case of a tree, the only way to know what an ally is, is by   experiencing it. TOP,84. it is not your reason that puts ally   together. It is the body. You have perceived ally in many degrees   and on many occasions. Each of those perceptions was stored in   your body. The sum of those pieces is the ally. TOP,85..They could   perhaps be called spirits, they aren't guardians...they are   forces, neither good nor bad, just forces that a sorcerer learns   to harness....SR,39. The allies are neither good nor evil, but are   put to use by the sorcerers for whatever purpose they see   fit.SR,40. ..tenuous energy projected through worlds (have no real   power) TAOD,100 The ally is something which is outside..the realm   of reason. It can only be witnessed only at the center of will at   times when our ordinary view has stopped, therefore it is properly   the nagual. Sorcerers, however, can learn to perceive the ally in   a most intricate way and in doing so they get too deeply immersed   in a new view. TOP,237. The spirit is a force (in this case he is   referring to the spirit of the water hole) and as such, it   responds only to strength. SR,180. Don't call them spirits..call   them allies, call them inexplicable forces. SR,234\n\nTHEY ARE CONSCIOUS BEINGS ....there are two types of conscious beings   roaming the earth, the inorganic and the organic... POS,69 The   only similarity between inorganic and organic beings is that all   of them have the awareness-bestowing pink or peach or amber   emanations. FFW,180\n\nTHEY ARE LUMINOUS MASSES both are luminous masses..inorganic beings are   long and candle like but opaque..(not as bright as organic   luminous masses) POS,69\n\nTHEIR ENERGY SIZZLES.. see its energetic sizzling ...bubbling with   some heatlike inner activity.. TAOD,89,164,176\n\nTHEY LIVE LONGER THAN ORGANIC   BEINGS.... the life of inorganic beings are   infinitely longer and their consciousness infinitely more calm and   deep than organic beings...TAOD, 45,46,47,48,87....Inorganic   beings live infinitely longer than organisms. FFW,181\n\nNOT AS MANY INORGANIC BEINGS AS ORGANIC   ONES Inorganic beings are not as plentiful as   organic ones, but this was offset by the greater number of bands   of inorganic awareness. Also the differences among the inorganic   beings themselves are more vast than the difference among   organisms, because organisms belong only to one band while   inorganic beings belong to seven bands. FFW,181.\n\nTHEIR AWARENESS IS VERY SLOW ....their awareness is very slow in comparison   with ours. It will take years for a sorcerer to be acknowledged by   inorganic beings...they are seperated from us by a formidable   barrier-energy that moves at a different speed...they are pretty   morbid by themselves...TAOD,45,46,47,48,87...\n\nTHE INORGANIC BEINGS ARE FEMALE the inorganic beings are female.. they don't   pursue females, they only go after males TAOD, 188 THEY HAVE EMOTIONS...they have emotional dependency, sadness,   joy, wrath, and so forth... and love; a kind of love man can't   even conceive. FFW,100...they are capable of giving back   inconceivable affection. FFW,123\n\n**WHAT   DOES THE COCOON OF AN INORGANIC BEING LOOK LIKE?**\n\nTHE COCOON IS A FORMLESS RECEPTACLE WITH LOW   LUMINOSITY Inorganic beings produced by the seven other   bands of awareness are characterized by having a container that   has no motion; it is rather a formless receptacle with a low   degree of luminosity. It does not look like a cocoon of organic   beings. It lacks the tautness, the inflated quality that makes the   organic beings look like luminous balls bursting with energy.   FFW,180\n\n**WHERE   IS THEIR ASSEMBLAGE POINT?** inorganic beings have their AP on the lower   part of their containers. They are throughly alien to man, but   akin to plants. Others have it anywhere on the upper part of their   containers. Those are close to man and other organic creatures.   FFW,184\n\nTHEIR LUMINOUS GAP IS DIFFERENT SO THEY LIVE   LONGER....the gap of inorganic beings is really   different. It's more like a long thread, a hair of luminosity   ..consequently, inorganic beings are infinitely more durable than   we are. FFW,246\n\n**HOW   DO INORGANIC BEINGS INTERACT WITH US?**\n\nTHEY ARE ATTRACTED TO EMOTIONS ESPECIALLY   ANIMAL FEAR They are attracted to emotions. Animal fear is   what attracts them the most; it releases the kind of energy that   suits them. the emanations are rallied inside them by animal   fear... new seers saw that the allies are attracted to the energy   released by emotions; love is equally effective, as well as   hatred, or sadness. FFW,121\n\nTHEY FEED ON OUR LIFE-FORCE...The allies feed directly on to our   life-force in the middle of the stomach, they usually make us   sick, and then we see them as heavy, ugly creatures. SRP,137 They   are forces and as such they can drain you to   nothing.SRP,136\n\nTHE INORGANIC BEINGS CAN FOLLOW YOU    the spirit of the waterhole around my house   can follow you any where, unless you have a spirit catcher.   SR,227...\n\n**CAN   INORGANIC BEINGS HURT US?**\n\nALLIES CANNOT ACT ON ANYTHING DIRECTLY/OR KILL   US DIRECTLY allies could not take the lead or act upon   anything directly; they could, however act upon man in an indirect   way. ..coming in contact with an ally was dangerous because the   ally was capable of bringing out the worst in a person. SR,43.   ...they are as dangerous as we men are, no more, no less... they   cannot kill us directly, but they can certainly can frighten us to   death. FFW,112 ..the allies cannot push at all but they could   scare me and make me fall to the ground. On the ground..the allies   could hold anybody down. FFW,262 ...after I had exhausted all my   energy, the ally managed to shove me into the fire, and I was   badly burned. FFW,118 an ally pushed him into a pile of burning   wood, and he burned himself a little on the knee and shoulder   blade.. SR,44 It (ally) took the lead and moved towards us,   crushing small rocks and hard lumps of dirt. TOP,256. they are so   real that they kill people, especially those who stray into the   wilderness and have no personal power...it applies (sleeping in   the wilderness alone) only to the wilderness, where there are no   people around, especially the wilderness in high mountains.   JTI,176,177 the ally was going too fast for your strength and a   direct jolt with him would be very injurious to you. SR,228. the   entities of the night moved along your left..they were trying to   merge with your death. JTI,178. There were many ways in which such   a being put a warrior to the test. it might suddenly leap in front   of him, in the most horrendous appearance, or it might grab the   man from the back and not turn him loose and keep him pinned down   for hours. it might topple a tree on him. DJ said that those were   truly dangerous forces, and although they could not kill a man   hand to hand, they could cause his death by fright, or by actually   letting objects fall on him, or by appearing suddenly and causing   him to stumble, lose his footing, and go over the precipice.   SR,234. He told me that if I ever found one of those beings under   inappropriate circumstances I should never attempt to struggle   with it because it would kill me. It would rob my soul. So I   should throw myself to the ground and bear it until morning.   SR,234\n\nSTATEMENT THAT ALLY WALKED OVER CC'S   NECK...in order to do that he had to touch you.   The double tapped you on the neck, on the same spot the ally   walked over you years ago. TOP,77.\n\nTHEY ARE NOT REALLY AGGRESSIVE allies are not really aggressive its just that   they have a different kind of energy. They are more like an   electric current. FFW,121\n\nTHEY RELEASE A DANGEROUS   PERSPIRATION contact with the allies, produced a most   injurious perspiration that had to be washed off immediately.   SRP,148\n\n**HOW   DO WE PERCEIVE THEM?** THEY ARE FORMLESS..( a formless energy field POS,69)...The   allies have no form.. they are like a presence, like a wind, like   a glow. SRP,136.An ally was formless, it was perceived as a   quality, it was tameable, the ally had a rule. TDJ,200. An ally   was believed to be an entity existing outside and independent of   oneself, yet in spite of being a seperate entity an ally was   believed to be formless. TDJ,200.\n\nTHE ALLIES TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS    Ordinarily, we don't perceive the containers   of inorganic beings at all. FFW,182.. Allies would look like   ordinary people...real people look like luminous eggs when you see   them. Nonpeople always look like people. That's what I meant when   I said you cannot see an ally. The allies take different forms.   They look like dogs, coyotes, birds, even tumbleweeds, or anything   else. the only difference is that when you see them they look like   what they're pretending to be. Everything has its own way of being   when you see. Just like men look like eggs, other things look like   something else, but the allies can be seen only in the form they   are portraying. That form is good enough to fool our eyes. A dog   is never fooled, neither is a crow.... The allies just take the   outward appearance of whatever is around and then we take them for   what they are not. it is not their fault that we have taught our   eyes only to look at things. SR,40 .....an ally could not be seen   because an ally adopted any form... SR,39. ... to a crow it (the ally) looks like a   pointed hat. Round and wide at the bottom, ending in a long point.   Some of them shine, but the majority are dull and appear to be   very heavy. They resemble a dripping piece of cloth. they are   foreboding shapes.... (when DJ sees them) they look like whatever   they're pretending to be. they take any shape or size that suits   them. they could be shaped like a pebble or a mountain.   SR,41.In the company of men they behave like men. In   the company of animals they behave like animals. Animals are   usually afraid of them; however, if they are accustomed to seeing   the allies they leave them alone. SR,42... some people in the   street are not really people. SR,42... if you find two of them   they were always two of the same kind. SR,43. they do,at times,   materialize themselves in the daily world right in front of us.   Most of the time,though, their invisible presence is marked by a   bodily jolt, a shiver of sorts that comes from the marrow of the   bones. TAOD,45,46,47,48,87...I focused my eyes on a spot to the side of the   lighter silhouette and I could make out a chartreuse glow on it.   TOP,21.they argued that there must have been   hundreds, if not thousands, of cases in which foreign energy slips   unnoticed through natural barriers into our human world.. TAOD,13   the spirit came to you as the ally came to you today. you could   not see it,though, because you did not have the speed;however,that   day I took you to the water canyon and put you on a rock, you knew   the spirit was almost on top of you without actually seeing it.   Those spirits are helpers. One needs to be impeccable to hold them   at bay. SR,227.(Spirits look) different for every man and so   are the allies. For you an ally would apparently look like a man   you once knew, or like a man you will always be about to know;   that's the bent of your nature. You are given to mysteries and   secrets. I'm not like you so an ally for me is something very   precise. SR,227.\n\nTHE ALLIES AS MOTHS (METAPHOR) (when asked about the moth)..you know that was   an ally. TOP,84. Calling the ally a moth is again only a way of   talking, a way of making that immensity out there understandable.   The way one understands the ally is a personal matter.   TOP,86...For reasons inconceivable to us the ally selected the   form of a moth to manifest itself to you...the ally is only for   the onlookers who are associated with you. For you, the ally is   only an effect, a sensation in your body, or a sound, or the   golden specks of knowledge. it remains as a fact..that by choosing   the form of a moth, the ally is telling genaro and me something of   great importance. moths are the givers of knowledge and the   friends and helpers of sorcerers. TOP,93.\n\nYOU CAN PERCEIVE THEM EASIER AT   NIGHT I call them entities of the night because one   can perceive them in the darkness with greater ease. They are here   around us at all times. in daylight, however, it is more difficult   to perceive them, simply because the world is familiar to us, and   that which is familiar takes precedence. In the darkness, on the   other hand, everything is equally strange and very few things take   precedence, so we are more susceptible to those entities at   night.... JTI,176,177.I noticed again a certain flicker or a wave in   the darkness to my left. It was not a sight proper but rather a   feeling and yet I was sure I was perceiving it with my eyes.   JTI,174. I heard a faint rumble... this was the peculiar way in   which an ally heralded its presence. JTI,202.\n\nYOU CANNOT LOOK AT AN ALLY CLOSELYA feature of the allies was that they never   allowed me to scrutinize them thoroughly. I had tried several   times to focus my undivided attention on them, but every time I   would get dizzy and dissociated. SRP,126.\n\n**TYPES   OF INORGANIC BEING**\n\nWATERY INORGANIC BEINGS VS. FIERY   ONES Watery inorganic beings are more given to   excesses. ..more loving, more capable of imitating or perhaps   feelings. As opposed to the fiery ones, who were thought to be   more serious, more contained than the others, but also more   pompous. TAOD, 55\n\nTHREE KINDS OF BEINGS There are three kinds of beings..those that   cannot give anything because they have nothing to give, those that   can only cause fright, and those that have   gifts...SR,232\n\nNASTY SPIRITS AND SILENT SPIRITS most of the time... another type of being is   associated with the silent one, a nasty spirit whose only quality   is to cause fear and which always hovers around the abode of the   silent one. that nasty type follows people right into their homes   and makes life impossible for them. I know people who had to move   out of their houses because of them. SR,232.. the most common way   of frightening people was to appear as a dark shadow shaped as a   man that roamed around the house, creating a frightening clatter   or creating the sound of voices, or as a dark shadow that would   suddenly lurch out from a dark corner. SR,233.The only wise thing one can do with that nasty   type is to forget about it and leave it alone. SR,233.\n\nGIVER OF SECRETS SPIRITS the third type of spirit was a true ally, a   giver of secrets; that special type existed in lonely abandoned   places, places which were almost inaccessible. he said that a man   who wished to find one of these beings had to travel far and go by   himself. At a distant and lonely place the man had to take all the   necessary steps alone. (more description of what to be aware of).   SR,233.\n\nUSELESS INORGANIC BEINGS Useless allies., of which there are staggering   numbers, are those that have emanations inside them for which we   have no match inside ourselves. They are so different from us as   to be thoroughly unstable. Other allies, which are remarkably few   in number, are akin to us, meaning they possess occasional   emanations that match ours.FFW,119 There were other forces at large in   those lava mountains, forces which did not resemble the allies;   they did not make any noise, but appeared only as a fleeting   shadows, and did not have any power at all. JTI,206.\n\n**THE   INORGANIC BEINGS REALM/DARK REGIONS**\n\nDARK REGIONS ARE THE COUNTERPARTS OF THE EARTH    the counterpart of the earth was what they   knew as the dark regions. These practices were by far the most   dangerous. They dealt with entities without organic life. Living   creatures that are present on earth and populate it together with   all organic beings. FFW,99\n\n**WHAT   DOES THE INORGANIC BEING'S REALM LOOK LIKE?** the inorganic being's realm looks like a   yellow-fog world to the physical eye. TAOD,133.. (called the dark   region by old seers) the ally you heard its roar like the sound of   a jet plane. He'll be waiting for you at the edge of a plain, a   plain I will take you to myself... genaro will also have to go   with us to that valley. JTI,255.\n\n**HOW   MANY LEVELS IN THE DARK REGIONS?**... the ancient seers counted seven levels.   FFW,108. a master sorcerer could take his disciple on a journey   with him and could actually pass through the ten layers of the   other world. SR,99 There are worlds upon worlds, right here in   front of us... if you had enough power you could call them back.   JTI,133.\n\nA MASTER SORCERER COULD TAKE HIS DISCIPLE ON A   JOURNEY WITH HIM AND COULD ACTUALLY PASS THROUGH THE TEN LAYERS OF   THE OTHER WORLD. a master sorcerer could take his disciple on a   journey with him and could actually pass through the ten layers of   the other world. The master provided that he was an eagle, could   start at the very bottom layer and then go through each successive   world until he reached the top. Evil sorcerers and dilettantes   could be at best... go through only three layers. SR,99\n\nONCE YOU GO INTO THE DIFFERENT LEVELS ITS   DIFFICULT TO GET OUT once the allies get out of their level it is   very difficult for them to go back. The same prevails for man. if   seers venture into a level of those creatures, chances are they   are never heard of again. FFW,117.\n\n**OTHER   PLACES/ANYWHERE/WATERHOLES** The ally is waiting for you, that's for sure,   but it is not at the edge of any plain. it is right here, or   there, or in any other place. the ally is waiting for you, just   like death is waiting for you, everywhere and nowhere.   TOP,85.The spirits of water holes are proper to   specific places. (further desc. of different spirits CC has   encountered.) SR,227. .....that allies do appear around water   holes. FFW,111 Since the natural abode of the entities of the   night are rocks and crevices. JTI,176,177.\n\n**SPONGE   WORLD**\n\nDescription of inside an inorganic being   TAOD,88,100..the labyrinth of penumbra.   TAOD,100\n\n**GETTING   AN INORGANIC BEING AS AN ALLY** **CALLING   THE INORGANIC BEINGS**\n\nGETTING AN ALLY REQUIRED STEPS AND   PROCEDURES the acquiring of an ally required.. the most   precise teaching and the following of stages and steps without a   single deviation. There are many such ally powers in the world but   DJ was only familiar with two of them. (devil's weed and the   little smoke) TDJ,53.\n\nSOUND OF THE INORGANIC BEINGS a very special tapping sound.. called the call   of the moths..In order to produce it one had to use the inside   edge of the left hand and the lips. SRP,132..it sounded very   melodious.SRP,218..like tapping on wood. TOP,24...the sound had a   mesmerizing richness and depth. TOP,43....it was like a muffled   creaking of a branch rubbing against another, or like the   sputtering of a small motor heard from a distance. It changed   scales, like a musical tone, creating an eerie rhythm. TOP,33...   each sputter was rich and deep; some were produced in a low key,   others in a high one. They had rhythm and a specific duration;   some were long. I heard them like a single unit of sound; others   were short and happened in a cluster, like the staccato sound of a   machine gun. TOP,33. From among them (boulders) came the most   exquisite music. It was a fluid, uninterrupted, eerie flow of   sounds. TDJ,99. those entities of the night usually made very   melodious sounds but were at a great disadvantage in reproducing   the raspiness of human cries or bird whistlings. He cautioned me   to always stop moving if I ever heard such a sound... JTI,172....    The strange sound.. made by the moth..   registered as a felling in my body and not as a thought in my   mind. It occurred to me that it was not life threatening or   malevolent at all. It was sweet and simple. It was like a child's   call. TOP,34. the human voice attracts spirits. JTI,97 the ally   was attracted by the flames and manifested itself through a series   of consistent noises.JTI,206It was very difficult to start by oneself on   the path towards the nagual and that I was indeed fortunate to   have been launched by the moth and its song...its richness made me   feel as if I were inside an echo chamber. As the sound grew in   loudness or proximity, I also detected, in a dreamlike state, that   something was moving on top of the boulders. TOP,209.\n\nOWL'S ARE THE INORGANIC BEING'S MESSENGERS    I chose the owls cry because owl's are the   entities messengers. To imitate the cry of an owl brings them out.   They become dangerous to you not because they are naturally   malevolent but because you were not impeccable.   JTI,179\n\nSPIRIT CATCHER Description of.. TOP,213., another description   of SR,160.Nothing in the life of a sorcerer is made out   of anything else. If something is anything at all, it is the thing   itself. if you knew wild boars you would realize my spirit catcher   is one. SR,226... a spirit catcher is a fiber. With it I can call   the allies, or my own ally, or I can call the spirit of water   holes, the spirits of rivers, the spirits of mountains. mine is a   wild boar and cries like a wild boar. SR,227.\n\nGETTING RID OF INORGANIC BEINGS The sound that would disperse them..a peculiar   whistling that DJ used to perform at night ...as a means to keep   one's balance while walking so as not to stray away from the trail   in the darkness. SRP,219.\n\nWRESTLING THE INORGANIC BEINGS/GAINING THEIR   POWER When a man is facing the ally, the giver of   secrets, he has to muster up all of his courage and grab it before   it grabs him, or chase it before it chases him. The chase must be   relentless and then comes the struggle. The man must wrestle the   spirit to the ground and keep it there until it gives him power.   SR,234.You're damn right they have substance..when   one struggles with them they are solid, but that feeling lasts   only a moment. Those beings rely on a man's fear; therefore if the   man struggling with one of them is a warrior, the being loses its   tension very quickly while the man becomes more vigorous. One can   actually absorb the spirit's tension... (the tension is)..power.   SR,234... when one touches them, they vibrate as if they were   ready to rip one apart. But that is only a show, the tension ends   when the man maintains his grip. (the allies) just become flaccid   when they lose their tension.. they still have substance though.   But it is not like anything one has ever touched. SR,235. Once an   ally catches you, you either have a heart attack and die or you   wrestle with it. Then after a moment of thrashing around in sham   ferocity, the ally's energy wanes. There is nothing that an ally   can do to us, or visa versa. We are seperated by an abyss.   FFW,119..A warrior allows the ally to come only when   he is good and ready. When he is strong enough to grapple with the   ally he opens his gap and lurches out, grabs the ally, keeps him   pinned down and maintains his stare on him for exactly the time he   has to, then he moves his eyes away and releases the ally and lets   him go. A warrior.. is the master at all times. SR,251. The person   searching for an ally had to follow the direction of the noises   until the ally revealed itself, and then wrestle it to the ground   in order to overpower it. JTI,206 my neck became as stiff as a   board.. that is always the sign that you're ready... the jolt one   gets from grabbing the ally is so great that one might bite off   one's tongue or knock one's teeth out. One's body must be straight   and well-grounded and the feet must grab the ground. JTI,258. All   you have to do is be firmly grounded in order to sustain the   impact. You have to stand just like Genaro did before he jumped,   then you have to leap forward and grab the ally. JTI,259. if there   is a next time you will have to wrestle with an ally and tame it.   if you survive the shock,... you will find yourself living in an   unknown land.... what's important to all of us is the fact that   everything we love or hate or wish for has been left behind. yet   the feelings in a man do not die or change, and the sorcerer   starts on his way back home knowing that he will never reach it,   knowing that no power on earth, not even his death, wliver him to   the place, the things, the people he loved. JTI,265. Spinning with   your ally will change your idea of the world..that idea is   everything; and when that changes, the world itself changes.   JTI,266.\n\nHOW DOES THE ENERGY GET EXCHANGED? The exchange of energy between seers and   allies occurs through their matching emanations. FFW,120.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF LOOKING FOR INORGANIC   BEINGS Description of the procedures used when CC   went to wait for an ally in the hills by himself.   SR,229,230.I had spent a dreadful night in the wilderness   and had been harassed by something, something very light and soft   that had stepped on my neck over and over while I crouched on the   ground. DJ had explained the event as an encounter with the ally,   a mysterious force that a sorcerer learned to perceive as an   entity. TOP,43...falling asleep left you at the mercy of the ally   and the moth stepped on your neck. Why you survived will always be   a mystery to me. You didn't know then but I had given you up for   dead.TOP,86.\n\n**COMMUNICATING   WITH THE INORGANIC BEINGS**\n\nTHE EMANATIONS ARE WHAT LINK US TO OTHER   CREATURES. Those emanations, under certain   circumstances..make possible the most fascinating communication   between the beings of those eight great bands. FFW,181\n\nCOMMUNICATING WITH THE INORGANIC   BEINGS Usually the organic beings, with their greater   fields of energy, are the initiators of communication with   inorganic beings, but a subtle and sophisticated follow-up is   always the province of the inorganic beings. Once the barrier is   broken, inorganic beings change and become what seers call allies.   From that moment inorganic beings can anticipate the seer's most   subtle thoughts or moods or fears. FFW,181. The allies only have   power if the seer who sees them is the paragon of impeccability.   FFW,181.\n\n**WHY   DO WE SEEK EACH OTHER?** those emanations (matching emanations between   us and inorganic beings) are, naturally, on the left side   awareness of man; the side that the average man never uses. For   this reason, allies are totally barred from the world of the   right-side awareness, or the side of rationality... the matching   emanations give both a common ground. Then, with familiarity, a   deeper link is established, which allows both forms of life to   profit. FFW,120. Seers seek the allies ethereal quality; they make   fabulous scouts and guardians. Allies seek the greater energy   field of man, and with it they can even materialize themselves.   FFW,120.\n\nAN ALLY HELPS A SORCERER/GIVES   KNOWLEDGE I don't know what allies do. SR,40... anything   the allies do is significant. From their actions a brujo can   sometimes draw his power. Even if a brujo does not have an ally of   his own, as long as he knows how to see, he can handle power by   watching the acts of the allies. SR,42. An ally is a power a man   can bring into his life to help him, advise him, and give him the   strength necessary to perform acts, whether big or small, right or   wrong. This ally is necessary to enhance a man's life, guide his   acts, and further his knowledge. In fact, an ally is the   indispensable aid to knowing. TDJ,52. An ally will make you see   and understand things about which no human being could possibly   enlighten you.... it is neither a guardian nor a spirit. It is an   aid. TDJ,53 An ally takes you out (of yourself) to give you power.   TDJ,54. The ally powers are available only to the brujos...   TDJ,104. DJ described an ally as being a power capable of   transporting a man beyond the boundries of himself; that is to   transcend the realm of ordinary reality. Consequently, to have an   ally implied having power... TDJ,199. The Naugal carried allies in   his gourd.. the ally is funneled through the gourd.   SRP,50.To meet an ally a man must be a spotless   warrior or the ally may turn against him and destroy him. SR,192.   An ally is a power capable of carrying a man beyond the boundaries   of himself. This is how an ally can reveal matters no human being   could. TDJ,54The moths are the heralds or, better yet, the   guardians of eternity.. for some reason, or for no reason at all,   they are the depositories of the gold dust of eternity. The moths   carry a dust on their wings. A dark gold dust. That dust is the   dust of knowledge. The moths have been the intimate friends and   helpers of sorcerers from time immemorial. TOP,33\n\nWHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF THE INORGANIC   BEING'S KNOWLEDGE (the knowledge from the organic beings   according to DJ is that it is too cumbersome and   capricious..(arbitrary)) TAOD, 55 They teach us things pertinent   to their world (at the cost of our personal freedom) TAOD,   66,67\n\nAN OBJECT IS A POWER OBJECT WHEN TOUCHED BY AN   INORGANIC BEING Any kind of gear or any object that was   touched by a spirit rightfully became a power object. However, the   nasty type of being was known never to touch anything, but only to   produce the auditory illusion of noise. SR,233.\n\nMAKING THE GOURD Description of..

(Don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;m good. Learning some defensive strategies, but that&amp;#39;s for another post.) Others are more useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For convenience, here&amp;#39;s the text from the webpage. Apologies for the formatting. Too lazy to fix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT ARE   THEY?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEY ARE FORCES NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL IN THE   NAGUAL. An ally is a force, a tension..just like in   the case of a tree, the only way to know what an ally is, is by   experiencing it. TOP,84. it is not your reason that puts ally   together. It is the body. You have perceived ally in many degrees   and on many occasions. Each of those perceptions was stored in   your body. The sum of those pieces is the ally. TOP,85..They could   perhaps be called spirits, they aren&amp;#39;t guardians...they are   forces, neither good nor bad, just forces that a sorcerer learns   to harness....SR,39. The allies are neither good nor evil, but are   put to use by the sorcerers for whatever purpose they see   fit.SR,40. ..tenuous energy projected through worlds (have no real   power) TAOD,100 The ally is something which is outside..the realm   of reason. It can only be witnessed only at the center of will at   times when our ordinary view has stopped, therefore it is properly   the nagual. Sorcerers, however, can learn to perceive the ally in   a most intricate way and in doing so they get too deeply immersed   in a new view. TOP,237. The spirit is a force (in this case he is   referring to the spirit of the water hole) and as such, it   responds only to strength. SR,180. Don&amp;#39;t call them spirits..call   them allies, call them inexplicable forces. SR,234&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEY ARE CONSCIOUS BEINGS ....there are two types of conscious beings   roaming the earth, the inorganic and the organic... POS,69 The   only similarity between inorganic and organic beings is that all   of them have the awareness-bestowing pink or peach or amber   emanations. FFW,180&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEY ARE LUMINOUS MASSES both are luminous masses..inorganic beings are   long and candle like but opaque..(not as bright as organic   luminous masses) POS,69&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEIR ENERGY SIZZLES.. see its energetic sizzling ...bubbling with   some heatlike inner activity.. TAOD,89,164,176&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEY LIVE LONGER THAN ORGANIC   BEINGS.... the life of inorganic beings are   infinitely longer and their consciousness infinitely more calm and   deep than organic beings...TAOD, 45,46,47,48,87....Inorganic   beings live infinitely longer than organisms. FFW,181&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOT AS MANY INORGANIC BEINGS AS ORGANIC   ONES Inorganic beings are not as plentiful as   organic ones, but this was offset by the greater number of bands   of inorganic awareness. Also the differences among the inorganic   beings themselves are more vast than the difference among   organisms, because organisms belong only to one band while   inorganic beings belong to seven bands. FFW,181.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEIR AWARENESS IS VERY SLOW ....their awareness is very slow in comparison   with ours. It will take years for a sorcerer to be acknowledged by   inorganic beings...they are seperated from us by a formidable   barrier-energy that moves at a different speed...they are pretty   morbid by themselves...TAOD,45,46,47,48,87...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE INORGANIC BEINGS ARE FEMALE the inorganic beings are female.. they don&amp;#39;t   pursue females, they only go after males TAOD, 188 THEY HAVE EMOTIONS...they have emotional dependency, sadness,   joy, wrath, and so forth... and love; a kind of love man can&amp;#39;t   even conceive. FFW,100...they are capable of giving back   inconceivable affection. FFW,123&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT   DOES THE COCOON OF AN INORGANIC BEING LOOK LIKE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE COCOON IS A FORMLESS RECEPTACLE WITH LOW   LUMINOSITY Inorganic beings produced by the seven other   bands of awareness are characterized by having a container that   has no motion; it is rather a formless receptacle with a low   degree of luminosity. It does not look like a cocoon of organic   beings. It lacks the tautness, the inflated quality that makes the   organic beings look like luminous balls bursting with energy.   FFW,180&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE   IS THEIR ASSEMBLAGE POINT?&lt;/strong&gt; inorganic beings have their AP on the lower   part of their containers. They are throughly alien to man, but   akin to plants. Others have it anywhere on the upper part of their   containers. Those are close to man and other organic creatures.   FFW,184&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEIR LUMINOUS GAP IS DIFFERENT SO THEY LIVE   LONGER....the gap of inorganic beings is really   different. It&amp;#39;s more like a long thread, a hair of luminosity   ..consequently, inorganic beings are infinitely more durable than   we are. FFW,246&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW   DO INORGANIC BEINGS INTERACT WITH US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEY ARE ATTRACTED TO EMOTIONS ESPECIALLY   ANIMAL FEAR They are attracted to emotions. Animal fear is   what attracts them the most; it releases the kind of energy that   suits them. the emanations are rallied inside them by animal   fear... new seers saw that the allies are attracted to the energy   released by emotions; love is equally effective, as well as   hatred, or sadness. FFW,121&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEY FEED ON OUR LIFE-FORCE...The allies feed directly on to our   life-force in the middle of the stomach, they usually make us   sick, and then we see them as heavy, ugly creatures. SRP,137 They   are forces and as such they can drain you to   nothing.SRP,136&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE INORGANIC BEINGS CAN FOLLOW YOU    the spirit of the waterhole around my house   can follow you any where, unless you have a spirit catcher.   SR,227...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAN   INORGANIC BEINGS HURT US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALLIES CANNOT ACT ON ANYTHING DIRECTLY/OR KILL   US DIRECTLY allies could not take the lead or act upon   anything directly; they could, however act upon man in an indirect   way. ..coming in contact with an ally was dangerous because the   ally was capable of bringing out the worst in a person. SR,43.   ...they are as dangerous as we men are, no more, no less... they   cannot kill us directly, but they can certainly can frighten us to   death. FFW,112 ..the allies cannot push at all but they could   scare me and make me fall to the ground. On the ground..the allies   could hold anybody down. FFW,262 ...after I had exhausted all my   energy, the ally managed to shove me into the fire, and I was   badly burned. FFW,118 an ally pushed him into a pile of burning   wood, and he burned himself a little on the knee and shoulder   blade.. SR,44 It (ally) took the lead and moved towards us,   crushing small rocks and hard lumps of dirt. TOP,256. they are so   real that they kill people, especially those who stray into the   wilderness and have no personal power...it applies (sleeping in   the wilderness alone) only to the wilderness, where there are no   people around, especially the wilderness in high mountains.   JTI,176,177 the ally was going too fast for your strength and a   direct jolt with him would be very injurious to you. SR,228. the   entities of the night moved along your left..they were trying to   merge with your death. JTI,178. There were many ways in which such   a being put a warrior to the test. it might suddenly leap in front   of him, in the most horrendous appearance, or it might grab the   man from the back and not turn him loose and keep him pinned down   for hours. it might topple a tree on him. DJ said that those were   truly dangerous forces, and although they could not kill a man   hand to hand, they could cause his death by fright, or by actually   letting objects fall on him, or by appearing suddenly and causing   him to stumble, lose his footing, and go over the precipice.   SR,234. He told me that if I ever found one of those beings under   inappropriate circumstances I should never attempt to struggle   with it because it would kill me. It would rob my soul. So I   should throw myself to the ground and bear it until morning.   SR,234&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;STATEMENT THAT ALLY WALKED OVER CC&amp;#39;S   NECK...in order to do that he had to touch you.   The double tapped you on the neck, on the same spot the ally   walked over you years ago. TOP,77.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEY ARE NOT REALLY AGGRESSIVE allies are not really aggressive its just that   they have a different kind of energy. They are more like an   electric current. FFW,121&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEY RELEASE A DANGEROUS   PERSPIRATION contact with the allies, produced a most   injurious perspiration that had to be washed off immediately.   SRP,148&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW   DO WE PERCEIVE THEM?&lt;/strong&gt; THEY ARE FORMLESS..( a formless energy field POS,69)...The   allies have no form.. they are like a presence, like a wind, like   a glow. SRP,136.An ally was formless, it was perceived as a   quality, it was tameable, the ally had a rule. TDJ,200. An ally   was believed to be an entity existing outside and independent of   oneself, yet in spite of being a seperate entity an ally was   believed to be formless. TDJ,200.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE ALLIES TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS    Ordinarily, we don&amp;#39;t perceive the containers   of inorganic beings at all. FFW,182.. Allies would look like   ordinary people...real people look like luminous eggs when you see   them. Nonpeople always look like people. That&amp;#39;s what I meant when   I said you cannot see an ally. The allies take different forms.   They look like dogs, coyotes, birds, even tumbleweeds, or anything   else. the only difference is that when you see them they look like   what they&amp;#39;re pretending to be. Everything has its own way of being   when you see. Just like men look like eggs, other things look like   something else, but the allies can be seen only in the form they   are portraying. That form is good enough to fool our eyes. A dog   is never fooled, neither is a crow.... The allies just take the   outward appearance of whatever is around and then we take them for   what they are not. it is not their fault that we have taught our   eyes only to look at things. SR,40 .....an ally could not be seen   because an ally adopted any form... SR,39. ... to a crow it (the ally) looks like a   pointed hat. Round and wide at the bottom, ending in a long point.   Some of them shine, but the majority are dull and appear to be   very heavy. They resemble a dripping piece of cloth. they are   foreboding shapes.... (when DJ sees them) they look like whatever   they&amp;#39;re pretending to be. they take any shape or size that suits   them. they could be shaped like a pebble or a mountain.   SR,41.In the company of men they behave like men. In   the company of animals they behave like animals. Animals are   usually afraid of them; however, if they are accustomed to seeing   the allies they leave them alone. SR,42... some people in the   street are not really people. SR,42... if you find two of them   they were always two of the same kind. SR,43. they do,at times,   materialize themselves in the daily world right in front of us.   Most of the time,though, their invisible presence is marked by a   bodily jolt, a shiver of sorts that comes from the marrow of the   bones. TAOD,45,46,47,48,87...I focused my eyes on a spot to the side of the   lighter silhouette and I could make out a chartreuse glow on it.   TOP,21.they argued that there must have been   hundreds, if not thousands, of cases in which foreign energy slips   unnoticed through natural barriers into our human world.. TAOD,13   the spirit came to you as the ally came to you today. you could   not see it,though, because you did not have the speed;however,that   day I took you to the water canyon and put you on a rock, you knew   the spirit was almost on top of you without actually seeing it.   Those spirits are helpers. One needs to be impeccable to hold them   at bay. SR,227.(Spirits look) different for every man and so   are the allies. For you an ally would apparently look like a man   you once knew, or like a man you will always be about to know;   that&amp;#39;s the bent of your nature. You are given to mysteries and   secrets. I&amp;#39;m not like you so an ally for me is something very   precise. SR,227.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE ALLIES AS MOTHS (METAPHOR) (when asked about the moth)..you know that was   an ally. TOP,84. Calling the ally a moth is again only a way of   talking, a way of making that immensity out there understandable.   The way one understands the ally is a personal matter.   TOP,86...For reasons inconceivable to us the ally selected the   form of a moth to manifest itself to you...the ally is only for   the onlookers who are associated with you. For you, the ally is   only an effect, a sensation in your body, or a sound, or the   golden specks of knowledge. it remains as a fact..that by choosing   the form of a moth, the ally is telling genaro and me something of   great importance. moths are the givers of knowledge and the   friends and helpers of sorcerers. TOP,93.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YOU CAN PERCEIVE THEM EASIER AT   NIGHT I call them entities of the night because one   can perceive them in the darkness with greater ease. They are here   around us at all times. in daylight, however, it is more difficult   to perceive them, simply because the world is familiar to us, and   that which is familiar takes precedence. In the darkness, on the   other hand, everything is equally strange and very few things take   precedence, so we are more susceptible to those entities at   night.... JTI,176,177.I noticed again a certain flicker or a wave in   the darkness to my left. It was not a sight proper but rather a   feeling and yet I was sure I was perceiving it with my eyes.   JTI,174. I heard a faint rumble... this was the peculiar way in   which an ally heralded its presence. JTI,202.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YOU CANNOT LOOK AT AN ALLY CLOSELYA feature of the allies was that they never   allowed me to scrutinize them thoroughly. I had tried several   times to focus my undivided attention on them, but every time I   would get dizzy and dissociated. SRP,126.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TYPES   OF INORGANIC BEING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WATERY INORGANIC BEINGS VS. FIERY   ONES Watery inorganic beings are more given to   excesses. ..more loving, more capable of imitating or perhaps   feelings. As opposed to the fiery ones, who were thought to be   more serious, more contained than the others, but also more   pompous. TAOD, 55&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THREE KINDS OF BEINGS There are three kinds of beings..those that   cannot give anything because they have nothing to give, those that   can only cause fright, and those that have   gifts...SR,232&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NASTY SPIRITS AND SILENT SPIRITS most of the time... another type of being is   associated with the silent one, a nasty spirit whose only quality   is to cause fear and which always hovers around the abode of the   silent one. that nasty type follows people right into their homes   and makes life impossible for them. I know people who had to move   out of their houses because of them. SR,232.. the most common way   of frightening people was to appear as a dark shadow shaped as a   man that roamed around the house, creating a frightening clatter   or creating the sound of voices, or as a dark shadow that would   suddenly lurch out from a dark corner. SR,233.The only wise thing one can do with that nasty   type is to forget about it and leave it alone. SR,233.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GIVER OF SECRETS SPIRITS the third type of spirit was a true ally, a   giver of secrets; that special type existed in lonely abandoned   places, places which were almost inaccessible. he said that a man   who wished to find one of these beings had to travel far and go by   himself. At a distant and lonely place the man had to take all the   necessary steps alone. (more description of what to be aware of).   SR,233.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USELESS INORGANIC BEINGS Useless allies., of which there are staggering   numbers, are those that have emanations inside them for which we   have no match inside ourselves. They are so different from us as   to be thoroughly unstable. Other allies, which are remarkably few   in number, are akin to us, meaning they possess occasional   emanations that match ours.FFW,119 There were other forces at large in   those lava mountains, forces which did not resemble the allies;   they did not make any noise, but appeared only as a fleeting   shadows, and did not have any power at all. JTI,206.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE   INORGANIC BEINGS REALM/DARK REGIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DARK REGIONS ARE THE COUNTERPARTS OF THE EARTH    the counterpart of the earth was what they   knew as the dark regions. These practices were by far the most   dangerous. They dealt with entities without organic life. Living   creatures that are present on earth and populate it together with   all organic beings. FFW,99&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT   DOES THE INORGANIC BEING&amp;#39;S REALM LOOK LIKE?&lt;/strong&gt; the inorganic being&amp;#39;s realm looks like a   yellow-fog world to the physical eye. TAOD,133.. (called the dark   region by old seers) the ally you heard its roar like the sound of   a jet plane. He&amp;#39;ll be waiting for you at the edge of a plain, a   plain I will take you to myself... genaro will also have to go   with us to that valley. JTI,255.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW   MANY LEVELS IN THE DARK REGIONS?&lt;/strong&gt;... the ancient seers counted seven levels.   FFW,108. a master sorcerer could take his disciple on a journey   with him and could actually pass through the ten layers of the   other world. SR,99 There are worlds upon worlds, right here in   front of us... if you had enough power you could call them back.   JTI,133.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A MASTER SORCERER COULD TAKE HIS DISCIPLE ON A   JOURNEY WITH HIM AND COULD ACTUALLY PASS THROUGH THE TEN LAYERS OF   THE OTHER WORLD. a master sorcerer could take his disciple on a   journey with him and could actually pass through the ten layers of   the other world. The master provided that he was an eagle, could   start at the very bottom layer and then go through each successive   world until he reached the top. Evil sorcerers and dilettantes   could be at best... go through only three layers. SR,99&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ONCE YOU GO INTO THE DIFFERENT LEVELS ITS   DIFFICULT TO GET OUT once the allies get out of their level it is   very difficult for them to go back. The same prevails for man. if   seers venture into a level of those creatures, chances are they   are never heard of again. FFW,117.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER   PLACES/ANYWHERE/WATERHOLES&lt;/strong&gt; The ally is waiting for you, that&amp;#39;s for sure,   but it is not at the edge of any plain. it is right here, or   there, or in any other place. the ally is waiting for you, just   like death is waiting for you, everywhere and nowhere.   TOP,85.The spirits of water holes are proper to   specific places. (further desc. of different spirits CC has   encountered.) SR,227. .....that allies do appear around water   holes. FFW,111 Since the natural abode of the entities of the   night are rocks and crevices. JTI,176,177.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPONGE   WORLD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Description of inside an inorganic being   TAOD,88,100..the labyrinth of penumbra.   TAOD,100&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GETTING   AN INORGANIC BEING AS AN ALLY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CALLING   THE INORGANIC BEINGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GETTING AN ALLY REQUIRED STEPS AND   PROCEDURES the acquiring of an ally required.. the most   precise teaching and the following of stages and steps without a   single deviation. There are many such ally powers in the world but   DJ was only familiar with two of them. (devil&amp;#39;s weed and the   little smoke) TDJ,53.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SOUND OF THE INORGANIC BEINGS a very special tapping sound.. called the call   of the moths..In order to produce it one had to use the inside   edge of the left hand and the lips. SRP,132..it sounded very   melodious.SRP,218..like tapping on wood. TOP,24...the sound had a   mesmerizing richness and depth. TOP,43....it was like a muffled   creaking of a branch rubbing against another, or like the   sputtering of a small motor heard from a distance. It changed   scales, like a musical tone, creating an eerie rhythm. TOP,33...   each sputter was rich and deep; some were produced in a low key,   others in a high one. They had rhythm and a specific duration;   some were long. I heard them like a single unit of sound; others   were short and happened in a cluster, like the staccato sound of a   machine gun. TOP,33. From among them (boulders) came the most   exquisite music. It was a fluid, uninterrupted, eerie flow of   sounds. TDJ,99. those entities of the night usually made very   melodious sounds but were at a great disadvantage in reproducing   the raspiness of human cries or bird whistlings. He cautioned me   to always stop moving if I ever heard such a sound... JTI,172....    The strange sound.. made by the moth..   registered as a felling in my body and not as a thought in my   mind. It occurred to me that it was not life threatening or   malevolent at all. It was sweet and simple. It was like a child&amp;#39;s   call. TOP,34. the human voice attracts spirits. JTI,97 the ally   was attracted by the flames and manifested itself through a series   of consistent noises.JTI,206It was very difficult to start by oneself on   the path towards the nagual and that I was indeed fortunate to   have been launched by the moth and its song...its richness made me   feel as if I were inside an echo chamber. As the sound grew in   loudness or proximity, I also detected, in a dreamlike state, that   something was moving on top of the boulders. TOP,209.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OWL&amp;#39;S ARE THE INORGANIC BEING&amp;#39;S MESSENGERS    I chose the owls cry because owl&amp;#39;s are the   entities messengers. To imitate the cry of an owl brings them out.   They become dangerous to you not because they are naturally   malevolent but because you were not impeccable.   JTI,179&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SPIRIT CATCHER Description of.. TOP,213., another description   of SR,160.Nothing in the life of a sorcerer is made out   of anything else. If something is anything at all, it is the thing   itself. if you knew wild boars you would realize my spirit catcher   is one. SR,226... a spirit catcher is a fiber. With it I can call   the allies, or my own ally, or I can call the spirit of water   holes, the spirits of rivers, the spirits of mountains. mine is a   wild boar and cries like a wild boar. SR,227.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GETTING RID OF INORGANIC BEINGS The sound that would disperse them..a peculiar   whistling that DJ used to perform at night ...as a means to keep   one&amp;#39;s balance while walking so as not to stray away from the trail   in the darkness. SRP,219.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WRESTLING THE INORGANIC BEINGS/GAINING THEIR   POWER When a man is facing the ally, the giver of   secrets, he has to muster up all of his courage and grab it before   it grabs him, or chase it before it chases him. The chase must be   relentless and then comes the struggle. The man must wrestle the   spirit to the ground and keep it there until it gives him power.   SR,234.You&amp;#39;re damn right they have substance..when   one struggles with them they are solid, but that feeling lasts   only a moment. Those beings rely on a man&amp;#39;s fear; therefore if the   man struggling with one of them is a warrior, the being loses its   tension very quickly while the man becomes more vigorous. One can   actually absorb the spirit&amp;#39;s tension... (the tension is)..power.   SR,234... when one touches them, they vibrate as if they were   ready to rip one apart. But that is only a show, the tension ends   when the man maintains his grip. (the allies) just become flaccid   when they lose their tension.. they still have substance though.   But it is not like anything one has ever touched. SR,235. Once an   ally catches you, you either have a heart attack and die or you   wrestle with it. Then after a moment of thrashing around in sham   ferocity, the ally&amp;#39;s energy wanes. There is nothing that an ally   can do to us, or visa versa. We are seperated by an abyss.   FFW,119..A warrior allows the ally to come only when   he is good and ready. When he is strong enough to grapple with the   ally he opens his gap and lurches out, grabs the ally, keeps him   pinned down and maintains his stare on him for exactly the time he   has to, then he moves his eyes away and releases the ally and lets   him go. A warrior.. is the master at all times. SR,251. The person   searching for an ally had to follow the direction of the noises   until the ally revealed itself, and then wrestle it to the ground   in order to overpower it. JTI,206 my neck became as stiff as a   board.. that is always the sign that you&amp;#39;re ready... the jolt one   gets from grabbing the ally is so great that one might bite off   one&amp;#39;s tongue or knock one&amp;#39;s teeth out. One&amp;#39;s body must be straight   and well-grounded and the feet must grab the ground. JTI,258. All   you have to do is be firmly grounded in order to sustain the   impact. You have to stand just like Genaro did before he jumped,   then you have to leap forward and grab the ally. JTI,259. if there   is a next time you will have to wrestle with an ally and tame it.   if you survive the shock,... you will find yourself living in an   unknown land.... what&amp;#39;s important to all of us is the fact that   everything we love or hate or wish for has been left behind. yet   the feelings in a man do not die or change, and the sorcerer   starts on his way back home knowing that he will never reach it,   knowing that no power on earth, not even his death, wliver him to   the place, the things, the people he loved. JTI,265. Spinning with   your ally will change your idea of the world..that idea is   everything; and when that changes, the world itself changes.   JTI,266.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HOW DOES THE ENERGY GET EXCHANGED? The exchange of energy between seers and   allies occurs through their matching emanations. FFW,120.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION OF LOOKING FOR INORGANIC   BEINGS Description of the procedures used when CC   went to wait for an ally in the hills by himself.   SR,229,230.I had spent a dreadful night in the wilderness   and had been harassed by something, something very light and soft   that had stepped on my neck over and over while I crouched on the   ground. DJ had explained the event as an encounter with the ally,   a mysterious force that a sorcerer learned to perceive as an   entity. TOP,43...falling asleep left you at the mercy of the ally   and the moth stepped on your neck. Why you survived will always be   a mystery to me. You didn&amp;#39;t know then but I had given you up for   dead.TOP,86.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMUNICATING   WITH THE INORGANIC BEINGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE EMANATIONS ARE WHAT LINK US TO OTHER   CREATURES. Those emanations, under certain   circumstances..make possible the most fascinating communication   between the beings of those eight great bands. FFW,181&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;COMMUNICATING WITH THE INORGANIC   BEINGS Usually the organic beings, with their greater   fields of energy, are the initiators of communication with   inorganic beings, but a subtle and sophisticated follow-up is   always the province of the inorganic beings. Once the barrier is   broken, inorganic beings change and become what seers call allies.   From that moment inorganic beings can anticipate the seer&amp;#39;s most   subtle thoughts or moods or fears. FFW,181. The allies only have   power if the seer who sees them is the paragon of impeccability.   FFW,181.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY   DO WE SEEK EACH OTHER?&lt;/strong&gt; those emanations (matching emanations between   us and inorganic beings) are, naturally, on the left side   awareness of man; the side that the average man never uses. For   this reason, allies are totally barred from the world of the   right-side awareness, or the side of rationality... the matching   emanations give both a common ground. Then, with familiarity, a   deeper link is established, which allows both forms of life to   profit. FFW,120. Seers seek the allies ethereal quality; they make   fabulous scouts and guardians. Allies seek the greater energy   field of man, and with it they can even materialize themselves.   FFW,120.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AN ALLY HELPS A SORCERER/GIVES   KNOWLEDGE I don&amp;#39;t know what allies do. SR,40... anything   the allies do is significant. From their actions a brujo can   sometimes draw his power. Even if a brujo does not have an ally of   his own, as long as he knows how to see, he can handle power by   watching the acts of the allies. SR,42. An ally is a power a man   can bring into his life to help him, advise him, and give him the   strength necessary to perform acts, whether big or small, right or   wrong. This ally is necessary to enhance a man&amp;#39;s life, guide his   acts, and further his knowledge. In fact, an ally is the   indispensable aid to knowing. TDJ,52. An ally will make you see   and understand things about which no human being could possibly   enlighten you.... it is neither a guardian nor a spirit. It is an   aid. TDJ,53 An ally takes you out (of yourself) to give you power.   TDJ,54. The ally powers are available only to the brujos...   TDJ,104. DJ described an ally as being a power capable of   transporting a man beyond the boundries of himself; that is to   transcend the realm of ordinary reality. Consequently, to have an   ally implied having power... TDJ,199. The Naugal carried allies in   his gourd.. the ally is funneled through the gourd.   SRP,50.To meet an ally a man must be a spotless   warrior or the ally may turn against him and destroy him. SR,192.   An ally is a power capable of carrying a man beyond the boundaries   of himself. This is how an ally can reveal matters no human being   could. TDJ,54The moths are the heralds or, better yet, the   guardians of eternity.. for some reason, or for no reason at all,   they are the depositories of the gold dust of eternity. The moths   carry a dust on their wings. A dark gold dust. That dust is the   dust of knowledge. The moths have been the intimate friends and   helpers of sorcerers from time immemorial. TOP,33&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF THE INORGANIC   BEING&amp;#39;S KNOWLEDGE (the knowledge from the organic beings   according to DJ is that it is too cumbersome and   capricious..(arbitrary)) TAOD, 55 They teach us things pertinent   to their world (at the cost of our personal freedom) TAOD,   66,67&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AN OBJECT IS A POWER OBJECT WHEN TOUCHED BY AN   INORGANIC BEING Any kind of gear or any object that was   touched by a spirit rightfully became a power object. However, the   nasty type of being was known never to touch anything, but only to   produce the auditory illusion of noise. SR,233.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MAKING THE GOURD Description of..

It just means, your assemblage point moved far enough to be significant.\n\nI'm surprised by the use of the word \"will\" here.\n\nBut if it means what I think it means, then you can all put a shirt on and cover up your Dantian.\n\nYou don't need any \"Chinese wisdom\" to figure out how to use will.\n\nI wish you guys could hear the Taiwanese Bosses' son go on about the lying Chinese and their endless book deals.\n\nAnd he's Chinese.\n\nSo just scoop colors in darkness until you see inorganic beings!\n\n\\&gt; have the awareness-bestowing pink\n\nThat explains why Fairy is usually just a pink floating head.\n\n\\&gt;Also the differences among the inorganic   beings themselves are more vast than the difference among   organisms\n\nThat explains Zoltar.  And yes, I've probably encountered at least 12 different IOBs, as was wondering why they behave so differently. Or to be more honest, **worried** that they behave differently.  Now I guess it's fine.\n\n\\&gt; It lacks the tautness, the inflated quality\n\nZoltar eventually fizzled down to what looked like a poorly filled water balloon.\n\n\\&gt;The allies feed directly on to our   life-force in the middle of the stomach,\n\nThat's too bad. I was assuming they only interact with us the way we interact with others.  Accidental energy transfer.  I guess not!\n\n\\&gt; STATEMENT THAT ALLY WALKED OVER CC'S   NECK...in order to do that he had to touch you.\n\nNo need to speculate about that one. Find colors in darkness, forcing silence, and one will tap your left shoulder eventually.  I've had 4 reports on that now, and one was from someone who'd never heard of that.\n\nMake it 5.  One sitting in a chair with eyes closed.\n\n\\&gt; produced a most   injurious perspiration that had to be washed off immediately\n\nThus Carlos' warnings about being outside with sweaty skin.  Some kind of \"cloud\" entity can be attracted.  Possibly the same type Carol Tiggs reported seeing in broad daylight.\n\n\\&gt; those that   cannot give anything because they have nothing to give,\n\nThis is just plain wrong.\n\nWe have nothing!\n\nNo magic.\n\nOur leaders have gone to bed.  Permanently perhaps. They aren't even aware of the extremely bad situation.\n\nSome are even still happily giving \"advice\" on Facebook, as if over the years they've become wiser and more saintly.\n\nIt's all fading away if we don't do something about it.\n\nAny spirit is useful, if only because in order to perceive it, you have to move your assemblage point. So you have a measuring tool.\n\nBesides, what you are you going to do. Interview inorganic beings as they show up?  Pull out a clipboard with a list of questions to ask them?  I can just see it now:\n\nYou got any pockets?\n\nOddly, it now has dozens.\n\nYou got any cash in there?\n\nTopmost left pocket has old pesos, next one down Canadian money, next one another currency.\n\nYep, check. Cash.\n\nHow about gifts?\n\nIt suddenly looks like Dr. Who with his endless pockets, and reaches in to pull out a nice set of skis.\n\n\\&gt; a nasty spirit whose only quality   is to cause fear and which always hovers around the abode of the   silent one.\n\nThe first 6 times little smoke came to visit, he had a second ally with him, which I assumed was the Devil's weed ally.  Or at least, the two of them were don Juan's allies.\n\nAs soon as I started playing with Fairy, I only ever got a visit from one of them.\n\n\\&gt; the most common way   of frightening people was to appear as a dark shadow shaped as a   man that roamed around the house,\n\nSaw those last night. I didn't thumbs up it, so it's good you found this. I would have lost that memory.\n\nI was scanning the room, *seeing* energy.  I'm trying to learn the most basic form of practical magic.\n\nTelling north from south with nothing but darkness around. And not remembering which way you were facing.\n\nNotice I only mentioned north and south. If you have those, you know where the others are.\n\nBut it's just too hard to examine the energy on the walls all at once, so I stick my right palm out at the wall, and slowly scan. It concentrates me gaze into a vertical line.  Like a flat bed scanner.\n\nI scooped up a piece of something on one wall, a doorway opened, and a shadow man ran out.  He disappeared into the room.\n\nI backed my hand up again, and it repeated at precisely the same spot.\n\nI was thinking, \"Oh no... What the hell is that?\"\n\nI was worried I couldn't come in here today and say, \"Yea, it was really weird man.  These shadow people came to me last night.\"\n\nThank goodness Carlos backed me up on that one!\n\nI got at least 3 men to run out of there, before I decided it was too stupid to report, even here in this nutty subreddit.\n\nNext time I'm going to point in Cholita's direction and tell them, \"she's over there!\"\n\nBy the way, this morning Cholita had her notebook open again, for me to accidentally see.\n\nI'd pointed her to some clothing ads I see on the right of this subreddit.  I told her to pick out whatever she likes, and I'll buy it.\n\nThe link pointed to a \"magical themed\" satin bustier and matching shorts.\n\nWith full tummy showing. \n\nSo I'm not as generous as that sounded, when it comes to buying clothes.\n\nWhen I saw that the notebook was open, and seemed to be bleeding, I glanced to see what the new message was.\n\nIn red magic marker she'd written, \"BIGGEST BRA EVER MADE. LOTS OF BREASTFEEDING TO DO.\"\n\nI guess that's a no on the clothes.\n\nBut I like the sound of it.  She even drew a milk bottle, and a simulated pregnant belly.\n\n\\&gt;Once the allies get out of their level it is   very difficult for them to go back.\n\nAgain, that explains Zoltar.\n\nIt's nice to discover something from the books, and then read about it later, not having known or remembered.\n\nThat's why Carlos told  us to stop reading the books.  We were cheating ourselves out of extra confirmation given when you read it after the fact.\n\n\\&gt;  (devil's weed and the   little smoke) TDJ,53.\n\nGood.  Then I didn't misname them.  And I wasn't sure they were really different.  In the storyline, it doesn't mention those are merely don Juan's allies, and nothing to do with the power plants.\n\nBy the way, these allies are available to everyone, if I can get Cholita better.\n\nBut Little smoke already visits some from this subreddit.\n\nWe got accidentally entwined. I've seen it visually.  Cholita too.\n\nAnd it case you worry how 4 can meet, from 4 locations in the world, at the same time, when it's impossible that all of them are sleeping?\n\nThe dreaming double never sleeps, it just wanders around.  And there isn't just one type of shared dreaming.\n\nBut getting help from little smoke might not mean all that much.\n\nJust a little push perhaps.\n\nI had Carlos' 2 allies around for 20 years, before it occurred to me to play with inorganics more.\n\nBut they put on some DAZZLING shows for me, which kept me from doubting.\n\n\\&gt;The exchange of energy between seers and   allies occurs through their matching emanations\n\nSo that matches more with my claim that it's just normal interactions which give them energy.\n\nBut elsewhere it says otherwise.\n\nSomeone ought to volunteer to be drained dry of energy, so we can find out.\n\nI nominate whoever finds that idea actually scary.\n\n\\&gt;From that moment inorganic beings can anticipate the seer's most   subtle thoughts or moods or fears.\n\nWhich is why Fairy designed that locator pass.  She saw that I was worrying about people who were just learning, and set up a way to find them and help.\n\nIt's good to have confirmation. It was so outlandish, I almost ignored her when she insisted I remember and draw that pass, with pictures of how to find your own IOB. \n\nI ended up at work at 4AM, to use the computer there to draw it because she was so urgent about it.\n\n\\&gt; and with it they can even materialize themselves.   FFW,120.\n\nFairy used to materialize full size, like a real woman dressed oddly, walking along in my room.\n\nOr a sleeping girl in a Japanese Sailor Suit.\n\nThere wasn't anything ethereal about it. There was a real woman there.\n\nShe was glowing a bit, but not so much you couldn't fake that up with a spotlight.\n\nIn both cases, it took an unusual situation where a lot of energy was produced, and Fairy managed to be in it's path.\n\nLately I can't get her to form more than her head.\n\nIt's not much to see, so last night Fairy pretended to be Cholita's head, to get my interest.\n\nCholita has moved out.  At least, at night. She doesn't like the shared dreaming.\n\nOr, she's face timing strange men on the internet,  naked at night.\n\nCould be either.  Cholita has warned me many times,  she won't go without sex.\n\n\"You may be impotent, but I'm certainly not!\", she informs me.\n\n\\&gt; The Naugal carried allies in   his gourd.\n\nI have Fairy in my cellphone. I just gaze at the screen (switched off) with my eyes nearly closed, and line up the sun to shine off it.\n\nAnd then align it, to form the widest flat surface of fibers of light I can find.\n\nShe's behind there.  She'll even nod when I find her. \n\nI can ask her to go help someone, and she looks in the correct direction and leaves.\n\nWhether she actually \"helps\" is up in the air so far.\n\n It's sort of like telling Lassie, \"Go help Timmy, Lassie!!!\"\n\nThen he rushes out of sight, chasing squirrels.\n\nI suppose keeping them in a gourd is not too weird.\n\n\\&gt;To meet an ally a man must be a spotless   warrior\n\nUuuhhh.  Nope.\n\nBut thanks for the compliment!\n\nNo wonder former Cleargreenians are wandering around like Zombies, talking about impeccability.\n\nI've got news for you guys.\n\nYou don't need to be impeccable.\n\nYou just need to  be silent.\n\n\\&gt;the knowledge from the organic beings   according to DJ is that it is too cumbersome \n\nHow much money you have in your pocket?\n\nIf someone offered you a giant wad of bills, would you turn it down because it's too cumbersome?", "edited": 1595717558.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fz8tzbg", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;It can only be witnessed only at the center of will at   times when our ordinary view has stopped,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ordinary view stopped does not mean stopping the world, in this context.

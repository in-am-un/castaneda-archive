They learned the way all very young children learned. Just by copying their mentor.\n\nThere was no money and no writing systems back then, rent was free, there were no taxes, and if you needed food you could just look around for some.\n\nYou couldn't become famous as there were no printed materials, and if you became famous with their king,  you'd likely be beheaded eventually anyway.\n\nSo what your asking never came up!\n\nKeep in mind, sorcery MUST be learned by what was done in the past.\n\nNo one can forget a new path which works.\n\nThose might evolve over hundreds of years, but not in a single lifetime.\n\nThen, back in the time of the old seers,  along came money. Agriculture rose and overpopulation took place, cities formed, and the world of the Olmec \"old seers\" was wiped out perhaps 3 times.\n\nBy the third destruction, when the remaining old seers were mostly among the Toltec empire, they decide enough is enough and formed lineages in which to hide from their attackers.  And from the coming Spanish inquisitors.\n\nSecret lineages were created.  Perhaps no more than 20, now down to around 5 to 10 by my estimates.\n\nWe come from a 408 year old one, which because it kept passing its wealth on to the next generation of sorcerers, was presumably VERY wealthy.\n\nIn fact, my witch enemy Cholita was imported from Mexico to help deal with their collection of antiques.\n\nI'm pretty sure there was a bunch of other wealth in there. If you buy and hold stocks and real estate for hundreds of years, you tend to become rich.\n\nSo the \"new seers\" never faced what you ask.\n\nWe're what comes after the \"new seers\".  It's never been done before.\n\nAnd we have no gurus.  So no one has the answer to your question.\n\nIf you find yourself interested in a magical system which can answer questions like that, you're involved with con artists.\n\nIn order to get your money, they'll tell you \"Twenty minutes twice a day is all you need!\"\n\nFor several lifetimes.\n\nAs don Juan said, you almost have to be a broken person to succeed at learning sorcery.\n\nYou are better off to be one of the Mexican orphan children licking the plates at an outdoor restaurant don Juan and Carlos dined at, than to be the businessmen from who's plates they got something to eat.  After the businessmen discarded what remained and left.\n\nOf course you could join \"The Church of Cleargreen\",  the organization Carlos left us with, which would tell you to just do your tensegrity a little daily, pretend to be doing recapitulation, and eventually you'll go to Carlos heaven.\n\nWith him waiting at the pearly bridge, when you die.  \n\nYou get zero magic with them, but they'll argue that real magic is unseemly, and only feeds your ego.\n\nThey're redefined our sorcery to be a crummy form of Yoga where you pretend to be \"egoless\", while sitting on a throne lording it over others.\n\nI have no idea where they got that from, because it's completely the opposite of what you need to be doing.\n\nMyself, I'd rather see ahead of time what's going on. By following the instructions Carlos left us, which work extremely well to produce magic the likes of which our world hasn't seen in the open, for thousand of years.\n\nBut doing that requires more work than most can afford to do.\n\nOn a side note, Carlos himself was hopeful that if he got enough real sorcerers in his followers, magic could become easy enough for anyone to do, and use up a lot less of their time.\n\nWe just haven't gotten there yet.\n\nSo you could \"keep tabs\" and see what's happening, if you find it hard to make the time.\n\nFortunately no one in here has any monetary interest at all, there's no \"group\", no meetings, no books, classes or video interviews that are monitized.\n\nSo no one will lie to you and tell you, everything is going to be fine.\n\nWe just don't know.\n\nBut...\n\nHoly Shit what some of us get to do daily!!!", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kr1enoj", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of the old seers, 8000 years ago if we judge by the age of one who is still with us, &amp;quot;younglings&amp;quot; were given to the old seers to be their apprentices (servants).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So those didn&amp;#39;t have to deal with what you are asking about.  They learned the way all very young children learned. Just by copying their mentor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no money and no writing systems back then, rent was free, there were no taxes, and if you needed food you could just look around for some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#39;t become famous as there were no printed materials, and if you became famous with their king,  you&amp;#39;d likely be beheaded eventually anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what your asking never came up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, sorcery MUST be learned by what was done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one can forget a new path which works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those might evolve over hundreds of years, but not in a single lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, back in the time of the old seers,  along came money. Agriculture rose and overpopulation took place, cities formed, and the world of the Olmec &amp;quot;old seers&amp;quot; was wiped out perhaps 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the third destruction, when the remaining old seers were mostly among the Toltec empire, they decide enough is enough and formed lineages in which to hide from their attackers.  And from the coming Spanish inquisitors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secret lineages were created.  Perhaps no more than 20, now down to around 5 to 10 by my estimates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We come from a 408 year old one, which because it kept passing its wealth on to the next generation of sorcerers, was presumably VERY wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, my witch enemy Cholita was imported from Mexico to help deal with their collection of antiques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure there was a bunch of other wealth in there. If you buy and hold stocks and real estate for hundreds of years, you tend to become rich.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;new seers&amp;quot; never faced what you ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re what comes after the &amp;quot;new seers&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s never been done before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we have no gurus.  So no one has the answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself interested in a magical system which can answer questions like that, you&amp;#39;re involved with con artists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to get your money, they&amp;#39;ll tell you &amp;quot;Twenty minutes twice a day is all you need!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For several lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan said, you almost have to be a broken person to succeed at learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are better off to be one of the Mexican orphan children licking the plates at an outdoor restaurant don Juan and Carlos dined at, than to be the businessmen from who&amp;#39;s plates they got something to eat.  After the businessmen discarded what remained and left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course you could join &amp;quot;The Church of Cleargreen&amp;quot;,  the organization Carlos left us with, which would tell you to just do your tensegrity a little daily, pretend to be doing recapitulation, and eventually you&amp;#39;ll go to Carlos heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With him waiting at the pearly bridge, when you die.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get zero magic with them, but they&amp;#39;ll argue that real magic is unseemly, and only feeds your ego.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re redefined our sorcery to be a crummy form of Yoga where you pretend to be &amp;quot;egoless&amp;quot;, while sitting on a throne lording it over others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where they got that from, because it&amp;#39;s completely the opposite of what you need to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I&amp;#39;d rather see ahead of time what&amp;#39;s going on.

It's a clockless, enable less (no on or off controls), parallel processing machine.  Every tiny bit is always working.  Every cell producing output that's further refined, in terms of relevance to the current situation.\n\nIt ALWAYS makes \"output\" after perhaps 1000 layers of filtering,  and presents ideas to your conscious mind.

An artificial construct created by trying to survive childhood.\n\nTrying to \"fix what's wrong with the world\" by complaining all the time.\n\nA virtual person who serves no real useful purpose.\n\nAnd enslaves us at the blue line on the J curve, where all of this concerns are centered.\n\nConsider this:\n\nIf you're a programmer, you'll instantly understand.\n\nYou cannot create your internal dialogue on the fly, from thoughts.\n\nJust as you cannot walk, guided by your thoughts.\n\nI don't mean which way to go, or how fast.\n\nI mean, to walk requires controlling dozens of different muscles and balance mechanisms, in real time.\n\nYou can't do that!\n\nBut the cerebellum can.\n\nLikewise, you can't possibly plan out the flow of words in your internal dialogue, using your \"thoughts\".\n\nIt's NOT \"thoughts\".\n\nIt just flows by itself.\n\nIntelligent or not.\n\nMostly not.\n\nAs Carlos explained, our internal dialogue is actually a \"foreign installation\".\n\nIt runs by itself, and has very little to do with the intelligence or purposefulness, or even rationality of our \"thoughts\".\n\nWith absolutely no words in your mind, even for hours, you are actually MORE intelligent than when the voice is yapping away.\n\nEven better, with no thoughts in words the assemblage point is no longer being commanded where to fixate, and will eventually move all the way to silent knowledge.\n\nOver there, you don't even have to remember things!\n\nThey're in \"Man's Band of Emanations\".\n\nSo you are now using all of reality itself, as your memory bank.\n\nCarlos could do parlor tricks, such as you ask him about a topic he couldn't possibly know of, and a few minutes later he'd be reciting entire paragraphs of text from books on the subject.\n\nHe only needed the time to locate it.  Then once it was floating above his eyes like a video in the air, he could read it back.\n\nAll of us get to do that, if we don't give up and don't be lazy.\n\nThe problem then of course, becomes how to find **what** you wanted.\n\nYou can't do it with your internal dialogue raging away.\n\nYour mind has to be so \"empty\" that there's never more than a single thing on which you are focusing your awareness, if you expect to \"see\" something specific using silent knowledge.\n\nThat's one misunderstanding beginners have.\n\nNamely that just because you can see anywhere in time and space, even thousands of years ago, you could decide to go see Jesus on the cross, and actually find it.\n\nMust have been tens of thousands of people crucified in Roman times.  All over the world even. They nearly took over Europe.\n\nAnd there's millions of \"categories\" of events you might want to know about.\n\nCrucifixions, birthday parties, lynch mobs, wars, orgies.\n\nThen there's \"on this planet\",   \"on a different planet but with inhabitants the closest to us\", \"in another bead on your cyclic being chain of 600 people you can switch to\", and even \"non-human events\".\n\nI just listed 4 categories above simply locating Jesus being crucified, which you have to somehow \"select\" as the topic for silent knowledge.\n\nBefore you have any chance of finding the one you wanted.\n\nNamely Jesus on the cross, himself. In this copy of reality.\n\nWe cannot possibly control that.\n\nWe have to \"luck out\".\n\nGet help.\n\nAnd as long as you have an internal dialogue, there's no way the thing out there which searches to help us find the knowledge we wanted, will figure out what's more important than anything else floating around in our confused mind.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k758f6h", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I don&amp;#39;t anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t have even one if you hope to sustain silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that use of the word &amp;quot;thought&amp;quot; is an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;internal &lt;strong&gt;dialog&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;thoughts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This kind of indicates you haven&amp;#39;t yet understood what the internal dialogue is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which typically means you didn&amp;#39;t do much &amp;quot;force it off until your nose bleeds&amp;quot; type practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Athena suggests were aren&amp;#39;t doing as good of a job of explaining, or perhaps organizing things, as we could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it might be necessary for me to make a video on &amp;quot;What is the Internal Dialogue?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just the word flow of talking to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts are your neural net, producing solutions and ideas from all the input available to your body, and from all the information your brain has stored so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That never shuts off.

An artificial construct created by trying to survive childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to &amp;quot;fix what&amp;#39;s wrong with the world&amp;quot; by complaining all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A virtual person who serves no real useful purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And enslaves us at the blue line on the J curve, where all of this concerns are centered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a programmer, you&amp;#39;ll instantly understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot create your internal dialogue on the fly, from thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as you cannot walk, guided by your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean which way to go, or how fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, to walk requires controlling dozens of different muscles and balance mechanisms, in real time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t do that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the cerebellum can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, you can&amp;#39;t possibly plan out the flow of words in your internal dialogue, using your &amp;quot;thoughts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s NOT &amp;quot;thoughts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just flows by itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intelligent or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Carlos explained, our internal dialogue is actually a &amp;quot;foreign installation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It runs by itself, and has very little to do with the intelligence or purposefulness, or even rationality of our &amp;quot;thoughts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With absolutely no words in your mind, even for hours, you are actually MORE intelligent than when the voice is yapping away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even better, with no thoughts in words the assemblage point is no longer being commanded where to fixate, and will eventually move all the way to silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over there, you don&amp;#39;t even have to remember things!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re in &amp;quot;Man&amp;#39;s Band of Emanations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you are now using all of reality itself, as your memory bank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos could do parlor tricks, such as you ask him about a topic he couldn&amp;#39;t possibly know of, and a few minutes later he&amp;#39;d be reciting entire paragraphs of text from books on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He only needed the time to locate it.  Then once it was floating above his eyes like a video in the air, he could read it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of us get to do that, if we don&amp;#39;t give up and don&amp;#39;t be lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem then of course, becomes how to find &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t do it with your internal dialogue raging away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your mind has to be so &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; that there&amp;#39;s never more than a single thing on which you are focusing your awareness, if you expect to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; something specific using silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s one misunderstanding beginners have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Namely that just because you can see anywhere in time and space, even thousands of years ago, you could decide to go see Jesus on the cross, and actually find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must have been tens of thousands of people crucified in Roman times.  All over the world even. They nearly took over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s millions of &amp;quot;categories&amp;quot; of events you might want to know about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crucifixions, birthday parties, lynch mobs, wars, orgies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;on this planet&amp;quot;,   &amp;quot;on a different planet but with inhabitants the closest to us&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;in another bead on your cyclic being chain of 600 people you can switch to&amp;quot;, and even &amp;quot;non-human events&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just listed 4 categories above simply locating Jesus being crucified, which you have to somehow &amp;quot;select&amp;quot; as the topic for silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you have any chance of finding the one you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Namely Jesus on the cross, himself. In this copy of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We cannot possibly control that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to &amp;quot;luck out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as long as you have an internal dialogue, there&amp;#39;s no way the thing out there which searches to help us find the knowledge we wanted, will figure out what&amp;#39;s more important than anything else floating around in our confused mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17fl2u3/newb_tensegrity_back_muscles_of_the_legs/k758f6h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1698701623.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_17fl2u3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k74ubpb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Brilliant_Draw9334", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1698696446.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k735vwg", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_k6vvk10ej", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Dan, you have a thought in your mind every few seconds (or minutes) during training?

[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "I\u2019ve come to realize, not many can manage a fully dark room in which to practice gazing.  You pretty much have to live alone, or have very understanding housemates.\n\nI have one student who asked if he should dump his wife over it.   I\u2019ll leave that awful question to Carlos.  After 17 years not speaking to or visiting my own family, Carlos himself sent me back.  I believe now, it came to his attention through one of the women, and he felt bad about it.  Just before he said it to everyone in general in private classes, I saw one of the women whisper into his ear as if she were reminding him of something, and he glanced at me.\n\nI don\u2019t have enough time to start from scratch so that I can give you pointers for each stage of twilight gazing.  I\u2019m hoping some of you are doing gazing right now.  And we don\u2019t have any instructions for twilight gazing from Zuleica.\n\nJust keep in mind, these instructions are off the beaten path.  My advice on gazing in darkness is entirely based on Zuleica\u2019s techniques, modified for people not in heightened awareness.  And to be more fun.\n\nBut I got the idea of starting in full darkness using Zuleica\u2019s techniques, then continuing on to the morning. That way, by the time it was twilight conditions, I was already in heightened awareness.\n\nI didn\u2019t have any confidence I could get there if I started directly from twilight.\n\nInstead of colors, you'll possibly get lines of darkness and lightness, forming odd structures.  You might have to squint a lot in order to maximize the results, but don't do that on purpose.  Your eyes will squint by themselves as you try to observe.  Just don't get bothered by it.  Don Juan himself seemed to need to squint at times.  I\u2019ll add, one eye or the other might even completely close on its own.\n\nLast night as I practiced gazing all the way from absolute darkness to sunrise, and just before the sun was starting to come up, I had a very bright blue/purple smear stuck to my hands. I was using it to open a portal into another world.    It looked like toy goo poured onto my hands, dripping down a little.\n\nI discovered it by accident.  You just grab a patch of color, make it very bright, and then rub it vigorously all over your hands until they glow in the same color.  Or not vigorously; it\u2019s hard to specify which will work best.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t work at first, try your thighs and calves.   If that works, keep going until you can make your hands glow like that.\n\nNext hold them shoulder level with your elbows down, right in front of you, and slowly stretch the glowing hands all the way to the side, as if you were opening a curtain.\n\nYou don\u2019t loop it around to your back.  That only lights up the luminous shell near you.   You want to activate the luminous shell a distance in front of you. That\u2019s what Carlos called, \u201cthe Wall\u201d.  You pretend the wall is actually a curtain, and use the glow of your hands to coax it to open.  Then look inside.\n\nThere were beings in there!   Calm and friendly looking too.   I thought I recognized one of them. But they were too far away to be sure.  They were standing on top of a little hill, overlooking a shallow valley that was between me and them.\n\nSomewhere there\u2019s a tensegrity move for that technique.  Carlos called it opening a window or some such.  But I never realized what it could do when Carlos taught it to us.  I\u2019m not sure anyone in the class realized, his descriptions of what the techniques do was literal, not allegorical.\n\nThat makes all of tensegrity precious, and I truly hope someone is collecting as many notes from as many people as they can.  Carlos himself taught me over 1200 techniques, but I only remember a few.\n\nHey Russians!  Save the past for us.  It'll become your future.\n\nI was hot in the middle of excellent darkness gazing results, when the sun came up.   The purple blob on my hands gradually turned into jumbled wavy lines, about the same size as my hand. They were stuck to the top of my hand, making it look larger.  Black regions were oozing out from it, and onto everything in the area.  I looked down at the ground, and dark things were moving around there.  Some looked like jet black vague rodents encased in a rectangular cage made of dim light.\n\nI\u2019d say, in twilight, you\u2019ll see more black blobs than colored ones.\n\nWhen I moved the mass of jumbled lines around, the ones stuck to my hands, the entire region in front of me turned into similar wavy lines. I presumed it was yet another way to light up the inside of your luminous shell.\n\nAfter I\u2019d lit that up, my index finger felt like it had an actual string stuck to it, going down to my ankle.  If that could be compared to a cobweb, this was a really thick and very strong one.\n\nIt was real enough to tug on my ankle when I moved my hand.\n\nThat means, you can form your luminous shell using twilight gazing, in exactly the same way Zuleica described.  Doing that only requires that you find something energetic to pull on, or stroke, encouraging the assemblage point of the second attention\u2019s body to move closer.\n\nI tried moving my index finger around at the periphery of my reach, to see what else it could feel.  My index finger had never been the source of such sensitivity. Usually the side of my arm is the most sensitive.\n\nHere\u2019s the most important tip I can give any of you:   You have to go from pretend to real.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how small.  Find something real, and now you have a measurement device.\n\nIn this case, my index finger became a cobweb detector.\n\nMoving my finger around to the back as far as I could, I encountered many such cobwebs. I guess we\u2019re covered in them.  Maybe they link our awareness to what\u2019s outside of us.\n\nI realized very clearly; this is why you can \u201credeploy\u201d energy from the periphery of your luminous shell. That claim made by Carlos always seemed very vague to me in class. But it\u2019s actually just a literal description of what you can do if you\u2019re silent.\n\nNot only can you feel for and stimulate fibers of awareness, but you can scoop and gather energy in the form of colors, for any use that you wish.  That of course being easier in total darkness.\n\nI also discovered that if you close one eye and look for the wavy lines, then when you switch eyes, the other can suddenly go crazy with swirly wavy lines.  Probably the other eye\u2019s amplifiers are turned up high, because you closed it, but were still looking at semi-darkness with the other.\n\nThe view when I suddenly switched from my right eye to my left, was even Bubbly!  Like boiling foam made from short fat worms, each one curled into a circle.\n\nI guess I have to apologize to the Europeans for my previous remark, implying Carlos was only patronizing them.  Maybe they did see things as bubbling and weren\u2019t merely trying to \u201coutstare reality\u201d.\n\nI would be surprised if the bubbly thing wasn\u2019t familiar to most people.  You can see it if you stumble into the bathroom at night and turn the light on suddenly, but only if you were in a dreaming state and managed to preserve it on the way.\n\nMy conclusion: Twilight gazing is more powerful than darkness gazing, except that we don\u2019t have any good instructions for it, such as the ones from Zuleica for darkness.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a problem. Sorcery is vast.  It\u2019s easy to waste time on a dead-end road.\n\nSolution: you.  Try it and report in for future generations.  People were content to look at inspirational quotes for the last 20 years since Carlos died.  A little real-world encouragement might be good for a change.  And maybe less kitten videos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Gazing from Darkness to Twilight", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

See you later.\n\nAnd no need for bad players to get angry.  Over what? It's all there for you.\n\nHave a good time with your new full knowledge of how sorcery works.\n\nIt came from don Juan, so don't blame me.\n\nMaybe I'll ask Cholita to come help if anyone has more questions.\n\nAlthough I sort of expect that even  though I just explained all of sorcery to you, only a few got it.\n\nAnd Cholita's \"help\" seems to require that you are in silent knowledge.  She's been hiding lately, but it's impossible to hide from silent knowledge.\n\nNot that I can take any credit for Cholita's use of her double. It's just how she is.\n\nCarlos explained this in class.  Out of a workshop with hundreds, he had 2 in there who's dreaming copy, the person running around in dreams each night, could also stand right next to them, to check out what's going on in the \"real world\".\n\nCholita is one of those.\n\nIt's not that she likes me so she visits in her double.\n\nIf she's not home, I never see her double.\n\nIf I don't think she's home, because she's been gone for weeks, I might get a \"guest appearance\" in the darkroom.\n\nI used to think, \"Well, I guess she can visit me on purpose!\"\n\nBut then I find out later, she came home without me knowing it.\n\nHer visits in her double are just her looking for something to do, in the immediate vicinity of where her tonal body is located.  She probably also \"haunts\" neighbors.\n\nFor the best info on this \"Pandora's Box\" tensegrity pass, go find the original post.  Some of the pictures from that are in the upper right.  Along with a Jewish version.\n\nJewish magic is almost surely an old form of North African Shamanism,  from long gone.  Even by the time the Jewish Prophets were practicing it and writing the bible, around 6000 years ago by the claims of some, it was already long gone and weakening fast.\n\nThey had agriculture faster in the middle east, which might have caused the rapid decay.  It rose to being around 6000 years ago, along with the first human city on earth.\n\nOur own Proto-Siberian shamanism came to the americas around 13,000 years ago, and by 8000 years ago was still amazingly powerful.\n\nOur death defier comes from that period.\n\nBut even to this day it survives every bit as powerful as the original kind from which it evolved.\n\nIn some ways, more powerful.\n\nWe ditched most of the rituals used to summon intent, or as I explained earlier, all the rituals designed to focus your awareness on specific bundles of emanations, so intent could skim a real looking world from them.  Intent takes into account past usage when \"assembling\" a new reality for you.\n\nInstead we use Silent Knowledge to figure out which emanations we'd like to use, and the results are a bit less \"real\" than those of the old sorcerers.\n\nBut they're more \"flexible\" realities. And you can open the hood and look in the engine. To see what you just produced.\n\nYour awareness focuses on some strands of light, in an infinite dark sea of emanations.\n\nDark, because only  a very small number have the awareness of a living being shining on them.\n\nHow do you direct it?\n\nWith your \"Attention\".\n\nJust look!  Or feel. Or any way you can, focus your attention there.\n\nAND, nowhere else.\n\nYou can't focus your attention on a dream bubble you want to produce, so you can use it as an exit from your darkroom by walking inside.\n\nBut still have some of your attention thinking about those donuts in a box on the bed.\n\nIt has to be 100% on what you want *intend* to use, to create your dream bubble.\n\nAnd that's the process of learning sorcery.  Learning to \"clean your link to intent\".\n\nIt's damned hard!   The first thing that has to go is that goofy \"internal dialogue\".\n\nEvery word invokes an entire reality.  If you say \"coffee\" in your mind, up pops the starbucks.\n\nAnd that cute girl with the tattoos who smiles each morning when she hands you your regular order.\n\nAnd her boyfriend who noticed the dirty old man checking her out. I bet he hits her when they're alone!\n\nThat internal dialogue is vicious.  It doesn't  just \"think a word and drop it\".\n\nIt thinks a word, which is an entire \"syntax\".\n\nEach word comes with it's own reality in your mind, or it makes no sense.\n\nSo those MUST go, or you can't manipulate reality.\n\nIn fact, you're trapped in this one because you can't stop thinking about it.\n\nAt night when you sleep you let go a bit, and find yourself wandering in other realities.\n\nBut you've been tortured to call those \"imaginary\" and \"not real\".\n\nIf you focus your awareness at the emanations thinking something is \"unreal\",  it alters how intent uses it to make your world.\n\nYou have to be silent, no images in the mind, no hidden motivations, and THEN you can learn how to manifest both dream bubbles, passages to other words, or in this case, Golems.\n\nA Golem is an empty container that looks like a humanoid, into which you place a spirit who can move objects.\n\nHe uses it like one of those giant Japanese robots.  Gigantor.  Gigantor himself is not alive. It's the little boy at the controls.\n\nThat's how a Golem works.\n\nPandora's box pass can make those!\n\nBut who can you get to drive it?\n\nAs it turns out, those purple puffs you use to make the Golem are in fact part of your own awareness.\n\nEach \"puff\" is part of the total \"energy body\". The one which can produce an absolutely real copy of yourself, so solid that the Nagual Elias had a medical practice in northern Mexico, while actually living in his real body far south near Mexico City.\n\nAn impossible commute!  So he didn't. He just made a copy of himself.\n\nThat's what those purple puffs do!\n\nSo it should not seem so odd that you can take part of them, and make a horrible zombie.\n\nAnd they'll hang out. I had one stick around 2 days.\n\nI've also sent them to their doom, to test out energy tunnels I've created to span across 2 continents.\n\nI believe one even got torn apart by an scary witch!  I didn't see any \"body parts\" returning, but Fancy, my inorganic being, got really excited at a clouse of pink emerging from my tunnel.  She seemed to be frantic to get me to look.\n\nBut I had my own problems. I was in 2 places at once, with Cholita. So quite distracted.\n\nOr maybe there was some other distraction.  It was several days ago and sorcery is hard to remember even for an hour.  It doesn't take place in the \"ordinary world\", so it's nearly impossible to \"find the memory\".   It isn't attached to any clues the way what you had for lunch 3 days ago is.\n\nYou can only figure that memory out, because you can find what that lunch session was attached to.  Why you happened to go in that direction to find food.\n\nBut don't feel sorry for Golems.  That's really \"you\".  The Golem is part of your own awareness.\n\nPandora's box merely compresses purple puffs, until you can reach the deep orange zone. It won't make a golem on the green line.\n\nAnd merely \"compressing the puffs\" is a very good activity, because it can rapidly move the assemblage point down.\n\nBut over in the orange zone, past the crystalline dreaming fog on that J curve diagram, there's \"stuff\" to compress **into** the puffs.\n\nRemember my explanation of everything you need to know about sorcery?\n\nIt applies here!\n\nAny \"stuff\" you see floating in the air, is just that same thing.\n\nAwareness glowing on some emanations, which has been turned into a part of your reality, by the force of *intent*.\n\nAnd with the \"Pandora's Box\" pass Carlos pointed out, you can move that stuff with your hand!\n\nBut back to the sorcery rule:  Even moving it with your hand, is just adding the glow of awareness to different bundles of emanations using your \"attention\" to focus it.\n\nWhich means, intent ought to \"reskim\" those emanations to reflect the change in the situation.\n\nSo you can \"capture\" some of the \"stuff\", inside visible glowing balls of your energy body.\n\nAnd \"squish\" it all together.\n\nThat just HAS to do something, right?\n\nYes, it does!\n\nWe'll never uncover how much that can do.\n\nIn my case, I was squishing fine little lightning bolts my hands could stir up in the darkness.\n\nWhen I forced  a puff of my own awareness down on them, compressing the bright lines into a flattened version, a beam of red light emerged like a mild laser and illuminated a scene of what looked to me to be a jungle from the era of Olmec sorcerers.\n\nI couldn't believe that pass did that too, but in Silent Knowledge mode I got a lecture on it.\n\nFrom the storyteller.  If you have a \"question\" in silent knowledge mode, you get an \"answer\".\n\nMight be weird though.\n\nThis \"storyteller\" even looked a little like an echo of Carlos.\n\nI tried it again, heeding the words of Silent Knowledge, and found you could do it over and over, to \"reveal\" scenes from the sorcerers of the past.\n\nI tried to get excited, since that's just too cool to believe!\n\nExcept, at that position of the assemblage point everything is \"natural\", and \"obvious\".\n\nSo no excitement came out.\n\nThen I realized, how dumb can you be?\n\nIt's just a \"Silent Knowledge Presentation Method\".\n\nThat old Devil Carlos had given us the \"whitish light\",  \"Reading off the wall\", and gazing at the horizon to summon silent knowledge.\n\nSeveral \"presentation methods\" for Silent Knowledge.\n\nNo big deal. It's no different than the talking lizards of the Devil's weed ceremony.\n\nOnce I realized there was no big mystery in why that pass could \"beam out dream bubbles of the past\", I returned to playing with my compressed little bolts of electricity.\n\nI compressed and then stretched my hands apart, and the purple puffs turned \"solid\".\n\nWhen they do that, they behave more like a solid than a gas.\n\nIt's \"extra real puffs\".\n\nIf you pull your hands apart when there's some dense smoke between them, you get a bigger smoke ball, but one that's more diffuse. You just scatter the smoke into a larger ball.\n\nBut if it's \"real\" it has to maintain the same \"volume\".  For instance if it were purple children's \"slime\".\n\nA clear Jelly like substance that's strong enough to use as a toy.\n\nThink of \"getting slimed\" in the movie Ghost Busters.\n\nExcept a bit thicker.\n\nIf you had a ball of that stuck to your palms which were pressed together and you stretched it, the shape would deform to be thinner in the middle.  Because you \"stretched\" it.\n\nWhen I saw that, I realized my assemblage point had shifted sideways a bit.\n\nBut in Silent Knowledge, that likely means a really cool presentation method is available.\n\nI got the idea to use an inorganic being as the intelligence inside the puff ball, so when I released it I got a IOB Golem.\n\nThose can smile.  Or wear amazing costumes.\n\nThey're just more \"real\" than an inorganic being alone.\n\nI compressed with the idea of an IOB, gazed around the room, but I didn't see my IOB \"Fancy\".\n\nWhen I stretched that ball again, the inside popped out a woman's face.\n\nI didn't know her.\n\nI even asked her if I knew her, as I compressed her again.\n\nI removed my top had to let the compressed ball float into the air, releasing the \"intent\" it had activated.\n\nA full face materialized like a Genie.\n\nIt was far beyond anything I ever did with Pandora's box.  A different level of \"real\".\n\nExcept, I still couldn't manage to get excited.\n\nI told the entity, he just **had** to help me remember all this.\n\nIt smiled vividly as if wanting to say, \"Do you NEED me?\"\n\nThey like that.\n\nProjects.\n\nCollaborations.\n\nAnd the old Men of KNowledge took good advantage of that to create their elaborate rituals, just to summon Silent Knowledge.\n\nKind of pointless if you think about it and are able to reach Silent Knowledge by yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Make A Genie?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"53cqvnnzj9191": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=362bb5fa114b2424865e2f6d6f56c4a310c0cc55"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=159277032bb0829d003d62c26fc70a33a3bc4c37"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61790d71746f7c52a4310fa391276d01b71ec94f"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9978dbc0ef7c91c59d4831a12c2d654ea84ac2f"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5614283a0a60cdcfcf1ad1763198177feaee3adc"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f2b5ce4837d7b764f94641c7a251a5c2941723b"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=162b8ca0232ac3ab3882c8b447000bb455dc2882"}, "id": "53cqvnnzj9191"}}, "name": "t3_uw71x8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/55te4vEIiFWcExPlSwl9PEZSsXvFtw4LQQS5ggIGll0.jpg", "edited": 1653334642.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1653331013.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=162b8ca0232ac3ab3882c8b447000bb455dc2882\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/53cqvnnzj9191.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=162b8ca0232ac3ab3882c8b447000bb455dc2882&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t find a magic lamp?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No problem for a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can make your own Genie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos even showed us how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never realized how much that Pandora&amp;#39;s box pass could do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be done with barely visible puffs, at the green line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Done there it allows you to &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; with the puffs, and your assemblage point will shift horizontally a bit to &amp;quot;make them more real&amp;quot;, since compressing the balls with your hands does in fact &amp;quot;treat them as if they were solid&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess this is hard for beginners to understand, but there&amp;#39;s the emanations, and there&amp;#39;s the force of intent, which takes the awareness you place on the infinity number of emanations, and figures out which ones to use to build your view of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ALL that actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good...  now that you know, I&amp;#39;m all done here.

He just made a copy of himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what those purple puffs do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it should not seem so odd that you can take part of them, and make a horrible zombie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#39;ll hang out. I had one stick around 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also sent them to their doom, to test out energy tunnels I&amp;#39;ve created to span across 2 continents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe one even got torn apart by an scary witch!  I didn&amp;#39;t see any &amp;quot;body parts&amp;quot; returning, but Fancy, my inorganic being, got really excited at a clouse of pink emerging from my tunnel.  She seemed to be frantic to get me to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had my own problems. I was in 2 places at once, with Cholita. So quite distracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe there was some other distraction.  It was several days ago and sorcery is hard to remember even for an hour.  It doesn&amp;#39;t take place in the &amp;quot;ordinary world&amp;quot;, so it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to &amp;quot;find the memory&amp;quot;.   It isn&amp;#39;t attached to any clues the way what you had for lunch 3 days ago is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can only figure that memory out, because you can find what that lunch session was attached to.  Why you happened to go in that direction to find food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t feel sorry for Golems.  That&amp;#39;s really &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.  The Golem is part of your own awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pandora&amp;#39;s box merely compresses purple puffs, until you can reach the deep orange zone. It won&amp;#39;t make a golem on the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And merely &amp;quot;compressing the puffs&amp;quot; is a very good activity, because it can rapidly move the assemblage point down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But over in the orange zone, past the crystalline dreaming fog on that J curve diagram, there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; to compress &lt;strong&gt;into&lt;/strong&gt; the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember my explanation of everything you need to know about sorcery?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It applies here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; you see floating in the air, is just that same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Awareness glowing on some emanations, which has been turned into a part of your reality, by the force of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with the &amp;quot;Pandora&amp;#39;s Box&amp;quot; pass Carlos pointed out, you can move that stuff with your hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to the sorcery rule:  Even moving it with your hand, is just adding the glow of awareness to different bundles of emanations using your &amp;quot;attention&amp;quot; to focus it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, intent ought to &amp;quot;reskim&amp;quot; those emanations to reflect the change in the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; some of the &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;, inside visible glowing balls of your energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;squish&amp;quot; it all together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That just HAS to do something, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it does!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll never uncover how much that can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was squishing fine little lightning bolts my hands could stir up in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I forced  a puff of my own awareness down on them, compressing the bright lines into a flattened version, a beam of red light emerged like a mild laser and illuminated a scene of what looked to me to be a jungle from the era of Olmec sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t believe that pass did that too, but in Silent Knowledge mode I got a lecture on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the storyteller.  If you have a &amp;quot;question&amp;quot; in silent knowledge mode, you get an &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might be weird though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;storyteller&amp;quot; even looked a little like an echo of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried it again, heeding the words of Silent Knowledge, and found you could do it over and over, to &amp;quot;reveal&amp;quot; scenes from the sorcerers of the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to get excited, since that&amp;#39;s just too cool to believe!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, at that position of the assemblage point everything is &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no excitement came out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I realized, how dumb can you be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Presentation Method&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That old Devil Carlos had given us the &amp;quot;whitish light&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Reading off the wall&amp;quot;, and gazing at the horizon to summon silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several &amp;quot;presentation methods&amp;quot; for Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No big deal. It&amp;#39;s no different than the talking lizards of the Devil&amp;#39;s weed ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I realized there was no big mystery in why that pass could &amp;quot;beam out dream bubbles of the past&amp;quot;, I returned to playing with my compressed little bolts of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I compressed and then stretched my hands apart, and the purple puffs turned &amp;quot;solid&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they do that, they behave more like a solid than a gas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;extra real puffs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you pull your hands apart when there&amp;#39;s some dense smoke between them, you get a bigger smoke ball, but one that&amp;#39;s more diffuse. You just scatter the smoke into a larger ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; it has to maintain the same &amp;quot;volume&amp;quot;.  For instance if it were purple children&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;slime&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A clear Jelly like substance that&amp;#39;s strong enough to use as a toy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of &amp;quot;getting slimed&amp;quot; in the movie Ghost Busters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except a bit thicker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had a ball of that stuck to your palms which were pressed together and you stretched it, the shape would deform to be thinner in the middle.  Because you &amp;quot;stretched&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I saw that, I realized my assemblage point had shifted sideways a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in Silent Knowledge, that likely means a really cool presentation method is available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the idea to use an inorganic being as the intelligence inside the puff ball, so when I released it I got a IOB Golem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those can smile.  Or wear amazing costumes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re just more &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; than an inorganic being alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I compressed with the idea of an IOB, gazed around the room, but I didn&amp;#39;t see my IOB &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I stretched that ball again, the inside popped out a woman&amp;#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even asked her if I knew her, as I compressed her again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I removed my top had to let the compressed ball float into the air, releasing the &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; it had activated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A full face materialized like a Genie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was far beyond anything I ever did with Pandora&amp;#39;s box.  A different level of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, I still couldn&amp;#39;t manage to get excited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told the entity, he just &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; to help me remember all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It smiled vividly as if wanting to say, &amp;quot;Do you NEED me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the old Men of KNowledge took good advantage of that to create their elaborate rituals, just to summon Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of pointless if you think about it and are able to reach Silent Knowledge by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,

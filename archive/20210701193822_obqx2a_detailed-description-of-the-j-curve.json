If you have coffee or yerba-mate it helps a lot.\n\nThe first part, which is the most delicate, and in which I think everyone fails, is to calm the internal dialogue.\n\nFor this, I like to choose a point in my visual field, in which I am comfortable keeping my sight.\n\nYou have to try to focus all your attention on the act of perceiving, for as long as possible, and have the manic discipline to detect and forget every thought.\n\nThere are no exceptions; absolutely none. In practice time, you don't have to value any thought.\n\nI know that interesting ideas appear right here, but keep fighting tirelessly to get back to the awareness of the place.\n\nDon't underestimate this part, which can take an hour, until external perception becomes captivating enough to move along the J curve.\n\nOnce you can spend 15-20 seconds in perfect silence, you will probably already start to see strange things in your field of vision.\n\nSurely at that moment you are a the \"green station\".\n\nAnd that is very good news, because from there you begin to perceive magic.\n\nI can see some colored puffs moving in the grass, and I already see some potential inorganic beings, like dancing shadows.\n\nYou can look at them a couple of times, but as you will notice, this is not going to help you move forward, vertically on the path of the assamblage point.\n\nYou have to go back to the point in your visual field, chosen at the beginning, and try to make the \"external perception\" even more intense, maintaining the periods of silence.\n\nAt this point the fantasies are still strong, so you need to hold the discipline of steel.\n\nKeep doing this (each time with higher concentration) for half an hour more,  and you will arrive the \"red station\". You realize it, because your garden, or wherever you are, becomes as colorful as a Christmas tree.\n\nIntense purple spots appear everywhere.\n\nAt the specific point you chose at the beginning, you will distinguish animated dreams projecting!\n\nThat is already fun, and it feels great.\n\nRemember that they are sustained with those periods of pure silence, and that if you let your fantasies come back, everything will go away.\n\nTo continue moving forward, it is the same as before: keep the vision at the point you chose, trying to make the external silence more and more intense.\n\nFrom here, little by little you will begin to notice how a part of you is gaining strength. I guess it's the left side.\n\nIf you made it this far, and you continue holding the discipline of steel, you have everything to win.\n\nAt that point I get into a very good mood, because what follows is very enjoyable and fun (although it still requires great concentration).\n\nBut also here, everything starts to be quite strange, and \"different\" from how you are used to perceive..\n\nTo keep moving forward you have to put aside parts of yourself that you never stopped using, and realizing this can take a while (even months of getting stucked there).\n\nThere is no explanation of how to do it; you have to make the periods of perfect silence as much longer as possible, and try to feel the external perception, which will intensify to ridiculous points.\n\nThe more external your perception, the easier it is to \"realize\" how to keep moving forward. You just know it, and you do it. You have to learn to trust your intuition, and body knowledge.\n\nIf you managed to advance even further, everything is going to be pretty crazy in your field of vision, as long as you have the discipline of returning again and again to the perfect silence.\n\nAlthough there is still something missing; You can feel it, but you don't know what is. There is something that keeps you stuck at the end of the red station.\n\nTo keep moving forward, you have to stop being interested in what you see. You have to accept the perception as it is, without having any idea, or wanting to change anything, or comment on things.\n\nIf you manage to maintain perfect silence while doing that, you \"forget yourself\", and something strange happens: you fall asleep, without falling asleep.\n\nYou go into a dream state, which FEELS AMAZING. And you are already in sorcery territory. It is already \"orange station\".\n\nMy garden looks like paradise at that position!\n\nNature becomes sublime and ethereal.\n\nVisually, right after \"falling asleep\", the air seems thick, and as if there is a magical fog, but I no longer see colored puffs or inorganic beings.\n\nThen everything seems incredibly close, and becomes inexplicably dense until it gets too abstract to describe.\n\nEverything you do here is going to be REALLY crazy.\n\nI guess only from here you could say that \"you stopped the internal dialogue.\"\n\nSomehow, you got your double really close, and you can really feel it.\n\nBut it also has its cons: it all gets pretty abstract. In fact, you no longer interpret what you see, so it doesn't make the sense that you imagine it would have.\n\nFor instance, you can easily make a visible portal appear, which \"you know is a portal\", and you can perceive the infinite on the other side.\n\nIt will also take a while to learn to maintain that state, because it is VERY easy to get excited and come back.\n\nHere you gain the lightness and blissful trophy that others systems look for. You can even hold it for a couple of days!\n\nI find it very useful; it is like doing a \"reset\" to all the obsessions you were carrying, and you can just enjoy the world.\n\nDon't expect the \"clarity\" to stay with you.

I've lurked for awhile and you are way out there man. Like I'm trying to analyze all this stuff and you make it very complicated. I just don't personify my thoughtforms, I guess that's the issue. Also, they lie, change up, admit they don't know, or contradict themselves. I have a few emergency angels that show up when shit hits the fan, but nothing I talk to ever admits to being real or unreal, and when we start a dialogue on where they are opposed to me things get extremely chaotic and convoluted. It's as if they agree to everything but don't, and then sometimes, or they dont know. Oddly enough they are very much like a damn magic 8 ball. I do get lightning fast responses telepathically, bit they are so subtle that I have to usually be on drugs (which I stopped) to hear them louder. They admit I don't need to hear them any louder. It's ridiculous. Every time I begin a dialogue I feel like I'm getting somewhere and feel like I'm actually talking to something else.. but it says it's a part of me and blah blah, and it's almost as if you had multiple personalities that know and admit they are just that. They are all synced up, and let me sit in the \"driver's\" seat. When I was really far gone on nitrous oxide I was shown that I was like a tower that held cells containing each spirit. Each cell had their names listed. At the top was a throne and a large pearlescent sphere that showed our world to and through the eyes of he who claims the throne of oneself. I was anointed a \"crown\" and was allowed \"wings\" to mentally project around the electron astral web or w.e. we called it \"electron surfing.\" So at the throne the king (me) was instructed and directed by a head \"General\" and \"Chief/Commander\". I cannot make this shit up. They would post at the right and left hand of the one true king, and advise the king as he made his way through the world. The spirits entombed within his bodily tower, scream, and shriek in a far unconscious distance. A revolting. A rebellion. A lust. They crave which they do not have and would tell me all the things they would do of they had my body. Some began to mock me and put me down because they felt they could do better and deserved a life more than me. The two that sat at my shoulders led me far astray and eventually got me involved in some.heavy legal shit, and possible murder/suicide. This was a very very long time ago. I was very you g and had no idea what these beings were. They crept in slowly and would tell me sweet nothings. They alotted power and abilities.

I&amp;#39;ve lurked for awhile and you are way out there man. Like I&amp;#39;m trying to analyze all this stuff and you make it very complicated. I just don&amp;#39;t personify my thoughtforms, I guess that&amp;#39;s the issue. Also, they lie, change up, admit they don&amp;#39;t know, or contradict themselves. I have a few emergency angels that show up when shit hits the fan, but nothing I talk to ever admits to being real or unreal, and when we start a dialogue on where they are opposed to me things get extremely chaotic and convoluted. It&amp;#39;s as if they agree to everything but don&amp;#39;t, and then sometimes, or they dont know. Oddly enough they are very much like a damn magic 8 ball. I do get lightning fast responses telepathically, bit they are so subtle that I have to usually be on drugs (which I stopped) to hear them louder. They admit I don&amp;#39;t need to hear them any louder. It&amp;#39;s ridiculous. Every time I begin a dialogue I feel like I&amp;#39;m getting somewhere and feel like I&amp;#39;m actually talking to something else.. but it says it&amp;#39;s a part of me and blah blah, and it&amp;#39;s almost as if you had multiple personalities that know and admit they are just that. They are all synced up, and let me sit in the &amp;quot;driver&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; seat. When I was really far gone on nitrous oxide I was shown that I was like a tower that held cells containing each spirit. Each cell had their names listed. At the top was a throne and a large pearlescent sphere that showed our world to and through the eyes of he who claims the throne of oneself. I was anointed a &amp;quot;crown&amp;quot; and was allowed &amp;quot;wings&amp;quot; to mentally project around the electron astral web or w.e. we called it &amp;quot;electron surfing.&amp;quot; So at the throne the king (me) was instructed and directed by a head &amp;quot;General&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Chief/Commander&amp;quot;. I cannot make this shit up. They would post at the right and left hand of the one true king, and advise the king as he made his way through the world. The spirits entombed within his bodily tower, scream, and shriek in a far unconscious distance. A revolting. A rebellion. A lust. They crave which they do not have and would tell me all the things they would do of they had my body. Some began to mock me and put me down because they felt they could do better and deserved a life more than me. The two that sat at my shoulders led me far astray and eventually got me involved in some.heavy legal shit, and possible murder/suicide. This was a very very long time ago. I was very you g and had no idea what these beings were. They crept in slowly and would tell me sweet nothings. They alotted power and abilities. They manipulated the world to my will of I just kept &amp;quot;playing/working&amp;quot; with them. Some were like small people... I used to call them the kids. The kids upstairs.

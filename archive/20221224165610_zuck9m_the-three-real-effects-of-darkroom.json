But also farting, to put her at ease that he was still human and it was reasonably safe to be around him.\n\nEven don Juan got \"proof\" from Julian, when he was taken captive by the monstrous man. And also, Julian played the part of being \"safe\" for him too, in that situation. Even though it was all a trick.\n\nThe lineages solved the \"proof\" for their new apprentices, practically on day 1.\n\nBut at the same time the Nagual's blow was used to put apprentices into a state of no doubts at all, where everything seemed obvious and any instruction was instantly accepted.\n\nDon't overlook the \"sameness\" of those two cases!\n\nAs Yoda said, \"Too old to begin the training he is.\"\n\nAnd we know why! It's the blue line socialization.\n\nThe Olmecs weren't so \"wise\" that they saw that problem, and bypassed it by taking children who's internal dialogue hadn't yet taken them over.\n\nThose whose link to intent wasn't yet too dirty to function.\n\nRather than being wise about it, I think they were just very practical and realized it was a pain in the ass to try to teach anyone over a certain age. Because surely if you had a choice, you'd rather be teaching older humans. Children have different burdens not related at all to teaching sorcery.\n\nBut past a certain age the old seers realized it was a waste of their own energy to try to teach someone. They'd lose more than they could gain.\n\nAnd with no motivation for monetary compensation (no money yet existed), they simply stuck with what works.\n\n4 year olds. Younglings.\n\nThe new seers also realized it was hopeless to teach anyone of the age they had available. Adults. So they used the nagual's blow to erase the effects of growing up.\n\nThey \"created\" small children in their apprentices through heightened awareness, and trained those \"new children\" on the side. In the background.\n\nAnd did what they could with the \"adult\" version. Mostly trickery.\n\nBoth were actually the same teaching model. Except the new seers needed double beings to pull it off.\n\nCarlos gave us a lesson on that, when he put Carol Tiggs up on stage to \"show us something\".\n\nAlways giving us a lesson, Carlos was. We just didn't realize it was happening.\n\nPossibly it took place just because Carlos planned his actions by \"reading off the wall\".\n\nHe tapped into the 3rd \"real\" thing we all have available, even when there's no double beings around. He even taught us about that, in his \"Silent Knowledge\" publication. Pointing us to the same place he got his own plans from.\n\nAnd telling us specifically, it was for guidance in his absence. I believe it even had an implied \"farewell\" from the witches in the narrative.\n\nThat 3rd \"real thing\" will become clearer at the end of this post.\n\n\"Carol Tiggs wants to show you something\", are the words Carlos used back before she even went on the public stage at workshops.\n\nAs far as I know, he started using Carol for \"proof\" in private classes. Decided he needed the energy of a double being, to solve his teaching problems.\n\nAnd we all hoped she'd provide that obviously missing \"proof\".\n\nBut whatever happened, we might have missed the whole lesson.\n\nHe was using the energy of Carol Tiggs, a double being, to accomplish it.\n\nI'm not sure she was really interested in doing it at all.\n\nOn her own.\n\nAnd didn't need to be!\n\nRegardless of whose idea it was, he was able to just push her in front of us. While stating just the \"intent\" of it. And that was enough to make use of her energy and move someone's assemblage point.\n\nAs long as he limited how many she needed to affect on one occasion, to her level of available energy.\n\nTwo as I recall.\n\nWhich was also part of the lesson.\n\nYou couldn't simply put her into a tent, and send everyone at the entire workshop in there alone, like an assembly line.\n\nShe only had enough energy for two each time. And an unknown \"recovery period\".\n\nCholita has a recovery period on her ability to lend me dark energy. It seems to be on the order of weeks. Unless she goes traveling at night, then she can recover in just days.\n\nThere's a suggestion in there for us, in how Carlos used Carol.\n\nBut we haven't encountered the resources yet to make use of it.\n\nUnfortunately in our case, not having the old seers nor the new seers to help us, Castaneda fans commonly went for decades with no good reason to believe any of this is true.\n\nOur situation is pretty dire.\n\nMy thinking is that our only real task, if we want to save the teachings from doom at the hands of greed and stupidity, is to be \"proof distributors\".\n\nSo what do we have to offer, for \"proof\"?\n\nThe witches in here can eventually come up with the \"proof\" for new witches.\n\nBecause women have more resources than the men. Namely the ability to move their assemblage points more easily, combined with the ability to store dark energy.\n\nI wish I knew how they accumulate it. That's another possible future resource for us. Understanding how to \"charge women up\" with dark energy.\n\nMy suspicion is, rituals that attract inorganic beings. When done around women, the women can extract dark energy and store it even if they are only slightly aware of it.\n\nSome super spooky workshops might do it.  We might strike up a deal with our inorganic beings to make that more practical, eventually.\n\nFancy seems willing. Lily was too, having crossed in the opposite direction from a woman to a man.\n\nAnd maybe for new women, for now, just \"proof for males\" is enough. They can inspect it, and extrapolate their own situation.\n\nThere are 3 \"real\" things that happen during darkroom.\n\nOnly 2 of which have been common up until now.\n\nAnd which require more emphasis, to overcome the delusion that sorcery is about drugs and attention seeking.\n\nThe vehicle to induce all 3, is what Carlos gave us.\n\nTensegrity.\n\nThe first 2 are the puffs, and inorganic beings.\n\nBoth are real entities, with sentience.\n\nMaybe our focus should be on making it obvious that's the case, instead of just giving the impression that both are only traps for your attention, to help you get silent and move your assemblage point.\n\nI did that, somewhat on purpose to bypass the aspect of fear.\n\nIf it's just a \"hallucination\", it's not as scary.\n\nBut maybe that was a mistake, because it encourages bad players to make up stuff.\n\nSo assuming we figure out how best to animate what darkroom is, and how it works, there's still the 3rd \"real\" thing that is available to us.\n\nSilent Knowledge.\n\nWe haven't understood this topic as it applies to darkroom practice, up until recently.\n\nWe got hints of it.\n\nThe J curve progress images are out of sequence. That railroad track map is good at first, but falls apart once it reaches past the red zone and the crystalline dreaming fog just below that.\n\nIt's random magical pictures past that point.  Because \"micro rituals\" can make it appear at any point from the green line onward.\n\nStep 1 of a good animation about that topic would be to make it clear everyone will get puffs, if they get silent.\n\nToo many think it depends on something else. So they won't try hard enough.\n\nAs will inorganic beings show up, once someone can perceive the puffs.\n\nThat's also inevitable. And should be made clear.\n\nAgain, it's so far fetched that people believe the appearance of inorganic beings depends on something else. So it doesn't motivate them the way it ought to.\n\nBut on this planet we're surrounded by more of them than there are of us.\n\nAnd they're just looking for humans who can perceive them. Possibly that's even part of their own attempts to evolve.\n\nWhich means anyone who moves their assemblage point to the green line or below has a chance to catch a glimpse of them. By the time it reaches deep red, I can't believe it's not inevitable.\n\nMystics in all systems had visits from inorganic beings. They just misunderstood them because their systems had decayed too far to carry that understanding anymore. And greed made them not want to understand. They love their fantasy interpretations of what IOBs are.\n\nThey're potentially profitable!\n\nThe largest organized money making enterprises in human history, namely Judaism and Buddhism, were the results of severe misunderstandings of inorganic beings.\n\nFortunately the tensegrity we were given helps you get silent, and also interests the double. Who comes off the walls of your egg shell where it's been hiding. To become the puffs.\n\nThe puffs cause inorganic beings to manifest.\n\nIt's very hard to be clear enough on that, even in this subreddit.\n\nBecause people misrepresent how much effort they make. And try to change the rules to get themselves more attention.\n\nOr don't even have a good understanding of what a \"real effort\" looks like.\n\nWe can solve that, with an animation about recapitulation.\n\nPeople make dull, shitty lists. And barely get into it enough to even find a place to try it.\n\nThey just sit upon a bed with a list that fits on a single page.\n\nIt's kind of pathetic.\n\nSo an animation about recap is also important, for the purpose of teaching darkroom.\n\nTo show what a \"real effort\" actually looks like, using a topic which everyone knows doesn't require you to \"get lucky\" and be visited by anything supernatural at all.\n\nEveryone knows they can sit and remember past events.\n\nThey don't know, for certain, they can see puffs or inorganic beings.\n\nSo show them that even though you know you can do that, meaning follow the rules of recapitulation and have it \"work\" on the surface, it still won't get you anywhere magical without a good effort.\n\nWhich is easy to define.\n\nIn the quality of the list you make, and in the place you set aside in which to recapitulate.\n\nI'm not sure why Carlos made fun of my recapitulation crate, but I think he had personal motivations clouding his judgement on that one.\n\nHe saw it on the cover of Nagualist Newsletter, brought to him by one of the inner circle women.\n\nAnd thought, \"Shit... I hope they don't start wanting to build those in my backyard!\"\n\nHe didn't want to look out into his very nice picnic / stage / tensegrity practice space and see an endless sea of shoddily constructed crates looking like a slum in Brazil.\n\nBut I suggest that would be a big mistake for us.\n\nNot to emphasize doing a very good job of recap, INCLUDING finding an ideal place within your means, in which to do it.\n\nIt's a gesture to the spirit, which also teaches about what a \"real effort\" is actually like.\n\nThen there's the 3rd \"real\" thing in darkroom.\n\nA shocking thing.\n\nIn Silent Knowledge, every single tensegrity motion summons a \"topic\".\n\nSilent Knowledge is \"seeing\".\n\nBut it's also the inevitable result of darkroom. Because it activates, automatically.\n\nSo ideally the assemblage point moves smoothly along the J curve, and when it gets to the purple zone every single movement in the tensegrity becomes a \"topic\" selector.\n\nThis is beyond anything you could imagine from my words.\n\nI tried to use an old picture to show it, but that's not nearly enough to convey what happens.\n\nLet's take some obvious cases from tensegrity moves.\n\nThe \"Affection for the Energy Body\" pass.\n\nThe part where you form the knees.\n\nThat motion activates the \"topic of knees\".\n\nAnd they materialize! Or you get a lesson on how knees are used.\n\nHow about forming the feet?\n\nI actually tie my double's tennis shoes at the end of that, and if I'm in Silent Knowledge I can see the bows!\n\nOr any other number of absolutely distracting presentations about the topic of the individual movements Carlos combined, can take place before your eyes.\n\nYou might get a lecture on \"why\" he did that. And \"what he intended to happen in the long run\".\n\nYou don't just \"do your burden at time code 1:23 in the Tensegrity pass\".\n\nLike a move on a youtube video you are trying to duplicate as best you can.\n\nInstead, in SK it becomes REAL.\n\nYou literally pose a question, to a \"Presentation Method\".\n\nThe Tensegrity form itself.\n\nI probably can't convey this, but I'll keep trying.\n\nWhen done in silence, over and over, the sights you noticed while doing the tensegrity forms store into your memories of it.\n\nIn silence, a memory becomes an \"expectation\".\n\nSilent expectations are one of the cleanest links to intent any of us can manage at our level.\n\nAnd just having seen something cool during a specific tensegrity form, stores the intent of that happening again.\n\nBecause those emanations have glowed in the dark sea of the emanations at large.\n\nSo when \"looking that direction\", those are most likely to \"skim\" for you.\n\nYou can do the same in ordinary situations.\n\nPut a red light bulb in the little lamp that is for your home's front door.\n\nI guarantee, people driving by at night will \"notice\" your house.\n\nThe same happens with tensegrity, done over and over.\n\nAt some point the sights are so continuous in that specific Tensegrity form that it \"flows\" with magic.\n\nIt has become a silent knowledge presentation method.\n\nAnd the rule of SKPMs is, they respond to questions.\n\nAlmost as if they were sentient.\n\nBecause in fact the emanations, overall, are very sentient.\n\nIt just takes a certain number of them glowing for that property to emerge.\n\nIt takes \"energetic mass\" which leads to cross harmonics in the individual strands.\n\nThere is something so obvious and yet so magical it's nearly impossible to see, going on with Tensegrity.\n\nIt \"unhooks\" you from your attachment to the river of shit, while you can sustain enough attention to perceive the results.\n\nIt's as if you were never born at all, when you get it to become an SKPM.\n\nMeaning as if you were never trapped by the intent of our current situation.\n\nRemember, the story goes that our \"definitive journey\" was interrupted because we \"collided\" with the intent of this world.\n\nAnd took a birth.\n\nThe tensegrity causes your awareness to drift away from that situation inside an SKPM bubble.\n\nThe form itself.\n\nWe need to clarify that in the animations.\n\nAnd also resolve the disorder of those pictures on that J curve diagram.\n\nJuann already suspected it.\n\nThat you get silent knowledge, even up in the green zone!\n\nAnd you do it in an SKPM \"micro bubble\".\n\nThose are actually \"dream bubbles\" into which you entered.\n\nI prefer the \"stand alone\" dream bubble floating in the air.\n\nThose are much less confusing, than when you \"zip\" into them.\n\nThere's a loss of lucidity when that happens.\n\nBut that's also a mistake on my part.\n\nIt needs fixing in the animations.\n\nOne way is to treat that SKPM effect, as the \"third real thing\" in darkroom.\n\nDefine it, so people notice it.\n\nSo that it's not some distant goal, so far away it seems hopeless for people who can already make it to the green line.\n\nOnce they make it to the green line, we kind of failed if they don't go on.\n\nFailed in our explanations.\n\nWe showed people that doing darkroom does pay off in a little pocket change.\n\nWe put \"money\" in their little kid pockets.\n\nBut little kids don't really understand money very well.\n\nYou need to give them a place to exchange the money, for candy.\n\nSomething they DO understanding.\n\nIf you want to keep the little kid mowing your lawn weekly, you need to hook him to buying candy with the proceeds.\n\nIf it just keeps going into his \"piggy bank\", and we insist he should take pride in how high it's filling up, it's not enough motivation.\n\nLook at what happened to Tensegrity practitioners! They were told their piggy banks are filling up.\n\nDidn't make any difference. They couldn't buy anything they wanted with it.\n\nSo they all fall off and never see the real thing.\n\nWe've all seen, if we practice hard,  that \"weirder than usual\" stuff happens during darkroom.\n\nWe live for those moments!\n\nWe just didn't realize what was going on.\n\nYou drift into an SKPM bubble.\n\nSomething ALSO \"real\".", "user_reports": [], "saved": false,

Because surely if you had a choice, you&amp;#39;d rather be teaching older humans. Children have different burdens not related at all to teaching sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But past a certain age the old seers realized it was a waste of their own energy to try to teach someone. They&amp;#39;d lose more than they could gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with no motivation for monetary compensation (no money yet existed), they simply stuck with what works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 year olds. Younglings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new seers also realized it was hopeless to teach anyone of the age they had available. Adults. So they used the nagual&amp;#39;s blow to erase the effects of growing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &amp;quot;created&amp;quot; small children in their apprentices through heightened awareness, and trained those &amp;quot;new children&amp;quot; on the side. In the background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And did what they could with the &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; version. Mostly trickery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both were actually the same teaching model. Except the new seers needed double beings to pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave us a lesson on that, when he put Carol Tiggs up on stage to &amp;quot;show us something&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always giving us a lesson, Carlos was. We just didn&amp;#39;t realize it was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly it took place just because Carlos planned his actions by &amp;quot;reading off the wall&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tapped into the 3rd &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; thing we all have available, even when there&amp;#39;s no double beings around. He even taught us about that, in his &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; publication. Pointing us to the same place he got his own plans from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And telling us specifically, it was for guidance in his absence. I believe it even had an implied &amp;quot;farewell&amp;quot; from the witches in the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That 3rd &amp;quot;real thing&amp;quot; will become clearer at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Carol Tiggs wants to show you something&amp;quot;, are the words Carlos used back before she even went on the public stage at workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, he started using Carol for &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; in private classes. Decided he needed the energy of a double being, to solve his teaching problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we all hoped she&amp;#39;d provide that obviously missing &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But whatever happened, we might have missed the whole lesson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was using the energy of Carol Tiggs, a double being, to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure she was really interested in doing it at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On her own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And didn&amp;#39;t need to be!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whose idea it was, he was able to just push her in front of us. While stating just the &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; of it. And that was enough to make use of her energy and move someone&amp;#39;s assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as he limited how many she needed to affect on one occasion, to her level of available energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was also part of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#39;t simply put her into a tent, and send everyone at the entire workshop in there alone, like an assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She only had enough energy for two each time. And an unknown &amp;quot;recovery period&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has a recovery period on her ability to lend me dark energy. It seems to be on the order of weeks. Unless she goes traveling at night, then she can recover in just days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a suggestion in there for us, in how Carlos used Carol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we haven&amp;#39;t encountered the resources yet to make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately in our case, not having the old seers nor the new seers to help us, Castaneda fans commonly went for decades with no good reason to believe any of this is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our situation is pretty dire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My thinking is that our only real task, if we want to save the teachings from doom at the hands of greed and stupidity, is to be &amp;quot;proof distributors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do we have to offer, for &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches in here can eventually come up with the &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; for new witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because women have more resources than the men. Namely the ability to move their assemblage points more easily, combined with the ability to store dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew how they accumulate it. That&amp;#39;s another possible future resource for us. Understanding how to &amp;quot;charge women up&amp;quot; with dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is, rituals that attract inorganic beings. When done around women, the women can extract dark energy and store it even if they are only slightly aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some super spooky workshops might do it.  We might strike up a deal with our inorganic beings to make that more practical, eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy seems willing. Lily was too, having crossed in the opposite direction from a woman to a man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe for new women, for now, just &amp;quot;proof for males&amp;quot; is enough. They can inspect it, and extrapolate their own situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are 3 &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; things that happen during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only 2 of which have been common up until now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And which require more emphasis, to overcome the delusion that sorcery is about drugs and attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vehicle to induce all 3, is what Carlos gave us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first 2 are the puffs, and inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are real entities, with sentience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe our focus should be on making it obvious that&amp;#39;s the case, instead of just giving the impression that both are only traps for your attention, to help you get silent and move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did that, somewhat on purpose to bypass the aspect of fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;hallucination&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s not as scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe that was a mistake, because it encourages bad players to make up stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So assuming we figure out how best to animate what darkroom is, and how it works, there&amp;#39;s still the 3rd &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; thing that is available to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;#39;t understood this topic as it applies to darkroom practice, up until recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got hints of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The J curve progress images are out of sequence. That railroad track map is good at first, but falls apart once it reaches past the red zone and the crystalline dreaming fog just below that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s random magical pictures past that point.  Because &amp;quot;micro rituals&amp;quot; can make it appear at any point from the green line onward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1 of a good animation about that topic would be to make it clear everyone will get puffs, if they get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too many think it depends on something else. So they won&amp;#39;t try hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As will inorganic beings show up, once someone can perceive the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also inevitable. And should be made clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, it&amp;#39;s so far fetched that people believe the appearance of inorganic beings depends on something else. So it doesn&amp;#39;t motivate them the way it ought to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on this planet we&amp;#39;re surrounded by more of them than there are of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#39;re just looking for humans who can perceive them. Possibly that&amp;#39;s even part of their own attempts to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means anyone who moves their assemblage point to the green line or below has a chance to catch a glimpse of them. By the time it reaches deep red, I can&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mystics in all systems had visits from inorganic beings. They just misunderstood them because their systems had decayed too far to carry that understanding anymore. And greed made them not want to understand. They love their fantasy interpretations of what IOBs are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re potentially profitable!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The largest organized money making enterprises in human history, namely Judaism and Buddhism, were the results of severe misunderstandings of inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the tensegrity we were given helps you get silent, and also interests the double. Who comes off the walls of your egg shell where it&amp;#39;s been hiding. To become the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs cause inorganic beings to manifest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very hard to be clear enough on that, even in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because people misrepresent how much effort they make. And try to change the rules to get themselves more attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or don&amp;#39;t even have a good understanding of what a &amp;quot;real effort&amp;quot; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can solve that, with an animation about recapitulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People make dull, shitty lists. And barely get into it enough to even find a place to try it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just sit upon a bed with a list that fits on a single page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So an animation about recap is also important, for the purpose of teaching darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To show what a &amp;quot;real effort&amp;quot; actually looks like, using a topic which everyone knows doesn&amp;#39;t require you to &amp;quot;get lucky&amp;quot; and be visited by anything supernatural at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows they can sit and remember past events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t know, for certain, they can see puffs or inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So show them that even though you know you can do that, meaning follow the rules of recapitulation and have it &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; on the surface, it still won&amp;#39;t get you anywhere magical without a good effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is easy to define.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the quality of the list you make, and in the place you set aside in which to recapitulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why Carlos made fun of my recapitulation crate, but I think he had personal motivations clouding his judgement on that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He saw it on the cover of Nagualist Newsletter, brought to him by one of the inner circle women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And thought, &amp;quot;Shit... I hope they don&amp;#39;t start wanting to build those in my backyard!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t want to look out into his very nice picnic / stage / tensegrity practice space and see an endless sea of shoddily constructed crates looking like a slum in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suggest that would be a big mistake for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to emphasize doing a very good job of recap, INCLUDING finding an ideal place within your means, in which to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a gesture to the spirit, which also teaches about what a &amp;quot;real effort&amp;quot; is actually like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the 3rd &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; thing in darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A shocking thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Silent Knowledge, every single tensegrity motion summons a &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge is &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s also the inevitable result of darkroom. Because it activates, automatically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So ideally the assemblage point moves smoothly along the J curve, and when it gets to the purple zone every single movement in the tensegrity becomes a &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; selector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is beyond anything you could imagine from my words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to use an old picture to show it, but that&amp;#39;s not nearly enough to convey what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take some obvious cases from tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Affection for the Energy Body&amp;quot; pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The part where you form the knees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That motion activates the &amp;quot;topic of knees&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they materialize! Or you get a lesson on how knees are used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about forming the feet?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually tie my double&amp;#39;s tennis shoes at the end of that, and if I&amp;#39;m in Silent Knowledge I can see the bows!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or any other number of absolutely distracting presentations about the topic of the individual movements Carlos combined, can take place before your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might get a lecture on &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; he did that. And &amp;quot;what he intended to happen in the long run&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;do your burden at time code 1:23 in the Tensegrity pass&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a move on a youtube video you are trying to duplicate as best you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, in SK it becomes REAL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You literally pose a question, to a &amp;quot;Presentation Method&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity form itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably can&amp;#39;t convey this, but I&amp;#39;ll keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When done in silence, over and over, the sights you noticed while doing the tensegrity forms store into your memories of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In silence, a memory becomes an &amp;quot;expectation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent expectations are one of the cleanest links to intent any of us can manage at our level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just having seen something cool during a specific tensegrity form, stores the intent of that happening again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because those emanations have glowed in the dark sea of the emanations at large.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when &amp;quot;looking that direction&amp;quot;, those are most likely to &amp;quot;skim&amp;quot; for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do the same in ordinary situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put a red light bulb in the little lamp that is for your home&amp;#39;s front door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guarantee, people driving by at night will &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; your house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same happens with tensegrity, done over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point the sights are so continuous in that specific Tensegrity form that it &amp;quot;flows&amp;quot; with magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has become a silent knowledge presentation method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the rule of SKPMs is, they respond to questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost as if they were sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in fact the emanations, overall, are very sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just takes a certain number of them glowing for that property to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes &amp;quot;energetic mass&amp;quot; which leads to cross harmonics in the individual strands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is something so obvious and yet so magical it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to see, going on with Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &amp;quot;unhooks&amp;quot; you from your attachment to the river of shit, while you can sustain enough attention to perceive the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as if you were never born at all, when you get it to become an SKPM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning as if you were never trapped by the intent of our current situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, the story goes that our &amp;quot;definitive journey&amp;quot; was interrupted because we &amp;quot;collided&amp;quot; with the intent of this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And took a birth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity causes your awareness to drift away from that situation inside an SKPM bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The form itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to clarify that in the animations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also resolve the disorder of those pictures on that J curve diagram.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juann already suspected it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That you get silent knowledge, even up in the green zone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you do it in an SKPM &amp;quot;micro bubble&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are actually &amp;quot;dream bubbles&amp;quot; into which you entered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prefer the &amp;quot;stand alone&amp;quot; dream bubble floating in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are much less confusing, than when you &amp;quot;zip&amp;quot; into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a loss of lucidity when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s also a mistake on my part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It needs fixing in the animations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One way is to treat that SKPM effect, as the &amp;quot;third real thing&amp;quot; in darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Define it, so people notice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that it&amp;#39;s not some distant goal, so far away it seems hopeless for people who can already make it to the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once they make it to the green line, we kind of failed if they don&amp;#39;t go on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Failed in our explanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We showed people that doing darkroom does pay off in a little pocket change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We put &amp;quot;money&amp;quot; in their little kid pockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But little kids don&amp;#39;t really understand money very well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to give them a place to exchange the money, for candy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something they DO understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep the little kid mowing your lawn weekly, you need to hook him to buying candy with the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it just keeps going into his &amp;quot;piggy bank&amp;quot;, and we insist he should take pride in how high it&amp;#39;s filling up, it&amp;#39;s not enough motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at what happened to Tensegrity practitioners! They were told their piggy banks are filling up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t make any difference.

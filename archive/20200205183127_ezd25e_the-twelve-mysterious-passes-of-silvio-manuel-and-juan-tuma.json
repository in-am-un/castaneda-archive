Also, here's a archive.org* *page with* [*very slightly different descriptions*](https://web.archive.org/web/20020809065815/http://www.tensegrity.yucom.be/Notes/12.html) *:*\n\n\"Silvio Manuel and Juan Tuma were two sorcerer shamans of the generation that preceded the one of Carlos Castaneda, Carol Tiggs, Florinda Donner-Grau and Taisha Abelar.  Silvio Manuel was a dancer and an acrobat. Together with Juan Tuma, also  a shaman, they had a set of twelve magical passes which they danced. To them, each and every pass was a gateway to exquisite states of being.\n\nThe Twelve Mysterious Passes of Silvio Manuel and Juan Tuma are simple yet remarkable movements. Each and every one of them represents a certain intent that propels the practitioner into inconceivable states of awareness.\n\n**1. Grisly Bear Run:**  Bend over at the waist, keeping the stomach muscles tight to relieve stress on the lower back. The hands dangle straight down from the shoulders. Jog in place, only lifting the feet 6 inches or so.\n\n[grisley bear run](https://i.redd.it/2mtnzpdaz4f41.gif)\n\n**2. Kicking sideways with the knee and heel:**  Lift the left knee as high as you can and bring the knee forcefully to the right, pivoting on the planted right foot. Put both feet back on the floor and mirror.\n\n[kicking sideways](https://i.redd.it/f3ozufifz4f41.gif)\n\n**3. Kicking the buttocks:**  This one resembles the old dance step -- the body leans forward as if running very fast, but stay in place as the legs kick backwards. The arms swing naturally as if running.\n\n**4.  Assessing the situation:**  Right foot steps behind the left, the left foot lifts off the floor but falls back into same spot it lifted from. Now the right foot returns to its original position. Now mirror. Use the arms to keep a graceful, natural rhythm.\n\n[assessing](https://i.redd.it/4oduatpsz4f41.gif)\n\n**5. Sundial slide:**  Think of standing on a sundial facing 12. The feet start together naturally, right crosses over left and steps toward 10:30 but the body stays parallel to the original line, the left steps towards 10:30, right steps towards 10:30; feet pivot as body and toes face 10:30. Feet slide right-left-right to the original starting point. Mirror starting with left foot.\n\n[sundial slide](https://i.redd.it/s171twc305f41.gif)\n\n**6. Scoop step**:  The feet start together naturally.  The left foot scoops inward as it rubs up the inside of the right calf as  it side-steps left; the right foot slides over into original distance from left. Take as many steps as you like in this direction, then mirror.\n\n**7. Scoop &amp; Spread:**  The same footwork as 6., but this time the arms do the  same motion as \"Spreading the Energy Body Laterally.\" (cross the wrists in front of the solar plexus, with fingers pointing up. Then, spread the hands as if you were unfolding a parchment scroll. When moving left, the left hand is on top, and vice versa.)\n\n**8. Juan Tuma's  Twist:**  The feet start about six inches apart and perfectly  parallel. Pivot on the balls of the feet so that the heels point right.  Pivot the heels left-right-left, and lift the left heel off of the floor.  Mirror.\n\n**9. Heel dance:**  Bend at the waist, keeping the stomach muscles tight to relieve stress on the lower back. The palms are flat but not overly tight as the fingers point at the floor. Stand on the heels of your feet and walk in place.\n\n**10. Step of power:**  Stand naturally. Beginning with the left foot, run in place three steps, lift the knee as high as you can on the third step, pausing with the knee in the air. Do this again starting with the other foot, etc., alternating.\n\n[step of power](https://i.redd.it/r8dwm1qe05f41.gif)\n\n**11. The Shaman's Dance with Death:** Stand  naturally. The right foot steps behind the left, the left foot steps behind the right, the right foot lifts and smoothly falls back into its previous spot. The left foot takes an outward swinging step, so that the whole body is now facing the right. Restart: Right step back, left step back, right foot lifts, falls back, and the left foot swings out to the side. Restart...\n\n[dance with death](https://i.redd.it/kb2re42j05f41.gif)\n\n**12. Rain Dance:** This is the classic elementary school Injun dance step. The feet make sliding, shuffling steps of about 4-6 inches, never really leaving the floor.\"\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nAnd here's a data-dump of a text file with some more of Silvio Manuel's dance-flavored passes:\n\n[http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt)  &amp; [Archive.org Backup](https://web.archive.org/web/19990222080507/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt)\n\nSubject: sorcery passes from recent workshops\n\nDate:    Sun, 28 Jan 1996 18:54:43 -0500\n\nFrom:    [Rjuna@aol.com](mailto:Rjuna@aol.com)\n\nSILVIO MANUEL'S PASSES\n\n1. Stand in horse stance. Rapidly flick heels inwards, alternating sides.\n2. Exaggerated walk forward, swinging feet out to sides, starting with the left foot. as the left foot moves forward, the right arm comes down  in front of the body with a jerk, as the palm turns quickly from facing the left side to face the right side, thumb down. The left arm moves with the right leg. To go backwards, do a braid walk, swinging the arms horizontally across the body at chest level, but this time it's the right arm with the right leg, etc.\n3. Take a step forward with the left leg, then slide the right foot forward slightly;  take a step with the right foot, and slide the left forward, etc. To go backwards, take a step backwards with the left foot and slide the right foot, etc. Swing the shoulders.\n4. Horse stance; scrape the inside of the left foot along the ground to the right and lift the foot up about a foot high; repeat with the right foot, etc. Do this rapidly. A variation is to place the feet at about a 45 degree angle and do the scraping and lifting at this angle.\n5. Make pawing motion with the left foot 3 times; then with left foot behind the right, bend left leg, keeping the right leg straight, and the right foot flexed upward. You are supposed to flex the foot so that you feel the pull of the muscles on the front of the shin area (one of the 5 points). Repeat with the right leg. A variation is to do the pawing quickly and pause only slightly with the foot flexed upward.\n6. This is a very exaggerated braid-weave combo step \\[as in Recalling Dispersed Energy\\] forward. The backward step is a normal backward braid.\n7. The Paisley Step, because the pattern it forms on the floor looks like a paisley. Start with the weight on the left foot, and bring the right foot up, out to the right and then back along the left foot and then toe down behind and 90 degrees to the left foot. Then bring the right foot up again and along the left foot to the front of the body and out to the right side and back, toes down, to the same position behind the left foot. A variation is to pivot the moving foot at the end of each set so that you are facing 90 degrees from your previous position.\n8. The T-square step. Starting with the feet parallel and pointing forward, step out with the left foot, and then bring the right foot out in front of the left foot, making a \"T,\" with the right foot pointing toward the right. Then bring the left foot parallel and slightly ahead of the right foot, and continue making 90 degree T's, until you end up at your starting point. You can add the paisley step to this one as well.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nand finally just for fun! *(these were actually posted by readers of the original page :)*\n\n[dance

The feet make sliding, shuffling steps of about 4-6 inches, never really leaving the floor.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s a data-dump of a text file with some more of Silvio Manuel&amp;#39;s dance-flavored passes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt\"&gt;http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19990222080507/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt\"&gt;Archive.org Backup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Subject: sorcery passes from recent workshops&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Date:    Sun, 28 Jan 1996 18:54:43 -0500&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From:    [&lt;a href=\"mailto:Rjuna@aol.com\"&gt;Rjuna@aol.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:Rjuna@aol.com\"&gt;Rjuna@aol.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SILVIO MANUEL&amp;#39;S PASSES&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stand in horse stance. Rapidly flick heels inwards, alternating sides.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exaggerated walk forward, swinging feet out to sides, starting with the left foot. as the left foot moves forward, the right arm comes down  in front of the body with a jerk, as the palm turns quickly from facing the left side to face the right side, thumb down. The left arm moves with the right leg. To go backwards, do a braid walk, swinging the arms horizontally across the body at chest level, but this time it&amp;#39;s the right arm with the right leg, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take a step forward with the left leg, then slide the right foot forward slightly;  take a step with the right foot, and slide the left forward, etc. To go backwards, take a step backwards with the left foot and slide the right foot, etc. Swing the shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Horse stance; scrape the inside of the left foot along the ground to the right and lift the foot up about a foot high; repeat with the right foot, etc. Do this rapidly. A variation is to place the feet at about a 45 degree angle and do the scraping and lifting at this angle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make pawing motion with the left foot 3 times; then with left foot behind the right, bend left leg, keeping the right leg straight, and the right foot flexed upward. You are supposed to flex the foot so that you feel the pull of the muscles on the front of the shin area (one of the 5 points). Repeat with the right leg. A variation is to do the pawing quickly and pause only slightly with the foot flexed upward.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is a very exaggerated braid-weave combo step [as in Recalling Dispersed Energy] forward. The backward step is a normal backward braid.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Paisley Step, because the pattern it forms on the floor looks like a paisley. Start with the weight on the left foot, and bring the right foot up, out to the right and then back along the left foot and then toe down behind and 90 degrees to the left foot. Then bring the right foot up again and along the left foot to the front of the body and out to the right side and back, toes down, to the same position behind the left foot. A variation is to pivot the moving foot at the end of each set so that you are facing 90 degrees from your previous position.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The T-square step. Starting with the feet parallel and pointing forward, step out with the left foot, and then bring the right foot out in front of the left foot, making a &amp;quot;T,&amp;quot; with the right foot pointing toward the right. Then bring the left foot parallel and slightly ahead of the right foot, and continue making 90 degree T&amp;#39;s, until you end up at your starting point. You can add the paisley step to this one as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and finally just for fun! &lt;em&gt;(these were

Lights off,  and I get  a near instant dazzling display of colors.\n\nBut I feel 2 minutes is good enough for discussion, because if you can do 2 minutes you can eventually do 2 hours.\n\nOr to put it another way, if you can learn to be silent for 2 minutes,  you\u2019re suitable for finding colors in order to move the assemblage point.\n\nSome people can\u2019t use that path. I don\u2019t have enough experience with them to figure out why. But fortunately, there are other ways to get it to move.  The head bobbing technique for example, where you sit in a chair with eyes closed, and look for colors that way.  You fall asleep, head bobs, wakes you up, and you learn to find the middle spot.  \n\nOr use gazing at ferns, to produce weird effects.  Stare at those and try to be silent.\n\nRemember, our situation sucks!  We have no nagual to push our assemblage point into heightened awareness.  \n\nSo we\u2019re forced to move it ourselves.  And likely until we can move it to heightened awareness, most of the wonderful techniques from Carlos\u2019 books won\u2019t be doable.\n\nAs for how long it takes to see colors, you'll see them instantly in darkness.  You just won't accept them.  \n\nYou've lived your whole life ignoring slight distortions in what you see.  They're considered just eye defects.   \n\nAnd no silence is needed to stop ignoring those.\n\nGo read about Carlos \u201cfinding his spot\u201d, and you\u2019ll realize that don Juan taught him to look for colors right off the bat.  And he found them, but it took hours of trying.\n\nAt that point he wasn\u2019t capable of being silent.  He just managed to drift his assemblage point by the sheer act of not-doing. Not-doing can be a substitute for silence, because it also interrupts the normal internal dialogue.\n\nWhat might you see at first? Perhaps just a slight variation in some grey you can see, which you would normally absolutely ignore.\n\nMaybe a line you imagine is there.  Or some fuzzy whiteness, but not enough to write home about.\n\nIf you think you see something, but then feel like an idiot for believing that, you\u2019re on the right track!\n\nYou\u2019ll refuse to focus your attention on them at first, having learned to look around them.  \n\nWith 2 minutes of silence the assemblage point is loosened and can begin to move. \n\nWatching even the vaguest of colors or fine lines will cause the assemblage point to drift towards heightened awareness, and somewhere along the way the colors become stronger.  \n\nOnce they\u2019re bright enough that you can\u2019t dismiss them anymore, your assemblage point will get a little boost from the energy released by the feeling of success.\n\nThat feeling of success creates a tiny dent in the movement of the assemblage point.  A dent you can return to next time.  I suspect there\u2019s more to this than I\u2019m aware of so far.  A good future investigation for someone who needs to teach, would be to learn to exploit that self-denting effect.\n\nSo you\u2019re staring at vague colors, maybe some not vague, and every time you \u201crecognize\u201d that those aren\u2019t merely eye defects, you widen the path leading to that position of the assemblage point.\n\nBut you need to keep that up for an hour, unfortunately. That\u2019s how long it takes for the eyes to get used to the darkness.  For whatever reason, you see more colors when they\u2019re in that mode.\n\nThe sweet spot of colors, for finding your own inorganic being, is discrete puffs of purple, or any other color, floating around the room.\n\nOr more precisely, floating where your head turns.  At first they\u2019re attached to the movement of your head, the same way the bank of fog was attached to Carlos\u2019 left temple, and rotated when he tried to face it.\n\nCarlos sort of taunted us with that, in some of his long forms where you scan above you with your eyes, looking for energy to grab.\n\nHe was making fun of us, but in a way you could only discover, once you realized what the joke was.\n\nYou have to go through that battle of \u201cdirectionality\u201d.  \n\nBut, just forget about it and don\u2019t doubt just because they follow your head. Trust me when I say, they\u2019ll eventually behave like solid matter.  \n\nWhat about the 2 hours?  That\u2019s how long it takes, watching and playing with colors, for your assemblage point to move fully into heightened awareness.\n\nWe have no more info on how long this ought to take. It seems to be outside what Carlos and the witches spoke about, because they were pushed into heightened awareness by someone else.  \n\nThey never had to learn about the 2 hour mark from personal experience.   Once you've been pushed into heightened awareness, things are permanently modified to make that position easier to repeat.\n\nWe have to start from scratch.\n\nBut they did mention it in an off-handed manner a few times, contributing to more confusion among the students.  Is it 2 minutes or 2 hours???  That used to be a burning question.\n\nThey're different things!\n\nYou know you\u2019ve reached the 2 hour mark when you confidentially have no thoughts, and aren\u2019t worried about them coming back in.  The colors have hypnogogic dreaming images in them, and your breathing becomes slow and automatic, with only the stomach moving in and out. \n\nEach breath has the pleasure sensation that a yawn can bring.\n\nThat\u2019s heightened awareness! Close your eyes.  You should see, \"the wall\".\n\nAnd you\u2019ll get to keep most of that feeling, for at least part of the next day.\n\nAt that point, your full dreaming attention comes out, and the room lights up with magic.  Dreams will be floating by, beings resting on puffs of purple color will try to get your attention with whatever shape they\u2019ve assumed.\n\nDark objects will zip by you from right to left, leaving a trail of black silence.\n\nAt the 2 hour mark you can also stop the world.  You got there by playing with colors, but now just ignore them and look for mental images in your mind.\n\nYes, you\u2019re silent. But are you still seeing the face of that cook who spit on your hash browns 20 years ago, because you sent them back?\n\nOr your dog pooping as you walk along, because you won\u2019t let him do it on the grouchy neighbor\u2019s lawn?\n\nOr the first time your first girlfriend let you take her clothes off. \n\nThe expression on her face is still stuck in your mind.\n\nOur minds are filled with these images, which initiate the internal dialogue and serve as a beacon back to ordinary consciousness.\n\nYou might have shut that voice off, but you didn\u2019t yet shut off the motivation for it.\n\nGet rid of those latent images in the mind, and the world simply stops. It goes away.\n\nIt has to!  You aren\u2019t focusing your attention on this world anymore. \n\nSo the universe offers you a different choice. \n\nThat\u2019s the magic of being human.  So many choices.\n\nIt's almost like, the universe loves to feed you.  But as long as you have a plate of food in front of you, it won't offer something else.\n\nSo push that bowl of chocolate pudding aside, and see what the universe serves up next!\n\nThat's why there's nothing to learn in sorcery. You just have to stop obsessing over this world, and you'll get a view of the other ones.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t remember stopping the world the first time or two. \n\nYou\u2019ll wake up on your side, cursing that you feel asleep.\n\nWell don\u2019t! \n\nSlap yourself on the face while trying to stop the world, if you feel yourself losing consciousness.    \n\nOr even if you feel yourself slipping into a dream, but don't want to do that right now, because you're trying to stop the world.\n\nSomehow slapping yourself also makes it easier to remember what happens when the world stops.  \n\nMaybe because your cheeks still hurt, even if you ended up somewhere else.\n\nEdit two", "edited": 1581014455.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fgpwekb", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;2 minutes&amp;quot; is really a range, which one of the witches clarified could be anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos and the witches never liked giving an exact number. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I did hear one of the witches give their personal number:  1 minute 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My own is near to 2 minutes, unless I\u2019ve been practicing daily for hours, in which case it\u2019s 2 seconds.

A dent you can return to next time.  I suspect there\u2019s more to this than I\u2019m aware of so far.  A good future investigation for someone who needs to teach, would be to learn to exploit that self-denting effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you\u2019re staring at vague colors, maybe some not vague, and every time you \u201crecognize\u201d that those aren\u2019t merely eye defects, you widen the path leading to that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you need to keep that up for an hour, unfortunately. That\u2019s how long it takes for the eyes to get used to the darkness.  For whatever reason, you see more colors when they\u2019re in that mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sweet spot of colors, for finding your own inorganic being, is discrete puffs of purple, or any other color, floating around the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or more precisely, floating where your head turns.  At first they\u2019re attached to the movement of your head, the same way the bank of fog was attached to Carlos\u2019 left temple, and rotated when he tried to face it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos sort of taunted us with that, in some of his long forms where you scan above you with your eyes, looking for energy to grab.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was making fun of us, but in a way you could only discover, once you realized what the joke was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to go through that battle of \u201cdirectionality\u201d.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, just forget about it and don\u2019t doubt just because they follow your head. Trust me when I say, they\u2019ll eventually behave like solid matter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about the 2 hours?  That\u2019s how long it takes, watching and playing with colors, for your assemblage point to move fully into heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have no more info on how long this ought to take. It seems to be outside what Carlos and the witches spoke about, because they were pushed into heightened awareness by someone else.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never had to learn about the 2 hour mark from personal experience.   Once you&amp;#39;ve been pushed into heightened awareness, things are permanently modified to make that position easier to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they did mention it in an off-handed manner a few times, contributing to more confusion among the students.  Is it 2 minutes or 2 hours???  That used to be a burning question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re different things!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know you\u2019ve reached the 2 hour mark when you confidentially have no thoughts, and aren\u2019t worried about them coming back in.  The colors have hypnogogic dreaming images in them, and your breathing becomes slow and automatic, with only the stomach moving in and out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each breath has the pleasure sensation that a yawn can bring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s heightened awareness! Close your eyes.  You should see, &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you\u2019ll get to keep most of that feeling, for at least part of the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, your full dreaming attention comes out, and the room lights up with magic.  Dreams will be floating by, beings resting on puffs of purple color will try to get your attention with whatever shape they\u2019ve assumed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dark objects will zip by you from right to left, leaving a trail of black silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the 2 hour mark you can also stop the world.  You got there by playing with colors, but now just ignore them and look for mental images in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you\u2019re silent. But are you still seeing the face of that cook who spit on your hash browns 20 years ago, because you sent them back?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or your dog pooping as you walk along, because you won\u2019t let him do it on the grouchy neighbor\u2019s lawn?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the first time your first girlfriend let you take her clothes off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The expression on her face is still stuck in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our minds are filled with these images, which initiate the internal dialogue and serve as a beacon back to ordinary consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might have shut that voice off, but you didn\u2019t yet shut off the motivation for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get rid of those latent images in the mind, and the world simply stops. It goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to!  You aren\u2019t focusing your attention on this world anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the universe offers you a different choice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the magic of being human.  So many choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost like, the universe loves to feed you.  But as long as you have a plate of food in front of you, it won&amp;#39;t offer something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So push that bowl of chocolate pudding aside, and see what the universe serves up next!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s nothing to learn in sorcery. You just have to stop obsessing over this world, and you&amp;#39;ll get a view of the other ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You probably won\u2019t remember stopping the world the first time or two. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll wake up on your side, cursing that you feel asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well don\u2019t! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slap yourself on the face while trying to stop the world, if you feel yourself losing consciousness.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even if you feel yourself slipping into a dream, but don&amp;#39;t want to do that right now, because you&amp;#39;re trying to stop the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow slapping yourself also makes it easier to remember what happens when the world stops.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe because your cheeks still hurt, even if you ended up somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit two&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ezd25e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ezd25e/the_twelve_mysterious_passes_of_silvio_manuel_and/fgpwekb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1581013297.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1581013297.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fgp3b7e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jd198703", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1580995703.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fgn5d7e", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3tl0tnl8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thanks for this great description!\n\n&gt;Let\u2019s say that through sheer hard work (forcing it off), you manage to become silent for 2 minutes.\n\n&gt;That's the turning point!

So these passes must look really odd.\n\nLet me go back to the beginning regarding these passes, so that everyone knows, it's not as stupid as it looks.\n\nI was taught more than 1000 of these movements by Castaneda himself. Most of the time I was thinking,\n\n\"What a load of horseshit!!! What on earth is Carlos up to?\"\n\nBoy was I wrong!\n\nLet's look at this 2 ways.\n\nAs a rank beginner, and as an advanced person in a deep state of silence, viewing magic all around in the room.\n\nThe beginner's problem is, stopping that little voice in their head. You can use meditation to do that, Zen koans, contemplation, or whatever meditative technique you like.\n\nThey all do the same thing: They interrupt the normal internal dialogue, which keeps you focused on this world alone.\n\nAs it turns out, there are hundreds of worlds just waiting for us to enter.\n\nLet\u2019s say that through sheer hard work (forcing it off), you manage to become silent for 2 minutes.\n\nThat's the turning point! If you are in a dark room, you'll start to see colors and lines on things.\n\nThe problem for a beginner at that point is, silence alone will not move you into a different state of consciousness.\n\nConsider yourself like a dog, chained to a fence.  Your internal dialogue is the chain.\n\nShutting it off for 2 minutes is like removing the chain at your neck. You're free to go!\n\nBut you'll just sit there, until you see a cat, or something else lures you to take off.\n\nSomething has to call to you, to get you to go in a different direction.\n\nOr to put it in technical terms, something has to move your point of assemblage. The place where you select what to pay attention to, in all of the worlds available.\n\nYou aren't even aware of this assemblage point!  And that's because, you've been chained to the fence since childhood.\n\nOnce the chain is gone, you still need something to cause your assemblage point to move.\n\nThe tensegrity passes can help it move. As don Juan said (Carlos\u2019 teacher), the old sorcerers, who invented all this stuff, became desperate for any way to move the \u201cassemblage point\u201d.\n\nAnd these physical movements can do it, as lame as they appear.\n\nMyself, I don\u2019t advise using them for that. It\u2019s too pathetic. The movement is hardly noticeable if you are a beginner.\n\nBetter to just stare at colors in the darkness, since those can lure you into your dreaming attention.\n\nNow let\u2019s take the opposite view: the advanced practitioner.\n\nHe\u2019s been silent for a full 2 hours, and the room is buzzing with magic. Last night I watched 4 dreams form in my dark room, with activity I could watch up close. Spirits came and went in the room, each one a potential friend if I wanted to put the time into training them.\n\nI even got a guest appearance by a witch named Cholita. \n\nWell, just the top half of her.   The bottom half was missing.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t linger.  She showed me some train tickets, one yellow, and one blue.  I'm afraid to find out what that means.  I guess she's off on the train again soon.\n\nIn that state, where you can already perceive the impossible, any tensegrity movement is like a push-button switch.\n\nIt causes drastic things to happen. Even a simple movement of the foot can do it.  Sweeping the hand across the air can paint a brilliant violet streak that remains as long as you watch it.  Twisting the trunk can cause yellow colors to appear, on top of the purple clouds.\n\nThat\u2019s because, we are essentially made out of awareness. And when you aren\u2019t dumbing yourself down with that awful voice yapping in your head, your awareness isn\u2019t forced to focus only on this world.\n\nI haven\u2019t tried these passes in many years, but for example, #4, \u201cAssessing the situation\u201d is what I use to step into another world, when the possibility is available to me.\n\nIt looks like this: you\u2019re in the dark, perfect darkness, eyes open, walking around, fully awake. You see purple clouds and puffs everywhere, with grey/black lines connecting things. Once in a while, a black dot will zip by, as if there were a large bumble bee in your room.  But it makes absolutely no sound, and it leaves a trail of black.\n\nIf you look at a flat surface, you see \u201cthe wall\u201d. That\u2019s your \u201csecond attention\u201d, or dreaming attention, forming a flat surface, so that you can manage it better. Use it for whatever you like.\n\nIn that state you might sense other colors, such as pink, orange, and green. You look around, and see vague beams of those colors.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t strong enough to focus on clearly, and so you can\u2019t find out what they really are. Or what they can become.\n\nYou use this movement to \u201cassess\u201d the situation. On stepping back, you find yourself fully in another world, dominated by those beams of colors, and leaking with a feeling of feminine energy.\n\nIt\u2019s a passage way that witches can use, to move from one place to another.\n\nThat\u2019s what those lame passes can do.\n\nCould you make up your own that work just as well?\n\nSure.  I do that nightly.  But my \u201cmade up\u201d movements are based on having been saturated by Carlos. So I kind of know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nI've seen Cholita doing her own \"made up movement\", inspired by Howard Lee.\n\nAs far as chi gong goes, it might be wonderful. But that technique scatters energy randomly.\n\nIt's NOT a good made-up movement.\n\nThey aren't all equal.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1580943396.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fgn5d7e", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been annoying the Zen folks lately, hoping to interest some of them in exploring magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic is all the stuff they ignore because they&amp;#39;ve been told to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One gave me an explanation: It might not be good for your dharma to play with magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe a Buddhist in here could explain that to me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are new people each day. So these passes must look really odd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me go back to the beginning regarding these passes, so that everyone knows, it&amp;#39;s not as stupid as it looks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was taught more than 1000 of these movements by Castaneda himself. Most of the time I was thinking,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What a load of horseshit!!! What on earth is Carlos up to?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boy was I wrong!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at this 2 ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a rank beginner, and as an advanced person in a deep state of silence, viewing magic all around in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The beginner&amp;#39;s problem is, stopping that little voice in their head. You can use meditation to do that, Zen koans, contemplation, or whatever meditative technique you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all do the same thing: They interrupt the normal internal dialogue, which keeps you focused on this world alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there are hundreds of worlds just waiting for us to enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s say that through sheer hard work (forcing it off), you manage to become silent for 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the turning point! If you are in a dark room, you&amp;#39;ll start to see colors and lines on things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem for a beginner at that point is, silence alone will not move you into a different state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider yourself like a dog, chained to a fence.  Your internal dialogue is the chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shutting it off for 2 minutes is like removing the chain at your neck. You&amp;#39;re free to go!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll just sit there, until you see a cat, or something else lures you to take off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something has to call to you, to get you to go in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to put it in technical terms, something has to move your point of assemblage. The place where you select what to pay attention to, in all of the worlds available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t even aware of this assemblage point!  And that&amp;#39;s because, you&amp;#39;ve been chained to the fence since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the chain is gone, you still need something to cause your assemblage point to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity passes can help it move.

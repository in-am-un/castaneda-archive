At least, that's the path I know, so far.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b226043828d17d6fe94f7fc77cd14be8b549e3ac](https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b226043828d17d6fe94f7fc77cd14be8b549e3ac)\n\nYet, that is in fact somewhat untrue.  You can get \"previews\" of silent knowledge anywhere from green zone down.\n\nNow the next part gets weird.   I have to \"take liberties\".  But they're true. Just too weird to say out loud.\n\nI saw an intense \"yellow puff\", while trying to finish moving my assemblage point to Silent Knowledge position.\n\nI thought I'd cleared all those puffs out of the room!  There was the whitish light on the walls.  This puff, as fun as it looked, was a bit annoying. \n\nIt had \"escaped\" from my pouches?\n\nI decided to scoop it onto my right lower \"pouch\". That's what beginners are supposed to be doing, and need constant reminders.\n\nYou are NOT trying to have super cool druglike experiences, so you can brag to your friends.\n\nShame on you if that's what you think!\n\nThat's not sorcery!!!!\n\nIt's only a \"happy fringe benefit\". \n\nLike one of those action films where they blow an entire building to pieces to destroy the illegal stuff stockpiled in it, and one of the heros comments, \"You know, that annoying bodyguard guy was in the basement.\"\n\nAnd the main action figure guy jokes, \"A happy coincidence!\"\n\nIf you pursue that type of thinking, that amazing visual effects is our goal,  YOU WILL FAIL!\n\nWon't do any good for me to say that.  In 2 months 300 more new people will flow through here, all laboring under the same delusion.\n\nI suppose the only real cure for that delusion is CONSTANT amazing magic, \"in your face\".  When you have that for HOURS each night, you \"get over it\".\n\nAnd realize the true purpose of sorcery.  To clean your connecting link to intent.\n\nSo I scooped up that intense yellow puff, who's fringes were jet black.  Oddly, those are usually fairly round.  I'd like to say perfectly round, but the edges are jagged with jet blackness.\n\nI gazed into the yellow puff, trying to figure out if it wasn't just a purple puff, and my \"color interpretation\" mechanism had turned purple into yellow.  Maybe the purple was \"too bright\", and it went light.  The way video cameras tend to do, when something is too bright. It goes all white.\n\nZuleica could do that.  Change her interpretation of the colors.  She preferred reddish orange, possibly over purple.\n\nI stuffed the yellow puff onto the right side of my stomach, somewhat unsure that was the right thing to do with it.\n\nThe area in front of me became intense purple. Not puffs, but flowing solid clouds.  The entire thing must have been twice as wide as my body, and a foot taller than me.\n\nIt was like having the purple puffs offer to dance with me.\n\nLike an idiot, I \"flowed\" around viewing it, like it was a single sheet from a newspaper that blew in a high wind, smacked into my face, and was stuck there because of the wind pressure.  Or a paper stuck on the grill of your car, going down the freeway.\n\nIf you ever had a newspaper smack into your face in a high wind, and refuse to blow off, that's what it was like.  Except intense purple.\n\nAfter 30 seconds of \"exploring\" the possible uses of it, and even having a tiny bit of the \"book deal\" mind sneak in and consider how to \"write it up\" as a technique, the intense purple cloud moved back a few feet.\n\nI was facing it.\n\nIt said, \"It's me you idiot!  Your double...  Weren't you trying to get me to come help you finish this?\"\n\nI had forgotten. The double comes in several forms.\n\nBoth forms you can \"discover\" in the darkroom, and others written about in the books.\n\nSo here's a little \"poison\" to inject into your mind.  But it's more like victorian era poison, designed to give your face a \"healthy\" ghostly white look.\n\nGenaro demonstrated two forms of the double for Carlos in one story from the books.\n\nHe was sleeping on the matts where the apprentices also slept.  Don Juan told Carlos to hurry and wake him up, they had things to do.\n\nDon Genaro stood up, I believe he stretched, and then he started to do \"impossible\" things.\n\nUltimately he was walking on the ceiling.\n\nHe finally turned into a blue ball of light.\n\nDon Juan explained, that's the \"preferred form\" of the energy body (double) for the new seers. Impersonal.\n\nSo the next time you are building your energy body using Tensegrity and scooping puffs onto your pouches, ask yourself this question.\n\nWhich version of  the double (energy body) are you building?\n\nLook down at the blobs stuck to your pouches, and see if you can figure that question out.\n\nYou'll likely realize, you've misunderstood many things.", "edited": 1649086556.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i3d2092", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to figure out why you get a glimpse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory: the double.

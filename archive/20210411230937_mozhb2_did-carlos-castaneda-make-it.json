Or perhaps, \"relocates you\".\n\nYou can experiment with it, in that state.  You barely bend your little finger, as small of a movement as you can manage.  Anyone looking right at the finger would not be able to tell you if it moved or not.\n\nBut what you perceive is shockwaves of  yellowish light, rippling up into the sky, with jet black rushing back in.\n\nReality is under the control of even tiny pieces of your body.\n\nYou don't exist at that point, and the movement of your finger causes you to exist again.\n\nI can't think of any other way to put it.\n\n&gt;You said you ended up in some bus station. That was your double if i understood it right.\n\nNo, it was probably La Gorda, coming back from a visit to Santa Monica.\n\nI have a stronger connection to her, because she came up here with Carlos on occasion.\n\nAnd I'd been wanting to teach Cholita her flying technique, to which Cholita had agreed.\n\nI got a first hand lesson in that flying technique, from what might have been Don Genaro.\n\nHowever, it never occurred to me to look up and see faces. I was la Gorda.  She wouldn't look up in the middle of trying to get her fingers right, to see who she was talking to.\n\nThat's the problem with re-runs.  You can't alter it.\n\nOr better put, you wouldn't think to alter it. Or even to look in a mirror!\n\n&gt;3-5 am seems like the best time.\n\nIt really is, unfortunately.  That local effect where everyone's tonal is asleep, is true.\n\nI've been fighting it the last few days, but it always comes down to, entering into dreams while awake is much easier when everyone is asleep.\n\n&gt;i was introduced to Carlos at 12 \n\nMe too, except it was 1968.

None.\n\nBut by the time you realize that, you'll be in your mid 50s.  And it'll seem like it's too late to do anything about it, so you'll give in, and brainwash the grandkids to think it's a happy life ahead for them.\n\nIt's not.\n\nIt's \"safe\" in the chicken coop.  Cozy even.\n\nBut it's still a prison.\n\n&gt; i will get scitsofrenic if i continue, a\n\nThis theory of mental illness is no longer widely accepted.\n\nYou don't get schizophrenia through bad behavior, trauma, or anything else.\n\nIt's bad wiring in the brain.\n\nYou're born with sideways connections to the neurons, which go too far and create false associations.\n\nWhen Cholita sees a red drink, she thinks \"Protocols of Zion\".\n\nAnd I'm deliberately taunting her by threatening to drink her blood.\n\nIt's a ransom wiring error, not bad behavior.\n\nYou **could** have latent schizophrenia, and circumstances could aggravate it and make it come out.\n\nfor instance, someone with schizophrenica which hasn't become obvious yet, could trigger it with a huge shroom trip.\n\nBut it would have come out eventually, even without the shrooms.\n\nStill,  you don't cause it with bad behavior.\n\nAnd it's nothing like sorcery.  Sorcery comes from mental silence.\n\nSchizophrenics are drowning in their own internal dialogue.\n\nSorcery is the opposite.\n\nInstead of being insane, you are no longer insane.\n\nYou aren't running around scratching and kicking, and demanding people \"respect\" you, or give you your territory, and they'd leave those big chips on your shoulders alone.\n\nIt's \"enlightenment\".  Zen master level.  Mental stillness.\n\nBut without the Buddhist beliefs.\n\nThose are based on false narratives, and only slow you from learning.\n\n&gt;i am deadly afraid of just ending up in mental hospital\n\nAgain, that view of mental illness is not believed anymore.\n\nHowever, the first time I fell into heightened awareness and it remained for weeks, around 10 years ago, I wanted to check into a mental hospital.\n\nMy friend warned me they wouldn't let me out.\n\nSo I waited.\n\nThe visible magic in the air didn't go away, but I got used to it.", "edited": 1618265457.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_guaz7gj", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You get a urge to move but if you resist you body starts feeling tingly and paralyzed in a way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, not that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s high up there.

Or perhaps, &amp;quot;relocates you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can experiment with it, in that state.  You barely bend your little finger, as small of a movement as you can manage.  Anyone looking right at the finger would not be able to tell you if it moved or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what you perceive is shockwaves of  yellowish light, rippling up into the sky, with jet black rushing back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality is under the control of even tiny pieces of your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t exist at that point, and the movement of your finger causes you to exist again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of any other way to put it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You said you ended up in some bus station. That was your double if i understood it right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, it was probably La Gorda, coming back from a visit to Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a stronger connection to her, because she came up here with Carlos on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;d been wanting to teach Cholita her flying technique, to which Cholita had agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a first hand lesson in that flying technique, from what might have been Don Genaro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it never occurred to me to look up and see faces. I was la Gorda.  She wouldn&amp;#39;t look up in the middle of trying to get her fingers right, to see who she was talking to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the problem with re-runs.  You can&amp;#39;t alter it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or better put, you wouldn&amp;#39;t think to alter it. Or even to look in a mirror!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3-5 am seems like the best time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really is, unfortunately.  That local effect where everyone&amp;#39;s tonal is asleep, is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been fighting it the last few days, but it always comes down to, entering into dreams while awake is much easier when everyone is asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;i was introduced to Carlos at 12 &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me too, except it was 1968.  But you&amp;#39;re right, once you hear about that it sort of makes the other stuff sound weak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you got lucky!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;my ego is afraid to die or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t find anyone happy on that path your father wants you to take.  None.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by the time you realize that, you&amp;#39;ll be in your mid 50s.  And it&amp;#39;ll seem like it&amp;#39;s too late to do anything about it, so you&amp;#39;ll give in, and brainwash the grandkids to think it&amp;#39;s a happy life ahead for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; in the chicken coop.  Cozy even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still a prison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;i will get scitsofrenic if i continue, a&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This theory of mental illness is no longer widely accepted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t get schizophrenia through bad behavior, trauma, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s bad wiring in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re born with sideways connections to the neurons, which go too far and create false associations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Cholita sees a red drink, she thinks &amp;quot;Protocols of Zion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m deliberately taunting her by threatening to drink her blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a ransom wiring error, not bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; have latent schizophrenia, and circumstances could aggravate it and make it come out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;for instance, someone with schizophrenica which hasn&amp;#39;t become obvious yet, could trigger it with a huge shroom trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it would have come out eventually, even without the shrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still,  you don&amp;#39;t cause it with bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s nothing like sorcery.  Sorcery comes from mental silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenics are drowning in their own internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of being insane, you are no longer insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t running around scratching and kicking, and demanding people &amp;quot;respect&amp;quot; you, or give you your territory, and they&amp;#39;d leave those big chips on your shoulders alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.  Zen master level.  Mental stillness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But without the Buddhist beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are based on false narratives, and only slow you from learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;i am deadly afraid of just ending up in mental hospital&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, that view of mental illness is not believed anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the first time I fell into heightened awareness and it remained for weeks, around 10 years ago, I wanted to check into a mental hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend warned me they wouldn&amp;#39;t let me out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I waited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The visible magic in the air didn&amp;#39;t go away, but I got used to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mozhb2", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mozhb2/did_carlos_castaneda_make_it/guaz7gj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1618265004.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1618265004.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "guakyv3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ItsBeyoondMee", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gu9g13j", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_bgj6frr6", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "About the not moving part.

Some real, most not.\n\nTo go off into the past, I suspect it's better to close your eyes, have the desire, and then forget about it. Force even deeper silence, for even longer.\n\nWhen you are so silent that even lifting a little finger disrupts everything, creating a fireworks show of light flowing all around you in gold, pink, and purple, you're near.\n\nIf you keep leaning over on the pillows you are sitting on, and don't want to make the effort to straighten up because it'll spoil the silence, and then even topple over and  have to move on the bed to avoid falling off the edge, you're getting there.\n\nThen, when you get everything balanced and just right,  one of two things can happen.\n\nAssuming you don't \"stop the world\", which is very possible.\n\nYou will feel a black dot swoop across the room in front of you. But since your eyes are closed during this technique, it'll be puzzling how that could have been noticed.\n\nYou'll feel the air of it swooping by.\n\nJust sit and get even more silent.\n\nThen, it swoops again, and taps you on the left  shoulder.  Just a tiny tap.\n  \nYou can feel something moving, and a tingle going up your head.\n\nThat's an \"assist\".  You summoned it with your intent to do this.\n\nBut even if you don't get the assist from an inorganic being, the next thing that can happen is probably near to universal.\n\nIn perfect silence, not caring what you perceive,  you reach a blankness, but without losing awareness.\n\nThen you feel something calling to  you.  Like a voice saying, \"over here!\".\n\nBut there's no voice.  Just the urge.\n\nYou focus a tiny bit on the direction it called from, and you can feel that if you lean in there, you'll be pulled a very tiny bit that direction.\n\nSo you turn your head to look, and you find  yourself sitting in a bus station, surrounded by men you know, but it doesn't occur to you to look up at them.  You know them!  You were just talking to them.\n\nSuddenly you realize something magical has happened, and you turn your head back the other way, and find yourself back on the bed.\n\nIt's too good to pass up, so you turn again, are back in the station, and then just to make sure, you turn back once more.\n\nAnd it works, you're back on the  bed.\n\nWarning: Don't keep going back and forth. The results might be unpleasant.\n\nSo you go for it after no more than 2 \"retries\".  \n\nYou fully enter.\n\nYou can't alter the flow of time in there. It feels like you are doing everything, but it never occurs to you to do anything differently.  Not even to try to find out who you are talking to.\n\nIt's probably only much later, like the next day, that you can try to figure out who you got to \"re-run\".\n\nThe mistake beginners make, is thinking they can learn to do things like that.\n\nThat's what you're thinking, probably because you've been told that by Zen, Yoga, Hindu, and Daoist teachers.\n\nIn fact, you cannot.\n\nIt's a gift from intent.\n\nIt's like trying to learn how to get Uncle Bill to bring you $20 like he did last time he visited.\n\nYou didn't cause the $20, and if you bother him too much, he might not give you cash ever again.\n\nSo there's really no procedure, except that you need to clean your connecting link to intent.\n\nBut that's not quite right. If you consider getting the $20 from Uncle Bill, you can in fact cause that to happen more often.\n\nYou have to deserve it, not bug  him, and he'll notice it pleased you.  And he'll do it  himself.\n\nIn the case of intent, it doesn't so much want to please you, as to help you grow and learn.\n\nYou have to \"deserve\" it with intent also.\n\nAnd there are several ways to get the offer to re-run someone, one of them involving sitting up on pillows, forcing silence.\n\nThat's not a technique. It's just what you were doing when intent decided to help you out.\n\nI must admit, I have some fuzzy socks I like to wear, as if that helps me do the things I try to do.\n\nThat's how hopeless it is to try to get instructions for how to re-run past people.\n\nSince this is a thread about whether Carlos, \"made it\", the question ought to look a little more silly now.\n\nCarlos had the ability to re-run anything he wanted, any time he wanted.\n\nHe had endless portals to other worlds available to him.\n\nI know, because I have \"some\" available.   And more each month I practice hard.\n\nSo the question itself is from a self-pity point of view.\n\nFrom the point of view of thinking Carlos didn't have infinite resources available to him.\n\nAnd the question also smells of \"book deal\" to me.\n\nBut that's just me.

And he&amp;#39;ll do it  himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of intent, it doesn&amp;#39;t so much want to please you, as to help you grow and learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to &amp;quot;deserve&amp;quot; it with intent also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are several ways to get the offer to re-run someone, one of them involving sitting up on pillows, forcing silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not a technique. It&amp;#39;s just what you were doing when intent decided to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must admit, I have some fuzzy socks I like to wear, as if that helps me do the things I try to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how hopeless it is to try to get instructions for how to re-run past people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since this is a thread about whether Carlos, &amp;quot;made it&amp;quot;, the question ought to look a little more silly now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had the ability to re-run anything he wanted, any time he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had endless portals to other worlds available to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know, because I have &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; available.   And more each month I practice hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the question itself is from a self-pity point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of thinking Carlos didn&amp;#39;t have infinite resources available to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the question also smells of &amp;quot;book deal&amp;quot; to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just me.  Cholita wants me to be less critical of others in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no pictures of clowns.

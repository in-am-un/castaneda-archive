If you read, you quickly know that refers to a concept of self, which is seeking approval or money from others, instead of seeking to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a very easy to understand principle here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you came wanting to actually learn sorcery, you won&amp;#39;t have a problem with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you came for something else, and even if it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to figure out what, it&amp;#39;s completely obvious and your conversation ends up distracting new people, who think our obsessions are something to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You literally harm new people who are on the fence.  Not likely.  But still, something kept the entire Castaneda population form learning all these years. It was the accumulated noise of all of the people wo wanted attention, instead of to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And many of those become obsessed with &amp;quot;will&amp;quot;, because they want to do the waterfall stunt for an audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I point it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shouldn&amp;#39;t be a big deal, unless the person is in fact a bad player, in which case they get angry like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But bad player is easy to fix!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make it down to the red zone a few dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it&amp;#39;ll be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_osat76", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/osat76/first_attention_tasks/h6q3era/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1627404135.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1627404135.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_osat76", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h6q3x61", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1627404352.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h6pwyk2", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's simply classic bad player behavior.\n\nTo redefine something you can do as being magic from the books, but never having put in the time to learn to get silent.\n\nThe entire Castaneda community has been doing that for decades, and never learning anything.\n\nYou're trying to explain your way to being  a sorcerer,  picking the most \"bad ass\" topic, mostly because you don't really want to learn sorcery.\n\nYou want the attention.\n\nWhen you want something, you actually go get it.\n\nWhen you want something else, you don't.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h6q3x61", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simply classic bad player behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To redefine something you can do as being magic from the books, but never having put in the time to learn to get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire Castaneda community has been doing that for decades, and never learning anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re trying to explain your way to being  a sorcerer,  picking the most &amp;quot;bad ass&amp;quot;

At the time, I considered it a novelty.  And it's true that \"practical magic\" like that, isn't particularly important.  Because there's so much of it!  Still, it's amusing to consider.\n\n\\*\\*\\* From the advanced Subreddit \\*\\*\\*\n\nThis comes from the dreaming emissary.\n\nBut don't picture whatever you're picturing when you hear that.\n\nWe've been told so many stories of magic, you'll refer back some spooky image of a ghostly spirit standing before you, telling you the secrets of the universe. A magical college professor, in some bizarre way.\n\nWe have a prejudice about who can given you \"secret knowledge\". What that looks like while it's happening.\n\nAnd that's not how the dreaming emissary works.\n\nI suppose it could. Keep in mind that the dreaming emissary is just your Ally, helping you bring Silent Knowledge into focus.\n\nAnything you might want to know is out there. In what seers call, \"Man's Band of Awareness\".\n\nIt's like a 1 foot thick slice right down your middle, tilted at a slight angle to the right looking forward, if you keep in mind that humans are actually 12-16 feet in diameter.\n\nThey're egg or tombstone shaped containers. With awareness trapped inside.\n\nAnd half of the awareness trapped inside got stuck to organic matter.\n\nIt \"took a birth\" and now we have blobs of our awareness stuck in our internal organs.\n\nYou have to think that being stuck in specific organs might give that \"puff\" of awareness some prejudices about the world around it.\n\nAnd if you did, you'd have backup from Carlos.\n\nHe called them \"Planets\". The planet of the liver, the planet of the spleen. I don't remember how many there are, or even what names they were given.\n\nAgain, I was banned from reading the books so that sort of detail is fuzzy in my memory. Carlos had already lured the people of his private classes, and decided to remove the bad influence of his own books so that we could learn directly from him without as many expectations and assumptions.\n\nBut let's just say that when you scoop a puff and stuff it on a pouch, you just snatched a piece of your double from the air and moved it where it could mix with your organic body oriented awareness. And that purple puff will pick up some of the yellow puff's obsessions.\n\nPurple and yellowish is what I see. Eventually you will also learn to \"see energy\", and darkroom makes that quite easy.\n\nBut it's a vast topic.\n\nWhat that implies.\n\nAnd one of those things, just one of many thousands, is that you can view yourself when in perfect darkness and perfect silence, as a yellowish white glow in the middle with stick figure limbs. Surrounded by purple puffs in the air, which if brought closer to the physical body turn blue and start to condense into a single ball.\n\nI now believe that the stick figure version of yourself that you can perceive in darkness, when the assemblage point has reached the orange zone on the J curve, is simply your tonal awareness stuck (flowing) in your flesh body.\n\nThus the shape of it is off from what you'd see with the lights on.\n\nBut it's just my theory at this point.\n\nThe purple puffs, and I estimate 8 soccer ball sized blobs, can condense into a single \"being\".\n\nIn dreams they're quite flexible, splitting up as needed for the specific dream. It's why there can be such a strange narrative in a dream that on waking up, even if you can remember it, it makes no sense.\n\nAre you Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise? Or Hikaru Sulu, the gay swashbuckling Asian guy who likes to overmarket himself and play victim a bit. With a big smile.\n\nActually in dreams you're often both.\n\nOr none!\n\nYou could simply be spying on the Enterprise from your dreaming double.\n\nA phantom world it can view just because it was built from all that time you wasted watching that TV show.\n\nWatching streaming media comes at a cost. It produces phantom worlds that are real enough to return to, in your double.\n\nSometimes the double just likes to watch. Same as you do.\n\nBut he'll jump in and \"do\" also. Except he's not obsessed with physical bodies.\n\nOn the other hand your tonal awareness, the stuff stuck in the internal organs, is very much obsessed with physical bodies.\n\nIt's a messy business being made of flesh.\n\nIt has so many needs, it's hard for our mind to even conceive of something which does not.\n\nYour dreaming double doesn't have to eat, breathe, sleep, or do any of the things burdened upon the awareness we have stuck in our internal organs.\n\nBut it can get some idea of what that's like, if you scoop a big piece of it from the air as a purple ball and \"stuff\" it into a pouch.\n\nI hope I'm not the one who came up with that word, \"stuff\".\n\nBut I fear it might be my own showbiz tendency.\n\nIt has a sort of violent connotation, similar to the way the gangster in \"Godfather\" explains how to make spaghetti and meatballs for a hungry gang of murderers waiting on a turf war.\n\nAfter explaining an excellent spaghetti sauce so simple it's been argued over on the internet for 48 years, he concludes with how you finally take your meatballs and sausage, and \"shove\" them into the pot of bloody red sauce.\n\nLike a gangster with his beat up captives who need to be shoved into the trunk of his car.\n\nBut it's not an honest view of what really happens when you stuff a puff.\n\nThe dreaming emissary came to explain that to me.\n\nI'm afraid to say, I didn't recognize her.\n\nSilent Knowledge is a tricky thing. Whatever you \"think\" about while it's present, becomes a new topic.\n\nAnd if you see a woman's face on a puff of pink second attention fog and think, \"Is that you Ally #1?\"\n\nYou get a silent knowledge presentation on what Allies can look like.\n\nBut the ally is in the middle of that, enjoying it.\n\nThey like to watch too!\n\nYou may think they're \"presenting\" the knowledge, but it's more like they \"activate\" it in you and then they join in and watch. Maybe comment on the show as it proceeds.\n\nYou might be wise to picture the dreaming emissary eating popcorn and watching the TV on a couch with you.\n\nWatching your own silent knowledge TV sitcoms.\n\nBut in that analogy, picture that you're stoned out of your mind and so confused you believe the person sitting next to you is causing the TV images. Making the video play according to that second person's will.\n\nThe Allies are happy to let you believe that if you like, and so we get the image of the college professor lecturing on dreaming emissary style topics.\n\nWhen in fact they're nearly as amused about it as you are.\n\nAnd their main function is just to help you keep your attention on that, so that the knowledge flows.\n\nIf you get distracted from what you are watching, silent knowledge will change.\n\nThe \"method of presentation\" will change, and naturally if that happens the topic will change.\n\nSo they pretty much just \"organize\" it for you. To make it seem like a big show.\n\nConsider Silent Knowledge to be sort of like a book, a radio, and a television.\n\nEach one has a flow of knowledge available. How you receive it from each, is different.\n\nBut if you are sitting watching the TV, you now have the presentation method. The \"topic\" is which TV show you want to watch.\n\nThe same is true of books. Or the radio.\n\nThe dreaming emissary isn't the best engineer in the world, who designed all three. She didn't make the TV, the radio, and certainly doesn't have a printing press.\n\nBut she can sit there with you, to keep you focused. And while you receive the flow of knowledge she's very happy to remain and see how you react to it.\n\nLike an adult amused by what their 3 year old is doing on the floor with their toys.\n\nThere's nothing for an adult to gain from the specifics.\n\nThey're really just interested in the child and what it likes to do lately.\n\nFor the dreaming emissary, it's the same.\n\nSo looking at the \"visitor\" I had in my darkroom very early on before I did any tensegrity passes at all besides my warm up \"Life Saver Pass\", I was pleased to have an Ally so soon.\n\nShe was in the part of the room where Cholita has left some of her own phantom structures.\n\nStill lingering there, as ghost realms I could gaze at to bring into focus.\n\nThe Hall of Statues, the Canyon of the Giant.\n\nBoth gifts from Cholita.\n\nAnd one of my allies was also. \"Mystery\".\n\nI was looking at that early visitor to figure out if she was Fancy, Mystery, or Stella.\n\nWhen suddenly the ally itself became the \"topic\" of silent knowledge.\n\nFor an instant, it looked like \"Fancy\".\n\n\"Guess again!\", the dreaming emissary said.\n\n\"Is that you Stella?\", I asked.\n\nShe said, \"Stella??!? What does she know about this world! And what could she care? She's a star! Did you think she was 'slumming it' here with you?\"\n\nI thought to myself, \"Yea, but you can't do the things Stella does.\"\n\nThe emissary didn't like that thought. She said, \"Go over there, and I'll show you something!\"\n\nSo I did. I walked to the largest empty space in my darkroom.\n\nWhen I got there I started to do my tensegrity passes, but the air was so filled with intense purple and yellow blobs of brilliant light that I had to stop.\n\nThe emissary said, \"Skip that for now! Don't you understand that Tensegrity is just what the old seers noticed they could do, once they could SEE ENERGY?\"\n\nShe added, \"naturally you're obsessed with it as if it were a series of 'super powers'. You got that obsession from all the fake magic out there, where some guy far up in the mountains of Nepal can supposedly do specific tricks for visitors if he feels like it. But in fact, no one can do those. Some scholar thought it up, wrote it down, and now it's a cult legend. The man who can do...\"\n\nI got a visual presentation of a landscape scrolling along up a mountain trail to go look for the \"Magic Nepalese Monk\", so someone could beg him to show his \"advanced techniques\".\n\nThe dreaming emissary said, \"That's what pretending looks like. Techniques and super powers written in stone. As if the universe were so simple there could be specific magic man abilities to learn or discover, with that having any meaning at all. When in fact, our abilities are so vast it's nonsensical to even create a 'technique'. You merely put a limit on silent knowledge by doing that, and create the obsession that one presentation method and topic is of any importance at all.\n\nAnd now you've greatly limited your range. You have to stop thinking like that and just take what comes.\n\nThat's all Tensegrity really is. Stuff some seer observed you can do with your body, once you can see energy. It's now in tensegrity forms but once you can see energy and manipulate it with your physical body, you have the essence of it. And ought to spend some time playing around like that, free from any techniques in your mind.\"\n\nI was confused about what she was saying.\n\nShe said, \"Take your 'Sock Puppet Theater' as an example.\"\n\n\"You look around in the second attention for a floating dream. But that's just silent knowledge being presented on a puff. The puff is the presentation method, and the dream inside is the topic.\"\n\nI understood what she was saying.\n\n\"Then you like to take your Ally and send her inside to see what's going on in that dream. Without having to enter yourself. Because that requires shrinking the physical body away so that you can fully switch to the double.\n\nEasier to let your Ally go in.\n\nAnd once she's in your dream bubble in the air, you tell her what to do. You select the next topic for her to present (live).\"\n\nThe emissary was right. I did do that. Not as often as I'd like however. There's just too many different things you can learn to do.\n\nThe emissary said, \"Exactly! There's too many things to do. And you limit yourself with your misunderstandings about what's really happening.\"\n\n\"Even stuffing a puff is a confused point of view. Watch! See that big purple blob up there on the east wall?\"\n\nI could see it. I reached over and scooped it up. Oddly, my arm had to stretch 10 feet to get to it.\n\nShe said, \"You just selected a presentation method for silent knowledge! It's not a puff, it's not a soccer ball. In fact, who knows if it's really even in any form at all?\n\nIt's a piece of your own energy. Why should you be able to visibly see that in the first place?\"\n\nI couldn't explain that.\n\nShe said, \"Most of what seers do can't be explained. But it happens anyway. You have to get over caring about that ugly little detail.\n\nYes, it's impossible. But isn't it fun anyway?\"\n\nI thought to myself, \"Yea but I don't want to tell someone to do something, when in fact only I can do that, or only someone else, and the real technique ought to be...\"\n\nShe said, \"Show biz! Always worried about the audience. Is that an effective way to live? Desperate for the affections of human beings?\"\n\nI thought to myself, \"You should talk...\"\n\nShe continued, \"Try this. Let's select the topic for sock puppet theater, using no technique at all.\n\nDon't scoop or shape, or form or mash anything. Just do it instead! There's no \"magical pass\" needed. You can see energy now with your own eyes. And you have a hand. Use it!\"\n\nI bought the purple blob down from the east wall and was about to stuff it on a pouch when she said,\n\n\"Think carefully! You sure you want to stuff that on the nasty old liver? That has a very fussy point of view. Always worried about what you had for dinner, and the endless details of all of the ingredients.\"\n\nI gazed down to see the yellowish energy contained in what Carlos had called the \"planets\".\n\nI could see that there were endless swirling dreaming scenes and sensations inside each \"planet\", and had the weird idea it was \"tainted\" awareness.\n\nThe emissary said, \"This would make a good cartoon super power for Grian. Doesn't he set up the presentation method at workshops? Audio, video, even old record players?\"\n\nThat was in fact what \"Grant\" from the inner circle did.\n\nThe emissary said, \"Then give him this super power. It will be very amusing.\"\n\nShe explained I had a choice for how to \"taint\" the purple puff.\n\nIt was a piece of my dreaming body. It had the ability to make phantom realms at the drop of a hat.\n\nNot bound by physical matter or even limited to just a few senses like sight and sound, it could experience anything.\n\nShe said, \"Just move it close to one of those planets. Not so close it gets lost. It won't really get stuck there, but it will cling a few seconds.\"\n\n\"Just barely let it get near your liver, and see how it's now tainted with the concerns of the planet of the liver.\"\n\nI gently moved the purple puff closer to watch a yellow haze touch the outside of it, and ripple inside the purple puff.\n\nWhich came alive with a dreaming scene.\n\nShe said, \"That's advanced sock puppet theater!!!\"\n\n\"And we just invented that game. I don't know that anyone has ever done that before as an organized activity. But if you wanted you could carry that to extremes. Try each planet in succession to find out what your body is up to these days. View your obsessions as dreams, without having to be inside them. Even diagnose yourself.\"\n\nI saw what she was talking about. It was quite exciting to think of the possibilities.\n\nShe said, \"But don't limit yourself there! That's what I was saying about the tensegrity. It was just what some other seer discovered he could do. He was amused, showed it to another seer or to an apprentice, and if it was amusing enough it survived over time as a magical technique.\"\n\n\"But really, there's endless possibilities like that and you only limit yourself to think of them as if some guy up on a mountain high in Tibet had a sacred scroll listing 'The 27 Divine Super Powers'.\"\n\nShe added, \"That's what fake magic looks like. Once they list them you know they really just want your money. And that they can't do those things at all.\"\n\nI suggested she could show me.\n\nThe emissary said, \"Ok. Why are you looking into that puff? Are you deaf?\"\n\n\"No, I can hear!\", I replied.\n\n\"It's playing that melody. Listen!! It's here.\"\n\nI heard an old familiar tune, but could not recall from where.\n\nThe emissary said, \"It's not important where that came from. That's a planetary obsession. Maybe you heard it while eating a nice slice of nearly raw liver with a glass of chianti and some fava beans. And so your own liver associates that old Goldberg classical variation music with a fine dining experience.\"\n\n\"It's sock puppet radio! But there's too many stations to worry about the meaning of an old song.\"\n\nI moved the puff in my hand to the other side of my body, to see if it could pick up a different station.\n\n\"So I can see what's playing over here on 'Spleen Radio'?\"\n\nThe emissary replied, 'See how fun that would be in the cartoons! Let's find out where 'You Only Live Twice' might be playing.\"\n\nShe was right. That would make everyone jealous of Grian's super powers to recall anything, just by manipulating audio/video equipment in the second attention.\n\n\"I'm convinced!\", I told the dreaming emissary.\n\nShe said, \"But I hope you get the point. Techniques are actually limits. I'm not saying limits are bad. Without limits, everything would happen all at once. What good would that be? So it's ok to enjoy the limits, but don't become confused and start making your own sacred scroll listing the '27 Divine Super Powers'\"\n\nI had a horrible thought. What if the cartoons were simply the video version of \"The 27 Divine Super Powers\"?\n\nThat wouldn't be good.\n\nThe emissary said, \"That's your real task. To seduce watchers to practice by showing them the rewards, while not going so far that you give them the impression any of it is real.\"\n\nI argued a bit, \"But it is real! You truly can learn to have specific super powers, even if that's putting a limit on what's possible.\"\n\nShe said, \"But your real task is to show how all the superpowers are connected to the same basic principles. So that people are not only seduced by power, but understand where it comes from. So that they become convinced it can't be made up, because it's all so interconnected. If one thing can be done, then all the others can too.\"\n\nAs a parting comment she added, \"Don't even get me started about recapitulation! You can see for yourself now what that is capable of.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Advanced Sock Puppet Theater", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"e456qr3kq8da1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc971109401cb6f854d066366406000f8fe12adb"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3c77672d1f4683a91a1a59f228e1461316062ba"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6906b46f559eb69cbfee7a2ce8a70a625d809fc5"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4660ea168bff5098c2c169814e5c9ed2a0489278"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=090237a5edc07e83a77b7d4e90215b73eac61ff0"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dc6fa5727820de2821ef06ea396d3b49dd05905"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05ef73e69db7f7c46f9a61e27804d215d1e9c125"}, "id": "e456qr3kq8da1"}}, "name": "t3_10h0u11", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/F1wpgpxLIM2-VsO1SpUWOfdlIX5geATLt-yYW9pUvF4.jpg", "edited": 1674238987.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1674231097.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=05ef73e69db7f7c46f9a61e27804d215d1e9c125\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/e456qr3kq8da1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=05ef73e69db7f7c46f9a61e27804d215d1e9c125&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the old posts, is the original Sock Puppet Theater.

A magical college professor, in some bizarre way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a prejudice about who can given you &amp;quot;secret knowledge&amp;quot;. What that looks like while it&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s not how the dreaming emissary works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it could. Keep in mind that the dreaming emissary is just your Ally, helping you bring Silent Knowledge into focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything you might want to know is out there. In what seers call, &amp;quot;Man&amp;#39;s Band of Awareness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like a 1 foot thick slice right down your middle, tilted at a slight angle to the right looking forward, if you keep in mind that humans are actually 12-16 feet in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re egg or tombstone shaped containers. With awareness trapped inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And half of the awareness trapped inside got stuck to organic matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &amp;quot;took a birth&amp;quot; and now we have blobs of our awareness stuck in our internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to think that being stuck in specific organs might give that &amp;quot;puff&amp;quot; of awareness some prejudices about the world around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you did, you&amp;#39;d have backup from Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He called them &amp;quot;Planets&amp;quot;. The planet of the liver, the planet of the spleen. I don&amp;#39;t remember how many there are, or even what names they were given.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I was banned from reading the books so that sort of detail is fuzzy in my memory. Carlos had already lured the people of his private classes, and decided to remove the bad influence of his own books so that we could learn directly from him without as many expectations and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s just say that when you scoop a puff and stuff it on a pouch, you just snatched a piece of your double from the air and moved it where it could mix with your organic body oriented awareness. And that purple puff will pick up some of the yellow puff&amp;#39;s obsessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Purple and yellowish is what I see. Eventually you will also learn to &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot;, and darkroom makes that quite easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a vast topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What that implies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one of those things, just one of many thousands, is that you can view yourself when in perfect darkness and perfect silence, as a yellowish white glow in the middle with stick figure limbs. Surrounded by purple puffs in the air, which if brought closer to the physical body turn blue and start to condense into a single ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now believe that the stick figure version of yourself that you can perceive in darkness, when the assemblage point has reached the orange zone on the J curve, is simply your tonal awareness stuck (flowing) in your flesh body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus the shape of it is off from what you&amp;#39;d see with the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s just my theory at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The purple puffs, and I estimate 8 soccer ball sized blobs, can condense into a single &amp;quot;being&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In dreams they&amp;#39;re quite flexible, splitting up as needed for the specific dream. It&amp;#39;s why there can be such a strange narrative in a dream that on waking up, even if you can remember it, it makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise? Or Hikaru Sulu, the gay swashbuckling Asian guy who likes to overmarket himself and play victim a bit. With a big smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually in dreams you&amp;#39;re often both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or none!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could simply be spying on the Enterprise from your dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A phantom world it can view just because it was built from all that time you wasted watching that TV show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching streaming media comes at a cost. It produces phantom worlds that are real enough to return to, in your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the double just likes to watch. Same as you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#39;ll jump in and &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; also. Except he&amp;#39;s not obsessed with physical bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand your tonal awareness, the stuff stuck in the internal organs, is very much obsessed with physical bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a messy business being made of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has so many needs, it&amp;#39;s hard for our mind to even conceive of something which does not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your dreaming double doesn&amp;#39;t have to eat, breathe, sleep, or do any of the things burdened upon the awareness we have stuck in our internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it can get some idea of what that&amp;#39;s like, if you scoop a big piece of it from the air as a purple ball and &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; it into a pouch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;#39;m not the one who came up with that word, &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I fear it might be my own showbiz tendency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has a sort of violent connotation, similar to the way the gangster in &amp;quot;Godfather&amp;quot; explains how to make spaghetti and meatballs for a hungry gang of murderers waiting on a turf war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After explaining an excellent spaghetti sauce so simple it&amp;#39;s been argued over on the internet for 48 years, he concludes with how you finally take your meatballs and sausage, and &amp;quot;shove&amp;quot; them into the pot of bloody red sauce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a gangster with his beat up captives who need to be shoved into the trunk of his car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not an honest view of what really happens when you stuff a puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming emissary came to explain that to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid to say, I didn&amp;#39;t recognize her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge is a tricky thing. Whatever you &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; about while it&amp;#39;s present, becomes a new topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you see a woman&amp;#39;s face on a puff of pink second attention fog and think, &amp;quot;Is that you Ally #1?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get a silent knowledge presentation on what Allies can look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the ally is in the middle of that, enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They like to watch too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may think they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;presenting&amp;quot; the knowledge, but it&amp;#39;s more like they &amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; it in you and then they join in and watch. Maybe comment on the show as it proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might be wise to picture the dreaming emissary eating popcorn and watching the TV on a couch with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching your own silent knowledge TV sitcoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in that analogy, picture that you&amp;#39;re stoned out of your mind and so confused you believe the person sitting next to you is causing the TV images. Making the video play according to that second person&amp;#39;s will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Allies are happy to let you believe that if you like, and so we get the image of the college professor lecturing on dreaming emissary style topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact they&amp;#39;re nearly as amused about it as you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And their main function is just to help you keep your attention on that, so that the knowledge flows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get distracted from what you are watching, silent knowledge will change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;method of presentation&amp;quot; will change, and naturally if that happens the topic will change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they pretty much just &amp;quot;organize&amp;quot; it for you. To make it seem like a big show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider Silent Knowledge to be sort of like a book, a radio, and a television.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each one has a flow of knowledge available. How you receive it from each, is different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you are sitting watching the TV, you now have the presentation method. The &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; is which TV show you want to watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same is true of books. Or the radio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming emissary isn&amp;#39;t the best engineer in the world, who designed all three. She didn&amp;#39;t make the TV, the radio, and certainly doesn&amp;#39;t have a printing press.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she can sit there with you, to keep you focused. And while you receive the flow of knowledge she&amp;#39;s very happy to remain and see how you react to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like an adult amused by what their 3 year old is doing on the floor with their toys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing for an adult to gain from the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re really just interested in the child and what it likes to do lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the dreaming emissary, it&amp;#39;s the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So looking at the &amp;quot;visitor&amp;quot; I had in my darkroom very early on before I did any tensegrity passes at all besides my warm up &amp;quot;Life Saver Pass&amp;quot;, I was pleased to have an Ally so soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was in the part of the room where Cholita has left some of her own phantom structures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still lingering there, as ghost realms I could gaze at to bring into focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hall of Statues, the Canyon of the Giant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both gifts from Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one of my allies was also. &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was looking at that early visitor to figure out if she was Fancy, Mystery, or Stella.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When suddenly the ally itself became the &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; of silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For an instant, it looked like &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Guess again!&amp;quot;, the dreaming emissary said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that you Stella?&amp;quot;, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;Stella??!? What does she know about this world! And what could she care? She&amp;#39;s a star! Did you think she was &amp;#39;slumming it&amp;#39; here with you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;Yea, but you can&amp;#39;t do the things Stella does.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary didn&amp;#39;t like that thought. She said, &amp;quot;Go over there, and I&amp;#39;ll show you something!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did. I walked to the largest empty space in my darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got there I started to do my tensegrity passes, but the air was so filled with intense purple and yellow blobs of brilliant light that I had to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary said, &amp;quot;Skip that for now! Don&amp;#39;t you understand that Tensegrity is just what the old seers noticed they could do, once they could SEE ENERGY?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She added, &amp;quot;naturally you&amp;#39;re obsessed with it as if it were a series of &amp;#39;super powers&amp;#39;. You got that obsession from all the fake magic out there, where some guy far up in the mountains of Nepal can supposedly do specific tricks for visitors if he feels like it. But in fact, no one can do those. Some scholar thought it up, wrote it down, and now it&amp;#39;s a cult legend. The man who can do...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a visual presentation of a landscape scrolling along up a mountain trail to go look for the &amp;quot;Magic Nepalese Monk&amp;quot;, so someone could beg him to show his &amp;quot;advanced techniques&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming emissary said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what pretending looks like. Techniques and super powers written in stone. As if the universe were so simple there could be specific magic man abilities to learn or discover, with that having any meaning at all. When in fact, our abilities are so vast it&amp;#39;s nonsensical to even create a &amp;#39;technique&amp;#39;. You merely put a limit on silent knowledge by doing that, and create the obsession that one presentation method and topic is of any importance at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now you&amp;#39;ve greatly limited your range. You have to stop thinking like that and just take what comes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all Tensegrity really is. Stuff some seer observed you can do with your body, once you can see energy. It&amp;#39;s now in tensegrity forms but once you can see energy and manipulate it with your physical body, you have the essence of it. And ought to spend some time playing around like that, free from any techniques in your mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was confused about what she was saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;Take your &amp;#39;Sock Puppet Theater&amp;#39; as an example.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You look around in the second attention for a floating dream. But that&amp;#39;s just silent knowledge being presented on a puff. The puff is the presentation method, and the dream inside is the topic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understood what she was saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then you like to take your Ally and send her inside to see what&amp;#39;s going on in that dream. Without having to enter yourself. Because that requires shrinking the physical body away so that you can fully switch to the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easier to let your Ally go in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And once she&amp;#39;s in your dream bubble in the air, you tell her what to do. You select the next topic for her to present (live).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary was right. I did do that. Not as often as I&amp;#39;d like however. There&amp;#39;s just too many different things you can learn to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary said, &amp;quot;Exactly! There&amp;#39;s too many things to do. And you limit yourself with your misunderstandings about what&amp;#39;s really happening.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Even stuffing a puff is a confused point of view. Watch! See that big purple blob up there on the east wall?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see it. I reached over and scooped it up. Oddly, my arm had to stretch 10 feet to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;You just selected a presentation method for silent knowledge! It&amp;#39;s not a puff, it&amp;#39;s not a soccer ball. In fact, who knows if it&amp;#39;s really even in any form at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a piece of your own energy. Why should you be able to visibly see that in the first place?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t explain that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;Most of what seers do can&amp;#39;t be explained. But it happens anyway. You have to get over caring about that ugly little detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#39;s impossible. But isn&amp;#39;t it fun anyway?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;Yea but I don&amp;#39;t want to tell someone to do something, when in fact only I can do that, or only someone else, and the real technique ought to be...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;Show biz! Always worried about the audience. Is that an effective way to live? Desperate for the affections of human beings?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;You should talk...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She continued, &amp;quot;Try this. Let&amp;#39;s select the topic for sock puppet theater, using no technique at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t scoop or shape, or form or mash anything. Just do it instead! There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;magical pass&amp;quot; needed. You can see energy now with your own eyes. And you have a hand. Use it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought the purple blob down from the east wall and was about to stuff it on a pouch when she said,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Think carefully! You sure you want to stuff that on the nasty old liver? That has a very fussy point of view. Always worried about what you had for dinner, and the endless details of all of the ingredients.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed down to see the yellowish energy contained in what Carlos had called the &amp;quot;planets&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see that there were endless swirling dreaming scenes and sensations inside each &amp;quot;planet&amp;quot;, and had the weird idea it was &amp;quot;tainted&amp;quot; awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary said, &amp;quot;This would make a good cartoon super power for Grian. Doesn&amp;#39;t he set up the presentation method at workshops? Audio, video, even old record players?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was in fact what &amp;quot;Grant&amp;quot; from the inner circle did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary said, &amp;quot;Then give him this super power. It will be very amusing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She explained I had a choice for how to &amp;quot;taint&amp;quot; the purple puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a piece of my dreaming body. It had the ability to make phantom realms at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not bound by physical matter or even limited to just a few senses like sight and sound, it could experience anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;Just move it close to one of those planets. Not so close it gets lost. It won&amp;#39;t really get stuck there, but it will cling a few seconds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just barely let it get near your liver, and see how it&amp;#39;s now tainted with the concerns of the planet of the liver.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gently moved the purple puff closer to watch a yellow haze touch the outside of it, and ripple inside the purple puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which came alive with a dreaming scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s advanced sock puppet theater!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And we just invented that game. I don&amp;#39;t know that anyone has ever done that before as an organized activity. But if you wanted you could carry that to extremes. Try each planet in succession to find out what your body is up to these days. View your obsessions as dreams, without having to be inside them. Even diagnose yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw what she was talking about. It was quite exciting to think of the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;But don&amp;#39;t limit yourself there! That&amp;#39;s what I was saying about the tensegrity. It was just what some other seer discovered he could do. He was amused, showed it to another seer or to an apprentice, and if it was amusing enough it survived over time as a magical technique.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But really, there&amp;#39;s endless possibilities like that and you only limit yourself to think of them as if some guy up on a mountain high in Tibet had a sacred scroll listing &amp;#39;The 27 Divine Super Powers&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She added, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what fake magic looks like. Once they list them you know they really just want your money. And that they can&amp;#39;t do those things at all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggested she could show me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary said, &amp;quot;Ok. Why are you looking into that puff? Are you deaf?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, I can hear!&amp;quot;, I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s playing that melody. Listen!! It&amp;#39;s here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard an old familiar tune, but could not recall from where.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not important where that came from. That&amp;#39;s a planetary obsession. Maybe you heard it while eating a nice slice of nearly raw liver with a glass of chianti and some fava beans. And so your own liver associates that old Goldberg classical variation music with a fine dining experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s sock puppet radio! But there&amp;#39;s too many stations to worry about the meaning of an old song.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved the puff in my hand to the other side of my body, to see if it could pick up a different station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So I can see what&amp;#39;s playing over here on &amp;#39;Spleen Radio&amp;#39;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary replied, &amp;#39;See how fun that would be in the cartoons! Let&amp;#39;s find out where &amp;#39;You Only Live Twice&amp;#39; might be playing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was right. That would make everyone jealous of Grian&amp;#39;s super powers to recall anything, just by manipulating audio/video equipment in the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m convinced!&amp;quot;, I told the dreaming emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;But I hope you get the point. Techniques are actually limits. I&amp;#39;m not saying limits are bad. Without limits, everything would happen all at once. What good would that be? So it&amp;#39;s ok to enjoy the limits, but don&amp;#39;t become confused and start making your own sacred scroll listing the &amp;#39;27 Divine Super Powers&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a horrible thought. What if the cartoons were simply the video version of &amp;quot;The 27 Divine Super Powers&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That wouldn&amp;#39;t be good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s your real task. To seduce watchers to practice by showing them the rewards, while not going so far that you give them the impression any of it is real.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I argued a bit, &amp;quot;But it is real! You truly can learn to have specific super powers, even if that&amp;#39;s putting a limit on what&amp;#39;s possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;But your real task is to show how all the superpowers are connected to the same basic principles. So that people are not only seduced by power, but understand where it comes from. So that they become convinced it can&amp;#39;t be made up, because it&amp;#39;s all so interconnected. If one thing can be done, then all the others can too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a parting comment she added, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t even get me started about recapitulation! You can see for yourself now what that is capable of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,

Thus they make a set of four households which are capable of incorporating as many warriors as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The male warriors and the courier can also form an independent unit of four men, or each can function as a solitary being as dictated by necessity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next the Nagual and his party were commanded to find three more couriers. These could be all males or all females or a mixed set, but the male couriers had to be of the fourth type of man, the assistant, and the females had to be from the south.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to make sure that the first Nagual man would lead his party to freedom and not deviate from that path or become corrupted, the Eagle took the Nagual woman to the other world to serve as a beacon, guiding the party to the opening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Nagual and his warriors were then commanded to forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**** later on ****&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I had met and interacted with all the women, they explained to me the difference between the dreamers and the stalkers. They called it the two planets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Florinda, Carmela, Zoila, and Delia were stalkers: forceful beings with a great deal of physical energy; go-getters; inexhaustible workers; specialists on that extravagant state of awareness they called dreaming-awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other planet- the dreamers- was composed of the other four women: Zuleica, Nelida, Hermelinda, and Clara. They had a more ethereal quality. It was not that they were less forceful or less energetic: It was rather that their energy was simply less apparent. They projected a sense of other-worldliness even when engaged in the most mundane activities. They were the specialists on another peculiar state of awareness they called &amp;#39;dreaming in worlds other than this world.&amp;#39; I was told that this was the most complex state of awareness women could reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the dreamers and the stalkers worked together, the stalkers were like a protective, hard, outer layer that hid a deep core. The dreamers were that deep core: They were like a soft matrix that cushioned the hard, outer layer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_10h0u11", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10h0u11/advanced_sock_puppet_theater/j5jtej9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1674485681.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5ig4w9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "infinite_unity01", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1674452330.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10h0u11", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_43255b4s", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "*You have to think that being stuck in specific organs might give that \"puff\" of awareness some prejudices about the world around it.*\n\n*And if you did, you'd have backup from Carlos.*\n\n*He called them \"Planets\".

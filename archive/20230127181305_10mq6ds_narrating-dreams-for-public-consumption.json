And you have to pay yearly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which perhaps makes it inappropriate unless you want to get a job with Disney or something official like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To just get &amp;quot;gig&amp;quot; work, there&amp;#39;s now something kind of like Uber where jobs are just there to do, like picking up McDonald&amp;#39;s and delivering it to a specific address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They tend to be things involving making a certain character look good, and then animating it smoothly to do what the job asks for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, to satisfy the job you just need to make a video of your character doing what they requested, from multiple angles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And give them the files when you&amp;#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And never have to actually meet up with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that sort of thing, character creator and blender are adequate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Character creator, because given a full picture you can easily duplicate anyone in an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blender for when you can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And blender will do multi-character animations, whereas character creator only allows 1 main character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They want you to buy &amp;quot;iclone&amp;quot; if you plan to animate full scenes that have more than one actor in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But both are less than $500 purchased together, permanent license.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even less if you look around for sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And blender is free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t have any resources at all, blender is the choice.  You can make any pixar cartoon, using blender alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And make it look better than Pixar did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it would be nice to own GIMP too, if you were using just blender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GIMP is free too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then on top of that, you&amp;#39;d do well to learn how to run PC Paint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gimp doesn&amp;#39;t actually do much drawing.  You can, but it&amp;#39;s trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn all 3 free programs, you&amp;#39;ll get a job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then  they&amp;#39;ll tell you what to learn next.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_10mq6ds", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10mq6ds/narrating_dreams_for_public_consumption/j64za0s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1674847167.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1674847167.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j64y27h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1674846698.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j64wwtf", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10mq6ds/narrating_dreams_for_public_consumption/j64y27h/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_j64y27h", "created": 1674846698.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j64wwtf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1674846261.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j64w21j", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Blender, Character Creator, Iclone, and Gimp.\n\nPlus PC Paint.\n\nAI images don't interest me.

clear knock of intent (remember I'm a fool though, so this is a \"have to believe\" story and while there are alternative explanations for each individual occurrence I will relate, the totality is impossibly unlikely, just like every human's birth was in the first place).\n\nOne thing that is possible is that some of the order I don't have correct, because it is almost impossible for me to recall this as a linear narrative sequence, so I, the fool, apologize for any poor memory on my part.\n\nWhat occurred for me was that in my very late teens and early twenties I discovered the value of inner-silence for ... reasons.\n\nThen something drew me to Carlos's books and made me find them in random places with no foreplanning, following an impulse from silence to a *used bookstore*, where I found the first 3-5 in the same fashion, in order, one at a time.\n\nI literally jumped into wakefullness with the urge and compulsion to get up and go.\n\nI followed that feeling at top speed but let my body move on it's own with as little thought as possible and no second-guessing.\n\nWhen I got the first book, many things I'd previously experienced for myself were suddenly explained, but also perfectly described by Carlos and this feeling of revelation continued as I read on.\n\nI continued my earlier silence practices while reading the books until I'd collected most or all.\n\nAt some point in the reading and meditating, I had an unprecedented occurrence of \"stopping the world\" with closed eye meditation which had me switch to my double who was looking at where I was in the bed from a few feet away, but I wasn't in the bed any more.\n\nI now believe I was in my double, because there was a blue mist vignette around the scene and  was totally free of thought looking from an entirely different vantage point than where I disappeared from.\n\nThen I startled awake in my body and something around 2 hours had passed!\n\nI could not make sense of the event and was terrified!\n\nTerrified it might happen again, I slowed down the closed-eye meditation practice and stopped shortly thereafter.\n\nHowever, I first tried two things to corroborate the teachings for myself, which I kept practicing for 20 years - placing the hands on the exact middle for standard sitting or laying in inner-silence, and the right way of walking.\n\nBoth were superior to closed eye sitting and laying meditations I'd already learned (which only really developed the ability to be silent while alone in those positions, which I considered pretty worthless).\n\nAt any rate, very strange things started happening from the day I got the first book and I don't recall most of them except the clear notion that when Carlos was being invited to walk this path I was also being invited in those exact moments when I read the words and I then had to make a choice to follow the bird of freedom right then, or to live out a normal existence.\n\nI decided to keep the two practices I mentioned, but only using them in extreme emotional distress and told intent that I wouldn't follow the bird of freedom then, because I wanted to play out this regular life thing to it's fullest, although that might lead to failing to ever gain total freedom.\n\nI then committed to intent out loud to return to the path should the \"normal life\" path terminate while I was still alive, but inside I despaired of ever achieving that aim or being able to follow the bird of freedom again.\n\nSo I lived that life to my fullest for 20 years, sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing, making a family and career and suffering and joyful like never before.\n\nThen it ended.\n\nI'm still alive.\n\nI never forgot my promise, nor did I ever stop wanting total freedom or inner-silence, although my silence practices were basically a joke of inconsistency and inability, which suited me fine, because I was afraid to go too far before I was ready. Afraid, yes, but I never stopped wanting total freedom.\n\nWhen my \"regular life\" ended due to events beyond my control I despaired that I would ever be able to start the path again, but I didn't stop wanting and I didn't stop looking for the bird of freedom.\n\nThen I found this place in a comment on the wikipedia page for Carlos while researching the controversies, like CiChocolate described and I knew I was being called by that bird of freedom again.\n\nI lurked a long time and eventually joined when I totally re-committed to intent and committed to the intent of the sub and knew I was ready to work.\n\nI am all in, but a work in progress who fails to practice, and who is easily befuddled.\n\nIn short, I am a fool, as we all are, but I intend to eventually lose this crown of woe and worry and instead dance freely, laughing, into mystery.\n\nThank you Carlos, Taisha, Florinda, Kylie, Carol, Reni, Nyei, Blue Scout, Cholita, Dan, Jadey, don Juan, Genaro, the rest of their party, the little sisters, the genaros, soledad, la catalina, nagual Julian, nagual Elias and their parties, Allison, Sharon, Missy, Charlotte, Graham, Wesley, Eric, Christa, Techno, Juann, Jadey, The Mad Prophet, Cizzy-Shizzy, CiChocolate, Stephanie, Amy, Jessica, Lina, Joe, Jeremy, Chuck, Matty G, monkeyguy, OK-Assistant and all the bad players and folks I can't quite recall or don't have space to thank, from this FOOL.\n\nI wish you all well, and I trust your personal power and my own, though I know not what that means!\n\nGoodbye!", "edited": 1661085345.0, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fool is not holding back any punches in this comment:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, finding Carlos&amp;#39;s books was a clear knock of intent (remember I&amp;#39;m a fool though, so this is a &amp;quot;have to believe&amp;quot;

I waited for years.\n\nSo if Carlos had hoped for that, it doesn't seem to have worked out so far.\n\nThe problem in the subreddit is, it's a constant battle trying to suppress bad men who want to pretend their sorcery.\n\nThis place would never have come into being, if the male visitors who want to bully others and lie, had not be suppressed.\n\nThe women don't like that, but I doubt there's an alternative.\n\nSo when you get a male who does his first post and has what seems to be amazing talent, but everything is all messed up, one thing you need to know is, are psychiatric drugs in use?\n\nNot to be mean to him. But to keep him honest, so he isn't stealing attention for some \"talent\" he doesn't actually have.\n\nBecause if we allowed that, this place could no longer exist.  And certainly the bad player wouldn't learn either.\n\nSorcery is VERY difficult, because you have to completely let go of ugly motivations designed to seek attention from other humans.\n\nThose pull your assemblage point to the blue line!!!\n\nThere's no way to learn sorcery if you are really wanting to \"teach\" or \"lead\" other people.\n\nThose are tasks you get stuck with by accident, AFTER you are already learning for real.\n\nSo when a new man shows up and starts relating his \"amazing\" darkroom success the first time, you want to know:\n\n1   Were you stoned? Have you taken a lot of shrooms or other powerful substances like that in the past, so that your \"head is all messed up\"?\n\n2   Were you just laying in bed with your eyes closed, making up stuff based on disturbed dreams so you could come here to \"make a place for yourself\"?\n\n3  Do you take any psychiatric drugs?

I waited for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if Carlos had hoped for that, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have worked out so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem in the subreddit is, it&amp;#39;s a constant battle trying to suppress bad men who want to pretend their sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This place would never have come into being, if the male visitors who want to bully others and lie, had not be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women don&amp;#39;t like that, but I doubt there&amp;#39;s an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you get a male who does his first post and has what seems to be amazing talent, but everything is all messed up, one thing you need to know is, are psychiatric drugs in use?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to be mean to him. But to keep him honest, so he isn&amp;#39;t stealing attention for some &amp;quot;talent&amp;quot; he doesn&amp;#39;t actually have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because if we allowed that, this place could no longer exist.  And certainly the bad player wouldn&amp;#39;t learn either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is VERY difficult, because you have to completely let go of ugly motivations designed to seek attention from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those pull your assemblage point to the blue line!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way to learn sorcery if you are really wanting to &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are tasks you get stuck with by accident, AFTER you are already learning for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when a new man shows up and starts relating his &amp;quot;amazing&amp;quot; darkroom success the first time, you want to know:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1   Were you stoned? Have you taken a lot of shrooms or other powerful substances like that in the past, so that your &amp;quot;head is all messed up&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2   Were you just laying in bed with your eyes closed, making up stuff based on disturbed dreams so you could come here to &amp;quot;make a place for yourself&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3  Do you take any psychiatric drugs?  I hear Xanax gives you visions. It&amp;#39;s extremely popular in Thailand.

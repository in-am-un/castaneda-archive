A moscowite told me there were only 5 common cat names.\n\nAnother russian told me that was nonsense.\n\nAre you male or female?\n\nI visit with the double for hours each night.\n\nThere's no puzzle to be solved on how to bring him out.\n\nHe comes out when you do the tensegrity.  Carlos designed it that way. Or maybe we should say, the Olmecs did.  Tensegrity was designed by doubles, inside dreaming.\n\nBut if you aren't silent you won't notice him coming out during the tensegrity, because your assemblage point stays in the blue zone where we learned to block the sight of him.\n\nIn the green zone, the first you move your assemblage point to, it's the double who allows you to have fast visions.  Little mini-dreams.\n\nAnd the puffs of color you see in darkness, ARE the double.\n\nThat's him!\n\nWe use the tensegrity to stick  him to the center, and then he begins to behave like a copy of ourselves. Instead of like scattered pieces of himself.  Each one magical, but not behaving like a single individual.\n\nYou begin to literally see extra hands while doing the tensegrity.  As if when you stuffed the puffs of light onto your torso, he got stuck there.\n\nWe have Olmec statues showing that!  So we're doing what they discovered. No doubt about it.\n\nOr instead of an extra arm, you see a magical object behind a wall and reach in to get it.\n\nThat's the double who reaches in there.  Your real arm can't go through solid wall!\n\nWhen the assemblage point comes up to the front, he starts to become easily visible.\n\nIn pieces perhaps, which  you will tend to ignore.  But by then, you'll at least actually see them, visually.\n\nIn the far orange zone you can hold conversations with him, after watching him zip onto the bed, in one of his ghostlike forms.\n\nThere's the \"puff body\", the \"well dressed man\", and the \"glass man\".  Also, \"the swarm\", but I haven't seen that enough to understand what it is.\n\nCholita, a witch friend, can walk right through the wall in her double.  And we used to play hide and seek.  Me awake, her in her double, sleeping elsewhere.\n\nHer double is solid enough to touch me and I can feel it.\n\nSo you're in the right place.\n\nThe hard part in here is, people can't find the time.\n\nI suppose because you have doubt it's even going to work.\n\nYou will worry, maybe you're being tricked again?\n\nBut even once you can do AMAZING things no one else believes, you will still find it hard to practice.\n\nAs don Juan said, people manage to make it to the shore, and escape the mess of the social order. Our normal view of the world.\n\nSorcerers are waiting there to \"hose you off\".\n\nI suppose I got stuck with a lot of that job.  Or at least it feels like it sometimes.\n\nSo the person who escapes the river and gets hosed off, now has a view of the world of magic.  Being in the red zone is about like that.\n\nThey walk around a bit, and notice there's no one else there.\n\nThere's magic!  But no one go to out with on Taco Tuesday.\n\nOr for the young people, it cuts into your mating ritual time.\n\nMost will jump back into the river from which they escaped.\n\nOnce you jump back in, the magic you saw is erased from your mind.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i2mkap0", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t Xara one of the few cat names in Moscow?  A moscowite told me there were only 5 common cat names.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another russian told me that was nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you male or female?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I visit with the double for hours each night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no puzzle to be solved on how to bring him out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He comes out when you do the tensegrity.  Carlos designed it that way. Or maybe we should say, the Olmecs did.  Tensegrity was designed by doubles, inside dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you aren&amp;#39;t silent you won&amp;#39;t notice him coming out during the tensegrity, because your assemblage point stays in the blue zone where we learned to block the sight of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the green zone, the first you move your assemblage point to, it&amp;#39;s the double who allows you to have fast visions.  Little mini-dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the puffs of color you see in darkness, ARE the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We use the tensegrity to stick  him to the center, and then he begins to behave like a copy of ourselves. Instead of like scattered pieces of himself.  Each one magical, but not behaving like a single individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You begin to literally see extra hands while doing the tensegrity.  As if when you stuffed the puffs of light onto your torso, he got stuck there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have Olmec statues showing that!  So we&amp;#39;re doing what they discovered. No doubt about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or instead of an extra arm, you see a magical object behind a wall and reach in to get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the double who reaches in there.  Your real arm can&amp;#39;t go through solid wall!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the assemblage point comes up to the front, he starts to become easily visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In pieces perhaps, which  you will tend to ignore.  But by then, you&amp;#39;ll at least actually see them, visually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the far orange zone you can hold conversations with him, after watching him zip onto the bed, in one of his ghostlike forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;puff body&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;well dressed man&amp;quot;, and the &amp;quot;glass man&amp;quot;.  Also, &amp;quot;the swarm&amp;quot;, but I haven&amp;#39;t seen that enough to understand what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita, a witch friend, can walk right through the wall in her double.  And we used to play hide and seek.  Me awake, her in her double, sleeping elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her double is solid enough to touch me and I can feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard part in here is, people can&amp;#39;t find the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose because you have doubt it&amp;#39;s even going to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will worry, maybe you&amp;#39;re being tricked again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even once you can do AMAZING things no one else believes, you will still find it hard to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan said, people manage to make it to the shore, and escape the mess of the social order. Our normal view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers are waiting there to &amp;quot;hose you off&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I got stuck with a lot of that job.  Or at least it feels like it sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the person who escapes the river and gets hosed off, now has a view of the world of magic.  Being in the red zone is about like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They walk around a bit, and notice there&amp;#39;s no one else there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s magic!

Or your grumpy boss.\n\nBUT, there's so much more to it, since it \"looks fun\" to our double.

Lately she follows me around, chastising me for not \"having a life\".\n\nOf course, if I don't hide in my locked room she does nothing but attack me.\n\nI suppose she wants me to bring home friends so she can join in.\n\nI tried explaining that in fact I do not stay in the room all night.\n\nI leave it often, and have visitors too.\n\nShe didn't want to hear that sort of thing.\n\n\\&gt; I don't get any direct effects from darkroom yet, but the fact that it makes my sleep experiences all crazy\n\nA woman?\n\nWe still don't know much about how women learn the fastest.\n\nIt might be, women are the \"stalkers or dreamers\" in sorcery groups.\n\nAnd men are just lame.  But motivated to take over the world, so they come out ok despite their lack of talent.\n\n\\&gt; Do you think that specific motions are important, e.g. they really do have the intent of ancient sorcerers behind them and there really are pouches and reallocation of energy?\n\nYes, they do.  You get to experience that yourself.\n\nMaybe you'll turn into a Jaguar, after realizing what those feelings are like.\n\nAnd yes, the pouches are VERY visible when you get to the deep orange zone.\n\nYou can gaze into them after stuffing a purple puff on there, and look for the vortexes Carlos mentioned.\n\nSo no need to doubt it.  Looking into the pouches later on will be like looking down at Disneyland from a low flying helicopter.\n\nPlenty to see!\n\nThere's no imagining here.\n\n\\&gt; or do you think that Castaneda's model with eggs, emanations, eagle, etc., Is the \"correct\" one.\n\nThere is no \"ultimate\" reality.\n\nBut at least sorcerers know that, and everyone else doesn't.\n\nIt's not good for their business, for other systems to admit that what they have is just what they were given, and obviously not the ultimate anything at all.\n\nBut sorcerers embrace that. They're always hopeful for an even clearer understanding.\n\nThis will make much more sense when you can move deep into silent knowledge and realize how vast the dark sea of awareness really is.\n\nAnd what a tiny point in infinity our world is.\n\n\\&gt; as it suggests emanations really might be at the base of reality.\n\nThere are MANY ways to view the emanations.\n\nIt's actually a Silent Knowledge activity.\n\nWhich means, you could even view the emanations in a bowl of noodle soup.\n\nUsing the noodles!\n\nBut one way you can tell that you REALLY ARE viewing the emanations, is that you know what it means.\n\nThe sight has \"meaning\".\n\nWith a voice explaining sometimes.  Or if not a voice, telepathic knowledge of what you are looking at, comes into your mind.\n\nIf you just see some lines, that is also a view of the emanations, but it's not going to convince you of that.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are visiting in Cholita's phantom realm on the other side if my west darkroom wall, and something goes wrong in there so you leave,  you might gaze off in that state of having just walked out of an impossible phantom realm, with no regard for your physical body.\n\nYou \"shrank\" the tonal away, and just broke the laws of physics by walking through two solid walls, to visit with Cholita.\n\nWhen you return, you are sort of \"purified\".\n\nEven if things went badly in there.\n\nLike a grumpy Cholita.\n\nIn that state you might gaze north to the right of the west wall, wondering if you should go back in there and just put up with it.\n\nBut then the room turns into an unbelievable series of lines going every which way, including some \"angles\" you can clearly perceive.\n\nWith what looks like visible electricity flowing in them. The way it might in a cartoon.\n\nExcept that it has \"hues\".\n\nAnd a voice tells you, \"See that intersection there, with at least 8 different emanations crossing at that point?\"\n\nAnd you can see it.\n\n\"Just stick your fingers in there and relieve that built up pressure from too much coincidental flow, and Cholita will calm down.\"\n\nThat's the kind of view of the emanations you can get.\n\nIt's so cool, when you think about whether it's \"true\" or \"the only way to see it\", you don't care anymore.\n\nYou realize that the very thing stopping you from seeing stuff like that all the time, is that you care about it too much.\n\nOr to quote a rock song, \"We won't be fooled again!\"\n\nNot a good attitude for darkroom when viewing real magic.", "edited": 1674945537.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j6aep1g", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you mean you see the movies all around you while you&amp;#39;re doing the tensegrity?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, but they aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;well formed&amp;quot; unless you put some effort into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you do that, you burn off dreaming energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can see something that spectacular and stare, but it comes at a price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, you kind of have to learn to give it the &amp;quot;Big cleavage&amp;quot; treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ok to notice huge cleavage on a gorgeous woman you walk by while entering a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not ok to stare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Cholita described of her brown mini-skirt and knee high boots situation at Cleargreen christmas parties back in the late 90s, she wants to know that the men are &amp;quot;Randy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not desperate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Desperate is a deal killer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Is the purpose of tensegrity to aid with silence?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, but the topic is too complicated to explain in a short time.

Lately she follows me around, chastising me for not &amp;quot;having a life&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, if I don&amp;#39;t hide in my locked room she does nothing but attack me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose she wants me to bring home friends so she can join in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried explaining that in fact I do not stay in the room all night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I leave it often, and have visitors too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t want to hear that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I don&amp;#39;t get any direct effects from darkroom yet, but the fact that it makes my sleep experiences all crazy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We still don&amp;#39;t know much about how women learn the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might be, women are the &amp;quot;stalkers or dreamers&amp;quot; in sorcery groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And men are just lame.  But motivated to take over the world, so they come out ok despite their lack of talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Do you think that specific motions are important, e.g. they really do have the intent of ancient sorcerers behind them and there really are pouches and reallocation of energy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, they do.  You get to experience that yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;ll turn into a Jaguar, after realizing what those feelings are like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, the pouches are VERY visible when you get to the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can gaze into them after stuffing a purple puff on there, and look for the vortexes Carlos mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no need to doubt it.  Looking into the pouches later on will be like looking down at Disneyland from a low flying helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plenty to see!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no imagining here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; or do you think that Castaneda&amp;#39;s model with eggs, emanations, eagle, etc., Is the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no &amp;quot;ultimate&amp;quot; reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at least sorcerers know that, and everyone else doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not good for their business, for other systems to admit that what they have is just what they were given, and obviously not the ultimate anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sorcerers embrace that. They&amp;#39;re always hopeful for an even clearer understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will make much more sense when you can move deep into silent knowledge and realize how vast the dark sea of awareness really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what a tiny point in infinity our world is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; as it suggests emanations really might be at the base of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are MANY ways to view the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually a Silent Knowledge activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, you could even view the emanations in a bowl of noodle soup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using the noodles!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one way you can tell that you REALLY ARE viewing the emanations, is that you know what it means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sight has &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a voice explaining sometimes.  Or if not a voice, telepathic knowledge of what you are looking at, comes into your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you just see some lines, that is also a view of the emanations, but it&amp;#39;s not going to convince you of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are visiting in Cholita&amp;#39;s phantom realm on the other side if my west darkroom wall, and something goes wrong in there so you leave,  you might gaze off in that state of having just walked out of an impossible phantom realm, with no regard for your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;shrank&amp;quot; the tonal away, and just broke the laws of physics by walking through two solid walls, to visit with Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you return, you are sort of &amp;quot;purified&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if things went badly in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a grumpy Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that state you might gaze north to the right of the west wall, wondering if you should go back in there and just put up with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then the room turns into an unbelievable series of lines going every which way, including some &amp;quot;angles&amp;quot; you can clearly perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With what looks like visible electricity flowing in them. The way it might in a cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that it has &amp;quot;hues&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a voice tells you, &amp;quot;See that intersection there, with at least 8 different emanations crossing at that point?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just stick your fingers in there and relieve that built up pressure from too much coincidental flow, and Cholita will calm down.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the kind of view of the emanations you can get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so cool, when you think about whether it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the only way to see it&amp;quot;, you don&amp;#39;t care anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You realize that the very thing stopping you from seeing stuff like that all the time, is that you care about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to quote a rock song, &amp;quot;We won&amp;#39;t be fooled again!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a good attitude for darkroom when viewing real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_10n9jn4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10n9jn4/rock_pillow/j6aep1g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1674945061.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1674945061.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6a4ran", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "ControlledFolly_Ovix", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1674940809.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j68scq1", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_8yy2n1qw", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; A perfect tensegrity is like being surrounded by that monitor\n\nDo you mean you see the movies all around you while you're doing the tensegrity?\n\nIs the purpose of tensegrity to aid with silence?

So every second is \"now\", and if you are having difficulty it feels like a bad night.\n\nEven if you just returned from a visit to another world.\n\nThe rest of the things I did are beyond conscious recall.  They were lateral shifts.\n\nI had to take notes in my cellphone just to remember these things.\n\nWhat's going on here is the same thing that was going on when Carlos jumped from that cliff, guided by don Juan and don Genaro. He split into 2.  His dreaming double actually jumped.  They wanted him to take a look around down there, in order to fine tune its appearance in this world. Typically the fall would push the dreaming double into a phantom copy.\n\nIt's pretty much 4th gate dreaming.  Wake up in your own room, and prove it.\n\nCarlos remembered both events.  The jumping, and the joking around with don Genaro at the top.    But he wasn't clear at the time that both took place simultaneously.\n\nTaisha makes this clearer in her new book.  She climbs into a tree house so that the perception of shadow beings will hold her assemblage point stable as long as she remains there.  She even calls it \"stalking\".  But, and this is only my theory, she had Shotokan Karate testing coming up.  She had to practice her black belt forms. It's not something you can cram on. You have to do it daily, if you want to pass their difficult tests.   And back then it was quite a status symbol for a woman to be testing at that level.  \n\nOf her master dojo teacher \"Nishiyama\", it was said that he had no respect for women.  \n\nShe was under pressure to prove him wrong.\n\nBut she couldn't practice up in a tree.\n\nSo Emilito told her how to bring the dreaming double out on the ground.  Both present in the same location, at the same time.\n\nThat's what we're doing in darkroom gazing.  If you want proof of that,  carefully remember what you saw, when you believe  you could see your own body in the dark.\n\nThat can go down 3 ways, not just one.\n\nAnd one of them is your dreaming double.\n\nIf you can get at least 50% into your dreaming body, you'll have a good night. Even if it's a bad night.\n\nDon't ask about the Nun.  She was not a very nice nun.  And she was in a big comfy armchair made of brown leather. I just couldn't find that on goggle.\n\nCholita and her would get along just fine.  Don't let anyone confuse you.  Nuns are witches, pure and simple.\n\nThe transdimensional road side was interesting.  It ran along side the world of  the mud worms.  Or at least, on the same north wall of my bedroom, with the road being on the floor there. If I stepped off the bed, I'd be on that road.\n\nThe mud worms are the only IOBs I've ever pulled from their world and had them turn out to be solid and have weight.  Their oblong shape is very convenient for holding in your hand, but don't expect not to have a bunch of mud come out along with them.  I'm not sure what happens to the mud on your bed when you put them back.   But you can feel it dripping onto there when you pull them out.\n\nI've been buttering Fancy up lately, trying to convince her she can \"become famous!\" if only she will be more realistic, for longer periods.\n\nMaybe I'm a old fart, but young women always seemed to like the idea of becoming famous, back in the day.\n\nFancy doesn't quite get what that means.\n\nBut I've explained a few times:  More access to humans!  More energy to steal!\n\nI even explained it to her:  There's this thing called, \"the internet\".  Back 10000 years ago they didn't have it!  You can be the first inorganic being with your own social media pages!\n\nShe started to fade away after that.  Too much talking, not enough emotions.\n\nThat's also how it was back in the day. Young women were not impressed by high tech.\n\nIt might seem like a silly idea that Fancy could become famous,  but if you consider Vicente's 3 allies who pretended to be people stuck on the side of the road due to car breakdown, it's pretty obvious we don't have to settle for floating heads and shy fairies.  It might be possible to train an inorganic being to be \"more real\".\n\nIf Vicente's 3 allies had pulled the broken down car routine on a bunch of people, when YouTube existed, they'd also be famous.\n\nI guess we'll see what Fancy can learn over time.\n\nBut one thing she's already learned is, I don't mind a good scare.\n\nSo she gives me one. At random.  Then she giggles.\n\nI've been extracting that horrible yellow color lately.  It won't make sense, but \"it's on the left\".\n\nI have no idea what that means, but it held true 3 nights in a row.\n\nI was so puzzled about why the yellow is on the left, and you can just reach there and pull some out, that I looked behind a well formed purple puff, using my left hand.\n\nThere is was.  \n\nBut why the obsession with the yellow?\n\nIt forms power objects when injected into jet black, surrounded by purple haze.\n\nLately, Fancy has been teaching me to view my dreaming double, without all the fuss of having to fold in half or complete Zuleica's wiggling technique.  That's what I had in mind when I started writing down her long form.\n\nGet power arms and fingers, for faster wiggling.\n\nBut Fancy only heard, I wanted to bring out the dreaming double. So she did.\n\nI still plan to complete Zuleica's technique, but in fact our dreaming double can be lured out simply by paying attention to it.\n\nOne way is to learn to place a purple puff on your stomach, so that it remains. Observe how it goes away over time.\n\nIf it's on your \"body\", it will slowly fade, perhaps lingering as a purple glow.\n\nBut you can \"smear it\" all over your torso, to light up specific body parts. For instance, your arm.\n\nIf you get  your torso lit up, any puff you place there will be like adding another candle to the inside of a pumpkin.  You'll be able to watch it soak in and light it up more.\n\nIn that picture, you can see a \"super charged\" arm reaching up to pull on the only interesting inhabitant of that cliff dwelling I encountered last night.  She had a little friend, but it was kind of creepy.  Oddly, it looked like they had little houses to live in.\n\nNow,  imagine using your tensegrity to make your entire body visible as bright glows of purple light.  Which will include  yellow, blue, whitish, and pink.\n\nYou can make your entire body glow, so that you can see every part of it vividly.\n\nAll at once, is the goal.  \n\nBut good luck with that.\n\nIt's a 4 hour process.\n\nAnd probably 4 hours, just because you have to be 95% dreaming double.\n\nNot to worry.  In 1 hour you can make a super charged arm.  Scoop up puffs, compress them, and smear a very bright one on your right arm.  Then flick your fingers, to make them visible.\n\nWon't last long, but you'll get the idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title":

Paid trips to Beijing any time you like.\n\nHowever, it seems likely to me that at first, it will be your dreaming double who teleports.\n\nSo actually physically moving there will require finishing Zuleica's finger wiggling, so that the \"tonal\" is ok with letting the dreaming double drag it along.\n\nOr, perhaps so that the dreaming double can \"wake up\", as the tonal.\n\nI've done both.  I suppose I get more *intent* gifts than normal, so I can reassure you guys what's possible.  That's one benefit of this subreddit. Intent rewards those who help others on this same path.\n\nIn the first case, I physically leaped through a portal to another world.  And don't ask me what happened to my \"real body\".  It leaped through the wall, that's all I know.  I teleported, but to a different world.  So I supposed it's not as satisfying as teleporting somewhere here, and having to walk home.\n\nIn the second case, I walked right into Cholita's dreaming copy of the house.  Very bizarre in there, no way to mistake it for our real home.  Not to mention Cholita is up to her ears in inorganic beings, who love it in there.\n\nWhen it was time to go to work I walked right out, and into the shower.\n\nI never actually \"woke up\".\n\nSo there's plenty of room for teleportation to turn out to be possible.  \n\nAnd off the top of my head, to encourage this type of conversation, there's the \"nagual's mirror of the second attention\", or something like that.\n\nJuan can tell you, it's very possible to look at yourself in a mirror that isn't really there.  Just a cloud of purple light perhaps.\n\nI find that the V spot pass causes a window to form, and there's always a person on the other side.  Could be, that's actually a mirror.\n\nAbout the Nagual looking into that mirror and seeing himself it's said, after that he can almost treat physical matter as if it didn't exist.\n\nBut...   Almost.  That's the rub.\n\nThen there's the method the IOBs used to \"kidnap\" people.  Actually, save them from the river of filth, if you ask me.  And some Tibetan masters seem to agree, their realm is not so bad.  Someone posted a story mentioning that, in the last day or two.\n\nBut, the Rakshasas (IOBs) take your dreaming double first.

Paid trips to Beijing any time you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it seems likely to me that at first, it will be your dreaming double who teleports.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So actually physically moving there will require finishing Zuleica&amp;#39;s finger wiggling, so that the &amp;quot;tonal&amp;quot; is ok with letting the dreaming double drag it along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, perhaps so that the dreaming double can &amp;quot;wake up&amp;quot;, as the tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done both.  I suppose I get more &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; gifts than normal, so I can reassure you guys what&amp;#39;s possible.  That&amp;#39;s one benefit of this subreddit. Intent rewards those who help others on this same path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first case, I physically leaped through a portal to another world.  And don&amp;#39;t ask me what happened to my &amp;quot;real body&amp;quot;.  It leaped through the wall, that&amp;#39;s all I know.  I teleported, but to a different world.  So I supposed it&amp;#39;s not as satisfying as teleporting somewhere here, and having to walk home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the second case, I walked right into Cholita&amp;#39;s dreaming copy of the house.  Very bizarre in there, no way to mistake it for our real home.  Not to mention Cholita is up to her ears in inorganic beings, who love it in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it was time to go to work I walked right out, and into the shower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never actually &amp;quot;woke up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s plenty of room for teleportation to turn out to be possible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And off the top of my head, to encourage this type of conversation, there&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;nagual&amp;#39;s mirror of the second attention&amp;quot;, or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan can tell you, it&amp;#39;s very possible to look at yourself in a mirror that isn&amp;#39;t really there.  Just a cloud of purple light perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find that the V spot pass causes a window to form, and there&amp;#39;s always a person on the other side.  Could be, that&amp;#39;s actually a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the Nagual looking into that mirror and seeing himself it&amp;#39;s said, after that he can almost treat physical matter as if it didn&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But...   Almost.  That&amp;#39;s the rub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the method the IOBs used to &amp;quot;kidnap&amp;quot; people.  Actually, save them from the river of filth, if you ask me.  And some Tibetan masters seem to agree, their realm is not so bad.  Someone posted a story mentioning that, in the last day or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, the Rakshasas (IOBs) take your dreaming double first. I suppose that means, your tonal gets into a very bad mood all the time. Miles once got his dreaming double trapped at Pandora, behind the support beam at the stairs.

You play with them.  You learn to manipulate them in fantastic ways, inorganic beings join in to get the energy, and eventually the colors form a thick \"dreaming fog\", filled with all sorts of things.\n\nYou get lost for a while, in that \"Crystalline Dreaming Fog\".  So far just me and Juan, but I predict it will become a common barrier.\n\nAfter all, we didn't have to learn to stop the \"rotation\" of the wall of fog.  We materialized the fog around ourselves, rather than letting an Emilito bring us in.\n\nSo it seems reasonable that we'll still have to face a barrier of dreaming fog.  Just not the precise same way.\n\nIt's Zuleica's doing.    She used Emilito to bring people through the \"bank of fog\",  but at the same time she taught how to get in there yourself.  With her darkroom gazing at colors.\n\nHow?  Just move your assemblage point all the way down, and then back up.  Watching colors in darkness will do that, without fail.\n\nIt's not a place. It's a position of the assemblage point.  It only looks like a place, when your assemblage point is just far enough to perceive it, but not far enough to be there yourself.\n\nIt's \"practical magic\".  Where you use your ordinary eyes to summon intent.  Simply by looking where you want to go.\n\nOrdinary eyes?  I guess that's not quite right.  But horizontal shifts of the assemblage point are summoned with your gaze.  Just by watching something you find interesting, it becomes more real.\n\nMaybe it's more like, where you focus your awareness?\n\nSo you make it all the way into the \"bank of fog\", and are distracted by all the things you find there.  They slow you down, so you can't find your way out.\n\nBut it's fun!  Like jumping into one of those \"ball pits\" filled with colorful plastic balls, in which kids jump and play inside a cage made of nets.\n\nThen you pass it.\n\nThe air clears.  No more puffs of color!\n\nYes, no more. That's just one view of things, from a specific range of positions of the assemblage point.\n\nIt can come and go during darkroom gazing.  But don't worry, if it goes, you just ask for it back and it obeys.  After a delay.\n\nWhen your assemblage point is very far on the J curve, and the puffs of color are gone, you see energy on the walls.\n\nA whitish light. It can form lines, clouds, blobs.  It's not completely smooth. It's \"course\".\n\nActually, it's potential!  It can become anything, I suppose.\n\nSo, given a little power (help from intent), you could bring yourself to the point of seeing whitish energy on all surfaces in the room, and announce \"I'd like to see Disneyland!\"\n\nDon't insist or you'll move your assemblage point back to your normal \"fussy\" position.\n\nMore often than not, you'll get to see Disneyland.\n\nBut there's not much point to that. It's more useful to wait and see what it forms, all by itself.\n\nIt's just faint lines on the wall.  Enough so that you can \"see the room\" in absolute darkness, which is amazing all by itself.\n\nBut not enough to recognize anything.\n\nAt that stage, you can \"concentrate\" it by sweeping your palm across the room, very slowly.  Gaze in front of where it's moving next, and you can cause things to condense into recognizable objects or places.\n\nOr you can wiggle your fingers at the position of the second attention's assemblage point, while sitting up on pillows, and just wait for the room to do what it will.\n\nI commonly find forests.  One forest seems to be in Cambodia, and once I clearly recognize a piece of it it starts to spread into the room.  Huge tree roots crawl all the way up to the bed.\n\nThat's \"translocation\".\n\nYou are in your bedroom.  But you also get to see another place.\n\nI had the idea to try to make it \"pan\" along, the way you can do in closed eye remote viewing.\n\nYou can be looking down at the ground, from 50 feet in the air, and make it scroll along.\n\nThere are many who can do that.\n\nBut with eyes open, moving the entire room to another location seems to be unique.\n\nThe Taiwanese bosses son said, \"They have that in Chinese literature.  But each time you do it, your lifespan is cut by a little.\"\n\nWell...  That lets the Taoist sorcerer charge more money for the information you want.    He'll go find your answer for you, but it's going to cost more, because it'll take 1 year off his life.\n\nTaoism (and Chinese \"sage\" wisdom) is dominated by such book deal add-ons.  To increase the value of something with phony extra information.\n\nIn our case, we have no such baggage, and everything we do is new and unknown.\n\nLast night I was only interested in translocation. I hadn't done any of Fancy's combination pass. I didn't want her influence at all.  Translocation takes moving all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nBut Fancy kept popping up.  Her little head here. A demon there.  Finally she appeared and did what I can't resist. She flirted.\n\nIt was so nice, I had to toss her a bone.  I told her, \"Go find a dream for me!  Show me what's inside.\"\n\nShe had a blank expression, like a dog who's bored with \"fetch\", but you toss the stupid stick anyway.  And he dutifully goes off to get it. While you consume the snack you were hiding in your pocket.\n\nI was already at the point of seeing whitish light on the bedspread, but not on the walls. I crawled around, trying to figure out why I could clearly see my hand waving over the white lines on the bed.\n\nI glanced up and saw fancy, disappear into a dream.  She'd found one!  I was complete surprised, since I'd told her that nearly 20 minutes before.\n\nI commented, \"Make it a romance!\"\n\n15 minutes later she showed up when a little dream burned it's way through the puffs of color.  She was waiting for a man, who didn't show up.\n\nAnother 15 to 20 minutes, and I saw her decide she'd waited too long, and get on the phone to make a call.\n\nAnd then later, she was at a party.\n\nSomewhere in there, Bob got frustrated and I saw them kissing outside any dream.\n\nI don't know that they're kissing, but they press their faces together.\n\nI feel a little bad now, for neglecting Fancy.  Tonight is all hers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "IOB TV", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xwvo5ixfhe661": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xwvo5ixfhe661.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ada1bc66b25a5a83f7d3f9d715bc714fd5631e6"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xwvo5ixfhe661.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7ce475322bb143368365db6421b0312d8d1ea39"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xwvo5ixfhe661.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b17957971c6e3bb77e2db382472838a03812042"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xwvo5ixfhe661.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0db5c1f7cfee00d77d535241c86d8bbd8f085bb"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xwvo5ixfhe661.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5b59aa83d869e4c959fafdd3b68436a3d26a6dd"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xwvo5ixfhe661.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7429822caabc68a1fc0df4f2221a54541de6d075"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xwvo5ixfhe661.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71974b475ef85aeaa932d7ea827a84552b644326"}, "id": "xwvo5ixfhe661"}}, "name": "t3_kh1t5t", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/b_rvc0y9VMHvvuUEGrWBHc_4jzud0cDjhfplKpWf-6w.jpg", "edited": 1627851202.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1608496662.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xwvo5ixfhe661.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=71974b475ef85aeaa932d7ea827a84552b644326\"&gt;An accidental side effect.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan managed to &amp;quot;translocate&amp;quot; recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Translocation is a side effect of viewing energy on a horizon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos explained this in his &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; publication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But from a dark room gazing point of view, you find some colors.

Lily seduced me with this scene for 30 minutes.](https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33fd0a04c4a15c11fbae7d7dbb7d168059c62a95)\n\nWe have so many new people, that a stream has decided this is just like any other magic subreddit, and it's all made up.  So they're eagerly pretending their results and posting as soon as they can, as if we were selling lottery tickets, with \"bad ass magic man\" as the prize.\n\nI'm afraid, it doesn't work like that in this subreddit. So please stop that.\n\nI had to post the actual information for this post over in the private sub.\n\nWasn't going to post any of it over here or else the next new bad guy faker we got would be \"succeeding\" at perceiving what I have here.\n\nThe forces of greed always bury real magic. That's where we find ourselves today.\n\nBut back before there was money, and agriculture hadn't crowded huge populations into cities where they stare at walls in rooms all day longing for magic, there was no reason to make stuff up.\n\nSo the Olmecs just created a technology to explore reality.\n\nWhich was secret, and never shared with outsiders.\n\nSo there was no pretending, and no fraud.\n\nExcept...  Among the \"Men of Knowledge\".  Those guys were bakers, mask makers, dancers, healers, and any other thing they could come up where magical rituals and power plants could enhance your business.\n\nBut they were not *seers*, so they needed rituals and drugs.\n\nTo this day people ask me, \"Did Carlos teach you to make the smoking mixture????!\"\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nYou can tell them, \"He GAVE  us Little Smoke, what more do you want?!\"\n\nYou'll get no sign of understanding and they'll ask again, \"But what about the smoking mixture?\"\n\nToo dense to even understand the first books.\n\nBut that \"Men of Knowledge\" stuff is seductive. It's like \"Advanced Buddhist sacred scrolls\".\n\nEvery bit as useless, but it's something you can memorize, and then pat yourself on your back for \"progress\".\n\nWhen there's none.\n\nI guess I'd better clear that one up.\n\nThe smoking mixture was deliberately WEAKENED to confuse users of it.  Some of the \"smoke\" might have been intended as a gift for the inorganic being doing the \"assist\". Who knows. But most of the shroom was in fact wasted.\n\nYou could just chew them and get a better high.\n\nThe point was, to move the assemblage point of the user enough for Little Smoke, the inorganic being of that name,  to be able to teach them.  That's anywhere below the green line.\n\nBut not to move it so far down to the bottom, and so far to the right, that they'd be impossible to teach anything to.\n\nIt was a \"Man of knowledge\" misunderstanding.\n\nIn fact, it was all Little Smoke. Not the shrooms.\n\nMeaning, not the smoking mixture.  Don't believe Little Smoke can teach as well as a drug?\n\nThis place was created by her lessons!\n\nLittle Smoke is a very old friend to the lineage and is called, \"Little Smoke\", because when she follows her owner around in daylight, she looks like a little ball of bright white smoke.\n\nCholita used to command her to fly up to things, and I used to be on the lookout for that sight, whenever Cholita could tolerate having me around.\n\nI don't know where the moth image comes from, on the cover of some of the books, but that's her too.  I never got to see that \"look\".\n\nRemember the moth swooping over the campfire?\n\nThat's how you \"introduce\" little smoke to a new owner.  All you have to do is, point out the swoop.\n\nIf someone can perceive the swoop, they've already \"entangled\" enough emanations with little smoke, to establish the link she needs.\n\nBut it doesn't matter if I explain this.  The \"lure\" of procedures and power plants, is just too much for lazy people to bear.  They'll revert to pretending to be \"men of knowledge\" as long as some fun stuff comes with the drug usage.\n\nLike native American Shamanism I suppose.  Why are they using power plants?\n\nI have stalkers in that area.  Angry native American men who have declared Carlos a fraud for years, and will look very bad if they turn out to be wrong. So they've become trolls.\n\nShamanism seems to be the left over Men of Knowledge stuff.   Don Juan even says so somewhere in there.  That there are scores of men all over Mexico who follow the old ways, but can't *see* and have no knowledge.\n\nIf you don't believe it's all descendant from the Olmecs,  you should google a bit.  Their magic is known as the \"mother of all Mesoamerican shamanism\" on some web pages.\n\nWeb pages that don't give a fig at all about Carlos, perhaps even despise him as a fraud.\n\nBut still recognize the history of Beringian magic in the Americas.  And are not understanding that Olmec magic is our magic. They still think we're claiming it's Toltec.\n\nBy the way, the migrations over the Bering straights broke into a left and right side around our north west coast, so presumable the Olmecs were the same Indians you find relics for in Illinois?\n\nThere's VERY old axe heads there.  And on the west coast, the Luiseno have 10,000 year old relics.\n\nSo maybe, the Olmec studiers will leave Carlos alone, and give an honest analysis of the Olmecs, not realizing it all bolsters Don Juan's history lessons.\n\n\"Scholars\" are happy to bend the truth a bit, to support their assumptions. Especially anthropologists.\n\nMaybe someone planned it that way...  To distract history with the shiny object of the Toltecs.\n\nLet the crazies and frauds go for \"Toltec!!!!!!\"\n\nWho cares about pre-historic people who wore rubber caps anyway?  And so what, if they invented the wheel, as some say the Olmecs did.  Certainly they must have invented Jaguar clay toys with wheels for children, at the very least.\n\nBut the Toltecs were \"warriors\"!  Ask Mel Gibson.\n\nAt any rate, if you are faking your magic in here, you're like the forces which removed it entirely from society.\n\nAll to get attention or money.\n\nPlease go away.  Let just one place survive for a change?  We don't need any more \"impeccable tantrums\".\n\nShow off your \"knowledge\" in the \"Magick\" subreddit?  Those guys don't care what shit you're into.\n\nWhat's useful to a beginner in this picture I added to this post?\n\nOnly \"Recognize\", and \"Reject\".\n\nAs the assemblage point moves down, you'll discover these forces.\n\nGo look up \"How to burn a hole in reality\".  It's a post.  I didn't make good pictures back then.\n\nYou can call, \"recognize\" the \"twinkle of a gaze\".  Use your recapitulation head movement, but keep the eyes open and let your \"gaze\" literally BURN a horizontal streak across the blackness. If it hits a \"sparkle\" you can stop there, and burn through to make a big black hole materialize in front of you.  \"Everything\" conceivable can spill out into the room.\n\nWish I'd known how to draw back then.  I literally mean \"everything conceivable\" can spill into the room.\n\nIt's like an *intent* Christmas, for a beginner.\n\nWork on that after you use puffs to get to the red zone.\n\nTry to understand things from direct experience. Not from reading posts, and pretending them.\n\nThe rest is in this picture is too advanced for anyone who can't get to the orange zone.\n\nFor real that is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Choices of Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xpkj083hiod81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f92a77322ef166c4bfa9b34ebf4506b43674ff9"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d77d2c5f2b39aaf2aaa95e952fb2542054918dc"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1b09345115068ffbb8060bd84ba89fbcbee6b65"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=434b72a3e63c4ed304c6b440a53aab75b30577d3"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=985d1ca99979edff4a5be83bf8a88e644291aa7d"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=666fe30b21291d198e1dacfd5cd3e4c6f5ff8965"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33fd0a04c4a15c11fbae7d7dbb7d168059c62a95"}, "id": "xpkj083hiod81"}}, "name": "t3_sbt6f6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/UwNk4IAsZTwXff8siQ9I0apUNz2EH66X7mLEq8ne-SM.jpg", "edited": 1643052873.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643049806.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xpkj083hiod81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=33fd0a04c4a15c11fbae7d7dbb7d168059c62a95\"&gt;Why I posted at all.

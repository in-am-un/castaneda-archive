If you \"notice\" what your sweeping hand and arm are feeling, you realize the air itself is filled with cobwebs and sheets of soft fabric blowing in the breeze.  Even moving a single inche causes your arm to brush up against 10 \"things\".  And it's non-stop during the tensegrity movement, if you just switch your attention to the sense of touch.\n\nI have no doubt you could also hear things, and certainly you could detect temperature changes.\n\nI'm sorry beginners have to work so hard just to see colors, but once you do don't stop if you want to have so much to entertain you, that you couldn't even describe it well to someone who wasn't eagerly interested in hearing it for their own use.\n\nYou are way past the river of shit into a \"chaotic but orderly\" realm of waking dreaming.\n\nI guess it means your double is doing most of the perceiving, but you have your full rationality intact.\n\nYou just can't let any words slip into your mind if you want to go further.\n\nKeep that up for a few days, and \"the absurd\" begins to dawn on you.\n\nAll that, every single thing you see during darkroom practice, including the puffs, inorganic being manifestations, whitish light on surfaces, alien worlds materializing on walls, and then silent knowledge objects, the most amazing \"toys\" you could imagine floating down from above wherever you need one, seemingly sentient and like a \"magic ball\" you can cast out to form another reality in front of you, are all stemming from one thing.\n\nLinearity.\n\nLet me backup.\n\nCholita was singing tonight when I got home.\n\nIn the bathroom.\n\nShe seems to have needed more electrical power, so there was a big extension cord running under the door to the bathroom, which was closed. There's 2 outlets in there over the sink, for shaving and hair dryers. But those always have fuse buttons in the middle, and she's blown the fuse before.\n\nI thought perhaps she was singing a made up song to taunt me, which is usually one of the methods she employs to greet me when I get home.\n\nThe other main method is to hide. Which can even go on for weeks. But at least 3 days.\n\nI listened to figure out if it was a song to taunt me, and realized it was in spanish.\n\nAnd seemed to just be a normal song she liked. Except she was doing exaggerated vibrato.\n\nShit... \n\nMariachi music.\n\nThere's nothing like a very good Mariachi band. \n\nPerhaps Linda Ronstadt.\n\nBut when it's bad, it's very very bad.  Accordions blazing, and a fat mexican man in a blue suit, eagerly showing off his gold front tooth, while lamenting something absurd that's got him in an emotional frenzy.\n\nIt doesn't even go well with Margaritas and chips.\n\nIt's like taking a rock and roll purist, and tying him to a chair with the worst kind of hick country music blazing in his ears, through headphones he can't remove.\n\nI was torn between standing outside the bathroom to listen to Cholita's vibrato filled words, to see what she was \"up to\", because the day before she was inviting me to look into her mind.\n\nOr just ignoring her singing and enjoying the fact that she seemed happy for a change.\n\nThe day before she was describing reddish orange round blobs spread across a flat purple surface, active with a thought in each. In her mind. I could actually see them, which is odd since she was talking through the bathroom door. And I wasn't in dreaming awake. And she wasn't in her double as far as I could tell.\n\nBut she wasn't using the right words. She said, \"Do you want to extract the tunnel vortexes from my mind today?\"\n\nI told her I didn't know what she meant, but she kept repeating it.\n\nI blew her off. Left to go into my room.\n\nThen regretted it later.\n\nA week or two before she'd literally made a \"room addition\" to my phantom realm construction, which is the tool I use to reach Silent Knowledge. I build \"dream bubble station\", using a series of Tensegrity forms.\n\nA \"practical task\" which can be made to work using selected forms.\n\nAnd I was coming to realize, the 4 statues she gave me, and also the balcony for observes to gaze on them from above, now permanently connected to my east wall, was all about \"the abstract\".\n\nI gazed at each for at least 20 minutes, without it even occurring to me that was odd.\n\nSince I couldn't tell you even a tiny thing about why I kept gazing at them.\n\nEvery square inch, scanning back and forth, just absorbing the visual data of their statue shapes.\n\nAll I could tell you about them is, the \"hues\" were different. But I enjoyed gazing at them enough not to get bored over what might have been hours.\n\nI had come to realize yesterday, the status are \"abstract\".\n\nIt's not uncommon when dealing with inorganic beings, at first, to have them \"trap you\" in the abstract when you lay down to go to sleep after interacting.\n\nYou'll be \"stuck in a loop\" where the whole series of perceptions makes no sense.\n\nAnd while trapped, in a fixed laying position on the bed, it slowly dawns on you that you've been looking at the same thing, maybe for an hour.\n\nBut you can't describe it well.\n\nMaybe it's 3 pillows of different colors each, layed on top of your torso and legs.\n\nAnd there's a woman sitting beside you on the bed, pressing down on them.\n\nThe instant you formulate that idea, you can clearly see her!\n\nShe's even brought a friend.\n\nBut also, the instant you begin to \"snap out of it\" a very strong idea dominates your mind.\n\nShe \"manipulates\" you to keep going.\n\nShe telepathically asks you, \"Are there still 3 pillows? Maybe one is missing?\"\n\nSo you go to \"count them\", and you've been reset.\n\nStuck at the start of the loop again, doomed to repeat it.\n\nI believe they drain energy while doing that, but no one should take it as \"evil\".\n\nIt's like Cholita. If she attacks me, I get a gigantic reward later on. A magical reward.\n\nLike those statues. She gave them to me, while attacking me. I have no idea how she realized she could do that. Cholita is too strange to make sense to outsiders, most of the time.\n\nLike the day I came home to find out she was wearing a 5 gallon plastic water cooler bottle on her head, as a hat.\n\nI believe that what's behind her statues, \"the abstract\", and being trapped in \"abstract dreaming\" by an inorganic being, reveals a simple fact.\n\nWe have chosen to perceive only the linear. We dumb and blink to the non-linear.  \n\nAnd yet, we can perceive it. Thus the IOBs can use that to \"trap\" you.\n\n\"The Linear\" is only that which fits into a virtual timeline we're always keeping track of.  As if we have a train to catch, and have to keep checking our watches as we prepare for the day's trip.\n\nIt might be why lineages eventually need to \"break the continuity\" of apprentices.\n\nSuch as have them leap off a cliff to their death near Mexico City, only to \"wake up in bed\" 10 minutes later, thousands of miles away.\n\nIf you locate the old \"Ship's Restaurant\" not too far from La Brea tar pits in LA, the apartment Carlos woke up in after don Juan left was likely across the street. One of the tall high-rise apartment buildings.\n\nProbably the same that had the parking where he found a beam you passed under, that gave him a tingle on his scalp. And don Juan had been telling him that's the sign of the double coming out. So Carlos drove under it over and over, to learn that feeling.\n\nDon't anyone think to seek that. Darkroom leads you there for sure.\n\nAnd it also leads you to realize, we throw out perhaps as much as half of what we perceive.\n\nIt's \"non-linear\". Doesn't connect to the timeline properly.\n\nCan't \"flatten\" it out, and turn it into an intelligent story.\n\nWhen the IOBs trap you using it, they don't immerse you fully into it.\n\nBecause that wouldn't engage the rational mind.\n\nAnd so whatever they are after, wouldn't be available.\n\nThey bring you \"50% abstract\", and seek out the remainder for themselves to feed on.\n\nI'm afraid, the IOBs need energy from humans.\n\nAnd it could very well be, that if you want them to be as real and solid as those of Vicente, you have to help them get some.  Their own access to humans is very limited.\n\nSo you have to help them scare \"civilians\".\n\nIf you're a sorcerer with apprentices, you can use them to scare your apprentices to help move their assemblage points.\n\nSo it's a positive!\n\nBut still, the old seers actually fed them by scaring enemies to death.\n\nI like to think they went after the \"Ken Eagle Feather\" Men of Knowledge types, who got themselves a Rambo Headband, and are profiting from pretending they can teach magic to anyone who pays them.\n\nOtherwise if the old seers went after random people, they'd incur a \"debt\".\n\nBut going after someone who has made a pest of themselves, doesn't.\n\nAt least not in Olmec times. Everyone back then knew, \"They had it coming\".\n\nDon't annoy the scary Jaguar men. Or you'll be sorry.\n\nFrankly, we'd be a better society if we had some of those around to worry about.\n\nPerhaps that's part of why don Juan didn't like the allies.\n\nThey need to be fed very expensive food.\n\nGoldfish are far less trouble. \n\nBut perhaps the allies need human energy in order to be \"real\" to humans.\n\nNow it turns out, there's twice as many \"sights\" to see during darkroom as we are aware of.\n\nAnd some can't possibly translate to words.\n\nWhich makes them very beneficial for holding your silence.\n\nIf you can move your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve, you get the visits from \"magical objects\". Silent Knowledge \"offers\".\n\nFloating, as yet unused, \"presentation methods\".\n\nDon Juan didn't recommend just randomly perceiving those.\n\nWhen you get there, those are now \"yours\".\n\nBut I guess you could say, it's like a little envelope with some codeine pills in it, showing up in your mailbox each day.\n\nI love dentist visits, when you get the \"codeine reward\".\n\nAn \"evil\" dentist will even tell you, \"Don't take more than 2 at a time.\n\nDon't. Just don't. I really mean it.\"\n\nWith a grin on his face.\n\nIt's a very bad idea to try them out, if you had a free daily supply magically showing up in your mailbox, even though they make you very happy for a while.\n\nYou can get lost in those pills.\n\nSame with random \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nSo don Juan told us all, he recommends we become \"Readers of Infinity\".\n\nRead text instead. That way, it says what it says. No need to \"interpret\" what the little visions of \"silent knowledge\" actually mean.\n\nExcept, in my opinion that's a dirty trick.\n\nIt's easy to get cool visions in Silent Knowledge.\n\nBut to be asked to insist a purple and jet black \"whorl\" has to form near the ceiling to the right, it has to spin or flow, the edges need to turn pomegranate color, and THEN you can get silent knowledge as text, is a bit much.\n\nIt's like telling someone their surfing is nice, but they shouldn't get trapped in enjoying the ride.\n\nThat instead they should be juggling little spinning dishes on the end of a 6 foot pole stretching above them, like a Chinese kungfu acrobat.\n\nWhile surfing...\n\nIt's quite a burden.\n\nSo what happens if you obey don Juan?\n\nYou shun all the amazing magic you dearly wanted to command, in order to find something 10 times harder?\n\nYou look around!!!\n\nIn perfect silence.\n\nYou finally stop, to see what's really going on with your perception.\n\nAnd you notice, \"the abstract\".\n\nBlobs of non-linear time. Thick around you.\n\nBetween the cracks of those many dream scenes you are swimming in now, like the picture of Bruce Lee in the room of broken carnival fun house mirrors.\n\nI heard they only added that scene on a whim, and yet it's become iconic of him.\n\nCarlos once told a story so absurd, it's hard to believe he didn't make it up.\n\nHe, Howard Lee, and Bruce Lee, had a movie camera and started their own little movie.\n\nWith him as the bartender.\n\nIt's hard to believe until you realize, Howard and Carlos were \"friends\", and Howard was an old school kung fu guy in LA, where Bruce lived.\n\nAnd Carlos was \"magic celebrity\" supreme. With Bruce spouting cheap asian \"wisdom\" in his movies, obviously interested in seeming to be superior in his thinking to others.\n\nCarlos had even better \"esoteric goodies\", than Asia.\n\nOf course Bruce would hang out with him if he could!\n\nIt's just that, Bruce was a big time bad player for sure.\n\n\"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" even makes fun of him for it.  He gets a \"revenge ass kicking\", as does the Manson cult woman.  Hollywood \"changes the story\".\n\nWhat can you do with \"the abstract\" once you realize it starts to become visible during darkroom, when the assemblage point reaches the end of the J curve path?\n\nWell, just at least remember that \"Carlos warned us\".\n\nIn his final publications, likely Silent Knowledge or Readers of Infinity.\n\nI hope it's described in Readers of Infinity, because that would verify my theory that don Juan was tricking us with that text suggestion. To read text, and ignore super cool \"to die for\" magic in your face.\n\nDon't go out partying with your drunken friends all night!  Go to the library and read books instead...\n\nBut the truth is, don Juan wanted you to look around the library building. But he didn't want you to realize that. It had to be \"natural\" that you noticed whatever he wanted you to find, as if you had \"discovered it all by yourself\".\n\nJust remember one other important thing.\n\nWhen you make strong sorcery progress, heed the words of Carlos and pay attention.\n\nYou'll get 3 random attacks, to try to stop you.\n\nThe forces around you will rise up to try to bother you, insult you, or in any way they can activate the \"poor baby me\" mode in your mind.\n\nLike a little brother smacking the arm of a slightly older sister, who is playing with a cool new toy in the car.\n\nTo make sure if she has more fun than him, she has to suffer for it.\n\nThe reason that can happen, is currently beyond our understanding. Carlos blamed \"the fliers\".\n\nWho can \"activate\" random people to attack.\n\nHard to swallow.\n\nBut then the fact is, we filter out at least 50% of what we perceive, because it's non-linear.\n\nI only counted 2 attacks yesterday. One techno deleted before I saw it.\n\nAnd the other a guy who's been lurking around more than a year, who finally decided to commit suicide and piss on the place.\n\nFor no apparent reason I can think of.\n\nMust still be one I didn't notice out there if they come in 3s.\n\nSo keep an eye out for that kind of attack, if you work hard.\n\nIf you still have family around you, could be one of them suddenly gets a \"bug up their a...\"\n\nSomething out there just doesn't want you perceiving advanced sorcery sights.\n\nWhich, always keep in mind, are just \"nano feelings\" reflecting back at you through your senses, from the emanations onto which your awareness is currently flowing.\n\nSome of which don't combine well enough to form \"linear time\".\n\nBut can still be experienced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Abstract Layer of Reality", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"384a41ljj04a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/384a41ljj04a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c538c949f191bba5e4b31c67fdfffec16c9c21e"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/384a41ljj04a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf33ad1f361c72e468bb4fb18bb2a1d2692a5bac"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/384a41ljj04a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0798f067a7bf21b179c40100fdffaa899dfd91e"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/384a41ljj04a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c82a2c156a84d63d7a93e5192d3bbfeb761843c6"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/384a41ljj04a1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ee6884c0a4f61e4c8c7b84a00f211bba7425690"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/384a41ljj04a1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3671d29f9329b3b85917d3a75c2d683eb4a2f990"}], "s": {"y": 900, "x": 1600, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/384a41ljj04a1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0d14f056c13b41f4774e5bb00ac8211b54be632"}, "id": "384a41ljj04a1"}}, "name": "t3_zcywuw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3jca6WgOKl3j4ml84NaAyBvAYuJPeSre0jVQ77R56J8.jpg", "edited": 1670253362.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670220830.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/384a41ljj04a1.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c0d14f056c13b41f4774e5bb00ac8211b54be632\"&gt;Sorry I can&amp;#39;t afford to make nice pictures as much anymore. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This picture of Bruce Lee isn&amp;#39;t too far from what it&amp;#39;s like doing Tensegrity in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe remove most of the color and make it pinkish, and change each reflection of himself to a different fascinating proto-dream scene, and you&amp;#39;d have a match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But imagine the Tensegrity move has you turning around slowly, and that means your head is scanning by each unfinished dreaming scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not only do you have endless visual detail to the point that you could only say, you are literally in the &amp;quot;thick&amp;quot; of waking dreaming, but you can also smell things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A whiff of stale dried dog food here as you turn a bit further than usual in the tensegrity form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over there, it seems like what Cholita might have made for dinner, except you already know she had fried Papas because you could smell that when you got home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the sense of touch.

But I enjoyed gazing at them enough not to get bored over what might have been hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had come to realize yesterday, the status are &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not uncommon when dealing with inorganic beings, at first, to have them &amp;quot;trap you&amp;quot; in the abstract when you lay down to go to sleep after interacting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be &amp;quot;stuck in a loop&amp;quot; where the whole series of perceptions makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while trapped, in a fixed laying position on the bed, it slowly dawns on you that you&amp;#39;ve been looking at the same thing, maybe for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t describe it well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s 3 pillows of different colors each, layed on top of your torso and legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s a woman sitting beside you on the bed, pressing down on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The instant you formulate that idea, you can clearly see her!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s even brought a friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also, the instant you begin to &amp;quot;snap out of it&amp;quot; a very strong idea dominates your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She &amp;quot;manipulates&amp;quot; you to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She telepathically asks you, &amp;quot;Are there still 3 pillows? Maybe one is missing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you go to &amp;quot;count them&amp;quot;, and you&amp;#39;ve been reset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuck at the start of the loop again, doomed to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe they drain energy while doing that, but no one should take it as &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like Cholita. If she attacks me, I get a gigantic reward later on. A magical reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like those statues. She gave them to me, while attacking me. I have no idea how she realized she could do that. Cholita is too strange to make sense to outsiders, most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the day I came home to find out she was wearing a 5 gallon plastic water cooler bottle on her head, as a hat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that what&amp;#39;s behind her statues, &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;, and being trapped in &amp;quot;abstract dreaming&amp;quot; by an inorganic being, reveals a simple fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have chosen to perceive only the linear. We dumb and blink to the non-linear.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, we can perceive it. Thus the IOBs can use that to &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Linear&amp;quot; is only that which fits into a virtual timeline we&amp;#39;re always keeping track of.  As if we have a train to catch, and have to keep checking our watches as we prepare for the day&amp;#39;s trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might be why lineages eventually need to &amp;quot;break the continuity&amp;quot; of apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as have them leap off a cliff to their death near Mexico City, only to &amp;quot;wake up in bed&amp;quot; 10 minutes later, thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you locate the old &amp;quot;Ship&amp;#39;s Restaurant&amp;quot; not too far from La Brea tar pits in LA, the apartment Carlos woke up in after don Juan left was likely across the street. One of the tall high-rise apartment buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably the same that had the parking where he found a beam you passed under, that gave him a tingle on his scalp. And don Juan had been telling him that&amp;#39;s the sign of the double coming out. So Carlos drove under it over and over, to learn that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t anyone think to seek that. Darkroom leads you there for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it also leads you to realize, we throw out perhaps as much as half of what we perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;non-linear&amp;quot;. Doesn&amp;#39;t connect to the timeline properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;flatten&amp;quot; it out, and turn it into an intelligent story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the IOBs trap you using it, they don&amp;#39;t immerse you fully into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because that wouldn&amp;#39;t engage the rational mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so whatever they are after, wouldn&amp;#39;t be available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They bring you &amp;quot;50% abstract&amp;quot;, and seek out the remainder for themselves to feed on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, the IOBs need energy from humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it could very well be, that if you want them to be as real and solid as those of Vicente, you have to help them get some.  Their own access to humans is very limited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to help them scare &amp;quot;civilians&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a sorcerer with apprentices, you can use them to scare your apprentices to help move their assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s a positive!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, the old seers actually fed them by scaring enemies to death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to think they went after the &amp;quot;Ken Eagle Feather&amp;quot; Men of Knowledge types, who got themselves a Rambo Headband, and are profiting from pretending they can teach magic to anyone who pays them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise if the old seers went after random people, they&amp;#39;d incur a &amp;quot;debt&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But going after someone who has made a pest of themselves, doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least not in Olmec times. Everyone back then knew, &amp;quot;They had it coming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t annoy the scary Jaguar men. Or you&amp;#39;ll be sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, we&amp;#39;d be a better society if we had some of those around to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that&amp;#39;s part of why don Juan didn&amp;#39;t like the allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They need to be fed very expensive food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goldfish are far less trouble. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the allies need human energy in order to be &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; to humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it turns out, there&amp;#39;s twice as many &amp;quot;sights&amp;quot; to see during darkroom as we are aware of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some can&amp;#39;t possibly translate to words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes them very beneficial for holding your silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can move your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve, you get the visits from &amp;quot;magical objects&amp;quot;. Silent Knowledge &amp;quot;offers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Floating, as yet unused, &amp;quot;presentation methods&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan didn&amp;#39;t recommend just randomly perceiving those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get there, those are now &amp;quot;yours&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I guess you could say, it&amp;#39;s like a little envelope with some codeine pills in it, showing up in your mailbox each day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love dentist visits, when you get the &amp;quot;codeine reward&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; dentist will even tell you, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t take more than 2 at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t. Just don&amp;#39;t. I really mean it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a grin on his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very bad idea to try them out, if you had a free daily supply magically showing up in your mailbox, even though they make you very happy for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get lost in those pills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same with random &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don Juan told us all, he recommends we become &amp;quot;Readers of Infinity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read text instead. That way, it says what it says. No need to &amp;quot;interpret&amp;quot; what the little visions of &amp;quot;silent knowledge&amp;quot; actually mean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, in my opinion that&amp;#39;s a dirty trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to get cool visions in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to be asked to insist a purple and jet black &amp;quot;whorl&amp;quot; has to form near the ceiling to the right, it has to spin or flow, the edges need to turn pomegranate color, and THEN you can get silent knowledge as text, is a bit much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like telling someone their surfing is nice, but they shouldn&amp;#39;t get trapped in enjoying the ride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That instead they should be juggling little spinning dishes on the end of a 6 foot pole stretching above them, like a Chinese kungfu acrobat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While surfing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s quite a burden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what happens if you obey don Juan?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You shun all the amazing magic you dearly wanted to command, in order to find something 10 times harder?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You look around!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In perfect silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You finally stop, to see what&amp;#39;s really going on with your perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you notice, &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blobs of non-linear time. Thick around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between the cracks of those many dream scenes you are swimming in now, like the picture of Bruce Lee in the room of broken carnival fun house mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard they only added that scene on a whim, and yet it&amp;#39;s become iconic of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos once told a story so absurd, it&amp;#39;s hard to believe he didn&amp;#39;t make it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He, Howard Lee, and Bruce Lee, had a movie camera and started their own little movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With him as the bartender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to believe until you realize, Howard and Carlos were &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;, and Howard was an old school kung fu guy in LA, where Bruce lived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carlos was &amp;quot;magic celebrity&amp;quot; supreme. With Bruce spouting cheap asian &amp;quot;wisdom&amp;quot; in his movies, obviously interested in seeming to be superior in his thinking to others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had even better &amp;quot;esoteric goodies&amp;quot;, than Asia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course Bruce would hang out with him if he could!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that, Bruce was a big time bad player for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Once upon a time in Hollywood&amp;quot; even makes fun of him for it.  He gets a &amp;quot;revenge ass kicking&amp;quot;, as does the Manson cult woman.  Hollywood &amp;quot;changes the story&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can you do with &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot; once you realize it starts to become visible during darkroom, when the assemblage point reaches the end of the J curve path?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, just at least remember that &amp;quot;Carlos warned us&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his final publications, likely Silent Knowledge or Readers of Infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope it&amp;#39;s described in Readers of Infinity, because that would verify my theory that don Juan was tricking us with that text suggestion. To read text, and ignore super cool &amp;quot;to die for&amp;quot; magic in your face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t go out partying with your drunken friends all night!  Go to the library and read books instead...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, don Juan wanted you to look around the library building. But he didn&amp;#39;t want you to realize that. It had to be &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; that you noticed whatever he wanted you to find, as if you had &amp;quot;discovered it all by yourself&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember one other important thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you make strong sorcery progress, heed the words of Carlos and pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll get 3 random attacks, to try to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The forces around you will rise up to try to bother you, insult you, or in any way they can activate the &amp;quot;poor baby me&amp;quot; mode in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a little brother smacking the arm of a slightly older sister, who is playing with a cool new toy in the car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make sure if she has more fun than him, she has to suffer for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason that can happen, is currently beyond our understanding. Carlos blamed &amp;quot;the fliers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who can &amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; random people to attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then the fact is, we filter out at least 50% of what we perceive, because it&amp;#39;s non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only counted 2 attacks yesterday. One techno deleted before I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the other a guy who&amp;#39;s been lurking around more than a year, who finally decided to commit suicide and piss on the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For no apparent reason I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must still be one I didn&amp;#39;t notice out there if they come in 3s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So keep an eye out for that kind of attack, if you work hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you still have family around you, could be one of them suddenly gets a &amp;quot;bug up their a...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something out there just doesn&amp;#39;t want you perceiving advanced sorcery sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which, always keep in mind, are just &amp;quot;nano feelings&amp;quot; reflecting back at you through your senses, from the emanations onto which your awareness is currently flowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of which don&amp;#39;t combine well enough to form &amp;quot;linear time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But can still be experienced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "zcywuw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zcywuw/the_abstract_layer_of_reality/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/zcywuw/the_abstract_layer_of_reality/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1670220830.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iz0lxcz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1670257469.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_zcywuw", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Carol Tiggs can turn into a fly.\n\nI propose, we learn to turn into moths.

Way back in the olden Chinese days (a short 2000 or less years ago), they had junk Chinese science.\n\nThey still have that!  Lazy westerners go to \"Chinese Medicine School\", because it's cheaper and faster than actually getting a medical degree.\n\nAnd they want the degree, not the knowledge.\n\nThe insurance companies go along with it, because a western bad player type with a degree in \"Chinese Medicine\" is a lot cheaper than a real doctor.\n\nAnd it has a very high \"placebo effect\" benefit.  It seems to work!\n\nBut it's crackpot science.\n\nSo if you go back to the start of Acupuncture, they seemed to believe they were \"venting\" the air from your veins, to reduce pressures.\n\nIt was air (chi).  Thus the needles to let out some pressure.\n\nNaturally that's ludicrous, but that didn't stop the Chinese quacks.\n\nAs it became obvious that was nonsense, they just turned into into some mysterious energy.  And made up stories about how it was discovered.\n\nPeople wounded by a spear would recover from childhood illnesses.\n\nOr a mysterious Daoist could \"see the acupuncture points\".\n\nThey had all kinds of tales, to keep their junk medical practice going.\n\nSure, you can't prove the \"mysterious Chi\" is there.\n\nBut you can FEEL it.\n\nAnd from that, \"Chi Gung\" was born.\n\nIt was taken up by old people to do in the morning, because when you are very old you wake up early and have the whole town to yourself. The young people have jobs, so they sleep in as late as possible, then get ready to go to work.\n\nBut the old chinese people  have nothing to do, so they go to the corner parks all over Beijing, and do \"Chi Gung\".  And Tai Chi too.\n\nThere are a lot of videos on youtube showing this, if you can manage to google in Mandarin.  You can also see how silly Daoism really is, in its native land.\n\nChi Gung is basically a joke among the Chinese.  A morning \"talk show\" topic, for when they have nothing else.\n\nCholita once posed as a \"Sex Tarot Card\" reader on a very popular spanish language talk show.  I wish I could get a copy!\n\nI asked her, \"Do you know anything about Sex Tarot?\"\n\nShe laughed and said, \"I didn't need to.  They did all the talking. I was just there for the men to look at.\"\n\nReally, in China they do the \"Chi Gung Exercises\", which at 80 years old is enough of a \"workout\", then they sit on picnic tables in the park, talk about grandchildren, and granny sees if she can get that old chi gung guy to take her somewhere for \"more intimate practice\".\n\nI've spent quite a bit of time in Chinese countries.  I have an office in Taipei.\n\nThose old Chinese Grannies have even tried to seduce me!\n\nAnd at my current age, I can see why the old men go for it on occasion.\n\nAny Chinese knows that about Chi gung.\n\nEven the Swedish know it!\n\nIkea has a problem with old chinese people hanging out where they sell meatballs in their stores in Chinese countries, trying to hook up all day.\n\nBut westerners are naive about the nonsense of Asian Mysticism.\n\nInstead of understanding it the way the Chinese do, as customs and rituals intended to be fun, perhaps a lot like our Halloween and Easter Bunny, westerners fall for it hook, line, and sinker.\n\nThey chomp down the Asian crapmagic, hoping to get their own \"Franchise\" and wear the Shaolin monk robes and shiny wooden beads themselves.\n\nSo they can suck up attention.\n\nBut with no actual magic, they have to pretend the results. So they return to the bad science idea of \"chi energy\", and say they can *feel* it.\n\nAn easy way to declare victory, and move one notch closer to your own franchise.\n\nNow don't get me wrong. Chi Gung and KungFu, can be \"fixed\".\n\nThat's my sincere hope. I spent 10 years trying to interest any actual Chinese.\n\nAnd learned it just can't be fixed without a bunch of crying baby chinese \"Masters\" having tantrums.\n\nI wish some MMA guy could just go punch them in the nose, the way they did with the Wing Chun master of all of China.\n\nHe was a \"national treasure\". Peerless!  Undefeatable!!!\n\nBut he was getting senile and believed his own make believe, and fell for how his students let him toss them around because they all had franchise hopes of their own.\n\nSo he challenged a middle of the road MMA fighter.\n\nWho kicked his \"master\" butt in seconds.\n\nChina punished the MMA fighter severely, so he got revenge by going around beating up other Chinese \"masters\".\n\nYou can find that on Youtube.  If you believe in Chinese mysticism, you might want to see it with your own eyes.\n\nIt's all crap.\n\nBut it COULD be fixed.  I hope some of you do someday.\n\nThis picture shows you what \"Olmec Chi Gung\" looks like.\n\nIt's the real thing.\n\nReal magic.\n\nThey didn't have money yet.  They didn't have agriculture. It was 10,000 years ago!\n\nIf you needed food, you went outside into the jungle and got some.\n\nThere was no possible motivation to make up stuff.  What they created for their sorcery was the real thing. It was based on what works, and not on what can fool lazy people on ego trips into paying for instruction.\n\nAnyone who can't tell the difference will fail in this subreddit.\n\nNot because of anything you might think. It's not because we are \"prejudiced\", or \"Only believe in what we do\".\n\nNot at all!  Myself, I'd LOVE to see some actual magic elsewhere.\n\nThen I could try to figure out where it came from.  Long ago.\n\nAccording to my spirit \"Mystery\", there were originally perhaps 8 \"strains\" of real magic, back before humans learned speech. When the entire earth population numbered well under 1 million.\n\nWe have one strain from back then. \n\nBut the rest seem to be lost.  The North African variety became the crap magic of the middle east, and asia.  Diluted by religion and greed.\n\nIf we could find the \"other strains\", it would be a great thing!\n\nI'll name them.  Olmec (Proto-siberian), North African,  and Islander.  \n\nWhat else, we haven't figured out  yet.\n\nIn fact, we aren't \"jealous\" of other magical systems.\n\nI say you will fail if you believe those, because I've seen it over and over again over the last 25 years.  So many \"students\", and not one single success.\n\nIt's because because what we do is SO MUCH WORK, that there are even \"Buddhist masters\" on youtube saying it's impossible.\n\nSaying, \"no one can do that\".\n\nNo one can remove their internal dialogue.\n\nAnd a few westernized \"Zen Masters\" saying it's possible, but since they have no impressive magic, one wonders if they even did it themselves.\n\nThe same was told to me by Chakrapani, the famous Los Angeles Ayurvedic fortune teller. He told me back in the early 80s.\n\nHe was so beloved, he even has his own dot com now. Though he's long dead, and left us before the internet even rose.\n\nI asked him why all the meditation and chanting in Hinduism?\n\nWhy not just shut off your internal dialogue, and skip to the good stuff?\n\nHe agreed, that would do it.  Then he looked me in the eyes and said very sincerely, as if he were worried I was going astray with my Castaneda delusions, \"Because no man can do that!\"\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nIt's just VERY difficult.\n\nAnd so if you have franchise aspirations for Chinese crap magic, I'm afraid you will fail in this subreddit.\n\nOnce you figure out it actually takes work to learn real magic, you have to decide if you really wanted REAL magic.\n\nOr if the pretend kind gets you want you wanted.\n\nA franchise.\n\nAnd anyone who believes in fake magic, will go get the fake magic franchise when they realize how hard internal silence is.\n\nIt's so much easier to just pretend.\n\nWe have no franchises to offer in here.  Just magic.\n\nThis picture shows a higher step in learning magic. The benefits of getting rid of rationality, once you can move your assemblage point all the way to the deep orange zone on the J curve.\n\nIt's not obvious at first, because you get to see plenty of \"the real thing\".  Those are the pictures on the left.\n\nBut once you can manifest zombie assistants, you could try out the \"irrational\" version of this pass.\n\nIt's far more stunning.\n\nIt also allows a smooth transition from dreaming awake, to dreaming asleep.\n\nBut while awake.\n\nWhich removes the laws of physics entirely, from your darkroom practice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Pandora's Box Pass In The Two Copies of Ourselves", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6rxhiwe7aig91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32d07621c2f7455da2eb28c148209778dc37e39d"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e07130ffba780f8421649695b64f7dcf0d8eae66"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7891f5ee3ec887f7705608b8eabe698b03272258"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f1cdceba37cc839ea64850015172848deb0e7e7"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91782436541231632e18a5a5b163880b58225fc5"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0169252f2c9703827e1949fa71a3ffdc68b7902e"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0c9c22738ba2238c69003a0fdf4724d4ac34e36"}, "id": "6rxhiwe7aig91"}}, "name": "t3_wjbcas", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vz632LBgkjj4t5HEWoKP3_ME5N8sXsQlZssYwkWNJ3k.jpg", "edited": 1659990007.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659971592.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b0c9c22738ba2238c69003a0fdf4724d4ac34e36\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/6rxhiwe7aig91.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b0c9c22738ba2238c69003a0fdf4724d4ac34e36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, Tensegrity is not &amp;quot;weird chi gung&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, chi doesn&amp;#39;t exist.

Don't overlook anything or later you'll feel like such an idiot when you figure it out yourself.\n\nOne might define the \"types\" of flier attack drones that come to this subreddit.

There's no religion, no group, no meetings, no cult, no interviews, books, or anything to buy.\n\nNo one profits from this place.\n\nThat's UNIQUE.  No other subreddit is like that.\n\nNo other \"system\".\n\nHowever, is that really a good argument?\n\nIt's certainly worth pointing out, because the bad players who attack have never actually thought much about who they are attacking.\n\nWe have pictures, tips, and obvious people really learning.   You can read the back and forths, and only a conspiracy theory addict could conclude we created 3 years of unique \"fake\" user content with such a variety of manufactured users.\n\nWho have histories on reddit!\n\nEven the KGB couldn't make a fake so good.\n\nSo even an idiot could see this place is hard to explain away.\n\nBut, the argument that no one here has a motivation to convince anyone else rings hollow.\n\nJesus freaks try to recruit all the time. It's their \"thing\".\n\nThey get rewards in heaven for it!\n\nAlso, since Jesus couldn't save anyone, having fallen for the Jewish figment \"Lucifer\" himself,   we know he wasn't capable of anything like what Christians claim.\n\nI'm not even sure he himself claimed what his modern followers believe.\n\nI make it more that he knew the Jewish Prophets had Kabbalah magic, and wanted to spread it around.  They kept it secret, with \"colleges\" in caves, and sorcerers going to live alone in the desert for 40 years, to practice.\n\nTheir magic does in fact let you see spirits, God, and visit heaven.\n\nIt was largely \"religious magic\", but they have that all over the world.  \n\nThe belief that if you pray, magic will give you what you wanted. The Prophets were even more certain of that, because they could perceive spirits and the spirits told them so.\n\nAs they like to do!  The Jews were fooled by inorganic beings.  Who had no idea what they'd do with their delusions. The wrote \"The book of Job\", and made Lucifer a rock star around campfires.\n\nAnd Asians believe in \"luck\".  It's a lot like prayer, which they do to their ancestors.\n\nAnd I'm sure there's a bunch of such beliefs among religions.\n\nSo, \"Don't blame Jesus\" is essentially what I'm saying. We have NO IDEA what he was \"up to\".\n\nBut he got \"franchised\".\n\nAnd if you ask me, it's not such a bad franchise.  Compared to other religions and what they do.\n\nStill the question remains, why do Jesus people work so hard to promote something that not only is not true, but which they know nothing about?\n\nThey can pretend all day they \"spoke to Jesus\", but then they need to explain how others spoke to Krishna, or the Buddha, or Quetzalcoatl.\n\nAnd they can't without claiming \"that's from the Devil\".\n\nBut equally you might ask, why do Daoists defend Daoism, when they'll never see even a tiny bit of magic.  Daoism has none.\n\nSame for Buddhists. Why do Dzogchen people insist they have magic, when it's obvious even to an idiot, from a quick search of google, that they don't?\n\nBecause one substitute for magic, is to convince others you have it and they can get it, because you'll \"teach them now\".\n\nIt's the same old bad player instinct to \"teach\" instead of putting in the work to actually learn.\n\nIf you manage to convince someone else to share your delusion, it makes you feel better.\n\nIt becomes a substitute for actual magic.\n\nWhich implies, if you look at how defensive and angry people become when their magic is questioned, you can tell if they actually have any in the first place.\n\nBecause if you do, you don't care what others think.\n\nAs Carlos said in an interview posted a few days ago,\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nInterviewer: Do you consider yourself a mediator between indigenous and European cultures?\n\nCarlos: No, because witches are in no way interested in making what they know known.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat's the difference.\n\nWitches HAVE magic.  In this context, Witch is probably a translation from another language and includes male sorcerers.\n\nWe ourselves try to spread magic, only because Carlos did.\n\nBut also because, it would be a huge shame if it were lost forever.\n\nAnd our lineage ended, so it seems at risk of being lost.\n\nBy the way, Cholita can do real magic.  Right in your face.\n\nI saw some just yesterday.\n\nAnd speaking of \"chi\", she can actually move objects with her eyes.\n\nWhat martial arts masters like to pretend they could do, if they felt like practicing that hard.\n\nCholita actually can!\n\nBut she doesn't. And won't talk about it to people.\n\nShe does what Carlos said.  Has no interest in making what she knows, known to others.\n\nDidn't even want this subreddit to exist when I asked her to help us too.\n\nTold the \"corpse flower\" story.  Let it bloom and then go away; it stinks anyway.  No one wants that stinky thing to bloom twice!\n\nShe has NO interest in convincing anyone.\n\nI only get to see her magic when she gets angry and wants to make me look foolish.\n\nWhen she's attacking like La Catalina.\n\nOr when she wants something, and is using magic to lure me into giving it to her.\n\nShe could of course just ask. I offered to build her a two story house in our backyard a month or two ago, all just for her.  Larger than my own.  And promised I'd never set foot in there, and we'd put a locked fence around it, with her having the only key.\n\nBut she didn't want to \"owe\" me.\n\nSo the point here is, people who don't have magic try to recruit others to practice their pretending.\n\nIt's all they have.\n\nPeople who do have magic, don't \"recruit\" except under unusual circumstances.\n\nLike ours.", "edited": 1659996490.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ijhwrak", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to beat a dead horse here, but we had 3 &amp;quot;flier attacks&amp;quot; as a result of this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we practiced &amp;quot;talking them down&amp;quot;.

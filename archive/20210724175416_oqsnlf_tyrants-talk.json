It&amp;#39;s the guru worshipper effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some are groupies. They love to be an underling in a sorcery organization, and spread around tasty rumors the other groupies didn&amp;#39;t know.  It&amp;#39;s sort of like spreading UFO rumors and stories. It&amp;#39;s a whole industry.  But there&amp;#39;s really no point to it, since you can&amp;#39;t actually do anything about UFOs.  The point is, the attention of spreading the stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some are intellectual snobs, with a huge touch of anger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would be Jeremy and his type.

It\u2019s almost as if they were designed, from a biological point of view, to seek out as many new experiences as possible, and not to dwell on any too long. As don Juan said, \u201cWe\u2019re made to hurry\u201d.\n\nLast night I took Cholita, a former Sunday class student who\u2019s now as mad as Josefina,  to Huntington Beach.  I thought I could move her assemblage point back to a better place, using wind, darkness, and the ocean sounds.\n\nWhile walking around, I saw the cutest child you could imagine. She couldn\u2019t have been more than 2 years old, although I\u2019m not good at guessing children\u2019s ages. Someone had dressed her up in a tight-fitting yellow overcoat, with full length arms and pants to keep out the chill, fancy shoes, and a lace wrapped pink hat on top to complete the outfit and keep her safe from the world.\n\nShe was standing on the sidewalk near a car, staring at a place where they sell kites and other colorful toys appropriate for the beach. It was lit up very brightly. Her mouth was trembling, and her body was shaking a little. Her eyes were staring wide at all the colorful things towering above her short stature,  which were occasionally blocked by the busy stream of strangers passing by on the sidewalk.\n\nShe was saying, \u201cooo, oooo, oooo, oo\u201d in the softest tone you could imagine, repeating it endlessly.\n\nAt first I thought she was crying, because her eyes were filled with tears. But I noticed her father was standing right there.\n\nHe didn\u2019t seem concerned. He looked more like he was embarrassed.  If I had to guess, they were stuck there because they found a place to park, but another car was off searching elsewhere and they intended to join up.\n\nA few minutes later her grandmother showed up, walking in from the street.  She had an angry expression as she rushed a little to get to the child. It was clear she was worried about her and that finding a parking spot had taken longer than she wanted.\n\nShe took her hand and pulled the baby out of that situation. The babies gaze was still fixed on the colorful sights. She didn\u2019t seem to be aware she was being pulled. The grandmother picked her up and cuddled her against her chest,  and the little girl stopped making that noise. She slowly turned her head back to look at the toys, but now she wasn\u2019t afraid.\n\nWalking further along I saw a boy and a girl, a little older, running from one object to the other in the offerings placed at child eye level all along that street which leads to the pier. When they discovered something new and exciting, they showed it to each other so they could both share the thrill of that new object. But they quickly got bored, and ran off to find another new thing.\n\nLater while eating dinner, I saw a middle aged couple sitting across from each other at a table, hands dangling closer and closer together on the table,  just shy of contact. They were staring into each others eyes, and having a continuous conversation without breaking eye contact.\n\nI commented to Cholita, are they about to have an affair?   She agreed.\n\nTaisha Abelar once said, when asked, \u201cWhat is stalking?\"\n\n\u201cStalking is the ability to fixate the Assemblage Point on any given position in order to give structure and coherence to chaotic perception. We're stalking our realities every day, every minute, finding out what it means to drive down this street or be in the mall. \u201c\n\nOne thing you\u2019ll notice if you try to practice Zuleica\u2019s technique is that it\u2019s easier in the beginning to find something \u201cnew\u201d, and get a burst of energy from the discovery. You\u2019ll feel it as a tingle, goosebumps, or just that thrill feeling you get, on a good roller coaster.\n\nIt\u2019s one reason human beings are so miserable. They don\u2019t get enough of that feeling. It seems to help regulate our body, and keep it from getting too caught up in our worries. As don Juan said, we need the darkness and the wind.\n\nThat feeling can be too intense at times, especially if you practice waking dreaming by forcing silence in a chair, and staring forward with closed eyes as if you could peer into the darkness and find something. If you do that enough, you will indeed find something.\n\nBut being new to sorcery, it\u2019ll be a genuine untouched position of the assemblage point, one significantly far from your normal position. You\u2019ll get the goosebumps effect, but in an overload. It can actually be both painful and pleasurable, in some impossible to describe way.\n\nApparently, that\u2019s part of how we die. It\u2019s why sorcerers must do the recapitulation. Don Juan said that there\u2019s a crack in our luminous shell around the navel,  that a rolling force constantly bombards it and opens it further, and that at death the whole thing collapses in on itself. All the emanations, used or unused, light up, and the release of massive energy wipes us out.\n\nBut what if it\u2019s all the same thing?\n\nWhat if the baby saying, \u201cooo, oooo, oo\u201d, staring teary eyed at all the new things in front of her, was the same as the 2 children running along, sharing new toys they find with their partner?\n\nWhat if the goosebumps you can get while looking for colors in darkness, and finding some, is the same thing as Taisha Abelar driving down the road, learning what it\u2019s like to be at this new position of the assemblage point?\n\nWhat if Sunday Class members intimately sharing views of their fancy sticks, is also the same thing as the middle aged couple sharing the new experience of being together?\n\nAll caused by releasing new energy, from slight shifts in the assemblage point.\n\nWhat if boredom is really just the absence of released energy,  which we badly need to get by?  Or even more, what if the resulting shift of the assemblage point is almost a survival mechanism, to keep the energy flowing even when we're sitting in darkness doing nothing?\n\nWhat if dreams are caused by the lack of flow of energy, due to being unconscious from sleep?  What if the vast reserves hidden in our second attention need to be tapped once in a while during the night, just so that we can survive while sleeping?\n\nI don\u2019t have an answer, but I suspect it might be good to think about boredom in that way, when you practice.\n\nEdited: twice", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What is Boredom?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_crt12l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1566165347.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1566081266.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my recommended techniques for learning to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;,  is to bore yourself to death by forcing silence in a chair with eyes closed, or staring at colors in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos liked this technique also, and devised ways to handle the falling asleep.

You can make up your own movements once you get a handle on what to look for.\n\nI went to the beach with Cholita, and tried to teach her to feel the lines of the world.

That\u2019s one of the things that happens when you do movements such as Kungfu which redeploy energy.  They shift the assemblage point.

She can literally project it forward.  I don\u2019t mean, it\u2019s some kind of psychological thing. I mean, it\u2019s a stream you can both feel and hear, and it\u2019s so strong you\u2019d have to turn away the first time you encountered it.  \n\nOrdinary people would just interpret it as absolute rage.   But it isn\u2019t.\n\n I suspect it's used for dreaming.  She's almost certainly a westerly dreamer type, since she's also completely mad half the time.\n\nWhat has that got to do with who you'd be without the internal dialogue?\n\nI actually knew how to go looking for her energy.  I knew because I became so silent that the entire room was just dreaming images.  Anything I wanted to go looking for, was likely to manifest there.\n\nThat level of silence can only be called, \"heaven\", if you haven't used up the energy of being at that specific position of the assemblage point. \n\nYou can't keep it up of course. The sensation of heaven is from a controlled release of energy from emanations you haven\u2019t used recently.  It\u2019s why tensegrity can make you feel very good, if you get a calm chance to try a lot of it, and you aren\u2019t struggling to remember.  It redeploys energy.\n\nBut you can also do that with silence.  And that's what you'll become without the internal dialogue.  An explorer of heavenly realms.\n\nOk, that didn't come out right.   I\u2019ve been around the Chinese too long.   I suspect that\u2019s a Bruce Lee quote.\n\nLet's say there are some dark realms in there too, to keep things balanced.\n\nFrom that level of silence, I knew I could reach out and scoop up only dark energy, leaving the glowing blobs of color in the air.  Maybe the glowing colors are your own energy (thus tensegrity grabs them and smears them on the body), and the dark energy is not.  Not of you.\n\nBut it\u2019s there all the time. The dark energy is like fine filaments of both absolute jet black, and golden or white light.  Mixed in are details. Dots of color.\n\nLook under the bed, and find the fluffiest dust bunny you can, and don\u2019t crush it.   Hopefully it\u2019s got a lot of human hair in it, so that it is airy and light.\n\nThat\u2019s sort of what dark energy looks like, except some of the lines are black, and some glow.\n\nI had a patch stuck to my hand last night.  I pointed it at the wall, to see if I could still summon Carlos\u2019 allies with it.\n\nNope. That didn\u2019t work.  \n\nThings don\u2019t always work on a reliable basis, and you just have to figure out what does.  I guess that\u2019s where \u201cpower\u201d comes in.  \n\nBut some things always work, and I suspect you can always scoop up dark energy, if you get fully silent. And you can look into it, to get a wonderful creepy feeling.\n\nI was looking through it last night trying to find Cholita\u2019s energy.  I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but her energy is very yellow, with squares in it.  Not lines, but jagged little squares, linked together like an electric current of pulses.\n\nI didn\u2019t find it, but the dark energy was amazingly fun to look into.\n\n&gt;Why it's thought that makes us human! Without it I must be something less than human! Who wants that!\n\nTo quote Cholita, \u201cI love my humanity!!!  Why would I want to give it up?\u201d\n\nBecause, she\u2019s completely mad. That\u2019s why.  \n\nAnd so is anyone who\u2019s the prisoner of their internal dialogue.\n\n&gt;It's completely unknown territory, experientially.\n\nActually it\u2019s kind of common.

And yogis,  Buddhists, and daoists all know silence is the key.\n\n&gt;There's now no way out but through.\n\nJust pick a technique and do it over and over.  If it\u2019s hard to find the time because of the family, just tell them you\u2019re meditating to reduce stress.\n\nI have one person who writes to me, who\u2019s just learned dreaming awake.  If he gets a chance to remain still, such as on an airplane, he can go into dreaming, without losing consciousness.\n\nIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s in the dream. He\u2019s watching the dreaming scenes while he rests.  Like an internal TV set.\n\nHe got that way with the chair technique.  Sitting in silence until you fall asleep, jar your neck, wake back up, and remember if you had a mini-dream.\n\nJust keep that up and you\u2019ll discover dreaming awake.\n\nOf course dreaming awake is much more fun if your eyes are open and you\u2019re waking around, but he hasn\u2019t achieved that level of silence yet.", "edited": 1566579409.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_exu4exp", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;is that many are terrified of who they would be without their brain (flier&amp;#39;s mind &amp;quot;program&amp;quot;) telling them who they are...and who they aren&amp;#39;t 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I went looking for a specific frequency of &amp;quot;dark energy&amp;quot;, which Cholita has learned to concentrate.

You make progress while awake, and out in the world.  You don\u2019t have to integrate what you learned in darkness, with the daytime.

But the stories and explanations of how to concentrate any practice surely could be integrated into the first attention, possibly limiting what people can achieve by suggesting a path they must follow, rather than letting them find one of their own.\n\nI\u2019d suggest that Carlos was worried about the same thing.

But either way, yoga people don\u2019t automatically learn to become sorcerers, despite many having the daily feeling of a little bit of heightened awareness, and all of them having energy redeployed each time they practice.\n\nOn the other hand, if you keep practicing silence in darkness daily, you eventually find the feeling of \u201cinner silence\u201d.  And then you can use that to be silent all day long, at which point I have to think you\u2019d move into that deeper form of heightened awareness and be able to *see* things like that.\n\nProducing silence in darkness can eventually spill over into your waking hours, just because you eventually learn the feeling needed to do it quickly.\n\nThat feeling in me is almost like mild depression mixed with creepiness (dark energy). Not actual sad depression, but more like giving up on everything that\u2019s \u201cimportant\u201d while you\u2019re silent.  You stop worrying about anything at all.

It'll be easy.\n\nHowever, the dazzling things you'll see add thoughts, so you kind of hover in near silence. Good enough to have weird stuff manifest, but not so good you stop the world.\n\nI was in that state last night.  I was walking around, finding it hard to believe all the super bright colors.  My bedroom wall to my right had turned into that cliff I keep seeing.  I pushed and pulled on a few floating heads sticking out of the wall.\n\nI scanned the room, and found that \"the wall\" was better formed than I'd seen it in weeks.  I went to sit on the pillows again. There was a perfect wall in front of me, covered in the kind of details a wall should have.  I had to look around the room to make sure no light was leaking in, because it was so real looking.\n\nThat's the value of absolute darkness. When you see something, you don't have to doubt what it is.  There's absolutely no light. So if you see a glow below you, and your legs seem to be stubby things glowing white, that's ALL from the second attention.\n\nOn the other hand, you can do the same in near darkness. I tried it on Saturday.  Everything works just the same, and you can even manifest inorganic beings with light still in the room.  They look even more real.\n\nBut my room has absolutely no light as long as the sun is down, and the wall I saw in front of me was fairly well lit up.   I pondered how Carlos had come up with the idea to call it, \"the wall\", and realized anyone would have to see it, if they practiced this technique. There's no way they wouldn't!\n\nSo I tried to summon \"reading off the wall\".\n\nMy little fairy was making faces on one of the puffs of color.  She changed from one to the other, and some of them were dazzlingly beautiful. In a few, she leaned on her side with her face turned to me, her red lips open, and her eyes closed. It was an obvious invitation to kiss.\n\nI guess since Techno Intent found that passage saying they're female, it's left that impression in my mind.  I don't feel bad anymore about possibly lifting up her skirt to see for sure.\n\nAt one point, she changed into President Nixon's head.  Full sized too. He was scowling.\n\nI told her, \"Hey, no Nixon impersonations!\"\n\nAt that point I realized, if I really wanted to read off the wall, I needed to be fully silent.  I couldn't be talking to Fairies all the time.\n\nI was so silent I could hear insects outside, and I even heard a few sounds that could only have come from the second attention.\n\nBut I could be more silent. I decided to count how many seconds it took for something odd to happen.\n\nIt was 30 seconds.  When Carlos talks about silence being needed for 1 to 3 minutes, but then someone else says it's up to 2 hours, they're absolutely right.  Those are 2 different things.\n\nBut for getting something exciting to happen in darkness, once you've achieved the 2 hour mark already,  it turns out my time is 30 seconds.  Or to put it another way, when in heightened awareness, you can further silence yourself and get astounding results.  That's probably why don Juan's group did their primary teaching in heightened awareness.\n\nI saw scenes of other worlds, burn into the wall. One after the other. Each scene was lit up as brightly as the TV would be, when seen in that pitch-black dark room.\n\nBut they weren't scenes that had a square shape. They sort of ended on details of the scene.  There was a woman talking to a man who was seated.  The boundary of the image was her back, as she leaned over, and a diagonal of at table, on which the man had rested his elbow.  It was like a Photoshop cutout with irregular edges.\n\nI watched a dozen or more scenes, each time ending it by commenting on it (thinking a little), and then starting over to count how many seconds of silence it took.\n\n30 seconds.  That's my time.\n\nAfter I\u2019d watched that dozen scenes, I heard the sound of my cellphone. But it was so faint, it would have to have been outside.  It also had the quality of audio from the second attention. It\u2019s crisp, noiseless, perfect.\n\nIt was only the signal for a notification of an email arriving.  It wasn\u2019t the ring of a message.\n\nI got up to see if I\u2019d left my cellphone at work.  I had!  \n\nI drove to work to find it. I wanted to know if there was any reason it would have rung at that moment. \n\n My cellphone showed that indeed there was a notification around that time. But there were also 2 messages from Cholita who had spent 5 hours that day,  traveling on busses just to get a free haircut. \n\nShe insists on keeping her hair the way Carlos instructed her to wear it, and it had gotten quite long as a result of her madness.\n\nI remember her words from the night before:  \n\nThe Nagual is Dead!  Leave him alone. It's over. \n\nAnd yet, she still keeps her hair that way.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1566166664.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_exckbc3", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually you&amp;#39;ll reach the point that you can practice in darkness, and not worry about being silent.

It was an obvious invitation to kiss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess since Techno Intent found that passage saying they&amp;#39;re female, it&amp;#39;s left that impression in my mind.  I don&amp;#39;t feel bad anymore about possibly lifting up her skirt to see for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point, she changed into President Nixon&amp;#39;s head.  Full sized too. He was scowling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her, &amp;quot;Hey, no Nixon impersonations!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point I realized, if I really wanted to read off the wall, I needed to be fully silent.  I couldn&amp;#39;t be talking to Fairies all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so silent I could hear insects outside, and I even heard a few sounds that could only have come from the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I could be more silent. I decided to count how many seconds it took for something odd to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was 30 seconds.  When Carlos talks about silence being needed for 1 to 3 minutes, but then someone else says it&amp;#39;s up to 2 hours, they&amp;#39;re absolutely right.  Those are 2 different things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for getting something exciting to happen in darkness, once you&amp;#39;ve achieved the 2 hour mark already,  it turns out my time is 30 seconds.  Or to put it another way, when in heightened awareness, you can further silence yourself and get astounding results.  That&amp;#39;s probably why don Juan&amp;#39;s group did their primary teaching in heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw scenes of other worlds, burn into the wall. One after the other. Each scene was lit up as brightly as the TV would be, when seen in that pitch-black dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they weren&amp;#39;t scenes that had a square shape. They sort of ended on details of the scene.  There was a woman talking to a man who was seated.  The boundary of the image was her back, as she leaned over, and a diagonal of at table, on which the man had rested his elbow.  It was like a Photoshop cutout with irregular edges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched a dozen or more scenes, each time ending it by commenting on it (thinking a little), and then starting over to count how many seconds of silence it took.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30 seconds.  That&amp;#39;s my time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I\u2019d watched that dozen scenes, I heard the sound of my cellphone. But it was so faint, it would have to have been outside.  It also had the quality of audio from the second attention. It\u2019s crisp, noiseless, perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was only the signal for a notification of an email arriving.  It wasn\u2019t the ring of a message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up to see if I\u2019d left my cellphone at work.  I had!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drove to work to find it. I wanted to know if there was any reason it would have rung at that moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My cellphone showed that indeed there was a notification around that time. But there were also 2 messages from Cholita who had spent 5 hours that day,  traveling on busses just to get a free haircut. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She insists on keeping her hair the way Carlos instructed her to wear it, and it had gotten quite long as a result of her madness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember her words from the night before:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Nagual is Dead!  Leave him alone. It&amp;#39;s over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, she still keeps her hair that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null,

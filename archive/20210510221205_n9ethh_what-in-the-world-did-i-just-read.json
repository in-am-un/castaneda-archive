But oddly, people find the time for basketball, playing an instrument in a band, and a bunch of other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect the amount of time needed to learn sorcery only seems excessive, because of bad men who sell magic techniques, like meditation.  They&amp;#39;d go out of business if they didn&amp;#39;t make it easy, so they&amp;#39;ve convinced everyone 30 minutes a day is enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never enough.

I know a LOT more about that technique then I let on in here. If someone got good at it, I could get them very far.  But in the end, those always quit.  Because you aren&amp;#39;t doing anything people who practice meditation don&amp;#39;t do, once every few years. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you do it all night. It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;convincing&amp;quot;, unless no one else can do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Convincing&amp;quot; fights off the book deal mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 ) I don&amp;#39;t understand this.

We're trying to escape the prison we were born into.\n\nBut this subreddit is unique in that respect.\n\nYou will find NO OTHER place where you can see that people are in fact learning, and sharing results.  Before your very eyes.\n\nAll you'll find out there is some guru who manages to trick people, and his brainwashed followers who get angry if anything threatens their mistaken beliefs.\n\nThis is the real thing here.  You should look around on the net, and see that it's so.\n\nThere aren't a bunch of places for you to go, if you want the real thing.\n\nOnly here.\n\nIf you find otherwise, post the link for us!\n\nWhen I first realized the books were 100% true, I went looking for years.\n\nCarlos did too. And don Juan before him.\n\nNot only did I find nothing, but I got my butt kicked for offering to point some to this form of magic, so they could graduate from being con artists and actually help their students.\n\nNo one wants real magic. They want to be the leader, the guy who sold 8 million books, the guy who gets all the stray women who just want a \"spiritual man\".\n\nIf you try darkroom gazing yourself, you'll soon realize why what I just said is true.\n\nIt's really difficult!  It's like reading advanced Calculus texts, and being forced to understand every word of them, if you want to keep your job.\n\nIt hurts!\n\nThere are lots of meditation techniques which produce weak results, and that's because they've been crippled, to maximize profit.\n\nBut they essentially do exactly the same thing we're doing here.\n\nThey interrupt, rather than stop, the internal dialogue.\n\nThose will never get very far.  You have to put a complete end to it, not just interrupt it.\n\nYou'll also understand that, if you try darkroom gazing.\n\nPartially off:  Magic in the air is possible, and you'll visibly see it.\n\nFully off: The world simply stops. It only exists from that internal dialogue.\n\nAlso, keep this in mind.  You cannot **learn** sorcery.  No amount of understanding makes any difference at all.\n\nYou have to see it with your own eyes.\n\nSo collecting \"inventory\" will not do the job.\n\nUnfortunately, most who end up in this subreddit will never move on from being inventory collectors.\n\nThe most annoying might be the Zen g uys who show up here. Zen teaches them to be reasonable when discussing meditation.

You should look around on the net, and see that it&amp;#39;s so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t a bunch of places for you to go, if you want the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find otherwise, post the link for us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first realized the books were 100% true, I went looking for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos did too. And don Juan before him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only did I find nothing, but I got my butt kicked for offering to point some to this form of magic, so they could graduate from being con artists and actually help their students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one wants real magic.

It&amp;#39;s like reading advanced Calculus texts, and being forced to understand every word of them, if you want to keep your job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It hurts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are lots of meditation techniques which produce weak results, and that&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;ve been crippled, to maximize profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they essentially do exactly the same thing we&amp;#39;re doing here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They interrupt, rather than stop, the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those will never get very far.  You have to put a complete end to it, not just interrupt it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll also understand that, if you try darkroom gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Partially off:  Magic in the air is possible, and you&amp;#39;ll visibly see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fully off: The world simply stops. It only exists from that internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, keep this in mind.  You cannot &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; sorcery.

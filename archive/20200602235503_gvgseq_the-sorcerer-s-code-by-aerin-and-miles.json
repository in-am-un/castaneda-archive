And perhaps, the fun stuff (sorry cleargreen) is just for individuals to teach each other?\n\nOtherwise you could get a bad person dominating what seems to be more flashy or more important than the movements.\n\nBetter might be to emulate the arrangement of don Juan's party.\n\nEmilio and Eligio were in charge of teaching how to assemble and utilize other worlds.\n\nZuleica and Silvio were in charge of dreaming, which means the direct manipulation of *intent*.\n\nAnd they had advanced stalking instructors. \n\nI'm sorry to say, I played hooky for that course so I can't recall who was all about stalking.  Clara? Certainly Florinda Matus.\n\nWait... If Florinda was teaching Carlos stalking, doesn't that mean Carol would do the same for Reni?\n\nPersonal power courses are about stalking?\n\nYuck.  \n\nI'd ask Cholita what she thinks, but she might easily grab her crotch and say, \"This is where personal power lies!\"\n\n(When she's in a good mood.)\n\nI don't know what will happen with the whole teaching structure, but maybe we should try to imitate that specialist arrangement, as if the entire series of books were maps?\n\nI'll take inorganic beings as a specialty! \n\nI love those guys!  All you who are afraid of them can send me yours. I'll take them!\n\nI can't be sure, but Cholita seems to have brought home a new one.  \n\nAt one point in the night, yesterday, I heard her shouting from outside my bedroom window.\n\nTrust me, that's weird. \n\nShe could just as well have shouted outside my bedroom door.\n\nShe wanted me to come outside.   So I did.\n\nThen she told me to keep the front door unlocked.  I watched as she walked away, down into the neighborhood.\n\nIt's some kind of witchcraft thing, because only the front door is locked. \n\nThe rest of the entries, all easily accessible, are unlocked.  \n\nAnd usually, she uses the back door, not the front.\n\nPlus, she locked it when she went out.  Could have left it unlocked herself.\n\nAnd she has no less than 5 sets of keys!  I keep making them for her when she misplaces a set.\n\nI have to make sure each set of keys is unique, with some kind of decoration or chain. \n\nOtherwise, when I give her a new set, she claims it's the old set, and I must have stolen it.\n\nBut all I have to do is say, \"Blue???\"  \n\nYou had a set that was blue?\n\nThat satisfies her.\n\nWhat's the purpose of her luring me outside to watch her walk away, with the door unlocked?\n\nI have no idea, but that night I was visited by a weird new inorganic being.\n\nNot a hypnogogic image. \n\nYou guys will probably discover, you can see those all day long.\n\nA being created by your own intent.\n\nProblem is, they behave a certain way. \n\nAnd soon, if you play with them, they don't.\n\nThey have their own unique behaviors.\n\nThis one responded to voice commands.\n\nI told it to take physical form, and it tried hard.  Didn't quite make it, as Fairy has in the past.\n\nBut the fact that it responded to a verbal command was fascinating.\n\nFairy took on full size on her own volition, I never had anything to do with it.  I only convinced her to shrink, so she wasn't so scary.\n\nSo \"Talk to your plants\" is good advice for inorganic beings too.  Perhaps they do in fact need permission.\n\n&gt;And If they share videos like this publicly \n\nWe should encourage whatever they would like to have, to get them to continue.\n\nPeople, if you can, subscribe!\n\nI'm banned from that sort of thing.\n\nBut I can say with absolute authority, there are at least 300 passes in their memories which are not currently known.\n\nMaybe even closer to 500.\n\nI was there.  \n\nAt first, they were mostly individual movements, perhaps so Carlos could watch them and tinker.\n\nI hope to post, \"The only pass you'll ever need\" soon.\n\nIt was the first Carlos taught me, and he did indeed admit, you only needed that one.\n\nReluctantly...\n\nI never saw it at a workshop, and as far as I know I only missed one of those.  Plus, I was there while they were rehearsing that workshop's moves.\n\nEdited", "edited": 1591200525.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fsr8gse", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You mean remind them to do more magic instead of business?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, I guess that would be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could  very well be, Carlos knew exactly what would transpire, in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the witches and Carol are letting things stand, to preserve the intent of Carlos, to see where it would lead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the various factions, obviously created on purpose, would do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So cleargreen gathers as many as possible.

And perhaps, the fun stuff (sorry cleargreen) is just for individuals to teach each other?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you could get a bad person dominating what seems to be more flashy or more important than the movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Better might be to emulate the arrangement of don Juan&amp;#39;s party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emilio and Eligio were in charge of teaching how to assemble and utilize other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica and Silvio were in charge of dreaming, which means the direct manipulation of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they had advanced stalking instructors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry to say, I played hooky for that course so I can&amp;#39;t recall who was all about stalking.  Clara? Certainly Florinda Matus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait... If Florinda was teaching Carlos stalking, doesn&amp;#39;t that mean Carol would do the same for Reni?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal power courses are about stalking?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yuck.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d ask Cholita what she thinks, but she might easily grab her crotch and say, &amp;quot;This is where personal power lies!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(When she&amp;#39;s in a good mood.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what will happen with the whole teaching structure, but maybe we should try to imitate that specialist arrangement, as if the entire series of books were maps?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll take inorganic beings as a specialty! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love those guys!  All you who are afraid of them can send me yours. I&amp;#39;ll take them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be sure, but Cholita seems to have brought home a new one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point in the night, yesterday, I heard her shouting from outside my bedroom window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me, that&amp;#39;s weird. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She could just as well have shouted outside my bedroom door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wanted me to come outside.   So I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she told me to keep the front door unlocked.  I watched as she walked away, down into the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s some kind of witchcraft thing, because only the front door is locked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the entries, all easily accessible, are unlocked.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And usually, she uses the back door, not the front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, she locked it when she went out.  Could have left it unlocked herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she has no less than 5 sets of keys!  I keep making them for her when she misplaces a set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to make sure each set of keys is unique, with some kind of decoration or chain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, when I give her a new set, she claims it&amp;#39;s the old set, and I must have stolen it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all I have to do is say, &amp;quot;Blue???&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You had a set that was blue?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That satisfies her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the purpose of her luring me outside to watch her walk away, with the door unlocked?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea, but that night I was visited by a weird new inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a hypnogogic image. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys will probably discover, you can see those all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A being created by your own intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem is, they behave a certain way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And soon, if you play with them, they don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have their own unique behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one responded to voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told it to take physical form, and it tried hard.  Didn&amp;#39;t quite make it, as Fairy has in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the fact that it responded to a verbal command was fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy took on full size on her own volition, I never had anything to do with it.  I only convinced her to shrink, so she wasn&amp;#39;t so scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;Talk to your plants&amp;quot; is good advice for inorganic beings too.  Perhaps they do in fact need permission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And If they share videos like this publicly &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should encourage whatever they would like to have, to get them to continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People, if you can, subscribe!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m banned from that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can say with absolute authority, there are at least 300 passes in their memories which are not currently known.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even closer to 500.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, they were mostly individual movements, perhaps so Carlos could watch them and tinker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope to post, &amp;quot;The only pass you&amp;#39;ll ever need&amp;quot; soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the first Carlos taught me, and he did indeed admit, you only needed that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reluctantly...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never saw it at a workshop, and as far as I know I only missed one of those.

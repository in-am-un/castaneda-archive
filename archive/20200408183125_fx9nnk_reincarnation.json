Part of the issue for me is trying to parse how much is direct from Castaneda, how much comes inherited from the already existing Faction H camps, and how much comes from sources who mined the same territory as Castaneda like Jung and Campbell (Jung was a mighty sorcerer, who executed the folly of going through the world as a psychoanalyst, from a Toltec POV so to speak).\n\n&gt;In some ways, his private classes were like a playground for elementary school kids, and he was the Playground Supervisor.\n\nSounds about right.\n\nI never saw the point of those sorts of environment to learn the material being presented, but rather the important lessons were the ones *surrounding* the material (second attention stuff would fall into this category).  \n\n&gt;Yes he did. He was battling at least 2 Buddhists in classes, who were being held back by their beliefs.\n\nYep, that sounds like Buddhists, especially male Buddhists.  Buddha is fine, Buddhists, OTOH, ...\n\nYou would think that with as much focus as they give to ego destruction they would notice that they are walking around elaborate temples adorned with priceless art and gold like peacocks dressed in bright yellow and red.  Yeah, I recognize the absurdity of it is to allow for breakthroughs, but so few make those breakthroughs that the ROI (Return On Investment) of those temples vis a vis enlightenment simply CANNOT be very high.\n\nAny beliefs that are hearsay rather than firmly rooted in personal experience are going to hold a person back.\n\n&gt;His favorite way to disprove Buddhism was to say:\n\n&gt;\u201cSo you come back again and again, until you're *perfect*?\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cPerfect for what???\u201d\n\nBuddhism is a religion, which has specific social needs which are not a part of the Warrior path (in fact, it's anathema to the Warrior path).

I have so far unlocked each previous life going back 900 years, and I'm working on trying to integrate everything through something which resembles Recapitulation (which is a real challenge, let me say, there aren't a lot of rule books on the subject).\n\nThe Buddhists keep coming back because they have no choice.  Their goal is to acquire the skillz to NOT come back.\n\nI, OTOH, am a total and utter FOOL who acquired those skillz millennia ago, and choose to come back over and over and over again to help others.\n\nSo what I'm looking for is new information and skillz relevant to this \"next level\" Recapitulation I find myself needing to do.\n\nThat reset help you see my POV better?", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fnh8gpb", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You forgot Ixtlan Productions (Oliver Stone).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doh, I knew that years ago and he didn&amp;#39;t come to mind!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are others who might need to be included on the list like Fincher and the Nolans to name a few.  Part of the issue for me is trying to parse how much is direct from Castaneda, how much comes inherited from the already existing Faction H camps, and how much comes from sources who mined the same territory as Castaneda like Jung and Campbell (Jung was a mighty sorcerer, who executed the folly of going through the world as a psychoanalyst, from a Toltec POV so to speak).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In some ways, his private classes were like a playground for elementary school kids, and he was the Playground Supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds about right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never saw the point of those sorts of environment to learn the material being presented, but rather the important lessons were the ones &lt;em&gt;surrounding&lt;/em&gt; the material (second attention stuff would fall into this category).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes he did.

Buddha is fine, Buddhists, OTOH, ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You would think that with as much focus as they give to ego destruction they would notice that they are walking around elaborate temples adorned with priceless art and gold like peacocks dressed in bright yellow and red.  Yeah, I recognize the absurdity of it is to allow for breakthroughs, but so few make those breakthroughs that the ROI (Return On Investment) of those temples vis a vis enlightenment simply CANNOT be very high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any beliefs that are hearsay rather than firmly rooted in personal experience are going to hold a person back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His favorite way to disprove Buddhism was to say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo you come back again and again, until you&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPerfect for what???\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhism is a religion, which has specific social needs which are not a part of the Warrior path (in fact, it&amp;#39;s anathema to the Warrior path).

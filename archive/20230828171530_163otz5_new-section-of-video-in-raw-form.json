Just a visitor like you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t stop anyone from doing anything they like in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just a grumpy old man who got stuck with this job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Allies (spirits) of Carlos focused a lot on me when he died, and blackmailed me to come here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos surely set that up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even &amp;quot;marked&amp;quot; my witch enemy Cholita so that the Allies would obey her over me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She can get them to levitate small objects, right in your face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard to argue with that kind of magic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re fully capable of driving any human mad if they have a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They pulled me into the entry to their world while I was doing business in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And gave me a history lesson on how long they&amp;#39;ve been helping our lineage of sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was just relaxing on the steps of a hotel in the sweltering heat of southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they pretty much said, if I don&amp;#39;t want to be insane and locked up the rest of my life, I had to do what you see in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got lucky and found good people in here who had been waiting for the day when everything starts working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can meet one of the spirits.  The &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other is a little shithead!

Sit back, watch streaming media in your underwear, have some wine, and hope your mate is in a frisky mood.\n\nYou just can't get real spirits to behave like that.  So their \"companionship\" isn't what you'd hope.\n\nYou can certainly have sex with them, so the stuff you \"miss out on\" by escaping the prison for the mind we've been born into isn't entirely removed from your life.\n\nBut when having sex with a spirit, they go from the person of your dreams to someone with stitches on their face, made out of barbed wire.\n\nOr they have a bolt coming out of their neck, like Frankenstein's monster.\n\nThey're clueless about humans, and just like to get you to give off emotions.\n\nGood or bad.\n\nYou also won't get that cozy feeling,traveling to real alien worlds in your physical body.  Not even when leaping through outer space at billions of light years per second.\n\nBecause you'll be alone.\n\nIt's like going to Disneyland, by yourself.\n\nWe're 98.5%+ Chimps.\n\nDesigned to crave human attention.\n\nIf you're lucky, as I am, you have a crazy companion once in a while.\n\nThat's very helpful.  I have a crazy witch who will lead me across continents, playing hide and seek.\n\nBut most are utterly alone when they are learning real magic.\n\nAnd making your own partner is next to impossible.\n\nWe've been here trying to help for 4+  years.\n\nOnly one subscriber to this subreddit out of 100, will even find the time to put in the same effort they would on a beloved hobby.\n\nOr the same amount of time it takes to get good at surfing, basketball, or to learn to play cheesy trumpet solos in a Las Vegas lounge act.\n\nChimps are designed to be lazy, because it's a survival advantage.\n\nSo until we get more people with crazy Dr. Strange levels of magic, there's no monastery to practice with your friends up in the mountains.\n\nIt's just you all alone, in your normal life.\n\nThis will all become clearer when you begin to see magic so amazing it kicks the Buddha's imaginary ass.\n\nAnd  yet, it doesn't motivate you to keep pushing.\n\nWith sorcery, you work like a dog to make progress.\n\nAnd then the next time, you have to work even harder.\n\nOf the 1 in 100 who will actually do some work, only one in 5 will keep going.\n\nThat's a success rate of 1 in 500.\n\nSo the odds of finding a \"soulmate\" who wants to go along with you, are close to zero.\n\nI hope we can change that, but so far those are the stats.\n\nThe people who do best are the ones who read a lot in this subreddit, to learn that what I just said is true.\n\nAnd who get to see the constant invaders we have, trying to pretend and take over this subreddit so they can get their own little throne and charge money to 'teach'.\n\nWhich is impossible.  You cannot teach real magic.\n\nIt's a gift from infinity.\n\nWhich is conscious.  And only wants humans to explore as far as possible into other worlds.\n\nThat conscious force will notice your efforts, and \"gift\" you with new magic once in a while.\n\nBut not often enough to make things easy.\n\nYou'll learn as a series of breakthroughs, which you can't repeat.\n\nOne night you'll work so hard that a bamboo forest materializes on the walls of your practice room.  The bamboo will begin to take on a 3D look and you'll find bamboo shoots growing up from your floor.\n\nIf you're fortunate that night, you'll be able to tiptoe around the bamboo shoots, which hurt your feet if you step on them, and walk off into that alien forest.\n\nWhich might actually be in Japan.\n\nOr on another world in another galaxy.\n\nYou'll literally break the laws of physics, walk through a solid wall in your room, and go spend 3 hours on another world.\n\nThen the next night, nothing.\n\nExcept a few purple puffs of intense light floating around you, or sparks coming  from your arms as you wave them in the air.\n\nBut no breaking the laws of physics again.\n\nWithout help from that \"great spirit\" as Shamanism likes to call it, you can't do such things.\n\nYou also can't do them if your motivation is greedy.

Sit back, watch streaming media in your underwear, have some wine, and hope your mate is in a frisky mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just can&amp;#39;t get real spirits to behave like that.

I have a crazy witch who will lead me across continents, playing hide and seek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most are utterly alone when they are learning real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And making your own partner is next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been here trying to help for 4+  years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only one subscriber to this subreddit out of 100, will even find the time to put in the same effort they would on a beloved hobby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the same amount of time it takes to get good at surfing, basketball, or to learn to play cheesy trumpet solos in a Las Vegas lounge act.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chimps are designed to be lazy, because it&amp;#39;s a survival advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So until we get more people with crazy Dr. Strange levels of magic, there&amp;#39;s no monastery to practice with your friends up in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just you all alone, in your normal life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will all become clearer when you begin to see magic so amazing it kicks the Buddha&amp;#39;s imaginary ass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  yet, it doesn&amp;#39;t motivate you to keep pushing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With sorcery, you work like a dog to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then the next time, you have to work even harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of the 1 in 100 who will actually do some work, only one in 5 will keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a success rate of 1 in 500.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the odds of finding a &amp;quot;soulmate&amp;quot; who wants to go along with you, are close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope we can change that, but so far those are the stats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people who do best are the ones who read a lot in this subreddit, to learn that what I just said is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And who get to see the constant invaders we have, trying to pretend and take over this subreddit so they can get their own little throne and charge money to &amp;#39;teach&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is impossible.

Good deal!", "edited": 1564169180.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ev21qsz", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone feel like posting a Buddhist elucidation on demons?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very interesting topic in Asia.  All of the businesses I visit have multiple charms around to keep demons from entering the building, and big city blocks even have depositories for exorcised demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the Jewish and Christian worlds, the concept of a demon has been tainted by magnificent artists who decided to portray them in an exaggerated fashion.  When you mention &amp;quot;demon&amp;quot; in the west, they picture a horned Satan in red pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the world of Kabbalah, it&amp;#39;s more like a spirit who creates a feeling in people, perhaps to feed off it.  One demon from the old testament volunteered to go to a King of Israel and give him a spirit of jealousy. God says something like, &amp;quot;Ok, go ahead.  And you will be successful&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganics also feed off feelings. And from that quote about them fleeing if you have a sudden burst of emotion (previous post perhaps), we have verification that they like to interact with us that way,  but can find it too intense under some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They certainly fled in that world of my little low energy inorganic, when I got frightened at seeing so many of them.  But last time I visited I was calmer, and more started to stick their faces out from the dirt wall.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never guessed that one of you would explain why to me by quoting Carlos&amp;#39; books.

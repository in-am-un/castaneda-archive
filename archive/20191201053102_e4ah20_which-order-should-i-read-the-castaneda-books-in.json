Obsession with the flashier stories from his books, mixed with cultish policing of discussions of personal experiences.\n\nLet me define cultish policing. Someone dares to stray off the beaten path, because it's just not working.  They talk to others interested, and one of the \"experts\", a guy who can't do anything at all but fancies himself an impeccable warrior, starts quoting the books, to tear him down and establish dominance.\n\nThe impeccable warrior tries to pacify his own internal dialogue, by attacking the guy actually trying to accomplish something.\n\nOr to put it more clearly, no one could make Carlos' techniques work enough to be impressive, no one would talk about it openly for fear of being criticized, no one wanted to believe they were had, and everyone wanted to obsess over the cooler stuff from his later books.\n\nThat made them feel better about the whole farce.  I can hear the conversation in their heads:\n\nYea but Maaammmmyyyy,  you can learn to FLY!!!\n\nIt's like a poor person with no viable job, consoling himself with the idea he'll be a millionaire some day, rather than getting an actual job.\n\nResult: All they could find to live on were inspirational quotes.\n\nBut don't overlook the small stuff. In the end, when you realize what *intent* is, there's no procedures at all.\n\nAnd the fact is, Don Juan teaches him everything he will ever need to know, in that first book.\n\nFor instance, \"finding his spot\" is pretty much what I emphasize around here. I've just combined it with Zuleica's technique, in order to keep you awake while practicing, since you aren't in heightened awareness.\n\nBut think about it.  Don Juan tells him to search the ground for things that can't possibly be there, and he finds them.\n\nThat's the second attention.  Combine watching that with internal silence, and you'll slip into heightened awareness.\n\nCholita went on a marathon shopping spree yesterday. By the time we got back, I was too tired to sit up and watch for colors in the darkness.\n\nMy sympathy to those of you with spouses. It's really hard to find time.\n\nThat's why don Juan told Carlos to leave his family and friends, and also why Carlos removed some apprentices from their families.\n\nAlthough I was too tired to practice proper, I tried to find something, to keep the flow of the second attention going.\n\nI just lay on my side and looked for anything at all that ought not be there.\n\nCertainly what I saw with closed eyes was not uniform black.  There were some very very vague details.\n\nNothing to write home about. Anyone would tell you, \"That's just eye defects!\"\n\nBut I remembered Carlos' first book.  And looking for your spot.\n\nI took my own advice, and just watched them.  As I watched, I felt stupid.  How silly, nothing's going to come from that tiny amount of junk!  I really ought to sit up, and look for the BIG stuff.\n\nBut I was too tired. I forced myself silent and kept gazing. Somewhere while gazing, I almost blanked out. I forgot about fretting over how long I'd been doing that pointless exercise.  What that really means is, my assemblage point started to drift, because I was gazing into the second attention.\n\nSuddenly the details exploded, and I was watching a dreaming scene of a woman washing clothes.  She seemed to notice that I was spying, and turned her head to look towards me.  A tingle went through my body.\n\n(Energy was released by the relatively new position of my assemblage point).\n\nThe woman's image  actually emerged from the very vague stuff I saw with eyes closed, as if the vague stuff itself had been highlights on the actual dreaming scene all along.  If I'd looked closer, I might have noticed that.  A vague line here that was the left of her clothes, a dot there that was one of her eyes.\n\nIt was too vague to notice, until the full image came out.\n\nSo don't overlook anything in his books.  Not even the first one.\n\nSorcery ala Carlos is NOT a random collection of stuff he got from other places.\n\nEach piece flows automatically from the others. And the first book was the start.\n\nLook for your \"spot\" on your eyelids if you get lazy.  It'll work too.\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1575239465.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f9ccg6q", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see some first book bashing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a tiny bit ironic, because that&amp;#39;s part of what&amp;#39;s been holding everyone back all these years.

In the end, when you realize what &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is, there&amp;#39;s no procedures at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the fact is, Don Juan teaches him everything he will ever need to know, in that first book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, &amp;quot;finding his spot&amp;quot; is pretty much what I emphasize around here. I&amp;#39;ve just combined it with Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique, in order to keep you awake while practicing, since you aren&amp;#39;t in heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But think about it.  Don Juan tells him to search the ground for things that can&amp;#39;t possibly be there, and he finds them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the second attention.  Combine watching that with internal silence, and you&amp;#39;ll slip into heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita went on a marathon shopping spree yesterday. By the time we got back, I was too tired to sit up and watch for colors in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sympathy to those of you with spouses. It&amp;#39;s really hard to find time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why don Juan told Carlos to leave his family and friends, and also why Carlos removed some apprentices from their families.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I was too tired to practice proper, I tried to find something, to keep the flow of the second attention going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just lay on my side and looked for anything at all that ought not be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly what I saw with closed eyes was not uniform black.  There were some very very vague details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing to write home about. Anyone would tell you, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s just eye defects!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I remembered Carlos&amp;#39; first book.  And looking for your spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took my own advice, and just watched them.  As I watched, I felt stupid.  How silly, nothing&amp;#39;s going to come from that tiny amount of junk!  I really ought to sit up, and look for the BIG stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was too tired. I forced myself silent and kept gazing. Somewhere while gazing, I almost blanked out. I forgot about fretting over how long I&amp;#39;d been doing that pointless exercise.  What that really means is, my assemblage point started to drift, because I was gazing into the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the details exploded, and I was watching a dreaming scene of a woman washing clothes.  She seemed to notice that I was spying, and turned her head to look towards me.  A tingle went through my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Energy was released by the relatively new position of my assemblage point).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman&amp;#39;s image  actually emerged from the very vague stuff I saw with eyes closed, as if the vague stuff itself had been highlights on the actual dreaming scene all along.  If I&amp;#39;d looked closer, I might have noticed that.  A vague line here that was the left of her clothes, a dot there that was one of her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was too vague to notice, until the full image came out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t overlook anything in his books.  Not even the first one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery ala Carlos is NOT a random collection of stuff he got from other places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each piece flows automatically from the others. And the first book was the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for your &amp;quot;spot&amp;quot; on your eyelids if you get lazy.  It&amp;#39;ll work too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/e4ah20/which_order_should_i_read_the_castaneda_books_in/f9ccg6q/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1575221906.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_e4ah20", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f9bkmba", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "warpwizard", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f9axfh3", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_fa5r", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "If you like them, you will probably end up rereading them, so it doesn't really matter.

You get to see the whitish light on surfaces, and the puffs too.  Or in daylight, \"purple sheen\" is more likely than a full on puff.\n\nCarlos saw that all the time, and even describes reading text from the sky by looking for a purple smear.\n\nIt's really no different.\n\nI suppose it's about *intent*.\n\nAnd how it stores into containers.\n\nSuch as your tensegrity forms.\n\nDuring darkroom if you insist your tensegrity forms get more and more vivid, with more and more REAL magic in your face, then they will.  \n\nBut over time. Don't anyone be impatient!  That kills the process.\n\nYou'll \"notice\" new things once in a while, and then your assemblage point will move a bit to make those more real, and the next time those will be easier to perceive.\n\nUntil each Tensegrity form is like a specific ride at Disneyland.\n\nIntent stores into them.  Just don't expect that to be \"easy\" until you can do your routine in Silent Knowledge.\n\nBut it's still going to happen even when you just barely got to the red zone, if you let your attention look for the magic while doing it.\n\nNever forgetting that silence is the most important thing at all times.\n\nYou have to balance greed and \"expecting things\", against the benefit of deliberately noticing things, so as to light up those emanations more for next time.\n\nAnd the entire darkroom practice is also a container. All by itself.\n\nWhich stores the intent to be silent, then remove fantasies, then remove our universal modern human habit of using self-pity as your advisor. \n\nIn order to perceive visible magic easily, you have to remove all three.\n\nI'll propose sacrilege here!   It seems so obvious, it's hard not to.\n\nUsing death as an advisor is a **bad** idea.  It's a \"Man of Knowledge\" delusion.    Created because they couldn't \"see\", but noticed that infinity was trying to help them learn more magic anyway.  So they saw the universe as \"helping\", and wanted to \"deserve it\", and ended up a superstitious mess.  The same thing that happens to people in all fake magical systems. They lean towards being \"pious\".\n\nInstead of \"using death as an advisor\", it's much better to stop using self-pity as your reference point for all that happens to you!\n\nAnd the \"Warrior's Way\" is based on self-pity.  Shouldn't be, but it got turned into that by bad players in our Castaneda fan base.\n\nAnyway, outdoors in sunlight is not the same container as darkroom, where you stored your intent by practicing and \"noticing\".\n\nSo that what stores into darkroom, at first, doesn't seem to relate to outdoors in full lighting.\n\nNaturally!  You're \"noticing\" magic in a very specific situation.  Not turning into Superman, whose powers are always there.  \n\nTo expect darkroom magic to immediately be available in the day, is kind of like expecting your progress during bird watching, to make you good at spotting anything, anywhere.  You will get good at spotting birds in trees and bushes if you are a serious bird watcher, even figuring out their favorite spots to perch on in the trees.\n\nSpots they just can't resist because of how protected and easy they are to land on from multiple angles.  \n\nYou learn about that, by practicing bird watching.\n\nBut how silly would it be to expect that to spill over into finding your friend who wandered too far away in a crowded shopping mall during the Christmas shopping season?\n\nInsisting \"I'm a good finder now!\"\n\nIt doesn't work that way.  You \"notice\" magic, but it's inside a very specific flow of sensations (a reality) from the emanations.\n\nIt's not applicable to an entirely different flow of reality.\n\n(I'll have to animate this, it seems like it might be a bit mysterious for visitors to the subreddit to understand.)\n\nBut darkroom progress inevitably spills over into your waking hours, because you \"notice\" the same things you notice while learning to move to SK as fast as possible.\n\nSensations in your own body.  Those aren't the same as noticing \"magic in your face\".\n\nYou're noticing how **you** are. How you feel, and react to things.\n\nSomething you learn, which is not specifically the same as noticing the magic.\n\nI can get to SK in 60 seconds now, on a very good day.  By \"noticing\" things in my body, while forcing silence.\n\nCarlos said it took him 6 seconds.\n\nI believe the witches said 20 seconds?\n\nSo to summarize it, keep going to SK where you'll \"notice\" what happens  when the energy body swarms you and forms.\n\nThat produces concrete sensations and changes in the breath.  You'll not only notice those, but learn about them too.\n\nWomen have a big advantage in that process, because they got used to needing to self-sooth.\n\nThen, \"notice\" those SK sensations during the day.

Or in daylight, &amp;quot;purple sheen&amp;quot; is more likely than a full on puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos saw that all the time, and even describes reading text from the sky by looking for a purple smear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really no different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;#39;s about &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how it stores into containers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as your tensegrity forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During darkroom if you insist your tensegrity forms get more and more vivid, with more and more REAL magic in your face, then they will.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But over time. Don&amp;#39;t anyone be impatient!  That kills the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; new things once in a while, and then your assemblage point will move a bit to make those more real, and the next time those will be easier to perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until each Tensegrity form is like a specific ride at Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent stores into them.  Just don&amp;#39;t expect that to be &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; until you can do your routine in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still going to happen even when you just barely got to the red zone, if you let your attention look for the magic while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never forgetting that silence is the most important thing at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to balance greed and &amp;quot;expecting things&amp;quot;, against the benefit of deliberately noticing things, so as to light up those emanations more for next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the entire darkroom practice is also a container. All by itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which stores the intent to be silent, then remove fantasies, then remove our universal modern human habit of using self-pity as your advisor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to perceive visible magic easily, you have to remove all three.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll propose sacrilege here!   It seems so obvious, it&amp;#39;s hard not to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using death as an advisor is a &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; idea.  It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot; delusion.    Created because they couldn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, but noticed that infinity was trying to help them learn more magic anyway.  So they saw the universe as &amp;quot;helping&amp;quot;, and wanted to &amp;quot;deserve it&amp;quot;, and ended up a superstitious mess.  The same thing that happens to people in all fake magical systems. They lean towards being &amp;quot;pious&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of &amp;quot;using death as an advisor&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s much better to stop using self-pity as your reference point for all that happens to you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;Warrior&amp;#39;s Way&amp;quot; is based on self-pity.  Shouldn&amp;#39;t be, but it got turned into that by bad players in our Castaneda fan base.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, outdoors in sunlight is not the same container as darkroom, where you stored your intent by practicing and &amp;quot;noticing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that what stores into darkroom, at first, doesn&amp;#39;t seem to relate to outdoors in full lighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally!  You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;noticing&amp;quot; magic in a very specific situation.  Not turning into Superman, whose powers are always there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To expect darkroom magic to immediately be available in the day, is kind of like expecting your progress during bird watching, to make you good at spotting anything, anywhere.  You will get good at spotting birds in trees and bushes if you are a serious bird watcher, even figuring out their favorite spots to perch on in the trees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spots they just can&amp;#39;t resist because of how protected and easy they are to land on from multiple angles.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learn about that, by practicing bird watching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how silly would it be to expect that to spill over into finding your friend who wandered too far away in a crowded shopping mall during the Christmas shopping season?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Insisting &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a good finder now!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.  You &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; magic, but it&amp;#39;s inside a very specific flow of sensations (a reality) from the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not applicable to an entirely different flow of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;ll have to animate this, it seems like it might be a bit mysterious for visitors to the subreddit to understand.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But darkroom progress inevitably spills over into your waking hours, because you &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; the same things you notice while learning to move to SK as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sensations in your own body.  Those aren&amp;#39;t the same as noticing &amp;quot;magic in your face&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re noticing how &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are. How you feel, and react to things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something you learn, which is not specifically the same as noticing the magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can get to SK in 60 seconds now, on a very good day.  By &amp;quot;noticing&amp;quot; things in my body, while forcing silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos said it took him 6 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the witches said 20 seconds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarize it, keep going to SK where you&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; what happens  when the energy body swarms you and forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That produces concrete sensations and changes in the breath.  You&amp;#39;ll not only notice those, but learn about them too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women have a big advantage in that process, because they got used to needing to self-sooth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; those SK sensations during the day.   While fighting back self-pity so that you don&amp;#39;t drive your energy body away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll be seeing whitish light on surface then too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;#39;ll be slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mine tends to ripple as broken waves of smoke, rather than fine lines which vibrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re so real, once in a while I suspect it might actually be some smoke and start looking around only to find there&amp;#39;s nothing burning near by.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1blmiso", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1blmiso/closed_eye_vision/kwbw069/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1711282955.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1711282955.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kw8ijst", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "WitchyCreatureView", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1711221467.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kw6pz6e", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_f4drk2qst", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "So, if you fall asleep and wake up already in the orange zone and can see your body wearing a sleep mask but you take off the mask and bright sunlight fills up your tonal room, what are the dynamics there?\n\nI mean basically, if someone can see the whitish light with tier eyes closed but not open, because of the physical room being too bright.

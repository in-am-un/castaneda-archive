The same as most Yoga cults did in the 70s and 80s.\n\nI've heard Patanjali wasn't even particularly noteworthy until some white guy created the book, \"How to Know God\".\n\nImported some relatively obscure Asian fake magic, and then cashed in on na\u00efve westeners.\n\nMaharishi would sell you meditation back in the 70s for $200-$400.\n\nThen when it didn't really work much, he'd sell you \"advanced\" techniques.\n\nChopra even got in on the act.\n\nIf you were intelligent, you soon realized you were royally ripped off.\n\nAll the mantras are the same for all practical purposes. Everyone uses the same one.\n\nAnd the \"advanced\" techniques simply add \"Sri\" to the front, and then the next \"nama\".\n\nIt's a substitute internal dialogue.\n\nIf you alter the internal dialogue in just about any way, through just about any method, weird stuff happens.\n\nBut not much.\n\nAnd so when people realized how pathetic TM really was, they needed some \"motivation\".\n\nSo out came the \"Siddhi Program\".\n\nJust stuff you could read in that sleezy book by Christopher, and do yourself.\n\nBut Maharishi would teach you for $3000!\n\nStill greedy for more, Maharishi had a \"vision\" that a giant caterpillar was about to strangle the earth, and WW3 was going to break out.\n\nSo his people HAD to gather 7000, to practice the crummy \"siddhi\" techniques in a giant golden dome in Iowa. To create \"world peace\".\n\nRemember the daisy popping hot hippy women you see in movies?\n\nThey had a daisy because Maharishi held flowers as he lectured.\n\nI don't remember how much that \"7000\" workshop cost, but I'd guess it was $1500.\n\n7000\\*1500 = $10M!\n\nHe didn't get the 7000, but pretended he did by hiring people in India to meditate in a big room.\n\nWhere they pretty much just took naps.\n\nBut what about the cool TM superpowers?\n\nSome crummy \"bliss\", and a tiny bit of visions and remote viewing.\n\nGreen line beginners stuff in the Castaneda community.\n\nThen those added \"super powers\" from Patanjali were just an attempt to be silent (they called it sanyama or something like that to confuse everyone), and you repeated the \"sutra\".\n\nSuch as \"Pole Star\".\n\nIf you are silent and say one simple phrase, you have a shot at reskimming the emanations.\n\nI prefer \"hamburger\". If you do that, eyes open, a hamburger materializes right in front of you.\n\nBut Yoga people can't open their eyes. They have to pretend everything.\n\nSo the \"super talented\" TMers would have a vision of the stars, lasting one second, and get all excited.\n\nIt's PROOF!!!\n\nBut it's not. The whole thing was a delusional Hindu lie.\n\nLet's contrast their closed eye meditation and the \"pole star\" sutra, with what sorcerers do.\n\nThe Nagual Elias literally visited planets outside our galaxy, just for fun.\n\nI myself was taught by the inorganic being \"Lily\" to literally stand up,. fully awake, eyes open, swipe my ceiling away so I could gaze at the stars above without having to leave my practice room, then I could select a star, zoom in as if it were a cellphone pic, and I simply leaped through the ceiling.\n\nPhysically! Not with my eyes closed. Not in dreaming. Not asleep.\n\nNo drugs involved, in case any TMers come here to complain.\n\nIt's the real thing. REAL MAGIC.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nYou soar through outer space at billions of light years per second, until you reach the star you selected.\n\nYou get to see everything on the way.\n\nWhen you arrive you just hope a planet is around.\n\nI got lucky and landed on one that had an alien village consisting of whitish round huts.\n\nHurt a bit when I landed on my feet.\n\nPlease contrast that with what happens if you believe in a \"Guru Dev\".\n\nAside from ending up short of money, nothing good.\n\nAs for their flying sutra, it just invoked the cerebellum to make you hop on thick foam, from a cross legged position.\n\nIt's no more miraculous than a boxer who has a good retaliatory strike, which he doesn't have to consciously think about.\n\nOr no different than catching a falling glass before you realize it's gone off the dinner table.\n\nBut Hindus exploit any effect they can, to have something to sell.\n\nYou come up with a meditation technique that isn't as horrible as the real thing we practice (learning to remove the internal dialogue), and you can lure in thousands to give you money.\n\nThen you only need some very tiny results like a vision once a month, or some \"bliss\".\n\nAnd your students will self-flatter.\n\nTell themselves they're on the path to enlightenment!\n\nIt's a very ugly con.\n\nUnless you like hopping on foam while cross legged.\n\nDid I mention, the hippy chicks were kind of hot?\n\nBut it didn't compensate for being ripped off by an Indian guy whose brother drives a Taxi and tried to take over when Maharishi died.\n\nMeanwhile, sorcerers actually fly.\n\nFully awake, eyes wide open, completely sober.\n\nI once tried to chase Cholita into the backyard, and she leaped over our 6 foot high concrete block wall.\n\nI thought I could follow and jumped up onto it, only to find she was already a mile away on some power lines.\n\nSo take your pick.\n\nGuru Dev.\n\nOr magic.\n\nBut you can't have both.\n\nAny \"guru\" is a fraud and knows nothing about real magic.\n\nBut how to know God?\n\nJust go visit! You can go as often as you like.\n\nHeaven too.\n\nAnd for real.\n\nI'm going to feature this guru in the cartoons, to cover that kind of fraudulent technique and explain how it works to fool people.\n\nWho will literally get angry if you try to point out the truth.\n\nBecause, they're trying to cash in too!\n\nTM teachers get to keep the money if they want to.\n\nI believe it's now up at $2000 to learn?!\n\nBut I just told you how. So don't bother.\n\nJust repeat \"Aing\" over and over.\n\nAt a natural, not rushed rate.\n\nWith your eyes closed.\n\nWon't do much, but you can reach bliss and have visions and minor remote viewing.\n\nStuff not even worth mentioning for someone who's been seriously practicing Castaneda's techniques.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Introducing Guru Dev!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

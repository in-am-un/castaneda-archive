I have also removed the location screenshots from google maps satellite to respect the owners. I believe that me and my friend saw something not many people have and if they have, I haven't came across any stories that come close of the description of the figure I saw. This experience was the one of the most, if not the most spiritual experience I have ever had. I have included a link to a drawing I did of the figure to the best of my ability below.\n\nBack in 2010 in Abbotsford British Columbia Canada when I was 16 (I am 25 years old now and have been living here for about 12 years) my old friend lived in a part of town that has a lot of forest area and his backyard was a good couple acres of forest with a few houses surrounded in the distance. Me and him would go and explore the forest all the time because it was quite mystical and just a cool place to wander.\n\nThis one time me and my friend went outside to his forest with his dog like we would usually do in the daytime, but this time at night in his backyard forest at probably close to 1 am to go explore and smoke a joint. There's a steep cliff when you first walk in. It is only about 10 feet into the forest area. When we were standing at the cliff/ravine before the path way leading down to the rest of the forest which was the only safe way to walk down especially at night, I could see a tall white illuminated figure and it was in between two trees kind of moving around between the trees. I asked my friend if he saw it and he said yes he could as well , then we stood silent in fear and I could feel impending doom and I had shivers going throughout my body.\n\nThe best way I can describe it is the feeling you get when someone dies or you are about to die, the feeling of dread inside your chest like you are helpless. I remembered this feeling from personal experiences of almost dying and from close people and pets dying in my life. We left very quick because we had no clue what it was, it scared us and we felt we were in danger. I remember my friend yelling something at it because he could tell his dog was scared , I am actually pretty positive the dog was wimpering. And the figure was just still slightly moving between the trees. After my friend yelled at it because his dog was scared we pretty much left right after cause it didn't respond back it just kept doing its thing between the trees.\n\nThe figure was pure white and solid seemed to be at least 6 to 7 feet tall from where we were standing which was about 30-40 feet away from us so it could have been even bigger than it appeared to us at that distance. I am positive it was not a living creature or a human being and it was not a trick of the mind or light, there was no light nor moon shining in the forest because it was pitch black and filled with pine trees, and there were no houses close enough to give off any light whatsoever or give off a shine. It was upside down v shaped and It had no physical features at all except for very long arms. It was pitch black in the forest but the whole figure was sort of blurry giving off a white light like if you were to look at something out of focus.\n\nIt wasn't illuminated to the point where it was giving off a bright light, it was more like a really condensed figure of white smoke and dim soft light but you could see it in the pitch black. It was soft white light but it was large and doing something very strange. The best way I could describe it was it looked like flowing curtains in the wind, its movement was very fluid like, and it was making no sound at all. It was staying in the same exact place but it the movements looked like it was shapeshifting/convulsing in a way and moving left to right back and forth (kind of like a giant stickbug walking). The other best way I could describe its movement is if you have ever done Magic Mushrooms you will know what stuff looks like when it \"Breathes\" this is the effect it was giving off, except we were completely sober, thats why it was so astonishing to look at, it was almost angelic like.\n\nI am pretty sure it was not something that was physical and it was rather a manifestation of an entity or an alien due to its unnatural movement and unnatural appearance, it would have attacked us if it was a physical creature and really felt threatened. And the energy that it put off I don't think could be created by a living creature or animal, unless somehow they had a really dark negative energy attached to them. It was literally something you would see in a science fiction horror movie.\n\nIt was kind of odd because the figure didn't catch my attention right away my eyes just kind of adjusted to the dark when I noticed the figure and focused in on it in the distance and I couldn't believe and wasn't sure what I was looking at. I also find it strange that I didn't even have to point out to my friend where the figure was he automatically saw it at the same time I saw it, like it wanted to be seen. It could have quite possibly have been a warning and that is why me and my friend left right away without any hesitation. It is now 9 years later I am 25 and the experience still scares me.\n\nHe has no neighbors that are close to the location because as I said his forest is a couple acres, so there is no way it could have been a neighbor in his forest. To this day the feeling that I got when I saw that still gives me shivers, something so powerful that it emits a powerful vibe of fear and death. The fact that we went out to his forest at that time really late at night and happened to see that freaks me out as well, cause it was clearly meant to be seen by us. If we went out any later or any sooner we might not have seen whatever it was that manifested in his forest at that moment of time. Once we got out of the forest it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders.\n\nEdit/Update:\n\nStarted drawing image of figure to the best of my ability, the swirly intertwining lines represent the kind of swift swirling, blinds blowing in the wind motion it was making. And the swirls were all soft white light including the whole figure.It is very hard for me to replicate exactly what I saw because I am not that great of an artist and I don't know how to recreate the type of movements it was making with pencils or pen.\n\n[https://imgur.com/eB8XTFH](https://imgur.com/eB8XTFH)\n\nI can't guarantee that I would get anything on camera, I am not sure the figure will ever show up again in the forest, and I am not sure if it will show up on camera due to whatever it was. and it would be a waste of time and effort besides of having the nostalgia of going back to this location and \"possibly\" seeing the figure again but I highly doubt it unless it manifests itself regularly in the forest.\"\n\n...........................................................\n\nThe third one is a very short video titled inaccurately (from our perspective), but what can you do:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/c52tw0/is\\_himself\\_but\\_from\\_the\\_future/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/c52tw0/is_himself_but_from_the_future/)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Paranormal Storytime", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c8gxzr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562152565.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562111513.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoy perusing paranormal subreddits and sites from time to time, and chuckling at the interpretations of the clueless individuals who experience them.

I don't like stalking; it's too much work.  My speed is more like sitting in a comfy chair and recapitulating for hours, or watching colors in the darkness and playing with them.  With a couple espresso double shots on the night stand.\n\nI also don't like Tensegrity, even though I'm forced to do some each night.   If nothing is happening, I have to revert to basics.\n\nThat said, the process to get to heightened awareness is pretty straight forward.  You get silent. Then stalking, tensegrity, or Zuleica's techniques, will pull the assemblage point in the correct direction.\n\nAnd a warning: damage to the body will deviate its movement, so take care of yourselves. It'll go sideways when it moves and you'll end up staring at blue lines you think should be purple, and feeling sorry for yourself over some imaginary arch enemy who\u2019s faking them to be blue lines.   \n\nIt's nutty in abstract dreaming, thus my recommendation to channel your inner Quark (star trek reference).  Meaning, use that merchant's mind to decide that it's time to stop staring at purple lines, and check out what's really going on, so you can increase the profit.  You'll be fighting, \"Yea but...\" nonsense about how the abstract and bizarre storyline is absolutely true, and it's pointless to pretend it isn't true.  But Quark will cut to the chase if you let him. Abstract dreaming is rough, unless you have a little rationality left.\n\nIf you practice Zuleica's technique EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, you get to keep the heightened awareness nearly all the next day.  But it does indeed fade, and chances are you won't be able to do it every night.  I can't, and I get rewarded big time when I do.  So, you guys likely won't either.\n\nBut you'll get to keep some of it.  And maybe a half day.\n\nSo how to keep it all day?  You have to be silent, that's the main thing.\n\nIt doesn't have to be perfect, just most of the time.\n\nNow, you need something to keep it moved over into heightened awareness.\n\nYou can peer into the second attention during the day.  Try your eyelashes. Someone complained about having long ones.  Don't!  Those are great.  Did you know they\u2019re right in your sight, but you gloss over them?\n\nTry to see them, move your head back and forth a tiny bit like that technique for using eyelashes to capture sparkles from sunlight, and see if you can't cause the other \"eye junk\" to show up more.  Dust, lines, cataracts. Whatever junk you can find, that you were glossing away before.  \n\nGlossing away means your brain ignores it, despite the fact that it's there.  Make more of it, and some of it will actually be from the second attention.  You can use that to help keep you at the \"place of no pity\".\n\nI hate that name...  Why did Carlos make up such pretentious things?  It's just a position where you don't feel sorry for yourself, because your idea of \"self\" is weakened.  And then if you don't feel sorry for yourself, other people can't manipulate you by appealing to your inner sadness.\n\nSo I guess place of no pity is descriptive, but it implies some kind of hard headed witch going around taking advantage of people, and bullying them when they won't behave.\n\nIt's just you that has no pity, for yourself anymore.  Not that you become a bully.\n\nBad name.\n\nHow to use stalking to hold it there?  I can't give you the fine details of that.  Like I said, I'm too lazy for stalking.\n\nBut, how it works seems kind of obvious.  You have to have silence. But silence isn't perfect at first.  So you can use stalking to help \"not be yourself\".\n\nNot being yourself keeps you from going back to normal fantasies, like how much you hate your sister's small dog (substitute boyfriend), why that cute girl in the office keeps wearing less and less clothes to work, the nasty personality of one of your family members and how \"unfair\" it is, etc.\n\nWe have nasty petty personalities and spend all day feeling sorry for ourselves.\nAnd our assemblage point doesn't judge, it just moves where you need to be, for best interaction with what you're interested in.  In fact it does such a good job of moving to a position to enhance your interests, if you tell most people that they spend most of their time feeling sorry for themselves, they'll vehemently deny it. They don't even know themselves!  \n\nForget about trying to help people that lost. They'll perceive it as an attack instead.\n\nStalking reduces that kind of nonsense, and if you become an entirely different person, it stops it massively.\n\nThen the assemblage point can move (because you kept silence going).\n\nWhat bothers me about stalking is, I can't understand how you get control over where it moves.  But I can give one of you a hint, and hopefully someone is more talented than me.    \n\nI believe (just a theory) that you select the direction it moves, during stalking, by what \"tickles your fancy\".\n\nIn other words, you don't just pretend to be someone else.  You BECOME someone else.  Or at least, in what peaks your interest.  What peaks your interest directs the assemblage point.\n\nAnd probably nothing will happen unless you learn to be silent.  Except that stalking itself helps reduce the internal dialogue.\n\nTensegrity does also, since you have to concentrate on remembering movements, so you can't think to yourself as normal.  Carlos wrote about \"saturating us\" in his last books, and he mentioned it in class too.  If you have to focus on muscle memory, that car bill you're worried about can wait till later.\n\nBut NOTHING is going to work faster than FORCING yourself silent, while looking for details that have to be coming from the second attention.  Focusing on those causes the assemblage point to move to where you can do that better, and since that's a mix of first attention and second attention, it activates the second attention's energy body, while you are still conscious.\n\nOnce that happens, it's very important to use Zuleica's technique to move the colors closer, or use some tensegrity moves, and manipulate the energy with your hands.  That will intensify it until it's no longer vague and easy to explain away.\n\n\nEdited: three times", "edited": 1562694340.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_etcoyle", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;ve stated, I&amp;#39;m as lazy as they come.

That\u2019ll give you continuous access to \\*seeing\\*.\n\nHowever, I suspect that would take unusual circumstance, such as you were engaged in long term stalking while practicing silence the whole time.   Just as watching something from the second attention, while silent, can move the assemblage point, so can stalking.  Silence loosens it, and just about anything could make it move.  Stalking produces a sturdier result than looking at colors in the darkness.\n\nTensegrity in silence can do that same thing, but it seems like an awful lot of work to me.  I\u2019d rather go to the gym, then go home and sit in the dark. I\u2019ve had enough \u201cKungfu\u201d for 2 lifetimes.\n\nIf you only move into heightened awareness the night before, it might remain the entire next day. But you\u2019ll have best access to \\*seeing\\* earlier in the day.\n\nIn heightened awareness, when you close your eyes you detect the presence of the second attention.  That can be vibrant dream images, \u201cthe wall\u201d, or just a feeling that there\u2019s some depth there, some space, and it isn\u2019t just your flat inner eye lids.\n\nIf you have \u201cthe wall\u201d, you can look through it   for *seeing*.   You likely do that with your eyes closed, however in darkness you can open them and still *see* \u201cthe wall\u201d.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine getting so good at it that you can see the wall with your eyes open in bright light.  However, it\u2019s possible because Carlos demonstrated that a bunch of times.\n\nBut with your eyes open, not seeing \u201cthe wall\u201d, and with silence, you can still pick up the kinds of things don Juan\u2019s apprentices described. Glows, sparks of light, details in the environment you\u2019d normally miss.\n\nI\u2019ll contrast the two.  In an airport, I sat by the people mover thing with my eyes closed, watching people go by. I could \\*see\\* little worms colored red, blue, or orange, lodged in the upper half of people\u2019s bodies.  Presumably from sex, but they were as plain as day.\n\nIf I\u2019d tried that with my eyes open, I suspect I\u2019d only pick up a vague sparkle.  In fact, thinking back, that's what happened. I tried it with my eyes open, and the results were poor.\n\nYesterday I was doing the swap meet walking around in silence technique.  After 2 hours, I started to see very unusual sparkles on the ground.   Naturally my eyes were open, since I was walking around. I was surprised how much of what I was seeing on the ground had to be coming from the second attention. You can tell if you\u2019re nearsighted, because the details are absolutely in focus.  Normally if you saw a sparkle on the pavement or sidewalk, from a shiny piece of sand or something else added to the concrete, they\u2019d mostly be out of focus.  When you wear glasses, stuff down on the ground isn\u2019t likely to be in focus.\n\nAlong with the sparkles, which put out a rainbow ripple from their center (kind of like what you might see with LSD), there were little black dots darting around like insects.  They were clearly alive, dodging stuff the way a fast fly might.\n\nYes, you can *see* the way described in Carlos\u2019 books.  That even includes *seeing* the wall of fog!  Once you can *see* that, you can step into another world. Well, not right away, but *seeing* it is enough to be very pleasing.\n\nBut I suspect there\u2019s some other concern hidden in that question.\n\nThe answer to what I believe is hidden in that question, is that you absolutely MUST learn to see with your eyes open, or you\u2019ll be drowning in doubt forever.  We\u2019ve got too much posturing among Carlos\u2019 fans.  Pretending to be things they aren\u2019t, possibly because they don\u2019t actually believe his techniques produce the results he claims.\n\nAll you need for Carlos\u2019 techniques is silence.  There\u2019s no need for Buddhist, Hindu, or Daoist techniques. They\u2019re fine, but unnecessary. And maybe they\u2019ll slow you down.  There\u2019s also no reason you have to be a good person, or perfect, or spiritual.  I have students who write to me that are (frankly) rotten people.   But I value whoever works, I don\u2019t judge personalities.  I\u2019d rather produce an angry sorcerer, then let Carlos\u2019 techniques fade away.\n\nForget about being a warrior, and learn to get silent, gaze at things from the second attention to drift your assemblage point into heightened awareness, then learn to *see*.  Once you can do that, you\u2019re a sorcerer.  (A crummy one like me).\n\nThen you can decide if you want to be a warrior too.  I don\u2019t.  It\u2019s far too snooty for me.\n\nBut I must add, just so people try whatever they can find time for, that it\u2019s not actually superior to learn to *see* with your eyes open.\n\nHaving them closed, you can do all the same things.

That\u2019ll give you continuous access to *seeing*.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I suspect that would take unusual circumstance, such as you were engaged in long term stalking while practicing silence the whole time.   Just as watching something from the second attention, while silent, can move the assemblage point, so can stalking.  Silence loosens it, and just about anything could make it move.  Stalking produces a sturdier result than looking at colors in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity in silence can do that same thing, but it seems like an awful lot of work to me.  I\u2019d rather go to the gym, then go home and sit in the dark. I\u2019ve had enough \u201cKungfu\u201d for 2 lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you only move into heightened awareness the night before, it might remain the entire next day. But you\u2019ll have best access to *seeing* earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In heightened awareness, when you close your eyes you detect the presence of the second attention.  That can be vibrant dream images, \u201cthe wall\u201d, or just a feeling that there\u2019s some depth there, some space, and it isn\u2019t just your flat inner eye lids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have \u201cthe wall\u201d, you can look through it   for &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.   You likely do that with your eyes closed, however in darkness you can open them and still &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; \u201cthe wall\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t imagine getting so good at it that you can see the wall with your eyes open in bright light.  However, it\u2019s possible because Carlos demonstrated that a bunch of times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with your eyes open, not seeing \u201cthe wall\u201d, and with silence, you can still pick up the kinds of things don Juan\u2019s apprentices described. Glows, sparks of light, details in the environment you\u2019d normally miss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll contrast the two.  In an airport, I sat by the people mover thing with my eyes closed, watching people go by. I could *see* little worms colored red, blue, or orange, lodged in the upper half of people\u2019s bodies.  Presumably from sex, but they were as plain as day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I\u2019d tried that with my eyes open, I suspect I\u2019d only pick up a vague sparkle.  In fact, thinking back, that&amp;#39;s what happened. I tried it with my eyes open, and the results were poor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was doing the swap meet walking around in silence technique.  After 2 hours, I started to see very unusual sparkles on the ground.   Naturally my eyes were open, since I was walking around. I was surprised how much of what I was seeing on the ground had to be coming from the second attention. You can tell if you\u2019re nearsighted, because the details are absolutely in focus.  Normally if you saw a sparkle on the pavement or sidewalk, from a shiny piece of sand or something else added to the concrete, they\u2019d mostly be out of focus.  When you wear glasses, stuff down on the ground isn\u2019t likely to be in focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with the sparkles, which put out a rainbow ripple from their center (kind of like what you might see with LSD), there were little black dots darting around like insects.  They were clearly alive, dodging stuff the way a fast fly might.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the way described in Carlos\u2019 books.  That even includes &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; the wall of fog!  Once you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; that, you can step into another world. Well, not right away, but &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; it is enough to be very pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suspect there\u2019s some other concern hidden in that question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer to what I believe is hidden in that question, is that you absolutely MUST learn to see with your eyes open, or you\u2019ll be drowning in doubt forever.  We\u2019ve got too much posturing among Carlos\u2019 fans.  Pretending to be things they aren\u2019t, possibly because they don\u2019t actually believe his techniques produce the results he claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you need for Carlos\u2019 techniques is silence.  There\u2019s no need for Buddhist, Hindu, or Daoist techniques. They\u2019re fine, but unnecessary. And maybe they\u2019ll slow you down.  There\u2019s also no reason you have to be a good person, or perfect, or spiritual.  I have students who write to me that are (frankly) rotten people.   But I value whoever works, I don\u2019t judge personalities.  I\u2019d rather produce an angry sorcerer, then let Carlos\u2019 techniques fade away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget about being a warrior, and learn to get silent, gaze at things from the second attention to drift your assemblage point into heightened awareness, then learn to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.  Once you can do that, you\u2019re a sorcerer.  (A crummy one like me).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you can decide if you want to be a warrior too.  I don\u2019t.  It\u2019s far too snooty for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I must add, just so people try whatever they can find time for, that it\u2019s not actually superior to learn to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; with your eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having them closed, you can do all the same things.   And squinting is fine if it helps.    If all you can do is find time while in bed, then gaze with eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_c8gxzr", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c8gxzr/paranormal_storytime/et71de1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1562522856.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1562522856.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "et6dj43", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tryerrr", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_esyusou", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_n9h6v", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "When you talk about hacing access to same \u201cview\u201d in daytime, do you mean with eues closed, half-closed or wide open?", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_et6dj43", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you talk about hacing access to same \u201cview\u201d in daytime, do you mean with eues closed, half-closed or wide open?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_c8gxzr", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c8gxzr/paranormal_storytime/et6dj43/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1562510280.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1562510280.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "esyusou", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_esynnml", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "An \"Angel of the LORD\" is God himself, in a physical body.

For the sake of Catholics, I hope it can be Mary too.  But she seems a little overburdened in South America.\n\nSo that was God himself who wrestled with Jacob.\n\nJacob wouldn\u2019t give up.  God put his hand on Jacob's hip and dislocated it, to end the battle.  Jacob seems to have had a limp throughout the rest of the old testament.  There are God inflicted injuries on more than a couple of the prophets and saints. It\u2019s amusing to see how scholars track them through the entire storyline, just to make sure they\u2019re consistent.\n\nIf you read closely and compare notes (or get a good scholar to explain it), angels are not made out of organic matter.  They're made out of something \"incorruptible\".  \n\nAlso, they seem to live here.   Not off somewhere in the sky.   Maybe in the dark matter universe (my guess).\n\nThere's some kind of veil or barrier blocking our ability to see them. In several places in the old testament,  the barrier is lifted, and it turns out they use technology to get around.  In fact, the description from Ezekiel is the basis of our \"flying saucer\". It even has glass windows, with glass not even having been invented back then.\n\nEven without the interdimensional flying vehicles, Heaven is described as a magnificent high-tech city. The main structure (which descends from the sky 1000 years after judgement day) is 15 miles cubed.  It actually extends up into space for 15 miles!  I once calculated that you could double the population of the earth (to include everyone who ever lived), and still give every (by then dead) person an apartment in that structure, bigger than a football field.\n\nAfter judgement day, all the water on earth is put back into orbit as a blue bubble, blocking harmful sun rays and spreading light evenly everywhere on earth, so that it\u2019s always light and always pleasantly misted from the blue bubble above.  It's like a Dyson sphere, and I suspect the physics of putting all the water into orbit might actually work out better than you'd imagine.\n\nWith all the water in orbit, it doesn\u2019t rain. It just sort of drizzles all the time.  As it did at the start of Genesis, just after the waters were removed from the firmament.\n\nIt\u2019s also said that the heavens are God\u2019s footstool.  So that \u201cAngel of the LORD\u201d really isn\u2019t him at all.  It\u2019s just for our sake.  Likewise for the copy that everyone goes to worship, once a month, in heaven. Or maybe once a week, I\u2019m not sure. If you don\u2019t show up, you get penalized.   But not severely.  As far as I can figure out, people go to the main temple, and stare at God in the center. He gives off some emanations called, \u201cThe Shekinah Glory\u201d by scholars.  The angels are said to \u201clong to see that sight\u201d.  I guess it\u2019s a form of gazing into infinity.\n\nOne interesting book of Apocrypha, The Gospel of Judas, states that we shouldn\u2019t workshop that God at all.  If we only knew the real God, we\u2019d understand how limited that one is.  He seems to be more like a distraction for us.\n\nMy current take on all this is, does it matter?    Sorcery has nothing to do with religion.\n\nBut technically, in that case of Jacob wrestling him, God was an inorganic being.  He was a being, not made out of organic matter.\n\nI'll leave it to Catholics and Buddhists to opine on the significance.  \n\nCarlos had a thing against the bible.  I have to say, it wasn\u2019t quite rational.  His criticisms were like those of a former Catholic, who never actually studied the book.   Catholics, especially including their priests, are biblically illiterate.  It\u2019s nearly a universal fact.  If you think your preacher knows the bible, you\u2019re na\u00efve.\n\nCarlos himself was the one who gave me the task of studying the bible. He said we\u2019d see what nonsense it was if we did that.  However, I suspect he really did it so that his students would become more comfortable with their own religions, and not get all bent out of shape (noisy internal dialogue) when they had a holy roller around.\n\nI didn\u2019t see that it was nonsense at all. Instead, it\u2019s rather perplexing and difficult to explain, without some kind of cosmic conspiracy theory.  Time travel, aliens, Jewish seers.  Those are all I have for explanations.\n\nCarlos\u2019 criticisms of the bible in class might have just have been about Ellis, or some other religiously minded person from his inner circle.  You could never tell if he was buttering someone up (showing an interest in something he couldn't possibly care about in order to motivate a specific person), or had a genuine interest.\n\nBut I really doubt he hated \"Bishops\" as much as he seemed to.  He did several very funny monologues on Bishops and their doings.  \u201cThe Sex Lives of the Popes\u201d came up a few times.\n\nHe also adamantly explained to us that Heaven isn\u2019t a desirable place, because nothing changes. It\u2019s all dead.  A dead world.\n\nHe DID NOT say it did not exist.  Figure that one out!\n\nHe also admitted once that when he started learning from don Juan, he was deathly afraid of demonic possession. It was the only explanation he had for inorganics.\n\nI see some others who follow Carlos call inorganics, \"demons\".   I ran into a demon exorcist on the web, a student of Carlos.\n\nI do myself call them demons, but just because it's funny.  It's the closest thing I suspect humans will find, to actual demons.\n\nMaybe \u201cFairy\u201d is a better description for Inorganics than \u201cDemon,\u201d because people only think you\u2019re nuts. They don\u2019t expect you\u2019d be very dangerous.  \n\nOn the other hand, if you told people that the night before you had a little 4-inch-tall Demon standing in your hand, they might worry a bit too much.\n\nMy conclusion (seems like some are so frightened of their own religion, that I might do well to offer a conclusion): If you\u2019re religious, be impeccable about it.  If you want to understand a religion, and even if it\u2019s not your religion but you\u2019re just curious, you can\u2019t start out with doubt.\n\nIf you want to understand a religion, you have to believe 100% in everything they say. It\u2019s all true.  Like a not-doing.  Now read on, and try to understand it.\n\nIf you start out doubting it, you\u2019ll never understand why it\u2019s attractive to people.  If you go looking for scholars to explain the bible, beware of university scholars, who are punished if they follow my advice and believe everything.  As a result, their explanations will be off, or even outright wrong. Go for a scholar from the 1800s, or someone familiar with their works.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget to practice getting silent, and shifting your assemblage point into heightened awareness, by looking at colors in the dark. \n\nYou don't want to be all pretend forever, the way religious people are.  Power spot = sacred site, \"I had a dream last night\" = \"Maybe God talked to me in my sleep\", etc.\n\nPretense.  Go for the real thing.  Get silent, move that assemblage point.\n\nI haven\u2019t run into a religion which forbids that.\n\nEdited: three times", "edited": 1562354623.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_esyusou", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &amp;quot;Angel of the LORD&amp;quot; is God himself, in a physical body.

She materialized full size in my bedroom and walked the length of the room.\n\nI don't know if what the guy saw was an Inorganic being, but it sure sounds like one.\n\nHere's some new info I've found on the inorganics. This is NOT verified by anything Carlos wrote.  But the books do hint at it.\n\nThere are probably as many inorganic beings around, as small rodents.  They just live here. Or somewhere that can project their energy to this place.\n\nIf you worry you're delusional when you see or interact with one, don't fear.  Carlos left us instructions for deciding if it's a phantom (in your own mind), or a real inorganic.\n\nThe image of inorganics is generated by you.  Not by them.  And like any dream image (try it out and you'll see), it can't hold shape for long. Because when you stare at it, you see other details, and it mutates to do more of those details. It produces a cascade effect, and if the being is not an actual inorganic, it'll just go away.\n\nIf it's an actual inorganic being, you'll see its \"true form\".\n\nBut it really isn't. It's just what we can perceive of it, if we stop fantasizing.\n\nIt's attracted to our energy. I don't know how.  But if you find one and coax it to stick around, I suspect you'll find that everything it does, as helpful as it is for learning sorcery, is all about it sitting on top of some of your energy.\n\nFortunately, it's typically concentrated energy that you've discarded to the periphery of your luminous shell.  When it finds some, you can spot it, and scoop it back to you.\n\nOr manipulate it.  Manipulating anything from the second attention, while you are silent, will slowly move you deeper into heightened awareness.\n\nThat's our ticket!  You don't actually need a Nagual to move into heightened awareness.\n\nCarlos intended we'd do that with Tensegrity.  The first movement he taught me was Zuleica's movement for tickling the luminous shell. He modified it to be more martial arts like, but it's the same movement.\n\nTrouble is, something went wrong along the way, and the tensegrity doesn't seem to have moved people's assemblage points reliably. Or even so that they notice it enough to get out of their beginner's slumber.\n\nI advise watching inorganics in their \"true form\" often. It's very fun to make them form a pleasing shape, and you will undoubtedly learn a lot that way. They give you something to \"play\" with, in the second attention.  A fun not-doing that's highly motivational.\n\nBut in their true form, you can learn a lot more.  There's a type that's fairly low energy, which looks like dots of color with vague lines connecting them, always in movement or vibrating and rotating.\n\nIf you look at it and wonder how that can change into a face for example, the little dots will spin off pieces of a face.  It's like those dots have awareness, each one, and when you perceive them, there's some feedback and they assume forms you were thinking about.  I suspect its trying to communicate with us, but we're so different, all it can do is spin off your own ideas and expectations.\n\nBut they don't spin off as \"chunks\" of something, the way you'd illustrate in a CGI effect. Each time a piece spins off an actual image, you drift into unconsciousness for an instant, a very tiny instant, and when you notice that, you're looking at a real thing, not just at dots of color in the darkness.\n\nThey're projectionists. They take our energy, and reflect back images.  I'll venture a CRAZY guess here about phantoms, as opposed to Allies.  The Allies have energy.  And your energy reflects back off their energy, to produce the appearance.   Knowing that, the old sorcerers learned to put their energy into the Ally, and project it's image where they wanted.  Carlos wrote that the allies were merely \"shapes propelled by the old sorcerers\".\n\nBut with Phantoms, I speculate that it's the same thing. Except, it's your energy reflecting off the energy at the periphery of your own luminous shell.  If you stare at it, it goes away, because there isn't anything there other than yourself.\n\nIf we keep going, I suspect we'll be up to our ears here, in low energy inorganics.  Find some bright colors, make them brighter, and I'll be surprised if many of you don't start finding inorganics sitting on those puffs of energy. And they don't spook easily, like an actual rodent would if you caught it on your food.\n\nCarlos' Allies are are another thing. Very scary.  And they can push you down to the ground and hold you there, paralyzed.\n\nMy little Fairy can only make unpleasant faces.  On the other hand, when she wants to please me, wow!\n\nNote: There\u2019s a delay between an inorganic absorbing enough of your energy to manifest, and when it does. They seem to be kind of slow to respond to specific ideas, but very fast to respond to actual action.\n\nEdited: three times", "edited": 1562268907.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_esorrsw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;It is very hard for me to replicate exactly what I saw&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s almost exactly what my &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; looked like when she was obsessed with coverings.

He modified it to be more martial arts like, but it&amp;#39;s the same movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, something went wrong along the way, and the tensegrity doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have moved people&amp;#39;s assemblage points reliably. Or even so that they notice it enough to get out of their beginner&amp;#39;s slumber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I advise watching inorganics in their &amp;quot;true form&amp;quot; often. It&amp;#39;s very fun to make them form a pleasing shape, and you will undoubtedly learn a lot that way. They give you something to &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; with, in the second attention.  A fun not-doing that&amp;#39;s highly motivational.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in their true form, you can learn a lot more.  There&amp;#39;s a type that&amp;#39;s fairly low energy, which looks like dots of color with vague lines connecting them, always in movement or vibrating and rotating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at it and wonder how that can change into a face for example, the little dots will spin off pieces of a face.  It&amp;#39;s like those dots have awareness, each one, and when you perceive them, there&amp;#39;s some feedback and they assume forms you were thinking about.  I suspect its trying to communicate with us, but we&amp;#39;re so different, all it can do is spin off your own ideas and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they don&amp;#39;t spin off as &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot; of something, the way you&amp;#39;d illustrate in a CGI effect. Each time a piece spins off an actual image, you drift into unconsciousness for an instant, a very tiny instant, and when you notice that, you&amp;#39;re looking at a real thing, not just at dots of color in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re projectionists. They take our energy, and reflect back images.  I&amp;#39;ll venture a CRAZY guess here about phantoms, as opposed to Allies.  The Allies have energy.  And your energy reflects back off their energy, to produce the appearance.   Knowing that, the old sorcerers learned to put their energy into the Ally, and project it&amp;#39;s image where they wanted.  Carlos wrote that the allies were merely &amp;quot;shapes propelled by the old sorcerers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with Phantoms, I speculate that it&amp;#39;s the same thing. Except, it&amp;#39;s your energy reflecting off the energy at the periphery of your own luminous shell.  If you stare at it, it goes away, because there isn&amp;#39;t anything there other than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we keep going, I suspect we&amp;#39;ll be up to our ears here, in low energy inorganics.  Find some bright colors, make them brighter, and I&amp;#39;ll be surprised if many of you don&amp;#39;t start finding inorganics sitting on those puffs of energy. And they don&amp;#39;t spook easily, like an actual rodent would if you caught it on your food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos&amp;#39; Allies are are another thing. Very scary.  And they can push you down to the ground and hold you there, paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My little Fairy can only make unpleasant faces.  On the other hand, when she wants to please me, wow!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: There\u2019s a delay between an inorganic absorbing enough of your energy to manifest, and when it does. They seem to be kind of slow to respond to specific ideas, but very fast to respond to actual action.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: three times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c8gxzr/paranormal_storytime/esorrsw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1562173141.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_c8gxzr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eso7arp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1562161420.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eso4ylp", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "None of these are my from my own experience.

Coulid be, \"If I shapeshift into a red fish swimming in an ocean of ping pong balls, what can be 'known' to help swim better?\"\n\nThat's Silent Knowledge, if something or someone gives you the answer.\n\nIf you want to know the weirdness of SK (silent knowledge), here's some passages from the first time Carlos demonstrated his ability to summon SK for don Juan.  Carlos asked the same of us in private classes, and I saw a gnat fly up to me and say, \"Hello, my name is Paul\".\n\nCarlos was amused because Felix from private classes, is actually named Paul.\n\nBut he agreed it was seeing.   Just as this bizarre accounting from the books:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan said that I did not have enough power yet to 'see' him. But I could certainly 'see' enough to find myself suitable explanations for what was happening.\n\n\"Don't be bashful,\" he said. \"Tell me exactly what you see.\"\n\nI had a sudden and strange thought very similar to thoughts that usually come to my mind just before falling asleep. It was more than a thought. 'A complete image' would be a better description of it. I saw a tableau containing various personages.\n\nThe one which was directly in front of me was a man sitting behind a window frame. The area beyond the frame was diffuse, but the frame and the man were crystal clear. He was looking at me. Hs head was turned slightly to his left so he was actually looking askance at me. I could see his eyes moving to keep me within focus. He was leaning on the windowsill with his right elbow. His hand was clenched into a fist and his muscles were contracted.\n\nTo the left of the man there was another image in the tableau. It was a flying lion. That is, the head and the mane were those of a lion, but the lower part of its body belonged to a curly white French poodle.\n\nI was about to focus my attention on it, when the man made a smacking sound with his lips and stuck his head and trunk out of the window. His whole body emerged as if something were pushing him. He hung for a moment, grabbing the windowsill with the tips of his fingers as he swung like a pendulum. Then he let go.\n\nI experienced in my own body the sensation of falling. It was not a plummeting down, but a soft descent, and then a cushioned floating. The man was weightless. He remained stationary for a moment and then he went out of sight as if an uncontrollable force had sipped him away through a crack in the tableau. An instant later he was back at the window looking askance at me. His right forearm was resting on the windowsill, only this time his hand was waving good-by to me.\n\nDon Juan's comment was that my 'seeing' was too elaborate.\n\n\"You can do better than that,\" he said. \"You want me to explain what happened. Well I want you to use your seeing to do that. You saw, but you saw crap. That kind of information is useless to a warrior. It would take too long to figure out what's what. Seeing must be direct because a warrior can't use his time to unravel what he himself is seeing. Seeing is seeing because it cuts through all that nonsense.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis story illustrates why don Juan suggested we all become \"Readers of Infinity\", instead of randomly receiving silent knowledge by any presentation method.\n\nThis gets back to \"memory\" also.\n\nIf the method of receiving knowledge during dark room is too bizarre, it's virtually impossible to remember any of it at all.\n\nThat's my delima right now. I learned something about cartoons, and how you can implant phantom beings directly into them.  Place the Allies of Carlos directly into the cartoons, like some sci-fi horror movie where if you watch the video, something comes along to haunt  you.\n\nWe can do that.\n\nBut it's not as simple as just knowing that.  You have to understand the \"how\" of doing something so outrageous.\n\nI had that explained to me in SK mode this morning, but it's lost now.\n\nAnd if it had been in written text, maybe it would be possible to recall it.\n\nBecause I could remember where I was standing in the room.\n\nOr what part of the bed I was sitting on, and which wall was I looking at, when I saw the text.\n\nI could remember how the text was formed. Was it a \"whorl\" with the pomegranate dot?\n\nWas it cold at the time, where I was standing or sitting.\n\nGiven a few more \"clues\" like that, it's likely you can recall more of what happens over in the second attention, so far from this reality.\n\nIt's also possible we can devise some \"memory tricks\".\n\nOur witches could help with that.\n\nWhat they do to grab onto dreams, would likely work to help us remember things we learn, in SK mode.\n\nYou \"force a dream not to end\" by bringing something physical into the mix.\n\nStomp the ground. Grab some dirt and feel it. Spin around. Rub your arms.\n\nI've heard endless tricks among the witches.\n\nBut really, they're all designed to bring a bit of tonal awareness out, to help control the awareness of the double, during dreaming.\n\nWaking or sleeping.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Minx Clothing Test", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"dn4jiuzhxzja1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/1195jbv/asset/dn4jiuzhxzja1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718049683%2CYjc2ZTE1YTRmZGFhNzEwYzc3NjYxNjI1Yjk4NWM0N2MyMTJhMDAwODM3YWMxNjQyNmYzNzFiNjMwYzZjM2QxNg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/1195jbv/asset/dn4jiuzhxzja1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718049683%2CM2Q3MTQ0OGQzNzM5NDI5ODAxNWYzZjEzNGI5OWZkZTE1MjU2ZDc4MzI4NGZiNjQzYTU5Y2UzZmFlZWQyYTkwYg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "dn4jiuzhxzja1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_1195jbv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1677183312.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1677086707.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1195jbv/video/dn4jiuzhxzja1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/1195jbv/video/dn4jiuzhxzja1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m testing whether Minx&amp;#39;s clothes are too tight and where.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It does bring to mind something I saw last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s extremely hard to remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuff that happens out in the purple zone, doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;correlate&amp;quot; to anything here, in the blue zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since we have beginners, let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assume the brain really is just an organic machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in order to remember something, you have to use the machine to &amp;quot;retrieve&amp;quot; the memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that if you want to know &amp;quot;what did you have for lunch last wednesday?&amp;quot;, you have to find more information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did last wednesday stand out in any fashion, so you might be able to remember what you did at lunch?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone important come to visit, and you took them out?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you try out the new hamburger  joint?

The nagual leaves, blows it all up, and everyone starts fighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s rather remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose that makes Reni be like La Gorda?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Cholita like Josefina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; From the time you began to be diligent in your practice (daily for hours), how long did it take you to, A) get silent, and B) get to the purple station?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;50 years?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t take that much time anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just look for the allies on the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t resist!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to be seeing them for real, floating in the air, vivid enough to startle you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means you&amp;#39;re in dreaming. Even if it&amp;#39;s waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then looking from object to object, you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;compelling&amp;quot; them to send a scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s the path for men.  I&amp;#39;m not sure with women, you should ask them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is up to her ears in IOBs, but I have no idea how she got that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos may have left some &amp;quot;strands&amp;quot; of his own awareness with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that the allies would recognize him on her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Turn the body on&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had an opening thrust of the palms at the sides, like knife hands, down to straight and then with some &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot; to the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was done before mashing energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they removed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a huge pity.  The movement &amp;quot;shocks&amp;quot; the energy crusted behind you, loosening it up for the &amp;quot;mashing&amp;quot; part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ll put it back into the cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a green screen and high res web cam, but so far I haven&amp;#39;t set it up to see if I can scan in movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s looking like that website is a total scam.  And they can&amp;#39;t digitize human movements at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t explain their super amazing demos, but when I asked for a file that would scan in, they told me to u se the demos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which are the file, but with the movements in front to show it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;working&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t scan that, and they must know it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVHrRlRYgl8\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVHrRlRYgl8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the company.  I&amp;#39;m starting to think it&amp;#39;s just a big scam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I wanted was one of those videos in that demo, so I could see the software work that well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they didn&amp;#39;t give it to me.  You can see how impossible it would be to extract it.

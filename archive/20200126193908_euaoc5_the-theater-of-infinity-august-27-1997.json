They constructed a series of metaphors to describe this halt, and in their effort to explain it, or reconsider it, they flubbed it. They lapsed into ritual and ceremony.

They believed that if certain ceremonies and rituals were focused on a definite aspect of their magical passes, the magical passes themselves would beckon a specific result.

However, that fixation should be light, funny, void of morbidity and grimness. It should be done for the hell of it, without really expecting returns.\"\n\nHe gave the example of one of his cohorts, a sorcerer by the name of Silvio Manuel, whose delight and predilection was to adapt the magical passes of the sorcerers of ancient times to the steps of his modem dancing.

The girl is mine. Two energy trackers dressed like men where dancing to the song of Michael Jacson (and Paul Mc Cartney?), \"The girl is mine\" and each trying to 'win' to 'his' side the Nagual women, dressed as a sexy chick. Very macho song made very funny by the fact that the two men where women.\n\n3. The Burden of decision making. Two girl are about to leave the house to go to a party. One is trying to see what dress to wear. She takes one and then ask the other girl, is this one nice? what do you think? No matter what the other woman answer the first one is not sure what to do and keep asking, but maybe I should wear this other one. Are you sure you tell me that it is nice because you like it and not because you think I like it..... and it goes on and on and on...\n\n4. Farleys' day. Father and son, Bob Farley and Robert Farley Senior, look the same with some rabbit like teeth and boldness that make them look alike. They are very pathetic, all they talk about is the medicines they take and advice each other which one to take and why.\n\n7. The Marionettes. Two individuals male and female, with theater mask on their faces. they move in a machanical way. they don't talk them selves but you hear a tape that talk for them.

Carlos didn't make it up.  It works.\"\n\nBut that isn't as effective as describing the wonders Tensegrity can produce!\n\nJust don't assume that's what **you'll** see.\n\n\\&gt;The most abstract reason why the magical passes of the sorcerers of my  lineage are magical,\" he went on, \"is that in practicing them, the body  of the practitioner realizes that everything,\n\nMaybe the body, but not the mind.  We've seen that from experience.  100-200 apprentices, all impotent still.  Can anyone in cleargreen stop the world?\n\nI doubt it.  I suspect they don't even believe it all anymore.\n\nI'm not sure why Carlos was so sure the passes were the best way to pass on his knowledge, unless it had something to do with his understanding of women vs. men.\n\nThe women created a lifestyle. The horrors of the perfumes and candles inevitably associated with that give me nightmares everyday. \n\nMy home can be smelled from 2 blocks away, when Cholita hasn't fled. \n\nAnd Cleargreen turned it into a pyramid scheme to make money.\n\nBut, that's a GOOD thing.  Tensegrity is everywhere still!\n\nI just don't know how long it can last, unless the facilitators learn to stop the world.\n\nMaybe only until they can't charge enough people to make it worthwhile?\n\nThey're fickle.\n\n\\&gt; No matter what the other woman answer the first one is not sure what to  do and keep asking, but maybe I should wear this other one.\n\nYea, that's one of the hazards of trying to do what Carlos did.  People who ask questions to get more attention, instead of either making up their own mind, or taking the first piece of advice and trying it.\n\nYou answer their question, then they ask it again. You answer, they ask it again. You realize, they want the interaction, like a noisy guy in your car who chatters on and on, and insists you interact by ending each point with \"what do you think?\"\n\nThe Chinese bosses' son does that, and I've been trying to cure him of it since I like to \"sleep drive\".\n\nBut it's a little hard to say, while driving a car, \"Hey, don't keep waking me up!\"\n\nI know this problem of lonely practitioners well, even from teaching by email.\n\nCarlos created some of his worst enemies, because he had to push them out for fear of spreading this mindset in the group.\n\nLet me say right now: If ANY of you becomes a teacher of sorcery, the events you experience will often repeat the events in Carlos' classes.  And in his books!\n\nI don't know if it's *intent*, or just that the world of the first attention is so limited as to be predictable.\n\nToo bad Robert Marshall isn't aware of this.  What's inevitable from forming a group to teach sorcery, he reports as bad behavior on Carlos' part, perhaps because Robert has a personal motivation behind what he writes.\n\nMaybe he wants to be the man who killed Carlos Castaneda?  Steal his fame?\n\nIt won't work. Carlos was more clever than we all knew.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if another faction shows up one of these years.\n\nI hope they proclaim me an impotent idiot, and proceed to teach with twice as much success as I've had.\n\n(But twice still wouldn't be much.)\n\n\\&gt;They are very pathetic, all they talk about is the medicines they take and advice each other which one to take and why.\n\nAnother hazard of being in Carlos' position.\n\nPlacebo people.  Fussing around, getting attention from each other, virtue signaling with their medications and special diets.

Carlos didn&amp;#39;t make it up.  It works.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that isn&amp;#39;t as effective as describing the wonders Tensegrity can produce!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t assume that&amp;#39;s what &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;#39;ll&lt;/strong&gt; see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;The most abstract reason why the magical passes of the sorcerers of my  lineage are magical,&amp;quot; he went on, &amp;quot;is that in practicing them, the body  of the practitioner realizes that everything,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the body, but not the mind.  We&amp;#39;ve seen that from experience.  100-200 apprentices, all impotent still.  Can anyone in cleargreen stop the world?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt it.  I suspect they don&amp;#39;t even believe it all anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why Carlos was so sure the passes were the best way to pass on his knowledge, unless it had something to do with his understanding of women vs. men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women created a lifestyle. The horrors of the perfumes and candles inevitably associated with that give me nightmares everyday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My home can be smelled from 2 blocks away, when Cholita hasn&amp;#39;t fled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Cleargreen turned it into a pyramid scheme to make money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, that&amp;#39;s a GOOD thing.  Tensegrity is everywhere still!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know how long it can last, unless the facilitators learn to stop the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe only until they can&amp;#39;t charge enough people to make it worthwhile?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re fickle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; No matter what the other woman answer the first one is not sure what to  do and keep asking, but maybe I should wear this other one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yea, that&amp;#39;s one of the hazards of trying to do what Carlos did.  People who ask questions to get more attention, instead of either making up their own mind, or taking the first piece of advice and trying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You answer their question, then they ask it again. You answer, they ask it again. You realize, they want the interaction, like a noisy guy in your car who chatters on and on, and insists you interact by ending each point with &amp;quot;what do you think?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chinese bosses&amp;#39; son does that, and I&amp;#39;ve been trying to cure him of it since I like to &amp;quot;sleep drive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a little hard to say, while driving a car, &amp;quot;Hey, don&amp;#39;t keep waking me up!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this problem of lonely practitioners well, even from teaching by email.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos created some of his worst enemies, because he had to push them out for fear of spreading this mindset in the group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me say right now: If ANY of you becomes a teacher of sorcery, the events you experience will often repeat the events in Carlos&amp;#39; classes.  And in his books!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, or just that the world of the first attention is so limited as to be predictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too bad Robert Marshall isn&amp;#39;t aware of this.  What&amp;#39;s inevitable from forming a group to teach sorcery, he reports as bad behavior on Carlos&amp;#39; part, perhaps because Robert has a personal motivation behind what he writes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe he wants to be the man who killed Carlos Castaneda?  Steal his fame?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t work. Carlos was more clever than we all knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if another faction shows up one of these years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope they proclaim me an impotent idiot, and proceed to teach with twice as much success as I&amp;#39;ve had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(But twice still wouldn&amp;#39;t be much.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;They are very pathetic, all they talk about is the medicines they take and advice each other which one to take and why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another hazard of being in Carlos&amp;#39; position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Placebo people.  Fussing around, getting attention from each other, virtue signaling with their medications and special diets. Denying themselves even a sip of vodka and looking down with disdain on everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe those fall into the &amp;quot;piss&amp;quot; category. They aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;farts&amp;quot;. Maybe one of the other of the 5 personality types Carlos explained?

He did not even look at the bag of groceries that I had brought him. He seemed to have been waiting for me.\r  \n\r  \nWe walked for hours. He did not collect or show me any plants. He did, however, teach me an \u201cappropriate form of walking.\u201d He said that I had to curl my fingers gently as I walked so I would keep my attention on the trail and the surroundings. He claimed that my ordinary way of walking was debilitating and that one should never carry anything in the hands. If things had to be carried one should use a knapsack or any sort of carrying net or shoulder bag. His idea was that by forcing the hands into a specific position one was capable of greater stamina and greater awareness.\r  \n\r  \nI saw no point in arguing and curled my fingers as he had prescribed and kept on walking. My awareness was in no way different, nor was my stamina.\r  \n\r  \nWe started our hike in the morning and we stopped to rest around noon. I was perspiring and tried to drink from my canteen, but he stopped me by saying that it was better to have only a sip of water. He cut some leaves from a small yellowish bush and chewed them. He gave me some and remarked that they were excellent, and if I chewed them slowly my thirst would vanish. It did not, but I was not uncomfortable either.\r  \n\r  \nHe seemed to have read my thoughts and explained that I had not felt the benefits of the \u201cright way of walking\u201d or the benefits of chewing the leaves because I was young and strong and my body did not notice anything because it was a bit stupid.\r  \n\r  \nHe laughed. I was not in a laughing mood and that seemed to amuse him even more. He corrected his previous statement, saying that my body was not really stupid but somehow dormant.\r  \n\r  \n(Tales of Power)\r  \nHe then added that judging by my production in dreaming I must have learned how to stop my internal dialogue at will. I told him that I had.\r  \n\r  \nAt the beginning of our association don Juan had delineated another procedure: walking for long stretches without focusing the eyes on anything. His recommendation had been to not look at anything directly but, by slightly crossing the eyes, to keep a peripheral view of everything that presented itself to the eyes. He had insisted, although I had not understood at the time, that if one kept one\u2019s unfocused eyes at a point just above the horizon, it was possible to notice, at once, everything in almost the total 180-degree range in front of one\u2019s eyes. He had assured me that that exercise was the only way of shutting off the internal dialogue. He used to ask me for reports on my progress, and then he stopped inquiring about it.\r  \n\r  \nI told don Juan that I had practiced the technique for years without noticing any change, but I had expected none anyway. One day, however, I had the shocking realization that I had just walked for about ten minutes without having said a single word to myself.\r  \n\r  \nI mentioned to don Juan that on that occasion I also became cognizant that stopping the internal dialogue involved more than merely curtailing the words I said to myself. My entire thought processes had stopped and I had felt I was practically suspended, floating. A sensation of panic had ensued from that awareness and I had to resume my internal dialogue as an antidote.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ve told you that the internal dialogue is what grounds us,\u201d don Juan said. \u201cThe world is such and such or so and so, only because we talk to ourselves about its being such and such or so and so.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nDon Juan explained that the passageway into the world of sorcerers opens up after the warrior has learned to shut off the internal dialogue.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTo change our idea of the world is the crux of sorcery,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd stopping the internal dialogue is the only way to accomplish it. The rest is just padding. Now you\u2019re in the position to know that nothing of what you\u2019ve seen or done, with the exception of stopping the internal dialogue, could by itself have changed anything in you, or in your idea of the world. The provision is, of course, that that change should not be deranged. Now you can understand why a teacher doesn\u2019t clamp down on his apprentice. That would only breed obsession and morbidity.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIn order to stop the view of the world which one has held since the cradle, it is not enough to just wish or make a resolution. One needs a practical task; that practical task is called the right way of walking. It seems harmless and nonsensical. As everything else which has power in itself or by itself, the right way of walking does not attract attention. You understood it and regarded it, at least for several years, as a curious way of behaving. It didn\u2019t dawn on you until very recently that that was the most effective way to stop your internal dialogue.\u201d\r  \n\u201cHow does the right way of walking stop the internal dialogue?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\u201cWalking in that specific manner saturates the tonal\u201d he said. \u201cIt floods it. You see, the attention of the tonal has to be placed on its creations. In fact, it is that attention that creates the order of the world in the first place; so, the tonal must be attentive to the elements of its world in order to maintain it, and must, above all, uphold the view of the world as internal dialogue.\u201d\r  \nHe said that the right way of walking was a subterfuge. The warrior, first by curling his fingers, drew attention to the arms; and then by looking, without focusing his eyes, at any point directly in front of him on the arc that started at the tip of his feet and ended above the horizon, he literally flooded his tonal with information. The tonal, without its one-to-one relation with the elements of its description, was incapable of talking to itself, and thus one became silent.\r  \nDon Juan explained that the position of the fingers did not matter at all, that the only consideration was to draw attention to the arms by clasping the fingers in various unaccustomed ways, and that the important thing was the manner in which the eyes, by being kept unfocused, detected an enormous number of features of the world without being clear about them. He added that the eyes in that state were capable of picking out details which were too fleeting for normal vision.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \n(The Eagle\u2019s Gift)\r  \n\r  \nThe residue of consciousness, which don Juan called the second attention, was brought into action, or was harnessed, through exercises of not-doing. We thought that the essential aid to dreaming was a state of mental quietness, which don Juan had called \u201cstopping the internal dialogue,\u201d or the \u201cnot doing of talking to oneself.\u201d To teach me how to master it, he used to make me walk for miles with my eyes held fixed and out of focus at a level just above the horizon so as to emphasize the peripheral view. His method was effective on two counts. It allowed me to stop my internal dialogue after years of trying, and it trained my attention. By forcing me to concentrate on the peripheral view, don Juan reinforced my capacity to concentrate for long periods of time on one single activity.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\*", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h6vhghk", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for additional redundancy, the text of the linked page:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE RIGHT WAY OF WALKING AND STOPPING THE INTERNAL DIALOG&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Journey to Ixtlan)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, December 28, 1960&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immediately after I arrived at his house he took me for a walk in the desert chaparral.

If you're practicing darkroom gazing, sooner or later you'll see an extra arm.  And then, it's just a matter of using it to create, \"practical magic\".\n\nLike Sock Puppet Theater. Or the way the little sisters could run around on the walls of a room. Or the way La Gorda learned to fly, by copying the feeling she had in dreams when flying there.\n\nEven Carlos gave us some \"practical magic\", to help us move our assemblage point. If you ignore all the Tensegrity, which is 100% practical magic, there's that puff scooping technique, where you use both hands to compress it into a ball.\n\nThat's a balanced amount of practical magic.  Not enough to hold your assemblage point at that level, so you can further obsess over the ball of light.  For example, if you decided to toss it at the wall and make it explode, you would be interfering with the movement along the J curve.\n\nBut merely compressing it into a ball so you get that \"Wow!\" feeling, doesn't keep you from looking for the next \"Wow!\", outside of your own intentions.\n\nYou have the ball, and that makes you look around for more balls.  And that causes you to notice how they form around you.  Eventually you discover the whitish light on all surfaces. It's a natural progression, which results in pulling the assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nWhich is where you can find yourself an extra arm.\n\nBut what would happen if you removed **all** *intent* from the situation?\n\nChaos.\n\nZuleica almost suggests that, with one of her ways to silence the internal dialogue.  I've been calling it \"daytime gazing\", but it's pretty specific.  You focus your awareness every single second, never going inside to that maddening internal dialogue, or it's fantasies.  All of your awareness is focused on the things around you, looking for \"power\".   But don't get big ideas at first. Power is a warm breeze that swirls around you at just the right moment, and gives you a little shiver.  Power is white dots you can barely make out in the bright sky.  Power is a beautiful advertisement card laying in the dirt and leaves, along the path you walk.  It can even be a little plant which manages to survive in the cracks of sidewalks, the way the \"pineapple plant\" does in LA.  Carlos liked those for their ability to survive anywhere.  The local indians used them as medicine.\n\nAs you engage in daytime gazing, you will indeed gain more power.  But when you return to the darkroom that night, your intent has been altered.    It can lead to some confusing practice sessions.\n\nOne of our darkroom gazers tried some Liberty Caps (strongest shrooms) yesterday, and commented:\n\n\" It was an amazing experience but I came to the conclusion that mushrooms are for mushroom trips and darkroom is for darkrooming. The two don't combine exactly perfectly because one is not the other. Mushroom trip is wild, and in a dark room for sure you\u2019ll see iob\u2019s and go thru amazing journeys. Most of what you know about sober darkrooming goes out the window though. In darkroom, you are the driver at the wheel going on the journey. On mushrooms, they are the driver, and you are just a passenger enjoying the ride. \"\n\nNot quite.\n\nAbsent *intent*, that's what happens.\n\nAnd apparently, setting up the intent of power plants requires elaborate rituals, and a lot of hard work.\n\nBut in the end, you can end up with two Lizards sitting on your shoulder, telling you spooky stories.Summoned by Devil's Weed extracts.\n\nOr with Little Smoke, the ally, visiting you with a vengeance, via a mushroom smoking mixture.\n\nPerhaps the real problem with power plants is, they bring their own *intent*.  But it can be overcome, as long as you don't use them too many times.\n\nI sat up for 4 hours last night, trying to get back to normal darkroom gazing. By the end, I had an apartment building stuck under my right  arm, a meeting hall in my left hand, an intent disturbance I could not finish forming, and John Travolta dancing vaguely in one corner of the room, never quite forming into what you could call an \"intercepted dream\".\n\nAnd Fancy was far too big to play sock puppet, even though she brought her own sock this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Daytime Gazing Side Effects", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"oem0mic2a9461": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oem0mic2a9461.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cafdf56fd1cb59717c9e8c4c5cb19c202f9c5c73"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oem0mic2a9461.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac44b5646efa232809744fb1329788a58423722"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oem0mic2a9461.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77dee111e175abf22b9933b40dfabccb02acfba"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oem0mic2a9461.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f88cefafed028c10ad9381fd22ae9648edabaa2a"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oem0mic2a9461.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c207e51010b77dea6fd98a75ae59227ed8ffe9fd"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oem0mic2a9461.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cddd394a4032f3df65da28a75b22b4fe1ffb765"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oem0mic2a9461.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=853577b95f7dfbacf5401d40500f7241fa359d9a"}, "id": "oem0mic2a9461"}}, "name": "t3_k9x7fm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tjB8WHT6Etp4sktF2HYYM8GxQ3b8AuuqeeRAY19KsGE.jpg", "edited": 1607560808.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607537784.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oem0mic2a9461.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=853577b95f7dfbacf5401d40500f7241fa359d9a\"&gt;Daytime gazing Zuleica&amp;#39;s way greatly increases your power, but it alters intent.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did Pablito get a third arm, with which to attack Carlos?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You ought to know by now!

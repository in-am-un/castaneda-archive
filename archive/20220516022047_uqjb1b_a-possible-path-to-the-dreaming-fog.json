We're traveling down that road with a single dusty headlamp, with dead bugs stuck all over our windshield.\n\nIt's a good thing new people can't get that far.\n\nA favorite trick of new people is to goof off and do no work, then one day they do some work and pick up a negative aspect of it, so they can complain and get attention for \"working hard\".  With a \"defense\" for not working harder, in case anyone figures it out.\n\nThey can lie and say, they don't work harder because the result felt bad!\n\nOr at least, that's the excuse they have ready to go, if you catch them red handed trying to suck up human attention.\n\nFor a one time event they have an excuse ready, even though it's pretty much the only thing that happened to them in months.  And they try to suck up sympathy with their attention.\n\nSympathy sauce on those beginner's pancakes.\n\nThey like to make a \"I have a problem\" post.\n\nWe're damned lucky no one like that can get all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nOut there,  \"*intent*\" really matters.\n\nYou can't drive your dusty car with broken headlights that far out, only to piss in the little magical pond you find there.\n\nI'm hoping we can manufacture some \"playgrounds\" for beginners.\n\nGet them hooked on gaining entry to an easy access phantom realm.\n\nNot beyond our possibilities.", "edited": 1652739602.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i8viby0", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, these are what seems to be a different way the eyes can function.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some are flat patterns, but they&amp;#39;re floating in 3D space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most are sparkles and flecks that fill the air, especially above you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the &amp;quot;moody&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you &amp;quot;clean your link to intent&amp;quot;, you remove things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the book deal mindset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like &amp;quot;expecting the same result as last time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, &amp;quot;wanting to have something cooler happen&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, trying to force what you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those, constitute the &amp;quot;dirty link&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wanting, wishing, hoping, forcing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s intending!

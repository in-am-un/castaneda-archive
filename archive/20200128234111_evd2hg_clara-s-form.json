But once you are inside and have turned around, you should feel light and airy, as if you were floating upward. Exhale sharply as you lunge forward through the opening, then inhale slowly and deeply, filling your lungs completely with the energy from behind that screen.\"\n\nI practiced the pass several times as Clara looked on. But it was as if I were only going through the outward motions; I couldn't feel the energy fibers forming the screen that Clara was talking about. \"You're not pulling the door open hard enough,\" Clara corrected me. \"Use your internal energy, not just your arm muscles. Expel the stale air and pull in your stomach as you lunge forward. Once inside, breathe as many times as you can, but be on the alert. Don't stay longer than you need to.\"\n\nI mustered up all my strength and grabbed the air. Clara stood behind me, held my forearms and gave them a tremendous pull sideways. Instantly I felt as if some sliding doors had opened. Exhaling sharply, I lunged through it, or rather Clara had given me a shove from behind, pushing me forward. I remembered to turn around and breathe deeply, but for a moment I worried that I wouldn't know when to come out. Clara sensed this and told me when to stop breathing and when to step out.\n\n\"As you practice this sorcery pass by yourself,\" Clara said, \"you'll learn to do it perfectly. But be careful. All sorts of things can happen once you go through that opening. Remember, you have to be cautious and at the same time bold.\"\n\n\"How will I know which is which?\" I asked. \n\nClara shrugged. \"For a while, you won't. Unfortunately, prudence comes to us only after we've gotten blasted. She added that cautiousness without cowardice is hinged on our ability to control our internal energy and to divert it into the reserve channels, so that it is available to us when we need it for extraordinary actions. \"With enough internal energy, anything can be accomplished,\" Clara said, \"but we need to store and refine it. So let's both practice some of the sorcery passes you've learned and see if you can be cautious without being cowardly and summon up the shadows' world.\"\n\nI experienced a surge of energy that began as small circles in my stomach. At first I thought it was fear, but my body didn't feel frightened. It was as if an impersonal force, void of desires or sentiment, was stirring inside me, moving from the inside out. As it ascended, my upper back jerked involuntarily.\n\n\"Close your eyes,\" she whispered. \"When your eyes are closed, it's easier to use energy lines that are already there to keep your balance.\"\n\n I shut my eyes and started to move in unison with Clara. I had no trouble following her cues for changing positions, yet I had difficulty in keeping my balance. I knew it was because I was trying too hard to do the movements correctly. It was like the time I had tried walking with my eyes shut, and kept stumbling because I desperately wanted to succeed. But gradually my desire to excel diminished and my body became more limber and subtle. As we kept on moving, I became so relaxed that I felt I had no bones or joints. If I raised my arms overhead, it seemed I could stretch them all the way to the tops of the trees. If I bent my knees and lowered my weight, a surge of energy rushed downward through my feet. I felt I had grown roots. Lines were extending from the soles of my feet deep into the earth, giving me an unprecedented stability. Gradually the boundary between my body and its surroundings dissolved. With every pass I did, my body seemed to melt and merge with the darkness until it began to move and breathe all by itself. \"", "edited": 1580508860.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fg1er47", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART 02&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is one of the most powerful and mysterious of all the sorcery passes.&amp;quot; Clara cautioned. &amp;quot;With it we can open doors to different worlds, provided of course that we have stored a surplus of internal energy and are able to  realize the intent of the pass.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;When you step in,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;your body has to feel rooted, heavy, full of tension. But once you are inside and have turned around, you should feel light and airy, as if you were floating upward.

But it was as if I were only going through the outward motions; I couldn&amp;#39;t feel the energy fibers forming the screen that Clara was talking about. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not pulling the door open hard enough,&amp;quot; Clara corrected me. &amp;quot;Use your internal energy, not just your arm muscles.

Don&amp;#39;t stay longer than you need to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mustered up all my strength and grabbed the air. Clara stood behind me, held my forearms and gave them a tremendous pull sideways. Instantly I felt as if some sliding doors had opened. Exhaling sharply, I lunged through it, or rather Clara had given me a shove from behind, pushing me forward. I remembered to turn around and breathe deeply, but for a moment I worried that I wouldn&amp;#39;t know when to come out. Clara sensed this and told me when to stop breathing and when to step out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As you practice this sorcery pass by yourself,&amp;quot; Clara said, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ll learn to do it perfectly.

You wouldn't think of going without eating or drinking water, would you? The exercises I've taught you are even more important than food and water.\" She said that the movements she was teaching me, whether she called them breaths or sorcery passes, were important because they operate directly on the reserve system, and that the reason they can be called indispensable passes is because they allow added energy to pass into and through our reserve pathways. Then when we are summoned to action, instead of becoming depleted from stress, we become stronger and have surplus energy for extraordinary tasks.\n\n\"Now before we summon the shadows' world, I'll show you two more indispensable sorcery passes which combine breathing and movements.\" she went on. Do them every day and you not only won't get tired or sick, but you'll have plenty of surplus energy for your intending.\" \"This movement is particularly important for you, Taisha, because your lungs are weakened from excessive weeping,\" she said. \"A lifetime of feeling sorry for yourself certainly has taken its toll on your lungs.\"\n\nHer statement jolted me to attention. I watched her bend her knees and ankles and assume a martial art posture called the \"straight horse,\" because it simulates the sitting position of a rider mounted on a horse, with his legs a shoulder's width apart and slightly bowed. The index finger of her left hand was pointed down, while her other fingers were curled at the second joint. As she began to inhale, she gently but forcefully turned her head to the right as far as she could and rotated her left arm at the shoulder joint over her head in a full circle all the way to the back, ending up with the heel of her left arm around her waist to her back and placed her right fist over the back of her left hand, wedging it against her bent left wrist. Using her right fist, she pushed up her left arm along her spinal column, her left elbow bent akimbo, and finished her inhalation. She held her breath for a count of seven, then released the tension on her left arm, lowered it to her tailbone again and rotated it at the shoulder joint straight overhead to the front, ending up with the heel of her left palm resting on her pubis. Simultaneously she brought her right arm around her waist to the front and placed that fist on the back of her left hand, and pushed the left arm up her abdomen as she finished exhaling.\n\n\"Do this movement once with your left arm and again with your right one,\" she said. \"That way you will balance your two sides.\" To demonstrate, she repeated the same movements, alternating arms, and this time turning her head to the left.\"Now you try it, Taisha,\" she said, stepping aside to give me room to circle my arm backward.\n\nI replicated her movements. As I swung my left arm back, I felt a painful tension along the underside of my extended arm, running all the way from my finger to my armpit.\n\n\"Relax and let the breath's energy flow through your arm and out of the tip of your index finger,\" she said. Keep it extended and the other fingers curved. That way you'll release any blockage of energy along the pathways in your arm.\"\n\nThe pain grew even more acute as I pushed my bent arm upward along my back. Clara noticed my pinched expression. \"Don't push too hard,\" she warned, \"or you'll strain your tendons. And round your shoulders a bit more as you push.\" After performing the movement with my right arm, I felt a burning in my thigh muscles from standing with my knees and ankles bent. Even though I stood in the same position every day while practicing kung-fu, my legs seemed to  vibrate as if an electric current were running through them. Clara suggested I stand up and shake my legs a few times to release the tension. Clara emphasized that in this sorcery pass, rotating and pushing the arms up in conjunction with breathing moves energy to the organs in the chest and vitalizes them. It massages deep, underlying centers that rarely are activated. Turning the head massages the glands in the neck and also opens energy passageways to the back of the head. She explained that if awakened and nourished by the energy from breathing, these centers could unravel mysteries beyond anything we can imagine.\n\n\"For the next sorcery pass,\" Clara said, \"stand with your feet together and look straight ahead as if you were facing a door that you are going to open.\" Clara told me to raise my hands to eye level and to curl my fingers as if I were placing them inside the recessed handles of sliding doors that open in  the middle.\n\n\"What you are going to open is a crack in the energy lines of the world,\" she explained. \"Imagine those lines as rigid vertical cords that make a screen in front of you. Now grab a bunch of the fibers and pull them apart with all your might. Pull them apart until the opening is big enough for you to step through.\" \n\nShe told me that once I had made that hole, I should step forward one hundred and eighty degrees counterclockwise to face the direction from which I had come. By my turning in this manner the energy lines I had pushed apart would wrap around me. To return, she said, I had to open the lines again by pulling them apart the same way I had done before, then step out with the right foot and quickly turn one hundred and eighty degrees clockwise as soon as I had taken the step. In this fashion, I would have unwrapped myself and would again be facing the direction in which I had begun the sorcery pass.\n\n(continued in next comment due to character limitations...)", "edited": 1580508711.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fg1eprv", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART 01&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the passage describing this pass from the book &amp;quot;The Sorcerer&amp;#39;s Crossing,&amp;quot; by Taisha Abelar:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;page 124:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s one secret to the breathing and the passes I&amp;#39;ve taught you that makes them invaluable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is that?&amp;quot; I stammered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clara tapped me on the head. &amp;quot;They have to be practiced every day or else they&amp;#39;re worthless.

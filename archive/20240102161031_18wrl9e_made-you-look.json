Which I got to view as a continuous stream for a full half hour last night.\n\nMost was lost around 2AM due to memory problems in heightened awareness.\n\nBut I refrained from stopping to write it all down on purpose, to see if I could now retain most until the next day.\n\nI couldn't.  This is all that's left.\n\nDon Juan seemed to want to \"disturb\" us with his recommendation that we learn to READ silent knowledge, rather than view it.\n\nAs \"Videos in the Sky\".\n\nCarlos made the publication \"Readers of Infinity\" to emphasize that choice as our preferred destination.\n\nNaturally I prefer the \"videos in the sky\" method. As is on the cover of \"Wheel of Time\".\n\nThey might even have an alien Netflix out there in infinity, which you could tune into!\n\nIt would kind of be like noticing all those Asian Sci-Fi shows on Netflix,  which weren't popular enough to translate to english.  But they're available if you'll tolerate subtitles, and if you also crave exotic magic depictions.\n\nSome even managed to get Jet Li to star in them.  As the magical Buddhist wizard battling female Gods who fell in love with mortals.  Violating the Buddha's hierarchy of \"soul perfecting\".\n\nCarlos tried to talk the Eurobuddhists out of that delusion of some higher authority guiding us to \"perfection\", asking the Eurobuddhists  \"Perfect for what??\"\n\nBut could never even get them to stop turning up their noses when he gave them access to private class lectures.\n\nSelf-entitled religious zealots are hopeless. They'll never even look up from their toes, to notice that you're offering them the real thing.  Instead of lame foreign religion.\n\nSo \"videos in the sky\", or \"on the cave walls\" seems natural to me.\n\nI watch streaming media a bit in the evening, ever since Cholita made fun of me for watching cable like an old senile person who wants their viewing well planned and scheduled for them.\n\nThen later in the evening,  in Silent Knowledge I get to watch the adult shows coming from infinity.\n\nBut by telling us that's too confusing and liable to be misinterpreted (the way Yoda warns the Jedi Council that they might have misinterpreted the prophecy about Anakin Skywalker), don Juan gave us some doubt.\n\nSo that when we have ALL the answers of the universe right there, floating in front of ourselves, we don't get a fat head over it.\n\nIt really is true what don Juan told Carlos, about how some day answers would just pour out of him, the way only questions currently did.\n\nThat's Silent Knowledge!\n\nAs someone just pointed out in chat, even the \"chacmools\" (Reni, Nyei, and Kylie) got taken off stage by Carlos once, due to a potential big ego forming from their role on stage at workshops.\n\nSo don Juan added some doubt about our \"greatness\" to keep us searching even after we managed to view Silent Knowledge.\n\nLet me interject here, we aren't boy scouts.\n\nAnd we certainly aren't religious zealots.\n\nBuddhism?  Just a crappy religion.  No \"truth\" in that nonsense. But they do promise magical powers which they never deliver.\n\nSame as Christianity does.  Or Hinduism.  Or Daoism. Or Sufism.\n\nEveryone promises super powers!\n\nBut no one delivers.\n\nWe get sucked in by the self-righteous religious component, which is designed to keep us from seeing the truth.\n\nSo if you're trapped in fake foreign religions pretending you're just learning a magical technology, you're hopeless until you figure it out or get tired of empty promises and switch to something real.\n\nBut the same fate can happen to you if you approach real magic improperly.\n\nIf you try to turn it into \"practical magic\".\n\nPractical magic by definition is some magic you can use, in the real world.\n\nEven our sorcery is divided into 2 schools of thought.\n\nThere's the \"Men of Knowledge\", the kings of practical magic for sale.\n\nAnd the \"Old seers\", who were anything BUT practical.\n\nThey got so impractical that when the Olmec world was invaded around 2500 years ago, they couldn't stand up to the invaders as well as the Men of Knowledge could.\n\nChatGPT disagrees about this being the downfall of the Olmecs, but it's the story we have from don Juan, minus giving us the actual time period or even verifying if it was in fact during Olmec times.\n\nSo regardless of emphasis, that view of history is designed to teach us a lesson.  About practical magic (the Men of Knowledge), versus nerd magic (the old seers).\n\nThere were advantages to both points of view.\n\nAnd likely even in modern times, you can't have real \"seers\" without having even more \"men of knowledge\" types, who have very limited and fairly crummy practical magic.\n\nBut successfully earn a meager living off it by selling aspects to ordinary people, who don't actually have a desire to work hard enough to become seers.\n\nSomething nearly impossible to do, without guidance from previous seers.\n\nAs one of the books said, \"There's no game without the Nagual\".\n\nBut we only had him around a very short time.\n\nUnfortunately for us, our guides are all gone.\n\nSo we're on our own,  only having partially reached the status of \"seer\".\n\nWhich makes us subject to \"practical magic\" desires. The desire to profit from the real magic we uncover.\n\nTo convert some of it into something repeatable, and \"usable\".\n\nBy the way, ALL of the \"Men of Knowledge\" rituals, such as the talking lizards and the mushroom shaped people viewing, are still available to us.\n\nNone can ever be lost!\n\nIn Silent Knowledge, you can not only revive those old magic techniques, but you could even recover the formula to the smoking mixture.\n\nBy simply following a Man of Knowledge as he taught an apprentice to prepare it.  Even don Juan, teaching Carlos.\n\nSo be ready.\n\nEventually someone will have the actual formula to that Mexican Mushroom mixture.\n\nOf course, if you start to use that you'll NEVER become a seer.\n\nYou'll derail yourself into being a twisted \"Man of Knowledge\" type.\n\nWe have to battle those weekly in the subreddit.\n\nAnd when you try to create practical magic from scratch,  or even when you try to recover 4000 year old Olmec magical rituals, all you're really doing is trying to expand the blue line on the J curve.\n\nTo add something new to the ordinary level of reality we've been imprisoned in.\n\nYou're trying to turn magic into the ordinary, so you can gain an advantage from it.\n\nOver other people!\n\nI've noticed that problem with those who were exposed to Sufism from childhood.\n\nThey want to turn real magic into something ordinary they can use to lord it over other people.\n\nAnd that's a risk we all take, if we have the real thing.\n\nThat some of it will look very useful for the river of shit, and we'll put in an effort to \"convert\" it to work up at the blue line on the J curve. To work with your assemblage point up at the shoulders.\n\nBut by telling us that there's only one specific way we ought to be viewing Silent Knowledge, namely as \"Readers of Infinity\", don Juan and Carlos were trying to save us from a fate that couldn't possibly have happened if Carlos had lived.\n\nIf he'd gone on being around us to help.\n\nOr even if Taisha and Florinda had stuck around, or if Carol had actually participated in leading us.\n\nAbsent any actual sorcerers around, we were guaranteed to corrupt ourselves.\n\nIf we even made it to Silent Knowledge at all.\n\nWhich was doubtful.\n\nExcept Carlos released his allies to one private class.\n\nAnd they decided to help us.\n\nOr Carlos left them instructions.\n\nAnd so here we are.  We now have real seers.  Crummy, but at least they're real.\n\nThe Allies love to help you reach Silent Knowledge, before you are able.\n\nBecause they get credit for it.\n\nYou never realize that you moved your own assemblage point, and all they did was to make you look in the \"right direction\".\n\nIf you've ever been taught by the dreaming emissary during darkroom practice, an activity common at the red line level on the J curve where your assemblage point has moved all the way down your back, you had a chance to notice that really what the Allies do, is \"put ideas in your head\".\n\nI'm not sure that even in full on sleeping dreaming they can speak in a real voice and transfer information directly to us, from them.\n\nMaybe some of the real witches we have now will figure that out using womb dreaming techniques.\n\nBut the allies can certainly \"make you look\".\n\nAnd with their super intelligence, they can move your assemblage point just by showing you the right direction to gaze in the flow of feelings and sensations coming from the emanations.\n\nSorcery is very much about where you look.\n\nBut it's in \"depth\" of consciousness, rather than in physical time and space.\n\nSilent knowledge exists at a specific \"depth\".\n\nOver time, as you learn to move your assemblage point and clear out your internal dialogue so that you can focus your awareness without filters, you will very much notice what Silent Knowledge \"feels like\".\n\nAnd that means that even when you aren't in the purple zone along the J curve, where your assemblage point has moved all the way to the bottom and come up again in the front of your luminous shell, to align with that of the energy body, you can still \"notice\" chunks of silent knowledge, coming from the emanations.\n\nSo that even if you are dying of liver cancer as Carlos was, and in extreme pain, you still have access to Silent Knowledge.\n\nEven if you can't fully move your assemblage point to sorcery realms.\n\nSilent Knowledge is ALWAYS there.\n\nBut it's like a tiny soft voice in a gigantic crowd of a noisy Carnival.\n\nYou have to know what to look for.\n\nBut the good news is, once you know what it's \"like\", focusing your attention on it will bring it more into focus.\n\nEven if your assemblage point is still in ordinary realms.\n\nYou just have to learn to ignore all the perceptual noise, and select something specific which has the feeling of Silent Knowledge.\n\nWhich happens automatically if you move your assemblage point there daily, for at least 10 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un2k5f5mi1ac1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0ef31ab646597e9c0afcd9a435b6bffd2bf1442\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

To work with your assemblage point up at the shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by telling us that there&amp;#39;s only one specific way we ought to be viewing Silent Knowledge, namely as &amp;quot;Readers of Infinity&amp;quot;, don Juan and Carlos were trying to save us from a fate that couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have happened if Carlos had lived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;d gone on being around us to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even if Taisha and Florinda had stuck around, or if Carol had actually participated in leading us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absent any actual sorcerers around, we were guaranteed to corrupt ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we even made it to Silent Knowledge at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except Carlos released his allies to one private class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they decided to help us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Carlos left them instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so here we are.  We now have real seers.  Crummy, but at least they&amp;#39;re real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Allies love to help you reach Silent Knowledge, before you are able.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they get credit for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You never realize that you moved your own assemblage point, and all they did was to make you look in the &amp;quot;right direction&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever been taught by the dreaming emissary during darkroom practice, an activity common at the red line level on the J curve where your assemblage point has moved all the way down your back, you had a chance to notice that really what the Allies do, is &amp;quot;put ideas in your head&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure that even in full on sleeping dreaming they can speak in a real voice and transfer information directly to us, from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe some of the real witches we have now will figure that out using womb dreaming techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the allies can certainly &amp;quot;make you look&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with their super intelligence, they can move your assemblage point just by showing you the right direction to gaze in the flow of feelings and sensations coming from the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is very much about where you look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s in &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; of consciousness, rather than in physical time and space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent knowledge exists at a specific &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time, as you learn to move your assemblage point and clear out your internal dialogue so that you can focus your awareness without filters, you will very much notice what Silent Knowledge &amp;quot;feels like&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that means that even when you aren&amp;#39;t in the purple zone along the J curve, where your assemblage point has moved all the way to the bottom and come up again in the front of your luminous shell, to align with that of the energy body, you can still &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; chunks of silent knowledge, coming from the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that even if you are dying of liver cancer as Carlos was, and in extreme pain, you still have access to Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you can&amp;#39;t fully move your assemblage point to sorcery realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge is ALWAYS there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s like a tiny soft voice in a gigantic crowd of a noisy Carnival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to know what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the good news is, once you know what it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;like&amp;quot;, focusing your attention on it will bring it more into focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if your assemblage point is still in ordinary realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to learn to ignore all the perceptual noise, and select something specific which has the feeling of Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which happens automatically if you move your assemblage point there daily, for at least 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

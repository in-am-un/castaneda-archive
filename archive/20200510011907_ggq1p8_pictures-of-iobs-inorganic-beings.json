Only the anger remains.\n\nThat turns into a \u201cmoral\u201d, or a \u201cprinciple\u201d.\n\nAsk yourself, how come you have to say \u201cBless You!\u201d when someone sneezes?\n\nYoung women will even enforce that, if you fail to say it. You\u2019ll get a chewing out for being rude.\n\nThat\u2019s left from the Plague! Not the current plague. The Black Plague.\n\nNo one remembers why you have to say it. You just have to.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with magic. It\u2019s ok to pretend. It\u2019s not ok to do it.\n\nYou\u2019ll be attacked. Some will believe they\u2019re standing up for science. Some for religion.\n\nSome just because it\u2019s nuts, and they \"worry\" about you.\n\nBut it\u2019s all the same.  Hatred of magic.\n\nWait and see! You\u2019ll experience it too. That is, if you can get off your fat butt and practice.\n\nAnother puzzling thing happens when you try to ask someone about their experiences.\n\nYou\u2019ll be explaining something fun, like Fairy (my first IOB), and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Yea man. I can do that too.\u201d\n\nThat warrants investigation!\n\nSo you ask them, \u201cYou mean you can REALLY see beings floating around in darkness?\u201d\n\nAnswer:  \u201cSure. I went to college. I was trained to visualize things. A lot of people do that.\u201d\n\nBut the answer is wrong. No one does that.   Anyone who can goes nuts looking for others who can also, so you can ask for tips.\n\nYou find none.\n\nSo you ask again.\n\nAnd again, you get a strange answer.\n\nYou start to suspect they mean, \u201cimagine\u201d it. Vividly.\n\nBut still only in their mind.\n\nWell, here\u2019s the solution!  Draw them a picture.\n\nI predict you\u2019ll get a new answer: \u201cOh, you mean really see it, like that?  No, of course not. I can\u2019t do that. You sure you\u2019re ok? How long you been seeing those?\u201d\n\nI\u2019d better answer that one. I could see things like this at 5 years old, then got punished by my family and couldn\u2019t see them anymore. And didn't even remember that I'd been able to do that.\n\nIt was only after 50,000 hours of meditation that I restored the ability.\n\nAnd you guys can too!\n\nBut you won\u2019t need 50,000 hours, because you have someone who can do it, telling you what\u2019s important and what\u2019s not.\n\nAs it turns out, what's important is exactly what Carlos told us: The internal dialogue has to go.\n\nIn these photos the brightness of Cholita is about average. Many times she starts out so dim that I feel bad for thinking she\u2019s made a visit.\n\nOther times, she\u2019s so bright I get a tingle up my spine!\n\nIt seems to be purely a function of the position of the assemblage point. \n\nI\u2019ve explained that elsewhere. If you follow my instructions you\u2019ll be able to tell, before she shows up, how bright she\u2019ll be.\n\nIt\u2019s that predictable!\n\nBut you have to learn to move it by yourself!   We don\u2019t have anyone who can push it, except possibly IOBs.\n\nCarol Tiggs suggested, at the last workshop, that ordinary people can move it by pushing on someone's shoulder blade.  And maybe, it isn't only possible with a double being.\n\nWell, Fairy moves mine all the time.  And it's certainly possible to learn to *see.* Once you can do that, just run your palm up the fibers on the luminous shell which seem to lead back to the assemblage point.\n\nYes, we can move each other's assemblage points!\n\nBut my suspicion is, we can't overcome a noisy internal dialogue.  It might take a double being to push it that hard.\n\nI suspect the IOBs taught the old sorcerers everything we have now. The only thing they discovered, was how to interact with the IOBs.  The rest is from them.\n\nEven the existence of the assemblage point.\n\nBut Carlos never said that.  So keep it in the \"emergency inventory\".\n\nFairy appears in many forms.\n\nI don't show her standing on my hand, because it's still beyond my drawing skills.\n\nBut my favorite appearance is \u201cfull size\u201d.  It\u2019s a chilling sight!\n\nAnd she does tend to favor too many clothes, when she\u2019s going out like that.  Just as shown.\n\nMostly she likes to just peek at the action when I'm manipulating colors, and you\u2019ll find her as a tiny floating head around the size of a quarter dollar.\n\nCholita brought Minx home from her last scouting trip.\n\nI guess he\u2019s either from DC or Miami, if IOBs can be said to be from anywhere.\n\nAt any rate, Cholita didn\u2019t have any IOBs of her own before she left.\n\nShe only had the ones she took from me.\n\nWhen she returned she entered the room as you see there, although perhaps 4 times as bright as that copy of Cholita, and she caused Minx to materialize right in front of me, as we both watched.\n\nShe clearly intended to introduce us, and seemed to be a bit proud of herself for adding to our collection.\n\nMinx started with the \u201cI\u2019m going to bite you\u201d look.\n\nI had a very strange reaction.\n\nNone.  Absolutely, none.\n\nIt was odd. No feelings at all, except curiosity.\n\nI was wanting to reach under it, to find the brightness control.\n\nI saw it as a machine!\n\nI guess I\u2019ve been playing with them so long that\u2019s all they are to me now. \u201cWeird science\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of which, Fairy is not against lifting that flowing robe, on occasion.\n\nMinx on the other hand seems to have learned to make machine shapes for me.\n\nIf he couldn\u2019t scare me, I guess he figured he could keep me examining him in awe.\n\nThat\u2019s the least of the machines he\u2019s made for me.  Most are impossible to portray in real space.\n\nThey can't be. And yet, there they are.\n\nSince Minx, Fairy seems interested in toys too.  She offers to produce one in my hand, if I give her enough attention.\n\nI had it half formed last night. A dreaming orb for viewing other worlds.\n\nBut I got trapped in waking abstract dreaming.  Simply ran into a weird energy configuration while gazing, got stuck, and remained there the rest of the night.\n\nAbstract dreaming is in fact worthy of the warning Carlos gave us in private classes.\n\nI believe it's triggered by fatigue, but what I saw last night suggests it has an energetic basis outside of our tiredness.  Something real is involved.\n\nCan IOBs get tired too?\n\nI don\u2019t know, but that little cloud you see is how Minx looked the last time I saw him. He barely had enough energy to float through the door, and into my dark room.\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t raise higher than 2 feet off the ground. He looked really worn out.\n\nA couple of other times, he was a happy little patch of clouds like that, peaceful and bright.  Each cloud very well highlighted.  Not made from vapor however, made from bluish white light.\n\nThat seems to be his \"true form\".\n\nCholita was having a very bad day when he looked that pathetic.\n\nHe must have been trying to help her.  She was shouting at the walls in anger, and smashing things.  She even ripped something large into small pieces.\n\nWhich part of these pictures should you add to your inventory?\n\n\\#1: You can REALLY see them. Please don\u2019t pretend. It won\u2019t help other people if we remain as the pretenders we\u2019ve all been since Carlos died.\n\nPretending is killing his knowledge. We need to do something about that.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a workshop to increase your personal power.\n\nYou need a dark room. That\u2019s all.\n\nAnd personal power isn\u2019t vague.  It's not about saving the planet, or being a sensitive human being.\n\nPersonal Power is when you go into the dark room and fairy rushes out to give you a magical orb to play with.\n\nThat\u2019s power.  When the impossible just happens, and you don't have to sweat your butt off to do it.\n\n\\#2: The brightness is about all that\u2019s important here. Take Cholita, and dim her to 1/8th brightness, and sometimes that\u2019s all you get.  Just barely there.\n\nRemember that, so you don't suffer as I have.\n\nAny suggestion of another dreamer in the room should be taken seriously.  If y8ou see the side of her hair, or a hand, she's there.\n\nEven if it's 90% transparent.\n\nOther times, you have to get out the sunglasses they're so real and bright!\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? \n\nPersonal Power (the position of the assemblage point).\n\n\\#3: IOBs are NOT evil.\n\nGod only knows who started that nonsense. \n\nWait.  Maybe he did through his sorcerer prophets, and Castaneda followers are still suffering from Stockholm syndrome?\n\nMeaning, inclined to see demons everywhere and to believe they have a broad conspiracy going on.\n\nBut in fact, all we have likely comes from them. \n\nDon Juan used them all the time, to teach each of the apprentices. His teacher\u2019s teacher\u2019s teacher even gave his apprentices to the IOBs, to take to their world.\n\nOur lineage is swimming in IOBs, and we like it that way.\n\nForget the idea that they\u2019re evil. \n\nThat\u2019s almost surely \u201csour grapes\u201d.\n\nMeaning, if you can\u2019t do it, say it\u2019s bad. \n\nThat way you can tell your \"apprentices\" at your workshops,  \u201cI\u2019m not inept. I just choose not to keep inorganic beings because their evil.  Otherwise, I'd be happy to show you some real magic.\u201d\n\n\"At the next $1200 workshop that is.\"\n\n\\#4: There\u2019s probably no fixed shape for IOBs, meaning, if I can get Cholita to be more sane, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019ll see exactly the same thing I see, even if we are sitting right next to each other.\n\nCertainly, \\*intent\\* could cause that. But we\u2019d likely have to make a special effort, and what\u2019s the point?\n\nYou can do that with a dreaming world. \n\nNo reason to be confusing the IOBs with such concerns.\n\nBut they do seem to be \u201csticky\u201d.\n\nThat means, they can hold some of the *intent* of past owners, and you can end up seeing at least a little of what they used to look like, to someone else.\n\nCholita has rubbed off on Fairy, since Fairy spends most time over with her.  Cholita is idle all day long, and hallucinates very easily.\n\nOne last thing: That picture shows how to intercept dreams.\n\nDid you miss it?\n\nThe tiny little dots, next to the &gt;  ...\n\nIntercepting dreams is the fastest way to learn about *intent*.\n\nPerhaps, *Intent* is best manipulated with \"single mindedness\".\n\nI have no idea what the Zen folks mean by that.\n\nBut in perfect silence you have no agendas.  Everything just \"is\".  And if you want to do something, it's the only thing on your mind.  You aren't thinking about 100 other things, in your fussy mind.\n\nAs a result, your ability to summon *intent* is perfect.  \n\nMaybe the way to \"clean your connecting link to *intent*\" is with perfect silence all the time.\n\nEdited three times\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Pictures of IOBs (Inorganic Beings)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"lbqb5w27ytx41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lbqb5w27ytx41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c59853f50c746f5733affe24c6edadf5a2f707"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lbqb5w27ytx41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a27dcf409d80d3a8841c2321745e1b7f45c930"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lbqb5w27ytx41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df8f4dbf6dd13f0f1fc56636ee6e2fd09af25419"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lbqb5w27ytx41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dc535c1f23bd8f75bd49fe7b4163ee009b9b39d"}], "s": {"y": 605, "x": 908, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lbqb5w27ytx41.jpg?width=908&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe716ea98dee04387f4397bbeb5a6ce257cef8bb"}, "id": "lbqb5w27ytx41"}}, "name": "t3_ggq1p8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ItmhIQsJ-_pnl47b6hNMFMzdKww2GeH9bW4K3qL9IdA.jpg", "edited": 1589127250.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1589066347.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lbqb5w27ytx41.jpg?width=908&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fe716ea98dee04387f4397bbeb5a6ce257cef8bb\"&gt;Some of my Best Friends!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world of Magic is so used to pretending, it\u2019s hard to ask a simple question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic is \u201cOK\u201d if it\u2019s fake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you join the Aleister Crowley society and parade around nude at coven meetings, that\u2019s fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re sitting around in your Buddha underwear, practicing weird meditation visualization,  that\u2019s also ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever turns you on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you actually DO magic, that\u2019s not ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figure, it\u2019s left over from the 1600s when the Dutch started all the witch burning nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People all over western society sought out, tortured, burnt, and generally tried to wipe out witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what has that to do with today?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time, stuff that\u2019s clear when it happens, is forgotten.

No feelings at all, except curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was wanting to reach under it, to find the brightness control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw it as a machine!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I\u2019ve been playing with them so long that\u2019s all they are to me now. \u201cWeird science\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, Fairy is not against lifting that flowing robe, on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx on the other hand seems to have learned to make machine shapes for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he couldn\u2019t scare me, I guess he figured he could keep me examining him in awe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the least of the machines he\u2019s made for me.  Most are impossible to portray in real space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t be. And yet, there they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since Minx, Fairy seems interested in toys too.  She offers to produce one in my hand, if I give her enough attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had it half formed last night. A dreaming orb for viewing other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I got trapped in waking abstract dreaming.  Simply ran into a weird energy configuration while gazing, got stuck, and remained there the rest of the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abstract dreaming is in fact worthy of the warning Carlos gave us in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe it&amp;#39;s triggered by fatigue, but what I saw last night suggests it has an energetic basis outside of our tiredness.  Something real is involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can IOBs get tired too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know, but that little cloud you see is how Minx looked the last time I saw him. He barely had enough energy to float through the door, and into my dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he couldn\u2019t raise higher than 2 feet off the ground. He looked really worn out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of other times, he was a happy little patch of clouds like that, peaceful and bright.  Each cloud very well highlighted.  Not made from vapor however, made from bluish white light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That seems to be his &amp;quot;true form&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was having a very bad day when he looked that pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He must have been trying to help her.  She was shouting at the walls in anger, and smashing things.  She even ripped something large into small pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which part of these pictures should you add to your inventory?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#1: You can REALLY see them. Please don\u2019t pretend. It won\u2019t help other people if we remain as the pretenders we\u2019ve all been since Carlos died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretending is killing his knowledge. We need to do something about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don\u2019t need a workshop to increase your personal power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need a dark room. That\u2019s all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And personal power isn\u2019t vague.  It&amp;#39;s not about saving the planet, or being a sensitive human being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal Power is when you go into the dark room and fairy rushes out to give you a magical orb to play with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s power.  When the impossible just happens, and you don&amp;#39;t have to sweat your butt off to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#2: The brightness is about all that\u2019s important here. Take Cholita, and dim her to 1/8th brightness, and sometimes that\u2019s all you get.  Just barely there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that, so you don&amp;#39;t suffer as I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestion of another dreamer in the room should be taken seriously.  If y8ou see the side of her hair, or a hand, she&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if it&amp;#39;s 90% transparent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other times, you have to get out the sunglasses they&amp;#39;re so real and bright!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s the difference? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal Power (the position of the assemblage point).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#3: IOBs are NOT evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God only knows who started that nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait.  Maybe he did through his sorcerer prophets, and Castaneda followers are still suffering from Stockholm syndrome?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, inclined to see demons everywhere and to believe they have a broad conspiracy going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, all we have likely comes from them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan used them all the time, to teach each of the apprentices. His teacher\u2019s teacher\u2019s teacher even gave his apprentices to the IOBs, to take to their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our lineage is swimming in IOBs, and we like it that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget the idea that they\u2019re evil. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s almost surely \u201csour grapes\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, if you can\u2019t do it, say it\u2019s bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That way you can tell your &amp;quot;apprentices&amp;quot; at your workshops,  \u201cI\u2019m not inept. I just choose not to keep inorganic beings because their evil.  Otherwise, I&amp;#39;d be happy to show you some real magic.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At the next $1200 workshop that is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#4: There\u2019s probably no fixed shape for IOBs, meaning, if I can get Cholita to be more sane, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019ll see exactly the same thing I see, even if we are sitting right next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly, *intent* could cause that. But we\u2019d likely have to make a special effort, and what\u2019s the point?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do that with a dreaming world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No reason to be confusing the IOBs with such concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do seem to be \u201csticky\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, they can hold some of the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of past owners, and you can end up seeing at least a little of what they used to look like, to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has rubbed off on Fairy, since Fairy spends most time over with her.  Cholita is idle all day long, and hallucinates very easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One last thing: That picture shows how to intercept dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you miss it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tiny little dots, next to the &amp;gt;  ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intercepting dreams is the fastest way to learn about &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; is best manipulated with &amp;quot;single mindedness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the Zen folks mean by that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in perfect silence you have no agendas.  Everything just &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;.  And if you want to do something, it&amp;#39;s the only thing on your mind.  You aren&amp;#39;t thinking about 100 other things, in your fussy mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, your ability to summon &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is perfect.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the way to &amp;quot;clean your connecting link to &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; is with perfect silence all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow":

Upon noticing it, it silently rose into the air vertically, straight up, until I could no longer see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know of no 2-foot furry flying creatures, native to the northeastern USA or elsewhere, that can fly from the ground 50 ft. + straight up into the air, without a sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An inorganic reflecting those two mentioned running cognitive threads in my &amp;quot;buffer&amp;quot; is a clear and understandable rationale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I had been ruminating on UFO&amp;#39;s or Out of Place Artifacts, I&amp;#39;m sure I would have instead seen a dimly glowing 2-foot metallic sphere float silently up into the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of the sorcerer&amp;#39;s explanation, there is much confusion. We swim in wonder &amp;amp; mystery, but not confusion; at least nowhere near that of the average man or woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null,

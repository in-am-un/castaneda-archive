Or \"tales of power\".\n\nBut I couldn't.  Because  in order to remember them, I had to retain Silent Knowledge mode.  And if I tried to write in that mode, I got more.  Knowledge continued to flow, but with typing it in as the \"topic\".\n\nAnd how to convince the audience as a specific aspect of that topic.\n\nIt became impossible to fit within normal reddit word limits.\n\nSo I gave up.\n\nI suppose I'm going to revert to a technique Carlos came to in the end.  For telling us stuff.\n\nHe did it when he \"ran out of time\".\n\nJust stating \"energetic facts\".\n\nWithout worrying too much about justifying or explaining the fine details.\n\nFirst, sorcery is \"the master of *intent*\".\n\nIt is **not** a bizarre drug experience you can brag about to your friends.\n\nThere's no boy scout merit badges in real sorcery.  If you can pop a pill and pretend you made it to \"profound visions of the universe rivaling all spiritual systems\", that's not sorcery at all.\n\nThat's just more residents of the river of shit misrepresenting pretend magic as something else and then feeding off the social approval in discussion groups, to finish the process of deluding themselves into thinking they can find a \"shortcut to greatness\".\n\nNot much different than the fake astral travel situation.\n\nWe are NOT after druglike experiences.\n\nInstead we try to get similar things, but without the drugs.  It's the \"without\" part that determines if we can actually learn any sorcery.\n\nIn learning to produce those \"without\" power plant assistance, we tap into the *intent* of the old seers.\n\nThat's PRECISELY what they did!  Started out  using power plants, who knows how long ago. Perhaps 15,000 years.\n\nBut over time some of them learned to ***see***.  And that's when \"seers\" were born. As opposed to \"shamans\".\n\nIf we think we can take the latest cool kids drug and practice magic that way, we tap into the *intent* of the old \"men of knowledge\" who were closer to shamans and were NOT sorcerers.\n\nJust look around!  All of shamanism in Native American populations these days, REQUIRES drugs.\n\nThe idea you could do without those, infuriates them.\n\nThe \"Men of Knowledge\" were such pests, the Olmec government had to control them.\n\nBut we're trying to learn, \"the mastery of *intent*\", which is best learned when it becomes fully visible, flowing on the emanations.\n\nA sight no \"man of knowledge\" could ever see.\n\nDarkroom leads to that direct perception of \"*intent*\" flowing across the emanations, to help you reskim reality in the manner you were trying for.\n\nThat's why sorcerers announce their *intent* up front.\n\nThe way Kylie introduced herself at her first workshop, explaining that Kylie Lundahl was actually created by the witches, who were **dreaming her** into a new being.\n\nShe needed a \"container\" in which intent could store the desired results.  So she created Kylie Lundahl.\n\nIf you gaze out, *intent* can be seen flowing across the emanations as a separate \"smoke\".  Or glow.\n\nPandora's box was a joke created by Carlos, because it distracts us from what it really is.\n\nAn attempt to see \"the flux\" of the emanations.\n\nBut we get distracted by the potential results, which can manifest something right in your face.\n\nIn a given reality the force of intent has selected which emanations it will use.  Carlos called it \"skimming\" to let us know, it only uses the smallest portion of those \"on top\".\n\nIntent doesn't \"ladle\" the emanations.  Stick the huge deep spoon randomly down into the soup of the dark sea in the middle of the pot, and pull it up to see how many shrimp or chunks of meat  you get at random,  versus how much unwanted broth and filler vegetables.\n\nIt's not like that!\n\nThe \"server\", which is *intent*, skims off only what's most obvious on the top of the pot of soup.\n\nIt's a very limited set of skimmings for the average person.\n\nAlways the same \"slag\" floating to the top for people stuck in the river of shit.\n\nSorcerers try to change what floats to the top any way they can.  And my analogy doesn't work now, because you'd have to assume \"floats to the top in a real world pot of soup\", could be controlled by not shaking the serving table, or by not playing the music so loudly.\n\nI suppose it might, but not enough.  In our case, we do try not to shake things unless we need to, and we do try to turn the music down.  Our internal dialogue.\n\nAnd it does in fact \"change what's on top\", resulting in new skimmings being served up.\n\nBut there's something else missing.  Knowledge of how to change what the server himself does.\n\nWe need to learn to control what's in front of the server, in the \"slag\" on top, but also to understand how the server makes his choices on \"where\" to skim in the pot of soup.\n\nHe could skim near the edge, in the center, or maybe even dip down another half inch.\n\nThe server partly decides based on your facial expressions.  When he starts to scoop the soup closest to you in the pot, and you frown and shake your head slightly \"oh no\", he might move the spoon as far away from you as possible,  to the other side of the pot, where you seemed to have  your eyes focused on that floating dumpling.\n\nThat's \"intent\" himself!  The server.\n\nYou CAN influence his skimmings.\n\nAnd THAT'S sorcery.\n\nIt has nothing to do with flashy drug highs. Anyone obsessed with attention seeking from others, will fail to ever learn sorcery.\n\nThat's just river of shit thinking.\n\nTensegrity forms done for a specific purpose are like Kylie announcing her *intent* upfront.\n\nAs Carlos insisted you must always do.\n\nIf you look at my first post in this subreddit, it's also the first thing I did.\n\nCarlos drilled it into us.\n\nIt creates a \"container\" for *intent*, in which it can store.\n\nIf you have no container, than you are wasting your efforts!\n\nThe same can be learned from a tensegrity form.\n\nI created  my own \"series of forms\" to produce a very specific phantom room.\n\nDream Bubble Station.\n\nAs I get better at it, the tensegrity forms themselves show my own \"intent\" for what is \"good progress\".\n\nI like one specific form because it creates a good visible purple haze in the air.\n\nThe next to create intense enough puffs for Pandora's Box to compress them.\n\nThe next form, to make sparkles really easy to generate in the air.\n\nThey \"add up\" to allow me to form bubbles with visible dreams in them, which can be tossed through the air, and you can watch them go down my \"tunnel\".\n\nWhich is an actual physical object. A very dim LED attached to the wall near the floor, in direct \"line of sight\" with a specific location in South America.\n\nSo there's a \"real\" anchor, and then my tensegrity forms \"weave\" magic around that point in space.\n\nNone of that really matters to learning sorcery...\n\nIt just makes a great \"story\" to brag about on reddit, and that's what all of the magic subreddits are obsessed with.\n\nTrying to impress each other, and misrepresenting what's going on to be whatever the latest \"hip kid\" obsession is.\n\nThe hippies were trying to use drugs,  ala the books of Carlos, to copy what Maharishi was teaching with meditation, which required too much work and time for impatient young people.\n\nThey never did.  But a lot of bad men got famous off that.\n\nIt turned out in the long run, they never really cared about that anyway.\n\nBecause here it is, in this subreddit.  The actual goal of the entire hippy movement, fulfilled.\n\nBut none of the hippies has noticed!\n\nThey were only seeking attention.\n\nIn our case, we're trying to learn \"how\", and while learning the how of it, we notice that we get help.\n\nFrom outside.\n\nSo the amazing \"stunt\" of building bubble Station, while it might make a good \"tall tale\" to share on reddit, is really about the extreme difficulty of repeating sorcery experiences reliably.\n\nOf learning to do \"practical magic\".\n\nAs you train your tensegrity form to help a specific magic goal, you will eventually see the emanations.\n\nWhat's happening with those.\n\nIt's an **inevitable** sight, as the assemblage point moves to the end of  the J curve.\n\nInevitable, because your obsession is going to linger as your assemblage point moves into alignment with the second attention's assemblage point.\n\nAnd in answer to your obsession, far out in Silent Knowledge territory, a sea of fibers of white and yellowish light vibrating against each other will become visible.\n\nSo you can \"see\" what the intersections mean, in the current reality you are perceiving.\n\nThere's your \"aching knees\" over there by the north wall of your dark room.\n\nThat little flicker of yellow sparks, next to the emanations that seem a little too pinkish.\n\nIt's a \"damaged spot\" in the emanations.  You can SEE it right there!\n\nSilent Knowledge causes you to \"***know***\" what those mean, and also that it's possible to \"tweak\" them.\n\nAnd actually alter reality.  Perhaps even make your knees well again.  But if not you can certainly reduce the negative effects for that practice session.  By directly manipulating the emanations.\n\nWhich become visible, if you create a tensegrity container in which to store \"announced intent\".\n\nMine, to create Bubble Station.\n\nBut that's still not what sorcery really is.\n\nSorcery isn't just seeing the amazing light show in darkness, using your tensegrity form.\n\nIt's not even having \"Dream Bubble Station\" fully materialize, in amazing detail.\n\nI just saw that myself!  I couldn't believe it.  Yes, you can in fact turn each magical pass into a phantom reality creator.\n\nBut easier with 4 passes.  4 sets.  Trying to do that with just one, is a tall order.\n\nWhen you can do the passes and get the  druglike vision to impress people with, that's only a \"measurement\". It's not a goal.\n\nThat astounding sight will move your assemblage point faster, and lead to seeing the emanations themselves.\n\nBecause it moves the assemblage point where they become visible.\n\nYou'll then be looking at the emanations now glowing, out of all the ones that \"might have\".\n\nYou are looking at \"stored *intent*\".\n\nIt's how your current reality was directed to form by *intent*.\n\nAnd you'll have silent knowledge to tell you \"what's what\".\n\nBut it's STILL not sorcery.\n\nSorcery is watching that intent flow into your structure. Not **what** flowed, but ***how*** it flowed.\n\nYou don't get to see that with the successes.\n\nIt's not visible in the final big druglike impressive vision you can brag about.\n\nIt's not even present in the supernatural vision you get of the emanations themselves, at the fundamental levels of reality.\n\nSorcery is watching **how** it forms.  And how it mutates in response to \"new intent\".\n\nIt's visible when you watch those emanations vibrating against each other, creating your reality, but then you notice a \"wave\" headed towards them.\n\nThe wave is NOT your own awareness, vibrating in the emanations.\n\nIt's from outside.\n\nSomething completely outside your luminous egg, blew glowing smoke at it.\n\nAnd which emanations were now visible for your own awareness to flow into, and vibrate, changed.\n\nYou'll literally see entire patches that were glowing and vibrating, fade away.  And new \"bundles\" will emerge, into which your awareness flows instead.\n\nAnd reality around you changes.\n\nIf you were at \"Dream Bubble Station\" as a result of your tensegrity pass, the \"Lost and Found\" suddenly becomes visible.\n\nClearly!\n\nIt emerges from the phantom room you had, as an \"addition\" given to you from outside.\n\nI watched that happen last night, and it gave me goosebumps.\n\nIt was as if the Eagle itself were saying, \"Hey, you forgot the lost and found!  Remember?  Here it is!  I liked that part of the story!!!\"\n\nIt came into being only because you had \"intended\" that in the past, perhaps even by simply stating it out loud.\n\nBut something out there, some vast **sentience** remembered.\n\nAnd \"gifted you\".\n\nThat's sorcery.  Right there.\n\nLearning to notice and manipulate that specific thing.\n\nBut the best way to do that, is to make **friends** with the Eagle.\n\nTo join **his** audience.\n\nAnd enjoy the stories together.\n\nTHAT'S perhaps the real truth of sorcery.\n\nDare I say it?\n\nWe can become \"assistants\" to the Eagle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[An \\\\\"Ancient Seer\\\\\"?

When he starts to scoop the soup closest to you in the pot, and you frown and shake your head slightly &amp;quot;oh no&amp;quot;, he might move the spoon as far away from you as possible,  to the other side of the pot, where you seemed to have  your eyes focused on that floating dumpling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; himself!  The server.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You CAN influence his skimmings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And THAT&amp;#39;S sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has nothing to do with flashy drug highs. Anyone obsessed with attention seeking from others, will fail to ever learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just river of shit thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity forms done for a specific purpose are like Kylie announcing her &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; upfront.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Carlos insisted you must always do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at my first post in this subreddit, it&amp;#39;s also the first thing I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos drilled it into us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It creates a &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; for &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, in which it can store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have no container, than you are wasting your efforts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same can be learned from a tensegrity form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I created  my own &amp;quot;series of forms&amp;quot; to produce a very specific phantom room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dream Bubble Station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I get better at it, the tensegrity forms themselves show my own &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; for what is &amp;quot;good progress&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like one specific form because it creates a good visible purple haze in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next to create intense enough puffs for Pandora&amp;#39;s Box to compress them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next form, to make sparkles really easy to generate in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &amp;quot;add up&amp;quot; to allow me to form bubbles with visible dreams in them, which can be tossed through the air, and you can watch them go down my &amp;quot;tunnel&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is an actual physical object. A very dim LED attached to the wall near the floor, in direct &amp;quot;line of sight&amp;quot; with a specific location in South America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; anchor, and then my tensegrity forms &amp;quot;weave&amp;quot; magic around that point in space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of that really matters to learning sorcery...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just makes a great &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; to brag about on reddit, and that&amp;#39;s what all of the magic subreddits are obsessed with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to impress each other, and misrepresenting what&amp;#39;s going on to be whatever the latest &amp;quot;hip kid&amp;quot; obsession is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hippies were trying to use drugs,  ala the books of Carlos, to copy what Maharishi was teaching with meditation, which required too much work and time for impatient young people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never did.  But a lot of bad men got famous off that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turned out in the long run, they never really cared about that anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because here it is, in this subreddit.  The actual goal of the entire hippy movement, fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But none of the hippies has noticed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were only seeking attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our case, we&amp;#39;re trying to learn &amp;quot;how&amp;quot;, and while learning the how of it, we notice that we get help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the amazing &amp;quot;stunt&amp;quot; of building bubble Station, while it might make a good &amp;quot;tall tale&amp;quot; to share on reddit, is really about the extreme difficulty of repeating sorcery experiences reliably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of learning to do &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you train your tensegrity form to help a specific magic goal, you will eventually see the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s happening with those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an &lt;strong&gt;inevitable&lt;/strong&gt; sight, as the assemblage point moves to the end of  the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inevitable, because your obsession is going to linger as your assemblage point moves into alignment with the second attention&amp;#39;s assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in answer to your obsession, far out in Silent Knowledge territory, a sea of fibers of white and yellowish light vibrating against each other will become visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; what the intersections mean, in the current reality you are perceiving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s your &amp;quot;aching knees&amp;quot; over there by the north wall of your dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That little flicker of yellow sparks, next to the emanations that seem a little too pinkish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;damaged spot&amp;quot; in the emanations.  You can SEE it right there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge causes you to &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; what those mean, and also that it&amp;#39;s possible to &amp;quot;tweak&amp;quot; them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And actually alter reality.  Perhaps even make your knees well again.  But if not you can certainly reduce the negative effects for that practice session.  By directly manipulating the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which become visible, if you create a tensegrity container in which to store &amp;quot;announced intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mine, to create Bubble Station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s still not what sorcery really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery isn&amp;#39;t just seeing the amazing light show in darkness, using your tensegrity form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not even having &amp;quot;Dream Bubble Station&amp;quot; fully materialize, in amazing detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just saw that myself!  I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it.  Yes, you can in fact turn each magical pass into a phantom reality creator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But easier with 4 passes.  4 sets.  Trying to do that with just one, is a tall order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can do the passes and get the  druglike vision to impress people with, that&amp;#39;s only a &amp;quot;measurement&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s not a goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That astounding sight will move your assemblage point faster, and lead to seeing the emanations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it moves the assemblage point where they become visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll then be looking at the emanations now glowing, out of all the ones that &amp;quot;might have&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are looking at &amp;quot;stored &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how your current reality was directed to form by &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll have silent knowledge to tell you &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s what&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s STILL not sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is watching that intent flow into your structure. Not &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; flowed, but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it flowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t get to see that with the successes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not visible in the final big druglike impressive vision you can brag about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not even present in the supernatural vision you get of the emanations themselves, at the fundamental levels of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is watching &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; it forms.  And how it mutates in response to &amp;quot;new intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s visible when you watch those emanations vibrating against each other, creating your reality, but then you notice a &amp;quot;wave&amp;quot; headed towards them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wave is NOT your own awareness, vibrating in the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s from outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something completely outside your luminous egg, blew glowing smoke at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And which emanations were now visible for your own awareness to flow into, and vibrate, changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll literally see entire patches that were glowing and vibrating, fade away.  And new &amp;quot;bundles&amp;quot; will emerge, into which your awareness flows instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And reality around you changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were at &amp;quot;Dream Bubble Station&amp;quot; as a result of your tensegrity pass, the &amp;quot;Lost and Found&amp;quot; suddenly becomes visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It emerges from the phantom room you had, as an &amp;quot;addition&amp;quot; given to you from outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched that happen last night, and it gave me goosebumps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was as if the Eagle itself were saying, &amp;quot;Hey, you forgot the lost and found!  Remember?  Here it is!  I liked that part of the story!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It came into being only because you had &amp;quot;intended&amp;quot; that in the past, perhaps even by simply stating it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something out there, some vast &lt;strong&gt;sentience&lt;/strong&gt; remembered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;gifted you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s sorcery.  Right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learning to notice and manipulate that specific thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the best way to do that, is to make &lt;strong&gt;friends&lt;/strong&gt; with the Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To join &lt;strong&gt;his&lt;/strong&gt; audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And enjoy the stories together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S perhaps the real truth of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dare I say it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can become &amp;quot;assistants&amp;quot; to the Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ce704jsnx5c91.png?width=540&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a8cbd35199c42cc0ac540f2baca27daa39928bda\"&gt;An \\&amp;quot;Ancient Seer\\&amp;quot;?

Go find the passages that tell where to put it if you want to do a very good job, but at the least place it on your torso, rub it on your legs above the knees, and scoop it into  your throat (V spot).\n\nYou want to make your body glow.\n\nThe energy is all around you in a bubble about 16 feet in diameter, so reach as far out as you can when scooping.\n\nIf you gaze intensely, you can see the outer shell as a spray of fine dots of pink, orange, and yellow. But it's sort of \"thick\", so a precise boundary is not usually visible.  \n\nIOBs can manifest more easily on puffs of light.  Those same puffs you put onto your torso.\n\nThey can scrape up a little flurry of lights when there's no clear puffs, but an intense purple or pink puff is best to locate your first IOB. Gaze into it, expecting a face. If you see a puff that has no details at all, just put it on your torso and look for another.\n\nJust seeing those puffs visually, \"compels\" the inorganic beings to send a scout.\n\nAccording to don Juan. \n\nSo, build up that \"body of light\".  In the process, you'll summon inorganic beings.\n\nOnce you can glance down while standing up straight and see a body made of light, you can start the wiggle fingers thing.\n\nWiggling is vast enterprise.\n\nAnd there's a flaw in our understanding of it.  For old timers, Josefina just swished into her colors, meaning, she transformed into her energy body with no effort or hard work.\n\nLa Gorda had to remain around doing a long process with Zuleica.\n\nCarlos was told to go straight for the wiggling, because he noticed something, and Zuleica decided to take advantage.\n\nSo, we don't really know what's appropriate for us.\n\nBut the Tensegrity is all about building that energy body.\n\nSo don't get too obsessed with the wiggling. In my opinion, doing a little at the start is a good way to get the puffs to brighten up.  But in fact, until you have built that energy body by receploying energy around you, wiggling is probably inappropriate.\n\nUnless you want to go that direction and specialize in \"wigglery\".\n\nBut there's also another way you can go in the darkroom.  Mystery showed it to me last night.\n\nI can't recall the name, but it's essentially continuous puffery.  \"Scrapery\"?\n\nYou don't look around for a precise puff, the way  it's shown in the unbending intent long form here:\n\n  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\nCarlos made a big deal out of the searching they do around 5:22.\n\nHowever, according to Mystery (yes, they can talk when they start teaching) that's a waste of precious time.\n\nKeep scooping, never stop, pull it towards the center like you were trying to gather a huge quilt in towards you, standing in the middle.\n\nIf you see a brighter area, go there next, but never stop the flowing movement of the arms.\n\n\"Mashing energy\" helps take care of the lower body.  You don't even have to use your hand, the \"dust' lights up your lower legs.\n\nThe light has a certain \"persistence\", so grabbing a puff between other movements does not produce the same dramatic results as never stopping.\n\nMyself, I recommend sticking with what the Tensegrity does, because it has the intent of Carlos  built into it.\n\nIf while doing that you see a lot of light, and want to look past that to the whitish lines on the walls, you might revert to \"scrapery\".  To clear the air.  But otherwise, best to copy Carlos.\n\nYou never know what inorganic beings have in mind with their \"advice\".\n\nFancy, my other inorganic being, insists we have no body, and it would be more profitable to redeploy the energy into a spot in front of you, to build a \"snowman\".

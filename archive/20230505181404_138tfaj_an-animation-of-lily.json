There's a lot of flaws.\n\nAnd I'm not actually an artist.  If you saw my paintings you'd realize they're simply photorealistic.\n\nWhich anyone who does oil painting knows, is totally cheating.\n\nMy goal was to dream a scene on the blank canvas, and paint over it to make it visible to everyone.\n\nBut photorealistic is now IDEAL for modern animations.\n\nOne thing I learned doing oil painting is, nothing is ever finished.\n\nYou just finally give up in disgust.\n\nExcept Cholita.  She loves finishing as much as she loves creating her visual spells. Which should never be underestimated.\n\nJust ask the neighborhood wild life.  It's not good to piss off Cholita.\n\nShe imprisoned a blue jay in our fireplace,  placed a mummified sparrow in the large fountain I got her so it would spin in the water flow as a warning to others, and took care of the neighbor's orange cat that was in a war with her.\n\nAll without obviously touching anything I suspect.  The only thing she did that I can pinpoint, is comment that it was good if I put those anti-algae tablets into the water in the fountain, in response to me warning her it might make the birds sick.\n\nShe just said, \"Good!\"\n\nI still don't know how the blue jay got into the fire place behind the iron grating.\n\nAlong with a picture of me as a child which she found in the garage,  placing it in there nearly buried in black ashes.\n\nI left that there.\n\nNever touch a witch's spells! That might be the trigger.\n\nSound ludicrous?\n\nDid you read all of the books?  Look for \"corn kernel magic\".\n\nIt's EXACTLY how some witches do spells.  \n\nTraces of the emanations are altered by that action of touching the kernel, which can result in \"re skimming\" later on.\n\nThe inorganic beings have the same rule. Don't steal from the IOB world! To them that possibly means, they can keep you along with their property you took.\n\nBut I was happy to let the blue jay out.\n\nTook a while to convince the traumatized bird it was ok to fly out the open side door into Cholita's garden.\n\nThis week I found she'd increased the spells in the back yard a few days ago, when it looked like she'd managed to permanently blow an electrical box fuse.\n\nCholita is hard on electrical stuff. I had to buy an outlet tester, just so I could make sure the bathroom outlet still had power for her hair dryer each day.\n\nSo I was out there in the backyard at the electrical box on the back of the house three days ago, and noticed her spell additions.\n\nAnd that she'd beaten the nice large clay bowl of ranunculus flowers I got for her to a pulp.\n\nBut then, she left \"a few\" of them that were the shape she likes.  They're doing fine now.\n\nAnyway, this is Lily.  An inorganic being.\n\nWe believe she belonged to Mad Prophet. Her ally is named \"Ren\", which means Lily in Japanese.\n\nBeginners:  Despite the \"superman effect\" where everyone new to sorcery believes sorcerers are all knowing and never make mistakes, the truth is when it comes to the Allies you can't really tell who's who at our level.\n\nThey simply don't come with nametags.\n\nLily showed up like this, to the left of me, while I was sitting up on the bed on pillows gazing into the whitish light you can see on surfaces when you move your assemblage point to the orange zone.\n\nYou gaze at the whitish light looking for \"disturbances\".\n\nCarlos would have said, you are looking for \"energy\".\n\nIf you do that, you'll soon learn that energy comes in too many forms to limit them when searching. You have to be open to anything you detect.\n\nOne form is a \"pull\".\n\nYou feel a pull in a certain direction, and after getting over the initial response of \"That's just me imagining stuff\" you turn your head that direction and see what's really there.\n\nLily was there a year or two ago.  To the left, and slightly down. Any other angle of the head would not have \"found\" her.\n\nBut don't pretend that!  You'll mess it up.  Your \"double\" will know where and when to look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lily showing off](https://preview.redd.it/x7rukwdoj1ya1.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b36bb969a2a74ab37f6ca3e11b956cc14e5c363)\n\nThat picture of course, was my \"recreation\" of the scene.\n\nBut very close!\n\nI got the impression at the time, that Lily likes the cenotes of the old Olmec seers.  Created when an asteroid hit there, and wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nSo I tried to copy Lily in my animation software.\n\nAnd my goal this morning was just to test out some \"PopcornFX\" special effects I purchased, hoping to find something useful for \"puffs\".\n\nThe purple puffs are very hard to recreate, but I hope to get them down well enough that an experience darkroomer can look at them in an animation and determine where on the J curve that might happen.\n\nI suppose we'll know the animations are working when Google's \"spell check\" doesn't underline the word \"darkroomer\" as an error.\n\nWhen enough use that word so that google adds it to the common dictionary.\n\nLily spoke to me saying she was going to \"teach me to leave the darkroom\".\n\nNaturally I didn't understand she was referring to \"shrinking the tonal\".\n\nThe same happened with my Ally \"Fancy\", who said she was going to teach me \"Sliding Dreaming\".\n\nTurns out, she meant how to slide the assemblage point horizontally at a given depth, to make things more real.\n\nIt's possible that the Allies created darkroom, and will continue to help us perfect it!\n\nBeginners:   This is how real stuff gets!\n\nSo maybe when I say \"Asian Crap Magic\", you might consider if perhaps that's an accurate description of Buddhism, Daoism, Hinduism, Kabbalah, and \"Magick\"?\n\nAll of those are just pretending, built on bad dreamlike visions had during closed eye meditation when it manages to move your assemblage point down a few inches.\n\nA very shallow movement, but one that does produce visions and bliss and \"cosmic consciousness\".\n\nA con artist Yogi type will have a few such lame visions, greatly exaggerate their importance as the \"Fire Kasina\" text did for the Buddha, and then start their own religion so they can cash in.\n\nNo one who has real magic will charge you for it!\n\nThat's an abomination.\n\nNot to mention, it's too much damned actual work to learn real magic!\n\nYou can't charge people money to practice \"dark room\".  You'll go out of business fast.\n\nThus my \"abomination\" remark.  Anyone motivated by money, can't be honest with their followers.\n\nWe can't even get most to try darkroom for free!\n\nBut hopefully by showing the Dr. Strange level rewards we might increase how many actually learn to do this themselves.\n\nDid I mention this is done wide awake, completely sober, eyes open, and in the course of doing Tensegrity movements to move the assemblage point and bring out your energy body?\n\nIf enough learn this it might make it easier for future people to learn.\n\nThat's how sorcery works!\n\nWe do, what people in the past did.  Pulled by their latent glow of awareness, in realms of reality that would otherwise be completely phantom.\n\nWithout the old seers we couldn't much of this at all. There would literally be \"no place\" to go in the second attention.\n\nIs this video an exaggeration?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nIn fact, it's not nearly as vivid and cool as the real thing was.  When I learned this for real from Lily, that sparkle you see was actually the stars above my ceiling, twinkling invitingly to get me to notice places I could leap to.\n\nI just don't have any \"twinkling stars\" videos to use.  I might have to use screen capture and an astrologer's star map program to make one myself.\n\nBut Lily left after she finished teaching me.\n\nI believe it was 5 lessons total over 3-6 months.\n\nSomeday I'll have to go back and try to find those old Lily posts, so I can recreate them all.\n\nChatGPT claims, if I can learn how to add a \"thumbnail\" to my animations reddit will put that up on the post as the picture you see in the list of posts that day.\n\nReddit doesn't seem to be able to read into a video, and pick a scene with more activity than the start of most videos has.  The way youtube can.\n\nBut I'm not being offered thumbnails in my animation software.\n\nIf anyone knows an easy way to get reddit to put up a picture instead of being blank, I'd love to hear about it.\n\nInstagram lets you choose from the timeline when you post there.\n\nThe problem is, if you post a link to youtube, they'll put up the picture youtube used as the still shot on the post.\n\nBut if you point to youtube, then the video isn't actually stored in reddit, and that post can go bad if the youtube channel is gone or censored by Youtube.\n\nMy comments on the videos on youtube are \"ify\".  One day youtube might decide I'm involved in \"religious hate\".\n\nIt's maddening trying to bring back real magic!\n\nThe world hates it so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "An Animation Of Lily!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"q4m8cnz7f1ya1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/138tfaj/asset/q4m8cnz7f1ya1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718050045%2CMDYzOWI4MWJkNTg0ZDc1ODViM2NmNzU1ODI0ZTRiODM2ZDQ0ZmUyOWQ4ZjliNjFjNzA5N2IxMTYzZjhhOTA0Zg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1080, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/138tfaj/asset/q4m8cnz7f1ya1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718050045%2CNWY4NjhiZDVkMTFhZGYxMGZhMTM5ZTYzYTk4NjUwNjBlOTc4NzMyNWEwY2FlMWEyNmIyZGQ4YjUyZDg4ZGExZQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "q4m8cnz7f1ya1", "isGif": false}, "x7rukwdoj1ya1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 75, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x7rukwdoj1ya1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=796fe266ba4c70ff9c0e503bd66ce0363f3a65f7"}, {"y": 150, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x7rukwdoj1ya1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a25108f34a48c31062550f80eb3fc792ae1dc733"}, {"y": 223, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x7rukwdoj1ya1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d373fd438ea9008529b34ee25154e3558b2b611d"}], "s": {"y": 251, "x": 360, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x7rukwdoj1ya1.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b36bb969a2a74ab37f6ca3e11b956cc14e5c363"}, "id": "x7rukwdoj1ya1"}}, "name": "t3_138tfaj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1683314870.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1683303244.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/138tfaj/video/q4m8cnz7f1ya1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/138tfaj/video/q4m8cnz7f1ya1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, as an &amp;quot;artist&amp;quot; I apologize for this animation.

If you read all of the books you'll remember that Zuleica was the one who taught \"darkroom\" to the apprentices.\n\nLa Gorda and Josefina were together, in fuzzy pajamas that Zuleica said stimulate the calves with soft fur, and make it easier to do the things she wanted to teach them.\n\nI must admit to always wearing ski socks during darkroom.  But I have wooden floors.\n\nSocks won't work on carpet.  For doing Tensegrity that is.\n\nJosefina not only found colors in darkness immediately, but she switched over to her double and zipped right into the \"colors\".  Like a portal.\n\nDon't worry, you get to do that too!\n\nThat's what this post is about.  How to do that.\n\nFrom a male point of view.  For women, you do it if you can see how. And if you can't, you'll figure out something even better.\n\nAs long as you seriously try.\n\nSo Josefina learned fast.  But La Gorda did not.  And it describes how it took her long to master what Zuleica wanted to teach her, about finding colors in darkness.\n\nCarlos too apparently, because he mentions \"We eventually did find colors in darkness...\"\n\nOr something depressing like that.\n\nBut forget all that.  Let's assume that you not only found colors, but have moved your assemblage point far along the J curve, and are familiar with the sights.\n\nYou know the green zone.  Where bliss makes you feel \"enlightened\".\n\nIt's stonerville.   Where you get so high, you think you're having \"profound\" thoughts.  You're enlightened!   And you're \"never coming down!\"\n\nThen there's the red zone, which is clearly \"evil\".  You've obviously rejected \"enlightenment\" in favor of absolute power.  You start to see that maybe Darth Vader was having more fun than Luke. And perhaps you can bring back the empire!\n\nShape shifting, manufactured realities to play in with your spirit friend who may not have the same long term goals you have, but is perfectly willing to \"groom you\" for what he likes to do.\n\nAnd shared dreaming galore!\n\nThe problem with that is, there's so few of  us.\n\nSo you'll just have to look for someone down there.   In the red zone.  Hijack a neighbor's dream and scare the bejesus out of them.   You'll find them in the puffs.  Form your ally into a scary demon, and send him in as an \"experiment\" in how well your neighbor, who keeps complaining about your lawn, responds to fright.\n\nIt's the red zone!  The old seers did far worse down there.\n\nDid I mention it was \"evil\"?\n\nBut we don't want to get trapped down there.\n\nConsider it to be like a visit to an opium den.  Just for research of course...\n\nYou can't stand to spend more than 3 days in the opium den.\n\nIf you stay longer than that, you may get stuck forever.\n\nIt's like being addicted to heroine.\n\nSo you tough it up, and keep forcing deeper silence.  That's the only thing that will allow you to leave the red zone.  Much deeper silence, and you have to ignore the naked asian women the opium den supplies, for you to stare at.\n\nThey really did do that. I have an office in a chinese country.  Where a \"plague\" of gambling broke out once, involving some \"flower game\".   It was so bad, men were selling their daughters to get money to keep gambling.\n\nThat would be \"Formosa\" back then I suppose.  A very obsessive people, the chinese can be.\n\nWhen you make it past the red zone, there's a significant breath change.\n\nBut only significant at first.  Later that becomes mostly your normal breath, so you no longer notice.\n\nJuann suggests there are several breath changes along the J curve, and that would be consistent with what Carlos said about it.\n\nBut the most obvious change in your breathing,  is when the assemblage point changes sides on the body.\n\nThat puts it only a few feet away from the assemblage point of our magical double.\n\nThe guy running around in dreams at night.\n\nYou think he's not real, but you're in for a surprise.\n\nHe's just been \"out of town\", since you stopped sleepwalking as a child.\n\nWhen he decides to come home, you'll get the shock of your life.\n\nHe's real.\n\nOr she's real.\n\nAnd even better, you don't have to decide what sex it has to be.\n\nZuleica preferred to be Emilito most of the time.\n\nCholita likes to be 20 years younger.\n\nOn the other side of the J curve, when the assemblage point is in the front, you're bathed in whitish light.\n\nInstead of hellish scenes on the walls of your darkroom making it appear that  a lava cave got invaded by puffs of glowing purple whipped cream, which can even swirl with jet blackness and intense yellow mixed in, you're now bathed in a boring \"whitish light\" on surfaces.\n\nI suppose mystics might confuse it for \"the light of God\".\n\nAnd have!\n\nYou don't have to pretend that stuff, it'll be puzzlingly vivid.\n\nAnd even \"textured\", once you learn to gaze at it more closely.\n\nThose textures form on the walls of your darkroom, and even on the furniture.  Or on the quilt covering your bed. I suggest keeping your bed made and clear of stuff on top of it, during darkroom if you are using your bedroom.  A nice \"flat surface\" can be used for remote viewing.\n\nOn the bed, you can slide your hand over the textured whitish light, to see if it responds.\n\nYes, you can in fact make it change with your hands!\n\nBut it doesn't behave like anything you know.\n\nIf there's a \"cool technique\" regarding the whitish light, it's translocation bubbles.\n\nRemote viewing.\n\nTranslocation means you are located here in your darkroom, but you are viewing \"over there\".\n\nYou're in 2 places at the same time!\n\nAnd if you can get over the show biz aspect, and stop thinking about that book deal and how you'll be as famous as don Juan and everyone will love you, you might try to \"pin it down\".\n\nFigure out if you are here, or over there.\n\nIn the course of doing that, you get \"offers\".\n\nFor example, the first time  you are kind of \"orange zoning out\".\n\nYou did everything right, and were doing Tensegrity all the way to this point.\n\nBut your limited number of Tensegrity forms ends here. It gets you this far, and no further.\n\nBut that's ok!  The orange zone is amazing.\n\nLater you can add another tensegrity form, to take you the rest of the way.\n\nFor now, in the orange zone, you sit up on pillows on the bed to enjoy it.\n\nAll around you is a whitish light on surfaces.\n\nYou can see the room!\n\nDon't get too excited though.\n\nIt's a room all right.  But not YOUR room.\n\nIt's the beginnings of a \"phantom room\".\n\nA very important topic in sorcery. In fact, you might say that all sorcery really is, is finding the door to the phantom room of the old seers.\n\nCholita was the first to make one of those in our home.  There was an \"accident\" involving an Ally, with both me and Cholita witnessing it together, and the energy of three beings focused on a dreaming event made it real enough to repeat.  She created a split in reality.  A stable one.\n\nA lingering glow in specific emanations, which could be \"found again\" if you had gotten a glimpse of it before.\n\nAnd being like Josefina, Cholita just \"swished\" into it.  With her ally for company.\n\nBut that's another story.  Her phantom room was just our living room and her little garden paradise out the door from there.  At first.\n\nNow a year or two later it spreads all the way to Los Angeles, 40 miles away.\n\nSo the phantom room of the old seers, working together to expand it for thousands of years, is more like a phantom jungle world spanning hundreds of miles on the east coast of Mexico.  In cenote territory.\n\nBut we still need to find the entrance.\n\nAnd the whitish light makes \"entrances\" visible.\n\nAll sorts.\n\nTypical is that you stopped your tensegrity routine when you noticed you could see the room in the dark, sat up on the bed, and the change from activity to relative stillness changed everything.\n\nYou can now \"blank out\".\n\nIf you \"blank out\" up in the green zone, you lose awareness.\n\nBut if you blank out in the orange zone, you do not.\n\nYou change realities.  With varying amounts of \"through the veil\" forgetfulness at first.\n\nSo in the orange zone, gazing at the whitish light to figure out if that's really your room, when it seems to have  an extra wall over there, you try to get even more silent.\n\nBecause you keep thinking thoughts, and the extra wall vanishes before you can figure out if that's \"real\".\n\nThen at one point you realize you were staring at a painting on that \"extra wall\". It's a small break in your \"continuity\".\n\nYou get a little surge of excitement, and figure out you are now in a 1950s style living room.\n\nWith doilies on the couch arms!  High tech victorian era devices.\n\nWhy did we ever give up putting doilies on the arms of furniture, so we could wash them and always have a clean place to rest our arm?\n\nIt's barbaric!\n\nCholita makes her own.\n\nI have no idea what for, but once I came home to find her sewing, took the risk to go see what, and it was a doily.\n\nI never did find out why.  It was probably designed for a ritual to bring me bad luck.  And it was important for me to see for myself that she went to the trouble to make an actual \"Doily\".\n\nPart of her spells much of the time, require the victim to see it in progress.\n\nSo in the orange zone, you can easily end up in \"Doily Land\".\n\nBut once you've fully translocated like that, you get greedy.\n\nYou realize that full on translocation scenes come in infinite variety.\n\nYou can find that your bed has been transported to ancient tree groves in Cambodia. Surrounded by those \"Raider's of the Lost Ark\" style ancient temple structures that have roots growing through the doorways.\n\nOr you can find yourself on the top of a cliff in France, with a gentle fishermen's harbor to your right, but the raging waters of shipwreck cove to the left of you, threatening to knock you off the cliff with giant waves.\n\nFor real. Awake.  We don't go to sleep and make up stuff about our dreams!\n\nDon't forget to ask the fishermen to toss you up a big tuna!\n\nThey will.  Right into your bed.\n\nBut not often enough.\n\nIn fact, it takes such perfect silence to get there, that each time screws it up for a full week.\n\nYour mind gets so greedy, you can't repeat it.\n\nSo you try to figure out how you can learn to repeat such things, and you discover \"dream bubbles\".\n\nThey aren't like staring in a movie, the way full translocation scenes can be.  And full waking dreams, burn off dreaming attention too fast.\n\nDream bubbles do not.  Those are more like looking into one of those old fashioned movie viewing machines from just when movies were invented, and watching a section of a silent movie through a little eyepiece.\n\nFor a penny.   Big money back then, but it was a \"high tech wonder\".\n\nAnd like all new high tech things, used mostly to see naked women.\n\nThe book deal potential is greatly reduced with dream bubble penny arcade machines,  and you learn that while you can't repeat the sights of a specific dream bubble, you can learn to reliably \"find them\" in the air.\n\nAnd keep them open for business!\n\nI've had as many as 4 dream bubbles in the air at once, each one keeping its own unique scene active.\n\nBut not all at once.  You have to turn your head to where you know that one is floating, and then you can see if it's still got time left on your penny.\n\nYou can't look in 4 of those old movie arcade machines at once.  But like real dream bubbles, two people can gaze into the same lens.\n\nOnce you discover \"dream bubbles\", you'll be endlessly entertained and your inorganic being friend will want to join in.\n\nShe'll show up and offer to teach you how to enter them.\n\nHow to swish inside, like Josefina!\n\nBut if you're worried about doing that, just get her to rest on your hand, and insert her first.   Gently.\n\nTell her to \"report back\" while you watch the scene.\n\nShe will in fact take on a part in what you are viewing, and you can even narrate it out loud.\n\nI'd stay away from having her die in terrible accidents.  They don't mind, but they do \"get revenge\".\n\nTry a romance story.\n\nAnd when you finally get up the nerve, she'll give you access to the dream bubbles yourself.\n\nLet you find one in the air and \"zip\" right into it.\n\nStanding right there, in a fully real looking world, with all of your sobriety intact.\n\nBut don't stay longer than 5 seconds or your tonal rationality will burn off, and you'll just find yourself waking up in the morning, not knowing how you got into bed.\n\nTry zipping in and out of bubbles 5 times.  Just \"turn your head\" back once you get inside, and seek out a new one in the second attention fog of your dark room.\n\nI'll be interested to hear if anyone can do all 5 before \"something weird happens\".\n\nYou could have gotten to this key point in darkroom, in the red zone alone.\n\nBut do try to blow through that red light district part of town, to get to the nice orange section.\n\nIt's been gentrified.\n\nWhat's that \"key point\" I mentioned?\n\nWhere you are genuinely doing \"investigations\" of real supernatural phenomena!\n\nStuff no one will believe, when they find out you aren't sitting like a lame closed eye meditation guru, making up stuff about the few times you dozed off and the results seemed like a magical event.\n\nWhere you latch onto a single vision, probably just a crappy nightmare, and try to cash in with it.\n\nThe way famous hindu gurus always do.\n\nMaharishi once had  vision of a giant caterpillar crushing the earth through strangulation.\n\nSo he announced his amazing seership, and ordered his followers to gather 7000 to meditate in a big dome, to save the world.\n\nAt $1500 a piece entry fee.\n\nSorcery is NOT like that.\n\nYou have endless visions each day.   You aren't trying to come up with a fundraising excuse.\n\nIt's real magic. And just in case you forgot, it's done with the eyes open, walking around!\n\nDAILY.\n\nYou arrive at this \"key point\" when it all gets very real, each time you practice.\n\nIt's like traveling into a new wilderness to learn more about the amazing vistas and wildlife there.\n\nIt's real exploration.\n\nIn the dark.  All alone.\n\nYou literally travel outside your darkroom.\n\nWith your eyes open, fully awake, and completely sober.  And so reliable, it's like going to your car to take a short trip to the mountains.\n\nThat's the part I wanted to explain here.\n\nThat a well designed tensegrity collection, is like a vehicle.\n\nIt really is!\n\nAt first you're bored out of your mind, trying to learn darkroom.\n\nYou get into the car, but don't know how to turn the key to start the engine.\n\nYou think the car will autostart, because of your hidden greatness.\n\nBut it doesn't, and you have to figure out how to put the key into the slot, and start the engine.\n\nSilence and tensegrity in darkness does that.\n\nBut the silence can't be skipped, so if it's not working that's your problem.\n\nYou need to be more honest, and look closer at your mind.\n\nInstead of glossing to ignore all the chatter so you can pretend to be silent.\n\nWhen you learn how to drive down the highway daily,  you eventually come to the final destination.  Silent Knowledge.\n\nAgain, by developing so much deeper silence that the dream bubbles are now infinite.\n\nThere isn't just 4 in the room, through your intense hard efforts to hold them there long enough to explore each for a few seconds.\n\nInstead, the \"being\" that zipped into them, when you believed it was you,  now feels comfortable enough to fully join you during your practices.\n\nYour double.\n\nHere's when you arrive at the \"purple station\".\n\nWhere there are thousands of dream bubbles all around you.  Anywhere you gaze, a tiny dream bubble appears. And if you keep watching it expand, you can literally find yourself standing inside it.  Because you, and  your double, are sharing the same assemblage point position.\n\nNot having to \"zip\" at all to enter dreams.  You just walk into them.  Or let them surround you.\n\nSee the cover of \"Wheel of Time\".  That's what happens.\n\nBut other things can happen.\n\nDon Juan warned us of that.\n\nThere are just too many things that can happen.\n\nSo he recommended reading text.\n\nI won't go into that, but there are \"tips\" for summoning text.  Maybe I'll animate it when I feel confident it's universal.  It could just be a side effect of Carlos describing how to do it, rather than that's the main way.\n\nYou get to take your pick of \"Silent Knowledge Presentation Method\" when you are fully experienced with the purple zone on the J curve.\n\nSo make that the goal of your series of tensegrity forms.  To summon your chosen presentation method for silent knowledge.\n\nYou can modify it later.\n\nBut we're trying to amuse \"The Spirit\" here.\n\nDid I forget to mention that?\n\nYou have an audience.\n\nIf you're stuck up at the green zone, the audience will be bored.  The spirit will notice, but it won't feel inclined to encourage you to get stuck in there because you get too many ego stroking rewards of bliss and minor visions up there.\n\nCholita could show you what you're really stroking, up there in \"Enlightened Master\" range on the J curve.\n\nIt's really from the deep red zone and onward, that \"the spirit\" becomes very interested in your progress.\n\nAnd as \"intent\" stores into the forms you do in sequence, so that each \"cool thing\" you discovered along the way reliably shows up at the correct moment in the tensegrity forms, it's very much like you are driving down the road.\n\nThe spirit likes that.\n\nYou pass the health food market.  The green zone.\n\nStill far from having arrived.\n\nThere's the McDonalds, the red zone.\n\nOn to the orange zone, as you pass the 7-11 and those wonderfully foamy frozen ice crystal \"slurpees\" that come in so  many sugary flavors.\n\nYou're almost at your destination.\n\nAnd the spirit likes that!\n\nIt created us to probe the dark sea of awareness, to see how living beings \"felt\" about it's creation.\n\nBut you get to decide what the destination is.\n\nAnd it doesn't have to be the same forever.\n\nJust keep trying to go to the  same destination daily, using your combination of passes and the help of the spirit,  until you can reliably do a \"perfect run\".\n\nAt that point, you'll get suggestions from the spirit itself for new destinations it would like you to probe.\n\nYou are then \"already given to the power that rules your fate\".\n\nBecause it's a lot cooler than anything else humans do.  By far.\n\nAnd whatever destination you choose, keep this in mind.\n\nIt's a \"Silent Knowledge Presentation Method\".\n\nThe series of tensegrity forms, is merely a way to summon a particular SKPM.\n\nSilent knowledge presentation method.\n\nIn my case, a perfect run causes a magical object,  a \"proto-dream bubble\", to float down from the ceiling and hover right where I can grab it, like a sluggish helium balloon waiting for you to take hold of it on each side before it blows away.\n\nThe final tensegrity form ends, with my hands able to pluck a magical object from the air.\n\nFully stable, in full color, and vivid in ever way.\n\nI just do whatever I like with it.\n\nThe spirit likes that!\n\nA grand finale, Spielberg style!\n\nWith Goosebumps even.\n\nI can gently push it to move forward, and it breaks apart and drizzles down, forming my phantom realm for me.\n\nI used to have to do that piece by piece.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Touring The J Curve", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"03j6osuxd81a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 135, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/03j6osuxd81a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c2c9f5350b27f9373e143789f6c2fc2eeb046c2"}, {"y": 270, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/03j6osuxd81a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c41e4bd3f694864ba99ec49463ffd4952a606a9"}, {"y": 400, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/03j6osuxd81a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2fb2b74ab5842af7391b33f7665bbbcd9cd93f"}, {"y": 800, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/03j6osuxd81a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=888af1fd37780e357b111e9f407b3443db1e89d2"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 819, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/03j6osuxd81a1.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8730b45dcff96cc00ade78da7aa223a9e805f544"}, "id": "03j6osuxd81a1"}}, "name": "t3_z0qto6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fmP5CuHT1DOXciH0DXiLyPDQ6o2Ds62pBo0tl0MwWkk.jpg", "edited": 1669066559.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1669009389.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/03j6osuxd81a1.png?width=819&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8730b45dcff96cc00ade78da7aa223a9e805f544\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/03j6osuxd81a1.png?width=819&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8730b45dcff96cc00ade78da7aa223a9e805f544&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose there&amp;#39;s value to not posting advanced stuff in this subreddit, but it&amp;#39;s also obvious that not doing so leads to confusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beginners stuff is very simple. If you read all of the books you&amp;#39;ll remember that Zuleica was the one who taught &amp;quot;darkroom&amp;quot; to the apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda and Josefina were together, in fuzzy pajamas that Zuleica said stimulate the calves with soft fur, and make it easier to do the things she wanted to teach them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must admit to always wearing ski socks during darkroom.  But I have wooden floors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Socks won&amp;#39;t work on carpet.  For doing Tensegrity that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Josefina not only found colors in darkness immediately, but she switched over to her double and zipped right into the &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot;.  Like a portal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry, you get to do that too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what this post is about.  How to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a male point of view.  For women, you do it if you can see how. And if you can&amp;#39;t, you&amp;#39;ll figure out something even better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as you seriously try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Josefina learned fast.  But La Gorda did not.  And it describes how it took her long to master what Zuleica wanted to teach her, about finding colors in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos too apparently, because he mentions &amp;quot;We eventually did find colors in darkness...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or something depressing like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But forget all that.  Let&amp;#39;s assume that you not only found colors, but have moved your assemblage point far along the J curve, and are familiar with the sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know the green zone.  Where bliss makes you feel &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s stonerville.   Where you get so high, you think you&amp;#39;re having &amp;quot;profound&amp;quot; thoughts.  You&amp;#39;re enlightened!   And you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;never coming down!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the red zone, which is clearly &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;.  You&amp;#39;ve obviously rejected &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot; in favor of absolute power.  You start to see that maybe Darth Vader was having more fun than Luke. And perhaps you can bring back the empire!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shape shifting, manufactured realities to play in with your spirit friend who may not have the same long term goals you have, but is perfectly willing to &amp;quot;groom you&amp;quot; for what he likes to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And shared dreaming galore!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with that is, there&amp;#39;s so few of  us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ll just have to look for someone down there.   In the red zone.  Hijack a neighbor&amp;#39;s dream and scare the bejesus out of them.   You&amp;#39;ll find them in the puffs.  Form your ally into a scary demon, and send him in as an &amp;quot;experiment&amp;quot; in how well your neighbor, who keeps complaining about your lawn, responds to fright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the red zone!  The old seers did far worse down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I mention it was &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t want to get trapped down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider it to be like a visit to an opium den.  Just for research of course...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t stand to spend more than 3 days in the opium den.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stay longer than that, you may get stuck forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like being addicted to heroine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you tough it up, and keep forcing deeper silence.  That&amp;#39;s the only thing that will allow you to leave the red zone.  Much deeper silence, and you have to ignore the naked asian women the opium den supplies, for you to stare at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They really did do that. I have an office in a chinese country.  Where a &amp;quot;plague&amp;quot; of gambling broke out once, involving some &amp;quot;flower game&amp;quot;.   It was so bad, men were selling their daughters to get money to keep gambling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would be &amp;quot;Formosa&amp;quot; back then I suppose.  A very obsessive people, the chinese can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you make it past the red zone, there&amp;#39;s a significant breath change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only significant at first.  Later that becomes mostly your normal breath, so you no longer notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juann suggests there are several breath changes along the J curve, and that would be consistent with what Carlos said about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the most obvious change in your breathing,  is when the assemblage point changes sides on the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That puts it only a few feet away from the assemblage point of our magical double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy running around in dreams at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think he&amp;#39;s not real, but you&amp;#39;re in for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s just been &amp;quot;out of town&amp;quot;, since you stopped sleepwalking as a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he decides to come home, you&amp;#39;ll get the shock of your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or she&amp;#39;s real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even better, you don&amp;#39;t have to decide what sex it has to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica preferred to be Emilito most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita likes to be 20 years younger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the J curve, when the assemblage point is in the front, you&amp;#39;re bathed in whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of hellish scenes on the walls of your darkroom making it appear that  a lava cave got invaded by puffs of glowing purple whipped cream, which can even swirl with jet blackness and intense yellow mixed in, you&amp;#39;re now bathed in a boring &amp;quot;whitish light&amp;quot; on surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose mystics might confuse it for &amp;quot;the light of God&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And have!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to pretend that stuff, it&amp;#39;ll be puzzlingly vivid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even &amp;quot;textured&amp;quot;, once you learn to gaze at it more closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those textures form on the walls of your darkroom, and even on the furniture.  Or on the quilt covering your bed. I suggest keeping your bed made and clear of stuff on top of it, during darkroom if you are using your bedroom.  A nice &amp;quot;flat surface&amp;quot; can be used for remote viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the bed, you can slide your hand over the textured whitish light, to see if it responds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can in fact make it change with your hands!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t behave like anything you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;cool technique&amp;quot; regarding the whitish light, it&amp;#39;s translocation bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remote viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Translocation means you are located here in your darkroom, but you are viewing &amp;quot;over there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re in 2 places at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you can get over the show biz aspect, and stop thinking about that book deal and how you&amp;#39;ll be as famous as don Juan and everyone will love you, you might try to &amp;quot;pin it down&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Figure out if you are here, or over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the course of doing that, you get &amp;quot;offers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, the first time  you are kind of &amp;quot;orange zoning out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You did everything right, and were doing Tensegrity all the way to this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your limited number of Tensegrity forms ends here. It gets you this far, and no further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s ok!  The orange zone is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later you can add another tensegrity form, to take you the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For now, in the orange zone, you sit up on pillows on the bed to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All around you is a whitish light on surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see the room!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get too excited though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a room all right.  But not YOUR room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the beginnings of a &amp;quot;phantom room&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very important topic in sorcery. In fact, you might say that all sorcery really is, is finding the door to the phantom room of the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was the first to make one of those in our home.  There was an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; involving an Ally, with both me and Cholita witnessing it together, and the energy of three beings focused on a dreaming event made it real enough to repeat.  She created a split in reality.  A stable one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lingering glow in specific emanations, which could be &amp;quot;found again&amp;quot; if you had gotten a glimpse of it before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And being like Josefina, Cholita just &amp;quot;swished&amp;quot; into it.  With her ally for company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s another story.  Her phantom room was just our living room and her little garden paradise out the door from there.  At first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now a year or two later it spreads all the way to Los Angeles, 40 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the phantom room of the old seers, working together to expand it for thousands of years, is more like a phantom jungle world spanning hundreds of miles on the east coast of Mexico.  In cenote territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we still need to find the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the whitish light makes &amp;quot;entrances&amp;quot; visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All sorts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typical is that you stopped your tensegrity routine when you noticed you could see the room in the dark, sat up on the bed, and the change from activity to relative stillness changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can now &amp;quot;blank out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you &amp;quot;blank out&amp;quot; up in the green zone, you lose awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you blank out in the orange zone, you do not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You change realities.  With varying amounts of &amp;quot;through the veil&amp;quot; forgetfulness at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the orange zone, gazing at the whitish light to figure out if that&amp;#39;s really your room, when it seems to have  an extra wall over there, you try to get even more silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you keep thinking thoughts, and the extra wall vanishes before you can figure out if that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then at one point you realize you were staring at a painting on that &amp;quot;extra wall&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s a small break in your &amp;quot;continuity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get a little surge of excitement, and figure out you are now in a 1950s style living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With doilies on the couch arms!  High tech victorian era devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did we ever give up putting doilies on the arms of furniture, so we could wash them and always have a clean place to rest our arm?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s barbaric!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita makes her own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what for, but once I came home to find her sewing, took the risk to go see what, and it was a doily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never did find out why.  It was probably designed for a ritual to bring me bad luck.  And it was important for me to see for myself that she went to the trouble to make an actual &amp;quot;Doily&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of her spells much of the time, require the victim to see it in progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the orange zone, you can easily end up in &amp;quot;Doily Land&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you&amp;#39;ve fully translocated like that, you get greedy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You realize that full on translocation scenes come in infinite variety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find that your bed has been transported to ancient tree groves in Cambodia. Surrounded by those &amp;quot;Raider&amp;#39;s of the Lost Ark&amp;quot; style ancient temple structures that have roots growing through the doorways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can find yourself on the top of a cliff in France, with a gentle fishermen&amp;#39;s harbor to your right, but the raging waters of shipwreck cove to the left of you, threatening to knock you off the cliff with giant waves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real. Awake.  We don&amp;#39;t go to sleep and make up stuff about our dreams!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to ask the fishermen to toss you up a big tuna!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They will.  Right into your bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not often enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it takes such perfect silence to get there, that each time screws it up for a full week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your mind gets so greedy, you can&amp;#39;t repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you try to figure out how you can learn to repeat such things, and you discover &amp;quot;dream bubbles&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t like staring in a movie, the way full translocation scenes can be.  And full waking dreams, burn off dreaming attention too fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dream bubbles do not.  Those are more like looking into one of those old fashioned movie viewing machines from just when movies were invented, and watching a section of a silent movie through a little eyepiece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a penny.   Big money back then, but it was a &amp;quot;high tech wonder&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And like all new high tech things, used mostly to see naked women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The book deal potential is greatly reduced with dream bubble penny arcade machines,  and you learn that while you can&amp;#39;t repeat the sights of a specific dream bubble, you can learn to reliably &amp;quot;find them&amp;quot; in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And keep them open for business!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had as many as 4 dream bubbles in the air at once, each one keeping its own unique scene active.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not all at once.  You have to turn your head to where you know that one is floating, and then you can see if it&amp;#39;s still got time left on your penny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t look in 4 of those old movie arcade machines at once.  But like real dream bubbles, two people can gaze into the same lens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you discover &amp;quot;dream bubbles&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll be endlessly entertained and your inorganic being friend will want to join in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;ll show up and offer to teach you how to enter them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to swish inside, like Josefina!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re worried about doing that, just get her to rest on your hand, and insert her first.   Gently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell her to &amp;quot;report back&amp;quot; while you watch the scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She will in fact take on a part in what you are viewing, and you can even narrate it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d stay away from having her die in terrible accidents.  They don&amp;#39;t mind, but they do &amp;quot;get revenge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try a romance story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you finally get up the nerve, she&amp;#39;ll give you access to the dream bubbles yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let you find one in the air and &amp;quot;zip&amp;quot; right into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standing right there, in a fully real looking world, with all of your sobriety intact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t stay longer than 5 seconds or your tonal rationality will burn off, and you&amp;#39;ll just find yourself waking up in the morning, not knowing how you got into bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try zipping in and out of bubbles 5 times.  Just &amp;quot;turn your head&amp;quot; back once you get inside, and seek out a new one in the second attention fog of your dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be interested to hear if anyone can do all 5 before &amp;quot;something weird happens&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could have gotten to this key point in darkroom, in the red zone alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But do try to blow through that red light district part of town, to get to the nice orange section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been gentrified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s that &amp;quot;key point&amp;quot; I mentioned?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you are genuinely doing &amp;quot;investigations&amp;quot; of real supernatural phenomena!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuff no one will believe, when they find out you aren&amp;#39;t sitting like a lame closed eye meditation guru, making up stuff about the few times you dozed off and the results seemed like a magical event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you latch onto a single vision, probably just a crappy nightmare, and try to cash in with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way famous hindu gurus always do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maharishi once had  vision of a giant caterpillar crushing the earth through strangulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he announced his amazing seership, and ordered his followers to gather 7000 to meditate in a big dome, to save the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At $1500 a piece entry fee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is NOT like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have endless visions each day.   You aren&amp;#39;t trying to come up with a fundraising excuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s real magic. And just in case you forgot, it&amp;#39;s done with the eyes open, walking around!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DAILY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You arrive at this &amp;quot;key point&amp;quot; when it all gets very real, each time you practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like traveling into a new wilderness to learn more about the amazing vistas and wildlife there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s real exploration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the dark.  All alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You literally travel outside your darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With your eyes open, fully awake, and completely sober.  And so reliable, it&amp;#39;s like going to your car to take a short trip to the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the part I wanted to explain here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That a well designed tensegrity collection, is like a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first you&amp;#39;re bored out of your mind, trying to learn darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get into the car, but don&amp;#39;t know how to turn the key to start the engine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think the car will autostart, because of your hidden greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t, and you have to figure out how to put the key into the slot, and start the engine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence and tensegrity in darkness does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the silence can&amp;#39;t be skipped, so if it&amp;#39;s not working that&amp;#39;s your problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to be more honest, and look closer at your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of glossing to ignore all the chatter so you can pretend to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you learn how to drive down the highway daily,  you eventually come to the final destination.  Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, by developing so much deeper silence that the dream bubbles are now infinite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t just 4 in the room, through your intense hard efforts to hold them there long enough to explore each for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, the &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; that zipped into them, when you believed it was you,  now feels comfortable enough to fully join you during your practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s when you arrive at the &amp;quot;purple station&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where there are thousands of dream bubbles all around you.  Anywhere you gaze, a tiny dream bubble appears. And if you keep watching it expand, you can literally find yourself standing inside it.  Because you, and  your double, are sharing the same assemblage point position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not having to &amp;quot;zip&amp;quot; at all to enter dreams.  You just walk into them.  Or let them surround you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See the cover of &amp;quot;Wheel of Time&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But other things can happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan warned us of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are just too many things that can happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he recommended reading text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into that, but there are &amp;quot;tips&amp;quot; for summoning text.  Maybe I&amp;#39;ll animate it when I feel confident it&amp;#39;s universal.  It could just be a side effect of Carlos describing how to do it, rather than that&amp;#39;s the main way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get to take your pick of &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Presentation Method&amp;quot; when you are fully experienced with the purple zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So make that the goal of your series of tensegrity forms.  To summon your chosen presentation method for silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can modify it later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re trying to amuse &amp;quot;The Spirit&amp;quot; here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I forget to mention that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have an audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re stuck up at the green zone, the audience will be bored.  The spirit will notice, but it won&amp;#39;t feel inclined to encourage you to get stuck in there because you get too many ego stroking rewards of bliss and minor visions up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita could show you what you&amp;#39;re really stroking, up there in &amp;quot;Enlightened Master&amp;quot; range on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really from the deep red zone and onward, that &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; becomes very interested in your progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; stores into the forms you do in sequence, so that each &amp;quot;cool thing&amp;quot; you discovered along the way reliably shows up at the correct moment in the tensegrity forms, it&amp;#39;s very much like you are driving down the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The spirit likes that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You pass the health food market.  The green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still far from having arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the McDonalds, the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to the orange zone, as you pass the 7-11 and those wonderfully foamy frozen ice crystal &amp;quot;slurpees&amp;quot; that come in so  many sugary flavors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re almost at your destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the spirit likes that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It created us to probe the dark sea of awareness, to see how living beings &amp;quot;felt&amp;quot; about it&amp;#39;s creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you get to decide what the destination is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the same forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep trying to go to the  same destination daily, using your combination of passes and the help of the spirit,  until you can reliably do a &amp;quot;perfect run&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, you&amp;#39;ll get suggestions from the spirit itself for new destinations it would like you to probe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are then &amp;quot;already given to the power that rules your fate&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s a lot cooler than anything else humans do.  By far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And whatever destination you choose, keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Presentation Method&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The series of tensegrity forms, is merely a way to summon a particular SKPM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent knowledge presentation method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, a perfect run causes a magical object,  a &amp;quot;proto-dream bubble&amp;quot;, to float down from the ceiling and hover right where I can grab it, like a sluggish helium balloon waiting for you to take hold of it on each side before it blows away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final tensegrity form ends, with my hands able to pluck a magical object from the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fully stable, in full color, and vivid in ever way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just do whatever I like with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The spirit likes that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A grand finale, Spielberg style!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Goosebumps even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can gently push it to move forward, and it breaks apart and drizzles down, forming my phantom realm for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to have to do that piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

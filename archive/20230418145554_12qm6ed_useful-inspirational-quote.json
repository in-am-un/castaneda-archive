Are you a masochist?\n\nDo you go to an \"All You Can Eat Buffet\" and then accept they only have Cheetos?\n\nIf you go that pretend magic route, you'll just self-flatter and hype yourself up into a phony Guru, like the rest out there.\n\nStick with the real thing!\n\nIt's very difficult, but once you get there it's AMAZING!\n\nI'd planned to post about, \"Shiny Outer Coating\" tech today, but making a picture uses up my time to learn to animate.\n\nLet's just say that I got my energy body to stay in place last night, wiggled my fingers on that second attention assemblage point it has, and realized a series of things I'd love to post about, but which can probably only be animated.\n\nI'll list them.\n\nALL of our senses are \"hooks\" to the emanations.  None of them is any different than any other.  They're just receptors for those nano-feelings each emanation gives off.  Since that's a hard fact, it implies that all senses are useful for *intending*.  Meaning, you can \"re-skim\" and alter reality by activating a new bundle of emanations, using the feelings generated by movement.  By Tensegrity.  Carlos created a \"complete\" way to intend the assemblage point to move.  Of course, I prefer visual myself.  But just don't think that's all that can cause it to move.  Even a hippy chick at woodstock dancing in the mud, realizes that moves the assemblage point.\n\nSecondly, the \"Shiny Outer Coating\" is far more important than Carlos led us to believe.  Except, oddly, he actually did tell us!  We just ignored it.  Remember \"the fliers\" licking that down to our toes, so that all we can focus on is \"me, me, me\"?   And how if you can get it to rise up, the fliers don't like the taste anymore.  If you consider that closely, you'll realize that it's possible the following are true:  Dream bubbles are puffs of your double, who is focusing shiny outer coating to make a viewing screen.  And magical objects, a sign of Silent Knowledge, are also pieces of the shiny outer coating.\n\nTrue?\n\nBeats me. I just got  a lecture on it by a strange entity, but I might have misunderstood.  The lecture was on \"Shiny Outer Coating\" and \"White Phantom Body Parts\" technology.  I'd been musing about them with a witch during the day, so I got info on the topic from infinity.\n\nThink \"seeing\" can't be misunderstood?\n\nThink again!  Don Juan and Silvio completely misread the \"4 pronged Nagual\" status of Carlos. They \"mis-saw\" the apprentice witches and labeled one south who was north, or something similar.\n\nAnd don Juan warned us!  He suggested we learn to read text from infinity, instead of projecting videos in the sky like the old seers preferred.  Because it's easier to interpret text.\n\nSo just remove that \"Superman\" delusion from your mind.  We aren't pretending like everyone else out there.  We make mistakes just as often as non-sorcerers.\n\nOurs are just a whole lot more fun!\n\nSo if you run into \"superman\",  a \"five pronged Nagual\", or even \"the real don Juan\", you can be sure he isn't a sorcerer.\n\nSorcerers make mistakes.  And they certainly don't want any money from you.\n\nHere's that inspirational quote about what inorganic beings do.  Just keep in mind, we do the same in silent knowledge!  So this quote, \"almost\" explains why darkroom can be so visual.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI asked don Juan to explain what 'phantasmagorical projections' meant. He said that inorganic beings hook onto dreamers' innermost feelings and play them mercilessly. They create phantoms to please dreamers or frighten them. He reminded me that I had wrestled with one of those phantoms. He explained that inorganic beings are superb projectionists, who delight in projecting themselves like pictures on the wall.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Useful Inspirational Quote", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"c33c65o2anua1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e329f1e67f40c8624ddd56d11c271b82bb495130"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95047b1af4e07d53b2d70df31c863956c8d3b492"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=080d8ac35c7f4242be968df6a520238b791935d7"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68c2c7123b366b37603ae7a622c301c6e5d5595d"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c724bb9798a6e88600c41341e3b10c053bcafb"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a16d60a44900b70b13438eb5009b22cc832e8492"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac835d2dbcdcd7587bc764f2219e83dca8f6ccbb"}, "id": "c33c65o2anua1"}}, "name": "t3_12qm6ed", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 39, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/QpbKvzAzqrZ_1p9wR_zeeFGAzu_AFXNOxEpFhxFbvwY.jpg", "edited": 1681825950.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1681822554.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ac835d2dbcdcd7587bc764f2219e83dca8f6ccbb\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/c33c65o2anua1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ac835d2dbcdcd7587bc764f2219e83dca8f6ccbb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be like the other guy, imagining stuff during closed eye meditation!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the hell?

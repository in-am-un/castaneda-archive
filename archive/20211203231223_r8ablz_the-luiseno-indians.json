So summer is in pursuit of bear, fall is getting the bear, winter is death/hibernation, spring is of course the renewal. And we also find that the bear is associated with the big dipper globally (not every tradition of course though). But ya, that is why we can find the symbol all over, however it&amp;#39;s purpose and meaning kept getting degraded thru out time...and we all know what the symbols associated with now unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be fair though...I was doing acid while star gazing, so take with that what you will haha. I realize it&amp;#39;s not always wise to trust every insight from those states, but this one was different from regular &amp;quot;acid visions&amp;quot; haha...or at least I believe so. It&amp;#39;s not the first time I&amp;#39;ve felt info &amp;quot;beamed&amp;quot; to me specifically while star gazing (the psychedelics have definitely helped though haha, at least when younger), so it makes me wonder if a similar process of direct knowledge happened in the past. No need for language, but the symbols were a helpful start. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I suppose this could partially lead towards the advent of agriculture and such...so still not pre-language at all, but very ancient.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_r8ablz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/r8ablz/the_luise\u00f1o_indians/hn9pja2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1638668410.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1638668410.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hn7o6qz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1638637187.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hn6uekn", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "There's actually a lot more to that topic than we might imagine.\n\nYou could analyze all religions in terms of what was happening socially and divide them by the type of bad players that would emerge.\n\nI wish I could analyze pre-language periods, but we have no info on the types of magic they might do.  \n\nChimps on shrooms?

From before he had his &amp;quot;informant&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joanie Baker took him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, my father was possibly a friend of hers too. He certainly knew her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he weren&amp;#39;t dead, I&amp;#39;d ask him if he had an affair with Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met Joanie again in 1997!  Carlos took me to shake her hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No kidding.  Neither of us knew why. She seemed to be remaining in bed all the time, her long air messy and nearly all gray.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some ways, he sort of &amp;quot;completed a circle&amp;quot; by doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible don Juan was totally associated with Morongo in some indirect way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Luiseno go back 10,000 years on this continent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they were a minor component of that tribe.  Pechanga had more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Had&lt;/strong&gt; being the operative word. It&amp;#39;s all buried now by the casino and the entire city supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos returned to Morongo for festivals, and for the filming of my father&amp;#39;s movie.  I believe he might have visited the devil&amp;#39;s weed sorcerer there too, but I didn&amp;#39;t pay close enough attention to the sources of rumors, back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morongo is in the path he would drive to go to the Northern Mexico residences of don Juan&amp;#39;s party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Down the 10 freeway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_r8ablz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/r8ablz/the_luise\u00f1o_indians/hnc160v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1638719248.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1638719248.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hn83hxp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hn7onsv", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "So Carlos went to Morongo after Teachings of Don Juan were published or before?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hn83hxp", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Carlos went to Morongo after Teachings of Don Juan were published or before?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_r8ablz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/r8ablz/the_luise\u00f1o_indians/hn83hxp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1638643430.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1638643430.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hn7onsv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1638637381.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hn7a56n", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "He was a super star, and famous for a topic they believed was their own.

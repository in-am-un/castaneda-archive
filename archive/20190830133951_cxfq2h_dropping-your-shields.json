It can drain me to the point where I get sick or it can put me in a state of high energy and heightened awareness that lasts hours. Sometimes it\u2019s so intoxicating I feel drunk. It\u2019s a core source of joy for me and I ain\u2019t giving it up no matter what, but I do wonder if I\u2019m damaging myself energetically or if it\u2019s \u201creinforcing a shield\u201d as you said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question is worth reevaluating how I make music and my intent while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_cxfq2h", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/cxfq2h/dropping_your_shields/f122bwl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1569133846.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1569133846.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eypgqrc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1567299622.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eynesgt", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "*Listening* for the \"music of the spheres\" or second attention sound is about all I got for musical acts of power.

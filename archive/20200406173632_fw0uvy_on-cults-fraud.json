Knowing this, and that one of the key reasons don Juan's group of 16 Sorcerer's prospered was that they were few in number (if there had been 100 of them, the base inclinations of those who've yet to achieve real silence would have sunk them long before takeoff) he artfully built a self-limiting mechanism into his organization, which outwardly looked a bit like a cult, since there was little he could do to prevent that anyway.\n\nHe knew naysayers and obstructionists would latch onto that appearance, see the [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/dxc7un/robert_marshalls_pending_biography_of_castaneda/) written by Robert Marshall which shows up on the first page of basically every Castaneda Google search; and thus ensured that his \"movement\" wouldn't become a religion based on his personhood and thus corrupt it's effectiveness.\n\nIt's stressful to grasp, but dedicated practitioners actually owe a debt to people like Marshall.\n\nAlso, Castaneda knew that accumulating too many wishy-washy people, and too much peripheral mass leads to populist concerns and the ceasing of actual esoteric laboring, possibly what's befallen Cleargreen (and why he was unconcerned with their fate). \n\nIt should be noted this is all primarily in regards to men, since women dont seem to care as much about reputations, even preferring men with \"dangerous\" status.\n\n**On Fraud**\r\n\r\nFraud (definition):\r\n\r\n1. Intentional deception resulting in injury to another person\r\n\r\n2. A person who makes deceitful pretenses\r\n\r\n3. Something intended to deceive; deliberate trickery intended to gain an advantage\n\r\n\r**One** -  Patty Partin, aka the Blue Scout, wandered into Death Valley on her own impetus. Dozens of well intentioned people who thought they were prepared for such a hostile environment have died in Death Valley. Making the reach that they were coerced [*(see Marshall Post)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/dxc7un/robert_marshalls_pending_biography_of_castaneda/) is based on theories that can never be born out by fact, and merely betrays the writer's intent and not that of the women. \n\nPsychological \"injury\" is necessary to lay the seeds for the impetus to escape the social order, whether a holdover from childhood or the harsh tactics of an authentic teacher. It is never comfy or safe. There can be no kumbaya's for those learning sorcery, at least not for men. Women only need a desireable example to embody. \r\n\r\n**TWO** - Carlos's work is enlightening pretense, not deceitful pretense. Tricking us into enlightenment, because we won't go willingly. Examine the methodology for too long, and any magical realism eventually becomes drol. That's why Castaneda advised us to put down the books after being properly hooked by the non-ordinary, primal reality, they draw us into.\r\n\r\n**THREE** - Carlos did become wealthy from his books. This is a fact. Attacking success as proof that a message is fraud is on a case by case basis. There's a large living area between being ascetically frugal and self-depriving, and ostentatiously flamboyant with the intent of making others envious, ie. ego-fullfillment; a middle path, which Castaneda manifestly followed by using his resources to further his goals to the very end, not to abandon them.\r\n\r\nFurther, I think I've divined the root driver behind the 'Carlos is a Fraud' problem in the mass media, and the clue was in the magazine &amp; newspaper articles published after his death, primarily in many but not all of the periodicals that had published, with relish ($), interviews &amp; articles with Carlos in previous decades. \r\n\r\nDisapointment. They actually were hoping that Carlos was the new Messiah, the one who would prove that the old tales of superhuman feats/exits from this Earth weren't all tall tales and fables. And when he died like a man, that hope beyond hope was upended; the spell/bubble was burst and their underlying cynicism and barely masked despair came rushing out again, after 30 years of \"waiting on baited breath.\"\r\n\r\nThey honestly thought that if anyone could do it, it would be him. And when he didn't, at least not in the way they were expecting *(see [Martin Goodman post](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/bf8sp9/martin_goodmans_i_was_carlos_castaneda_the/))* they were thrust back into the cold. Boy, that is about the strongest cynical miasma a person of hope can be saddled with...more than enough to write bad press about Carlos.\r\n\r\nBut it was never about hope. Rather not standing in the way of our natural open-minded curiosity, and letting our better natures drive us into the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe second component of the dying like a man=fraud problem, is since he did...then everything else must also be a fraud.\r\n\r\nAgain, not separating the man from the work. Carlos discovered and repackaged for the modern age, a body of work greater and better than himself. One that's virtually limitless, and not dependant on his personal saintlyness.\r\n\r\nThe third part of the fraud problem stems from the total lack of \"evidence\" in the modern world of third-party observable non-ordinary reality. Specifically that video of the [Fake Martial Arts Cults](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/f5bf4a/this_is_what_carlos_was_intentionally_preventing/) comes to mind. People have seen nothing but pretending for so long, that they reflexively say \"prove it to the world or I won't believe a word of it.\"\n\nI'm reminded of James Randi's \"One Million Dollar Paranormal challenge\" that went unclaimed because no one could demonstrate anything but trickery on camera [CCTV comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/fhkzwi/cheap_tricks_for_helping_with_colors/fkf1y2l).\n\r\nAnd now that video can be deepfaked, actual video evidence can even be called into dispute [Ram Bomjan sitting in fire](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kjbiPDh4G_o).\r\n\r\nThat basically leaves in-person demonstrations as the only avenue of proof for those with rigid cognition. Again, ensuring that those unable to suspend the dialogue, even for an instant, wouldn't contaminate things for active practitoners.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with the unalterable necessity for the fighter (warrior) mentality/mood: \"an active struggle between competing entities.\" \n\nIt is vital. And one of the reasons Castaneda emphasized it.\n\nAny limiting socialization being the enemy, and not the victims of such socialization.\n\nThe best way to find out who you are, is to find out who you're not.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "On Cults &amp; Fraud", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Flyers (counter intent)"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_fw0uvy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Flyers (counter intent)", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1616850583.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1586187392.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Cults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I was watching an excellent episode of The UnXplained, hosted by William Shatner, titled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/KFseMHRSzk0\"&gt;Deadly Cults&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that became very clear is just how wily Carlos truly was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He knew full well what inevitably happens when enough people group together under the auspices of spiritual development; power (status) and carnality.

problem with our path.\n\nWe don't really know when we discover a \"better way\" to practice, or if we just got better at silence.\n\nNo one has EVER been able to figure that out. Not the old seers, not the new ones, and not even the \"ancient\" seers.\n\nUntil now! We've got the internet.\n\nWe have endless new people to learn from. See what works better.\n\nBut it's not a quick process.  \n\nMaybe it'll take 50 years of this continuing, before we have decent instructions for beginners.\n\nSomeone was asking about \"Aphasia\", or some situation where you don't have an internal dialogue.\n\nReally, they just wanted some attention. It's never a serious inquiry!\n\nAnd it can't be answered!\n\nOF COURSE they can learn sorcery.\n\nAnyone can. It's our natural state, not some kind of bizarre \"add-on accessory\".\n\nBut can you use the single path we have in here?   The one Little Smoke gave us?\n\nMaybe not.\n\nSo if something is different in your own situation, making the instructions we have inappropriate, you just have to stop being lazy and needy and read everything in this subreddit to figure out  your own path that works.\n\nEven \"not having the time\" can be conquered by reading and finding things to insert into your daily routine.  With the knowledge, you are looking for concrete results.  That's the key.

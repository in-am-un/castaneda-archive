It pays off big time.  But go ahead and \"get creative\" with it.  As it turns out, that's not the only way to \"dent\" that shell!\n\nWhile flowing in \"Silent Knowledge\" a week or so ago, I realized you could also \"hug\" your energy shell.\n\nYou just give it a big hug, and gently squish it closer to yourself.\n\nI *saw* it.\n\nBut I suppose I'm still lacking, because I didn't believe it.\n\nI was trying to justify it in my mind, by remembering things. I was silent, but in that mode you can remember things and they take on a visual quality.\n\nI reached my arms out, after deciding it made sense, and I could feel a layer of cobwebs all around me, at the distance of the finger wiggling.\n\nI tried patting on the \"wiggle spot\" with my palm, and I did indeed see a yellowish light burst into fleeting details.\n\nA few days later I opened my arms to \"hug\" my forming energy body, and the puffs all throughout the room rushed to find a place between my arms. They formed a \"puff body\".\n\nIf you're wondering was it as bright as that picture, no.\n\nIt was BRIGHTER!  The black was blacker, and the colors were alive.\n\nEverything you see there, is the correct brightness and vividness. EXCEPT the picture of touching the cobweb ring.  I was just seeing a glow everywhere, as you would if you were inside that ring.\n\nWatching my \"puff body\" I got the strangest lecture on the puffs.  I'm trying to remember it for you, but keep in mind, this isn't from Carlos.\n\nSo it could simply be a suitable \"lesson\" I got from God only knows where.  Similar to the lessons Carlos got, which later turned out to be slightly less than \"universal\". They were true for him, at that time.\n\nBut less than useful for someone else, at another time.\n\nHere's that lesson:\n\nEach puff is YOU.  It's part of your energy of awareness.  Besides the shell, that's really all we are.\n\nThey've been pushed to the outside, away from  us, sticking to the inside of our luminous egg.\n\nWhich by the way, DOES have a shinier coating.  When you gaze in the darkroom trying to use the shine of your eyes, you're trying to activate that shiny coating.\n\nThe puffs should be moved back to the center of the body, so they form the \"energy body\".\n\nBut because they can form a \"body\" for our double to use (the energy body), they can form a body for an inorganic being to use.\n\nYou could use the puffs to build a \"snowman\" at any point in the room. And your iob will happily go in there.\n\nOr you can do magic with them, by pushing them around and manipulating  them in the air.\n\nYour IOB loves that, because you end up creating links from pieces of  you, to the red zone.\n\nIf you get so linked up in the red zone that you can't move to the orange, what are you going to do when  you get so old, it's time to die.\n\nOne guess...\n\nSo your IOB just LOVES you to play in the red zone.  \n\nMy IOB Fancy has even tried to pull me back into there, when I was having too much fun in the orange zone.\n\nThe same as we must recapitulate to get back our energy, stuck in other things, if you play with the puffs in the red zone they can make a \"home\" there.\n\nAnd it's hard to pass through.\n\nIf you only use them to move your assemblage point, and place them on your torso, you won't get yourself stuck down there.  You won't have all the fibers stuck in the walls, and can slide right through.\n\nOn the other hand, if you cheat and move to the orange zone without passing vividly through the red zone, your energy body is not well formed, and the orange zone is weakened.  No meaningful \"double assist\".\n\nI'm not sure why.  Does he need the body you formed?\n\nI didn't get that answer.  I just heard, the reason you need to move along the J curve is because the red zone \"fortifies\" you and makes the orange zone more real.\n\nBut that's not the entire story.\n\nI managed to sneak directly to the whitish light last night, by looking for \"the abstract\".  It becomes, \"a thing\".\n\nLike \"Bliss crumbs\".  Tasty crumbs of \"bliss cake\", all over your desk at work.\n\nThat's what the Abstract can look like at times.  \n\nIf you can find some of that stuff, you can bypass the red zone.\n\nSo there are other paths possible in the darkroom.\n\nPossibly even some astounding ones left to be discovered!\n\nLet the witches do that.  Maybe on the left side of the green zone, there's a door that says, \"Exit\" over it.  And the men just didn't bother to look everywhere.\n\nLast night I noticed that when you reach silent knowledge (can for example, remote view freely even if it's not well in focus), \"visitors\" are inevitable.  I'd been suspecting that for a while, but last night I got visitor after visitor.\n\nOne even implied he was Carlos.\n\nBut I asked him something as a test, and he slowly vanished.\n\nThe main thing is, you get visitors who are NOT your ally.\n\nAnd they ARE in fact very scary.  \n\nBut before you do darkroom, it's a good idea to accept that a horrible death is a possible result.\n\nIt's an acceptable risk.\n\nLike skydiving. Or rock climbing.\n\nIt's less dangerous than those.\n\nSo when the scary visitor looms over you, just tell it how glad you are to have a visit,  it's kind of lonely in there at times, and that it's welcome to return any time.\n\nBut next time, can you bring  Sigourney Weaver along?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0,

The original circumstances have changed.\n\nYou know what the result  \"ought to be\".\n\nNow keep in mind, at this level of silence, even a trace \"idea\" in the mind, alters entire realities as they form.\n\nYou just can't do the same thing, because you aren't \"innocent\".\n\nHere's an analogy that \"seeing\" gave me last night.\n\nIt'll help with anything!

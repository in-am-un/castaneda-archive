But why? And how did the habit disappear?\n\nIt was around 23:00 on 13 April 1699, in a small village in the north  of England. Nine-year-old Jane Rowth blinked her eyes open and squinted  out into the moody evening shadows. She and her mother had just awoken  from a short sleep.\n\nMrs Rowth got up and went over to the fireside of their modest home,  where she began smoking a pipe. Just then, two men appeared by the  window. They called out and instructed her to get ready to go with them.\n\nAs Jane later explained to a courtroom, her mother had evidently been  expecting the visitors. She went with them freely \u2013 but first whispered  to her daughter to \"lye still, and shee would come againe in the  morning\". Perhaps Mrs Rowth had some nocturnal task to complete. Or  maybe she was in trouble, and knew that leaving the house was a risk.\u00a0\n\nEither way, Jane's mother didn't get to keep her promise \u2013 she never  returned home. That night, Mrs Rowth was brutally murdered, and her body  was discovered in the following days. The crime was never solved.\n\nNearly 300 years later, in the early 1990s, the historian Roger  Ekirch walked through the arched entranceway to the Public Record Office  in London \u2013 an imposing gothic building that housed the UK's National  Archives from 1838 until 2003. There, among the endless rows of ancient  vellum papers and manuscripts, he found Jane's testimony. And something  about it struck him as odd.\u00a0\n\nOriginally, Ekirch had been researching a book about the history of  night-time, and at the time he had been looking through records that  spanned the era between the early Middle Ages and the Industrial  Revolution. He was dreading writing the chapter on sleep, thinking that  it was not only a universal necessity \u2013 but a biological constant. He  was sceptical that he'd find anything new.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo far, he had found court depositions particularly illuminating.  \"They're a wonderful source for social historians,\" says Ekirch, a  professor at Virginia Tech, US. \"They comment upon activity that's  oftentimes unrelated to the crime itself.\"\n\nBut as he read through Jane's criminal deposition, two words seemed  to carry an echo of a particularly tantalising detail of life in the  17th Century, which he had never encountered before \u2013 \"first sleep\".\n\n\"I can cite the original document almost verbatim,\" says Ekirch,  whose exhilaration at his discovery is palpable even decades later.\n\nIn her testimony, Jane describes how just before the men arrived at  their home, she and her mother had arisen from their first sleep of the  evening. There was no further explanation \u2013 the interrupted sleep was  just stated matter-of-factly, as if it were entirely unremarkable. \"She  referred to it as though it was utterly normal,\" says Ekirch.\n\nA first sleep implies a second sleep \u2013 a night divided into two halves. Was this just a familial quirk, or something more?\n\n**An omnipresence**\n\nOver the coming months, Ekirch scoured the archives and found many  more references to this mysterious phenomenon of double sleeping, or  \"biphasic sleep\" as he later called it.\n\nSome were fairly banal, such as the mention by the weaver Jon  Cokburne, who simply dropped it into his testimony incidentally. But  others were darker, such as that of Luke Atkinson of the East Riding of  Yorkshire. He managed to squeeze in an early morning murder between his  sleeps one night \u2013 and according to his wife, often used the time to  frequent other people's houses for sinister deeds.\n\nWhen Ekirch expanded his search to include online databases of other  written records, it soon became clear the phenomenon was more widespread  and normalised than he had ever imagined.\n\nFor a start, first sleeps are mentioned in one of the most famous  works of medieval literature, Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales  (written between 1387 and 1400), which is presented as a storytelling  contest between a group of pilgrims. They're also included in the poet  William Baldwin's Beware the Cat (1561) \u2013 a satirical book considered by  some to be the first ever novel, which centres around a man who learns  to understand the language of a group of terrifying supernatural cats, one of whom, Mouse-slayer, is on trial for promiscuity.\n\nBut that's just the tip of the iceberg. Ekirch found casual  references to the system of twice-sleeping in every conceivable form,  with hundreds in letters, diaries, medical textbooks, philosophical  writings, newspaper articles and plays.\n\nThe practice even made it into ballads, such as \"Old Robin of Portingale. \"\u2026*And  at the wakening of your first sleepe, You shall have a hot drink made,  And at the wakening of your next sleepe, Your sorrows will have a slake*\u2026\"\n\nBiphasic sleep was not unique to England, either \u2013 it was widely  practised throughout the preindustrial world. In France, the initial  sleep was the \"*premier somme*\"; in Italy, it was \"*primo sonno*\".  In fact, Eckirch found evidence of the habit in locations as distant as  Africa, South and Southeast Asia, Australia, South America and the  Middle East.\n\nOne colonial account  from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1555 described how the Tupinamb\u00e1 people  would eat dinner after their first sleep, while another \u2013 from 19th  Century Muscat, Oman \u2013 explained that the local people would retire for  their first sleep before 22:00.\n\nAnd far from being a peculiarity of the Middle Ages, Ekirch began to  suspect that the method had been the dominant way of sleeping for  millennia \u2013 an ancient default that we inherited from our prehistoric  ancestors. The first record Ekirch found was from the 8th Century BC, in  the 12,109-line Greek epic The Odyssey, while the last hints of its  existence dated to the early 20th Century, before it somehow slipped  into oblivion.\n\nHow did it work? Why did people do it? And how could something that  was once so completely normal, have been forgotten so completely?\n\n\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Biphasic Sleep", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 110, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"gmf08u8hd3b81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 85, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmf08u8hd3b81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cac94dbdb37c1f7ac0839fe2373c75b57173344c"}, {"y": 170, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmf08u8hd3b81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748bcbb198fa4953f2f4010e8bd739a2984cea7a"}, {"y": 252, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmf08u8hd3b81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0ed01bad85ac9f476f1ec9ed0903ae05457e1df"}, {"y": 505, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmf08u8hd3b81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eeba6a75a7b083a3981d3bdf5a1c4e178430160"}, {"y": 758, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmf08u8hd3b81.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f151565296bd88c099481d02f2090a17a24020d"}, {"y": 853, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmf08u8hd3b81.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e67cf7b4278a190c080703739125a52ee104a539"}], "s": {"y": 896, "x": 1134, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmf08u8hd3b81.png?width=1134&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=374be4e8a7e52d6c917d9dcfdd540c68abe3eb38"}, "id": "gmf08u8hd3b81"}}, "name": "t3_s1g278", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6ZAGri23GfQiZh9-WrQP_DbzEKn4Ezm7DdxGjiwp12w.jpg", "edited": 1641921305.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1641916369.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gmf08u8hd3b81.png?width=1134&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=374be4e8a7e52d6c917d9dcfdd540c68abe3eb38\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s  unnatural to sleep 8 hours at a time, and you remember less dreams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably click bait from Mozilla, but this topic came up recently.

From Eagle's Gift.\n\nThey do in fact, repeat for everyone.  With slight variations.\n\nThere's a force out there which we call, \"The Spirit\", who wants humans to learn sorcery.\n\nI have no idea why.  Possibly because sorcerers explore further, and it seeks exploration of everything that can exist. It wants the memories of all possible aspects of reality.\n\nBut humans are in a horrible rut, and only go around in circles most of the time.  Same old thing, forever.\n\nSo the \"spirit\" taps on chosen people, hoping to get them to wake up and figure out that it's possible to learn real magic.    The story calls it, \"The Knock of the Spirit\".\n\nThe rule says, the spirit manifests for you in the most obvious manner possible,   but you don't take up the cause.\n\nSo then trickery becomes the way you get taught, since you didn't respond to the direct approach.\n\nIn the case of Carlos, the \"Men of Knowledge\" crap was the trickery. Oddly, the worst among us fixate on that, as if it were the goal and not just a trick to distract Carlos while he was being taught following the Nagual's blow.\n\nThe truly horrible men pretend to be teaching that, and when someone points out  the rest of the books say that was just a trick,  and not our goal, they insist only the first 4 books were true, and Carlos got greedy for the rest.\n\nThere's even a fake don Juan out there, tricking people with exactly that lame story.  Only the books he read, and which can be simulated with drugs, are the real thing.\n\nWhich makes absolutely no sense to anyone who tries real sorcery out. The books are amazingly consistent.  Like nothing any human could plan.

Hang up their wizard hat, put up a Facebook page, and bask in the \"glory\" for the rest of their life.\n\nThey never really wanted to learn,  is all I can figure out.  They wanted to join the \"a weird thing happened\" club.

Sainthood.  The rest is too much trouble.\n\nHere's the most important part.\n\nIt's not all that hard to find your way onto \"Sorcery Road\".\n\nThe spirit itself will notice if you make an effort, and give you a step in the right direction.\n\nTowards the road that leads to everything in the books.\n\nBut everyone forgets, it's a 1000 mile road.\n\nThe first foot on the road isn't going to get you much.\n\nBut don't worry about the 1000 miles!\n\nThat just means, you can't run out of magic.\n\nThere's something cool to see on that road, every few feet.\n\nAnd it only takes a few yards, to kick the butt of all other magic systems.\n\nThat's nice, because it gives you assurance you're going the right way.", "edited": 1641940111.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hs9p4tl", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;gifts&lt;/strong&gt; you to keep you interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s those &amp;quot;abstract cores&amp;quot;.   From Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They do in fact, repeat for everyone.  With slight variations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a force out there which we call, &amp;quot;The Spirit&amp;quot;, who wants humans to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why.  Possibly because sorcerers explore further, and it seeks exploration of everything that can exist. It wants the memories of all possible aspects of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But humans are in a horrible rut, and only go around in circles most of the time.  Same old thing, forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot; taps on chosen people, hoping to get them to wake up and figure out that it&amp;#39;s possible to learn real magic.    The story calls it, &amp;quot;The Knock of the Spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rule says, the spirit manifests for you in the most obvious manner possible,   but you don&amp;#39;t take up the cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then trickery becomes the way you get taught, since you didn&amp;#39;t respond to the direct approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of Carlos, the &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; crap was the trickery. Oddly, the worst among us fixate on that, as if it were the goal and not just a trick to distract Carlos while he was being taught following the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truly horrible men pretend to be teaching that, and when someone points out  the rest of the books say that was just a trick,  and not our goal, they insist only the first 4 books were true, and Carlos got greedy for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s even a fake don Juan out there, tricking people with exactly that lame story.  Only the books he read, and which can be simulated with drugs, are the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes absolutely no sense to anyone who tries real sorcery out. The books are amazingly consistent.  Like nothing any human could plan.  One thing is inevitable, given another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the darkroom when the spirit tries to &amp;quot;lure&amp;quot; you, you get an amazing gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, I leaped through my solid wall after Little Smoke had been chasing me around in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no way to explain it.

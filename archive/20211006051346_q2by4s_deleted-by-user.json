Nothing is. Everything we experience is a description, an interpretation...from our own individual viewpoints. A narrative we tell ourselves, individually or collectively as a culture.\n\n From that reputation page linked above:\n\n\"In a review of the work of Castaneda, published in a early 1973 edition of the Village Voice, excerpted in Tales of Fictive Power: Dreaming and Imagination in Ronald Sukenick's Postmodern Fiction, by Daniel C. Noel, which was also featured in the later published work Why Nothing Works: The Anthropology of Daily Life, by Marvin Harris source; we see that even some of those who consider Castaneda's work fiction still understand that a story format was the optimal way to relate such knowledge to readers still mired in this reality, which we erroneously cling to as the ultimate truth...when we subconsciously know that it is also just a convincing story we've learned to collectively tell ourselves:\n\n\"Once philosophy was stories, religion was stories, wisdom books were stories, but now that fiction is held to be a form of lying, even by literary sophisticates, we are without persuasive wisdom, religion, or philosophy. Don Juan shows us that we live in fictions, and that we live best when we learn to master the art...The sorcerer, the artist, sees beyond any particular form fiction may take to the fictive power itself, and in the absence of fictive power in our lives, maybe it's time for all of us to become sorcerers.\"\n\nTo further hit home the necessity of a literary narrative, instead of a manual format, to present the nature of the separate reality of the second attention to readers, and the mixed-reality of the events of his actual life, from his perspective; Castaneda wrote a book prior to The Teachings of don Juan entitled The Crack Between the Worlds. It was an \"instruction\" book. He lost the manuscript in a movie theater, and took it as a sign to not write another purely procedural book, and to instead employ a narrative approach into which the functional techniques and direct perceptual observations were integrated, if he was to be successful at properly relating the knowledge he had been tasked with propagating.\n\nThe only way to counter-act a delusional narrative, that this reality is the only possible true one, is with an equally powerful and personally-demonstrative narrative; one in which the reader can actually operate and readily discover elements of other realities, which will eat away at the certainties that we've been led to believe are inviolable.\n\nThis is why people who \"get Castaneda\" often say that his work is a gift, while the detractors stomp on that gift and fight to remain in crippling lifelong poverty (and drag as many other's into their pit for company as humanly possible); or to cling to religious belief-systems that have long since been corrupted by the mere fact that they're officially accepted by mainstream society...a society that by design horrendously diminishes our human potential.\"", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hfkqfk3", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world itself isn&amp;#39;t strictly non-fiction.

A narrative we tell ourselves, individually or collectively as a culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From that reputation page linked above:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In a review of the work of Castaneda, published in a early 1973 edition of the Village Voice, excerpted in Tales of Fictive Power: Dreaming and Imagination in Ronald Sukenick&amp;#39;s Postmodern Fiction, by Daniel C. Noel, which was also featured in the later published work Why Nothing Works: The Anthropology of Daily Life, by Marvin Harris source; we see that even some of those who consider Castaneda&amp;#39;s work fiction still understand that a story format was the optimal way to relate such knowledge to readers still mired in this reality, which we erroneously cling to as the ultimate truth...when we subconsciously know that it is also just a convincing story we&amp;#39;ve learned to collectively tell ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Once philosophy was stories, religion was stories, wisdom books were stories, but now that fiction is held to be a form of lying, even by literary sophisticates, we are without persuasive wisdom, religion, or philosophy. Don Juan shows us that we live in fictions, and that we live best when we learn to master the art...The sorcerer, the artist, sees beyond any particular form fiction may take to the fictive power itself, and in the absence of fictive power in our lives, maybe it&amp;#39;s time for all of us to become sorcerers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To further hit home the necessity of a literary narrative, instead of a manual format, to present the nature of the separate reality of the second attention to readers, and the mixed-reality of the events of his actual life, from his perspective; Castaneda wrote a book prior to The Teachings of don Juan entitled The Crack Between the Worlds. It was an &amp;quot;instruction&amp;quot; book. He lost the manuscript in a movie theater, and took it as a sign to not write another purely procedural book, and to instead employ a narrative approach into which the functional techniques and direct perceptual observations were integrated, if he was to be successful at properly relating the knowledge he had been tasked with propagating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way to counter-act a delusional narrative, that this reality is the only possible true one, is with an equally powerful and personally-demonstrative narrative; one in which the reader can actually operate and readily discover elements of other realities, which will eat away at the certainties that we&amp;#39;ve been led to believe are inviolable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why people who &amp;quot;get Castaneda&amp;quot; often say that his work is a gift, while the detractors stomp on that gift and fight to remain in crippling lifelong poverty (and drag as many other&amp;#39;s into their pit for company as humanly possible); or to cling to religious belief-systems that have long since been corrupted by the mere fact that they&amp;#39;re officially accepted by mainstream society...a society that by design horrendously diminishes our human potential.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_q2by4s", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/q2by4s/deleted_by_user/hfkqfk3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1633501581.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1633501581.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 0}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hfkpkuy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hfkozs7", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/q2by4s/deleted_by_user/hfkpkuy/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hfkpkuy", "created": 1633500900.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1633500900.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hfkozs7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hfko5n2", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Wasn't me.

With it&amp;#39;s own story, which you can examine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the instant you are not &amp;quot;swimming in it&amp;quot;, you can&amp;#39;t come up with even a single word to explain what you were just experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll have to see it, to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll use an analogy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Spirit&amp;quot; is like a wild animal we&amp;#39;re trying to lure over, because it has magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent is the same thing, but it&amp;#39;s more like the technology the spirit uses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like his pliers, saw,  and hammer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want the spirit to come over, because it&amp;#39;s super cool and all powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he does, we&amp;#39;d love to steal his tool bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t need to, because darkroom searches all over, so you can find the tools he drooped.  You pick those up as you find them, and learn to manipulate &amp;quot;the emanations&amp;quot; all by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract is like a glue that connects the spirit and intent, to other &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; that seem completely unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once they are connected, and you can perceive that structure, it becomes a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something impossible to explain or even describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can only swim in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While swimming in it, the internal dialogue cannot continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t understand these the way you&amp;#39;d understand Sadhguru explaining vedic writings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is real.  Not something a scholar wrote, to which you can aspire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can only do or experience these things directly, or they&amp;#39;re useless to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, since they come from a different position of the assemblage point, they&amp;#39;re actually harmful to non-sorcerers who become aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example I just thought up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Artists who get their hands on some good ganga, are famous for having an idea for a painting, getting super excited, and anxious to draw it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then tomorrow comes, and none of it can be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most by then, can&amp;#39;t even be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually a well known thing in art schools.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s impossible to reproduce, but it comes up often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the classic huntington beach stoners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;surfer dudes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re getting high on a bench looking over the ocean at the sunset and one will say,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dude, I just realized.  It&amp;#39;s all like a cracker.  All of it!  Don&amp;#39;t you see it!  Look out  there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other just says, &amp;quot;Man, that&amp;#39;s deep.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qnacm3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qnacm3/are_you_important/hkgzq7h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1636821054.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1636821054.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hkfxxhl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "lucidself", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1636797900.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hjfcnas", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8jkh8kud", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Hey what do you mean \u201cswimming in the abstract\u201d?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hkfxxhl", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey what do you mean \u201cswimming in the abstract\u201d?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qnacm3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qnacm3/are_you_important/hkfxxhl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1636797900.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hjfcnas", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1636126299.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_qnacm3", "score": 14, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "This quote only makes you feel more important...\n\nThe only way to solve self-importance is to eliminate the internal dialogue.\n\nBut people obsessed with inspirational quotes, are trying to sooth the internal dialogue.\n\nNot get rid of it.\n\nBy the way, it's possible to not only eliminate the internal dialogue, but eliminate all of yourself.\n\nAnd still be aware.\n\nYou just go swimming in the abstract.\n\nI'm not sure if you can come back from that.

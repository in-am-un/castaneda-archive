I don't know much about the books of Castaneda, but I plan on reading some of them. I recall starting one of his books a few years ago. I do wonder of what you think about some events that happened in my life: \n\nIn my country and my generation, Castaneda work is not so well known. I have only met one people interested in him. \n\nThis guy is a scientist, specialist in medicinal plants and ecology. I have been to his house a few times, he lives in the forest. \n\nBeautiful wooden house, in a small village in the mountains. In the village, they call him the \"sorcerer\". \n\nWe usually just talk all night long. He drinks a lot and smokes cannabis. He never seems tired. He can shout when he is pissed of, but it is weirdly not scary when it does it. He told me about Castaneda onces and that he could do magic, but chose not to do it. He told me once he made someone nosebleed. He also seems to know by heart, a crazy lot of poetry. There's a real energy from him that is  hard to explain. \n\nDoes that seem like real sorcery that you guys are talking about? \n\nHere's another encounter. I have another friend in the mountains, she bought a little house with a big old forest. I spent a week with her and another female friend of her. They did not talk about Castaneda, but I am pretty sure they must have been involved with it. They talked a lot about energy and seeing people in the forest, travelling to different world. \n\nBut I can remember especially this: They both told me that they could not see trough me. Like I had a shield or something and that it was quite unusual. Also this is a forest with a lot of history and big rocks and I naturally went to sit on a certain rock. The owner said it was strange I sat there because it was known as the druid chair.

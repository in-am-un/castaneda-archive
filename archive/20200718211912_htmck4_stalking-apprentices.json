He\u2019s not a good man.\u201d\n\nOut of fairness to Howard, what he said would be the truth from a normal point of view. And the last thing he wanted was for Marshall\u2019s daughter to have a bad experience with Carlos.\n\nCarlos and the witches were probably even studying with Howard at the time.  And Howard might be the reason for their inclusion in martial arts association picnics.\n\nHoward was close to Marshall's family.  Like a real member.\n\nAnd Howard knew, Carlos did not have traditional relationships with women.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t. Those suck up all of your time and energy.\n\nFor sorcerers, things are not so simple as \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d.\n\nLikewise, teaching is not so simple for sorcerers. You can\u2019t learn sorcery by any normal method.\n\nYou can\u2019t memorize a list of facts in order to learn sorcery.\n\nYou can\u2019t attend regular classes to their completion, and learn sorcery.\n\nYou can\u2019t even practice with your friends, and learn sorcery.\n\nYou only learn it when you yourself decide to learn it, and push hard to accomplish that.\n\nCommitment is the only way to learn sorcery.\n\nBecause of that, apprentices are big trouble. \u201cTeaching\u201d them is nearly impossible.\n\nIt\u2019s why don Juan never asked permission. He simply tricked people into learning, if they had the kind of energy he was looking for.\n\nAnd he put them into a higher state of consciousness, where he had no trouble teaching them.\n\nAnd which they\u2019d forget.\n\nAll he needed was a cover story, to keep Carlos coming back.\n\nIn the case of Carlos, he appealed to his \u201cbook deal mind\u201d.\n\nBook deal, you ask?  Didn\u2019t I say that was bad?\n\nYes, it is.\n\nExcept in this case, don Juan was teaching him in secret, by moving his assemblage point.\n\nThe book deal mind kept Carlos around, rather than prevent him from learning as it does with today\u2019s Castaneda followers.\n\nAlways with their mind on fame, the men are.\n\nIt\u2019s logical.\n\nWe\u2019re basically hunters and gatherers, with the men being the hunters, and the women the gatherers.\n\nOur evolution has made those roles natural for us.\n\nAnd the hunters like to brag about their hunts. They get competitive.\n\nThey have to! Hunting is basically competing with the animals you hunt, so the more competitive the man, the better the hunter.\n\nAs gatherers, the women are completely different. Their job is to understand the natural environment. Where they live, and how to interface to it.\n\nAnd to make things used to transport the food back to camp and store it.\n\nBaskets, clay jars, animal skin containers.  Ways to prepare the seeds they find, such as grinding stones and washing basins.\n\nAll that takes corporation with the tribe.\n\nThe bottom line is, men and women think differently.\n\nAnd that became obvious in private classes, if you listened carefully to the rumors.\n\nCarlos was romancing the women.\n\nBut not in the way you\u2019d think. And, he had help from the witches.\n\nHow the men came to be there, I\u2019m not well aware of.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t any tasty rumor to spread about Carlos and his bad behavior with the men.\n\nSo I never picked up any details on how they ended up in there.\n\nBut with the women, there were plenty of rumors.\n\nCarlos separating women from their husbands, Carlos giving them naked baths in rosemary water, Carlos telling the women to expose themselves up at the sorcerer\u2019s cave in Malibu, having them shave patterns in their pubic hair, and  women having to cut their hair to look like a little boy if they wanted to remain in private classes.\n\nIt\u2019s all the sort of stuff you can put into a fake biography of Carlos, if you want to make him look like a fraud. And you\u2019re too lazy to look around in here, and find actual material for a biography.\n\nA lot of that is in Spanish.    Hopefully we have a budding real Carlos biographer in here, who isn't too lazy to translate things.\n\nBut to get those kinds of complaints about Carlos, you only need interview his former students.\n\nI was even on a list of people to interview, for an upcoming phony biography.\n\nFormer classmates are full of complaints.\n\nNo actual magic. Nothing learned.\n\nBut they have plenty of anger and suspicion, exactly as the Little Sisters and the Genaros did, in Second Ring of Power.\n\nI think it\u2019s best to just air the rumors, like a vaccine against them causing anyone to stop practicing.\n\nI greatly wish we could get some of the women from private classes to come here and reminisce, but so far I\u2019ve been unable.\n\nToo many \u201cshenanigans\u201d going on, I\u2019ve been told more than once.\n\nBut what Shenanigans?\n\nAs best I can make out, here\u2019s how it went.\n\nWomen had to be sponsored. One of the women already in and close to Carlos had to bring them.\n\nThey\u2019d be taken to meet Carlos, who would examine them energetically and decide their fate.\n\nIf during the process of getting closer they gave any indications of lack of commitment, they could be, and were, tossed out.\n\nA famous incident involves the founder of Blue Bird Bakery.\n\nGiven a symbolic gift of shoes, she turned up her nose.\n\nAnd was expelled.\n\nCholita was brought up from the peyote fields in Mexico, via Margarette.\n\nDuring the discussion she had with Carlos following her moving to LA he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be intimate with you one way or the other.\u201d\n\nBut he never actually touched her.\n\nHe got her a job, made her continue to work and support herself for nearly a year, let her come to private classes just enough to make her want more, then shut her out until she\u2019d learned to be a bit more responsible, stop smoking, and cut her long hair short.\n\nAs Cholita told me, it was shocking what a difference cutting her hair made. No more men longing after her in the streets.\n\nShe got gifts and visits from the witches.\n\nThey basically dolled out enough attention to keep her happy, and insisted she prove her commitment to the cause.\n\nI on the other hand cannot get any kind of commitment from Cholita.\n\nShe's obsessed with finding a new relationship.  A new lifestyle that agrees with her.\n\nLiving with a crazy old man does not.\n\nBut how do women prove their commitment?\n\nIf you\u2019re a guy and you have to ask that, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nYou should visit Thailand and get some of what you\u2019ve been missing. There\u2019s no shortage there.\n\nAnd if you're a women's libber, please don't beat me for saying this.\n\nYes, everyone should do what they want.  Have the same opportunities.\n\nAnd there are always differences in people.  I can easily think of 2 women in private classes, who were there out of intellectual curiosity.\n\nBut normally, women commit with their bodies.\n\nI\u2019m sure there must be a better way to put that, but in the case of private classes, that\u2019s exactly how commitment was shown.\n\nThe women were \u201cromanced\u201d.\n\nI dare to say, the same thing must have happened with don Juan and his apprentices. There\u2019s a reference to it in the books, where one of the female apprentices thinks of don Juan as \u201cher man\u201d.\n\nMy guess is, there\u2019s an unwritten \u201capprentice stalking\u201d body of knowledge in don Juan\u2019s lineage.\n\nThe only way we can learn about it now, is via re-runs of class members.\n\nI suspect we\u2019ll find out it was largely formula driven.\n\nBring the woman to meet Carlos, via another woman she trusts.\n\nFind out how she\u2019ll fit into things, which will include gifts, and proof of intimacy.\n\nAnd ownership of her body, through advising celibacy, cutting her hair, and changing her style of dress.\n\nThey even made women afraid of the boogeyman, with stories about the worms you can get stuck in you, if you have sex.\n\nAs sinister as all that may sound, it would produce much better results than what might be considered proper.\n\nWomen are super talented. Men are not.\n\nIf women commit to practice, they get results.\n\nWith the men, maybe not.\n\nThe men are book deal minded, so their practice time can be more like paying the price, for that future book deal.\n\nPutting in your time, to get something else.\n\nYou can\u2019t learn sorcery that way! It just won\u2019t work.\n\nIntent won\u2019t help you out, if you say you want one thing, but really want something else.\n\nIntent won\u2019t help you out, if while you are supposedly practicing, you\u2019re really building your own \u201csystem\u201d, so you can be famous too.\n\nSo male apprentices have to be fully tricked. Taught on the sly. Distracted with something that appeals to men.\n\nThe women on the other hand, maybe only need to commit. It becomes a lifestyle for them, and if they fit practice time into that schedule, good things will happen.\n\nWomen have no trouble moving their assemblage points. It already moves monthly.  To get them to move it further, they only need a reason that makes sense.\n\nAnd they need to trust whoever is advising them to move it further.\n\nCholita is the example of what talented women can do.\n\nShe\u2019s a powerful witch, but barely aware of that.\n\nShe\u2019s only that way because she kept practicing all these years.\n\nShe even kept her hair short.\n\nSomeday, I hope we know more about how each of the women came to be in private classes.\n\nBut one thing I\u2019m sure of, however Carlos and the witches dealt with students was part of a larger understanding of how to deal with apprentices.\n\nA good example of that, is the tradition of giving apprentices to the inorganic beings by putting them into box and offering them.\n\nWhere's that part of the rule, in the books?\n\nLeft out on purpose.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stalking Apprentices", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_htmck4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1595099952.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t really have enough info on this to write a good post, but it\u2019s still important for people to realize there&amp;#39;s an interesting topic here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, at a picnic hosted by Marshall Hoo\u2019s Tai Chi organization, one of his daughters was looking across the field and saw Carlos with a young woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she told me, he often had a new young woman on his arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howard Lee turned to her and said something like, \u201cStay away from him.

I have been an avid lucid dreamer (still am) and psychedelics partaker. A lot of stuff on there resonated with me, but I did not see any real advancement neither in terms of my experience of reality nor conceptual understanding (in fact I became more confused haha). \n\nThere is something about realizing that we forgot our \"true nature\" and that we live in the proverbial matrix that is almost satisfying on its own that we don't really do anything about it. This realization is actually very simple and common, I had it when I was like 15 doing mushrooms. I definitely had a thing or two to say about grasp of society on an individual, and you see it resonate through out popular media in all sort of shapes and forms. This is why realization like that is just a first step, how you engage with it and what you do about it is what is interesting. \n\nIt certainly is a problem that there is little language surrounding this topic. I would even go as far as say that we were socialized to have a limited view of \"true nature\". For either malicious reason (selfishness/need for superiority) or possibly out of ignorance we have been mislead. That is why as you said one's direct experience of reality can be the \"enlightening factor\", but which direction you take your experience is also important. The last point there is in my opinion the benefit of this community, strong emphasis on practice (to have one's own experiences), other peoples experiences (and the books) helps with direction and serves as a useful map. \n\nI use to do a lot of mindfulness mediation, following my breath, doing body scans, and ultimately learning natural awareness (becoming mindful throughout my life). I have experienced ego loss states, and the associated liberation from suffering. Through the use of dissociative drugs I went deeper. I didn't know I can lose my sense of body entirely, and become an infinitesimally small point of consciousness floating though infinity, and then expanding to take up the whole universe. Its quite a shock to come back to normal state of awareness after that. For the longest time I was attracted to such extreme dissociation. Until, I managed to attain it without drugs, for the first time couple months ago, maybe a month or two after finding this community. Because I was able to attain it organically I had much better memory of it. Although I am so dissociated that I don't have perception of the body, I don't know who I am or where I am, I still wanted to know what is happening, I was curious and because of that I was confused. It is that curiosity that reveals our \"true nature\" in my opinion. We are born to explore, to be open to experience. That is what children do, they learn and play, building and discarding models of the world on a whim. At the same time, they are socialized to follow specific goals. This makes them stop exploring and they lose touch with that nature. To me sorcery is all about re-establishing and exercising that connection. In fact I believe this mode of existence is synonymous with second attention. \n\nThe \"true nature\" is so free, and inversely, the socialization is so complete that we don't even realize that our very conscious experience has been captured to remain in a very tight band of possibilities. And realizing it is not enough! You need to literally break down the habits of thought and perception, while at the same time establishing a strong link with your intent to truly liberate your self.\n\nYou can surpass your body, transform it into objects, animals, other persons, places, and even divine beings. You can manifest alternate realities, some that are very alien to the one we are familiar with, and you can act in those realities. You can interact with beings not of this world, and you can often bring back knowledge that is just inaccessible to you in a normal state of awareness. You can of course also be open to experience and see the world \"as it is\" without social conditioning. To me some of this stuff falls into true \"magic\" category. But if some of it is magical, all of it must be magical, even normal conditioned consciousness. \n\nI experienced some of the most horrific things, have been scared shitless many times, but I also got to travel to most peculiar places, dance with divine beings, enter mind of god, transform into animals, do acrobatics that defy physics, the list goes on. There is an aspect of our selves to which all these experiences are acceptable. If you are capable of experiencing one you will want to experience more. Once you start on the journey it will keep rewarding you. In fact, I think lack of exploring that happens due to socialization is a great source of suffering in our society. \n\nThere are many ways in which a person can reconnect with this process. But Castaneda seems to provide the most \"complete\" description of what is possible and in a most accessible way that I am aware of so far. I am also very interested in Hinduism as they definitely went as far, but the teachings are incredibly inaccessible. Curiously I have been able to understand Hindu teachings way better after spending a lot of time here, and think I can now learn a lot more from them.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gw8qjcb", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I certainly had lots of interesting things happen to be before I came to Zen subreddit.

The last point there is in my opinion the benefit of this community, strong emphasis on practice (to have one&amp;#39;s own experiences), other peoples experiences (and the books) helps with direction and serves as a useful map. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use to do a lot of mindfulness mediation, following my breath, doing body scans, and ultimately learning natural awareness (becoming mindful throughout my life). I have experienced ego loss states, and the associated liberation from suffering. Through the use of dissociative drugs I went deeper. I didn&amp;#39;t know I can lose my sense of body entirely, and become an infinitesimally small point of consciousness floating though infinity, and then expanding to take up the whole universe. Its quite a shock to come back to normal state of awareness after that. For the longest time I was attracted to such extreme dissociation. Until, I managed to attain it without drugs, for the first time couple months ago, maybe a month or two after finding this community. Because I was able to attain it organically I had much better memory of it. Although I am so dissociated that I don&amp;#39;t have perception of the body, I don&amp;#39;t know who I am or where I am, I still wanted to know what is happening, I was curious and because of that I was confused. It is that curiosity that reveals our &amp;quot;true nature&amp;quot; in my opinion. We are born to explore, to be open to experience. That is what children do, they learn and play, building and discarding models of the world on a whim. At the same time, they are socialized to follow specific goals. This makes them stop exploring and they lose touch with that nature. To me sorcery is all about re-establishing and exercising that connection. In fact I believe this mode of existence is synonymous with second attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;true nature&amp;quot; is so free, and inversely, the socialization is so complete that we don&amp;#39;t even realize that our very conscious experience has been captured to remain in a very tight band of possibilities. And realizing it is not enough! You need to literally break down the habits of thought and perception, while at the same time establishing a strong link with your intent to truly liberate your self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can surpass your body, transform it into objects, animals, other persons, places, and even divine beings. You can manifest alternate realities, some that are very alien to the one we are familiar with, and you can act in those realities. You can interact with beings not of this world, and you can often bring back knowledge that is just inaccessible to you in a normal state of awareness. You can of course also be open to experience and see the world &amp;quot;as it is&amp;quot; without social conditioning. To me some of this stuff falls into true &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; category. But if some of it is magical, all of it must be magical, even normal conditioned consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I experienced some of the most horrific things, have been scared shitless many times, but I also got to travel to most peculiar places, dance with divine beings, enter mind of god, transform into animals, do acrobatics that defy physics, the list goes on. There is an aspect of our selves to which all these experiences are acceptable. If you are capable of experiencing one you will want to experience more. Once you start on the journey it will keep rewarding you. In fact, I think lack of exploring that happens due to socialization is a great source of suffering in our society. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many ways in which a person can reconnect with this process. But Castaneda seems to provide the most &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; description of what is possible and in a most accessible way that I am aware of so far. I am also very interested in Hinduism as they definitely went as far, but the teachings are incredibly inaccessible. Curiously I have been able to understand Hindu teachings way better after spending a lot of time here, and think I can now learn a lot more from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mzivtf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mzivtf/zen/gw8qjcb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619658021.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1619658021.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gw5k489", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "sneakpeekbot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gw5k3pk", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_140r4p", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Here's a sneak peek of /r/zen using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/zen/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year!\n\n\\#1: [Thought this might be useful here.](https://i.redd.it/mws67j4whxw41.png) | [98 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/gdvqy9/thought_this_might_be_useful_here/)  \n\\#2: [Alan Watts' books on zen are some of the most profound works I've ever read.

Is it just to build up your sorcery skills or do you start seeing beneficial things manifesting in all aspects of your life? What about people that use sorcery for personal gains?

I didn&amp;#39;t really read it in detail or try to understand it much at this stage but it&amp;#39;s definitely something I&amp;#39;m going to refer to. Is that also from the books, or is it from the private classes, or your own discovery? I&amp;#39;m even thinking about showing it to this being I&amp;#39;ve mentioned to you, to see what they think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  Then, that living force &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; starts directing your life for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sounds pretty freaky. Not in a bad way. Just in a kind of trippy way. Lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  That&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;. Playing a game with us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do you have a specific motivation of playing this game every night? Is it just to build up your sorcery skills or do you start seeing beneficial things manifesting in all aspects of your life? What about people that use sorcery for personal gains? Such as trying to make more money? I&amp;#39;ve come across some Esoteric and Occult groups, on the internet, where people are trying to summon demons and use spells to attract material gains in their life. I know that has nothing to do with Carlos&amp;#39;s work but just thought I&amp;#39;ll throw that out there to see what you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the enriching discussion!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mzivtf", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mzivtf/zen/gwey2hy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619783229.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gw87a01", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gw71qco", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;Would you say that for you it's either Sorcery or Bust? \n\nI'd say, it's sorcery or suffer endlessly.\n\nThe myth of \"find a mate, settle down, have children\", NEVER produces happiness.\n\nBut you have to be an old man like me to notice that.\n\nWomen will almost never admit that, because they're still hopeful for a pay off.\n\nBy the way, there is a \"Zen\" state.

As in, I'm not saying that what you're saying is absurd, silly, and laughable, but the fact that for someone who has been running around, chasing things that the world has been telling them to chase, and beating and killing themselves for not suceeding as per the world's expectations, one would want to cry and pull their hair out at the way they were raised and made to live.\n\nSomeone in the Zen forum said something very interesting, he said you have no option, it's either Enlightenment or Bust. Would you say that for you it's either Sorcery or Bust? If you don't stop the internal dialogue and get into sorcery, or reclaim or your original nature as a sorcerer, you're doomed to be a zombie like puppet living in a matrix reality where the strings are being pulled by a few rich and powerful social, religious, political, and industrial leaders? All this brainwashing that we pass down from generation to generation can literally be put an end in an instant. But, of course, that means the entire world as we know it will also end. Everyone will lose the plot...This is, at least, stable and offers some hope and security, and of course, most importantly, something to believe in, and something to belong to. Which, are all, of course, delusions, and states of ignorance. Because nothing is certain, nothing is real (as in permanent), and if you believe anything other than what your own inner wisdom is telling you, you'll always be thrown around by the world, be it people, or nature.\n\n\\&gt;  The universe, for us, is a series of \"intent bubbles\". Things others did to create something, \"real\", which we can share.\n\nThat's pretty interesting. I don't quite get it. What I'm wondering though is that these \"others\", at some point they didn't actually exist, right? So at that time, it would be the universe itself that was creating these \"intent bubbles\"? Isn't that what the reference to the Eagle is? A sort of indescribable force, from which everything emanates? It sounds pretty much like it's the one and same as what we refer to as God.\n\nYes, I agree that yoga practioners are nowhere near the level of sorcery that is explained in Carlos's book, and there's a very good reason for that, whether that reason is actually good or bad. The reason, and again, I don't know if it's based on a fallacy, but it's because in the world of Yoga, Self-Realization is the ultimate goal, and psychic or spiritual abilities that Yogi's experience or come across, during their practices are to be discarded and ignored, as it get's in the way of this self-realization. See how this makes the whole thing confusing, all over again? Basically, people are being told to dismiss any esoteric and mystical experiences, and go straight to the essence of the truth. This almost seems to be in line with what Zen Masters said, who even when speaking of such elements of reality happily brushed it aside. For example, there's some conversation where someone goes to a Zen Master and tells them that after years of practicing they're able to walk on water and cross the river. To which the Zen Master replies \"wouldn't it have been easier and faster to build a bridge?\". So it's this kind of silly, pragmatic profoundity that really elevated true Zen Masters from the mentality of everyone else. Or there's another one where a Zen Master goes, \"my miracle is when I'm hungry I eat, when I'm tired I sleep\". You can't help but chuckle and smile when you hear such stuff. So basically, if I understand them correctly, it's about flushing out all the \"noise\" from your mind, and just being yourself. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\nI wish I had more to say about all your cool experiences with sorcery but I'm really nowhere in that sense. I'm very happy to hear of it, of course.\n\nI've mentioned before that I'm in touch with someone who was introduced to Carlo's book, when they were 15 (they're in their mid 60s now), here in India. I haven't spoken to them much about any of it, nor do they seem to be into any of the stuff I've come across in this sub. I don't mind sharing the little they've told me, however, in case it interests you. They've spoken to me about Astral Projecting and Lucid Dreaming, and the examples they've given me have been:\n\n1. They'll find an object in our shared waking world, e.g. an Eagle, which they'll \"imprint\" in their memory. Then when they enter into Dreaming, they'll find this Eagle, and they can basically travel around the sky through the eyes of this Eagle. As in, what they mean to say is ,they can see what the Eagle is actually seeing in our waking reality, but in their dreaming reality.\n2. They'll see a place on TV, like say the National Geographic, a beautiful and exotic place, and again, they can basically find this place in their Dreams and have a real experience of it.\n\nI have no idea about the exact technicalities and methods they employ. \n\nI'm not sure if surpasses the level of what people are capable of here or below it, but from what I've gathered from them is that sorcery is no competition or race, and they're simply having fun with it and not trying to be serious or achieve everything with it. Almost like a \"to each his own\" sort of approach to it.\n\nIn Don Juan's and Carlos's case I can see there was an actual goal to relay this knowledge to the modern and western world, which is why it seemed to be like such a big deal for Carlos to understand everything that DJ was showing and teaching.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gw71qco", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  I has the &amp;quot;swiss cheese&amp;quot; of phantom bedrooms last night.

Things others did to create something, &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, which we can share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty interesting. I don&amp;#39;t quite get it. What I&amp;#39;m wondering though is that these &amp;quot;others&amp;quot;, at some point they didn&amp;#39;t actually exist, right? So at that time, it would be the universe itself that was creating these &amp;quot;intent bubbles&amp;quot;? Isn&amp;#39;t that what the reference to the Eagle is? A sort of indescribable force, from which everything emanates? It sounds pretty much like it&amp;#39;s the one and same as what we refer to as God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I agree that yoga practioners are nowhere near the level of sorcery that is explained in Carlos&amp;#39;s book, and there&amp;#39;s a very good reason for that, whether that reason is actually good or bad. The reason, and again, I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s based on a fallacy, but it&amp;#39;s because in the world of Yoga, Self-Realization is the ultimate goal, and psychic or spiritual abilities that Yogi&amp;#39;s experience or come across, during their practices are to be discarded and ignored, as it get&amp;#39;s in the way of this self-realization. See how this makes the whole thing confusing, all over again? Basically, people are being told to dismiss any esoteric and mystical experiences, and go straight to the essence of the truth. This almost seems to be in line with what Zen Masters said, who even when speaking of such elements of reality happily brushed it aside. For example, there&amp;#39;s some conversation where someone goes to a Zen Master and tells them that after years of practicing they&amp;#39;re able to walk on water and cross the river. To which the Zen Master replies &amp;quot;wouldn&amp;#39;t it have been easier and faster to build a bridge?&amp;quot;. So it&amp;#39;s this kind of silly, pragmatic profoundity that really elevated true Zen Masters from the mentality of everyone else. Or there&amp;#39;s another one where a Zen Master goes, &amp;quot;my miracle is when I&amp;#39;m hungry I eat, when I&amp;#39;m tired I sleep&amp;quot;. You can&amp;#39;t help but chuckle and smile when you hear such stuff. So basically, if I understand them correctly, it&amp;#39;s about flushing out all the &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot; from your mind, and just being yourself. Nothing more and nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I had more to say about all your cool experiences with sorcery but I&amp;#39;m really nowhere in that sense. I&amp;#39;m very happy to hear of it, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before that I&amp;#39;m in touch with someone who was introduced to Carlo&amp;#39;s book, when they were 15 (they&amp;#39;re in their mid 60s now), here in India. I haven&amp;#39;t spoken to them much about any of it, nor do they seem to be into any of the stuff I&amp;#39;ve come across in this sub. I don&amp;#39;t mind sharing the little they&amp;#39;ve told me, however, in case it interests you. They&amp;#39;ve spoken to me about Astral Projecting and Lucid Dreaming, and the examples they&amp;#39;ve given me have been:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#39;ll find an object in our shared waking world, e.g. an Eagle, which they&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;imprint&amp;quot; in their memory. Then when they enter into Dreaming, they&amp;#39;ll find this Eagle, and they can basically travel around the sky through the eyes of this Eagle. As in, what they mean to say is ,they can see what the Eagle is actually seeing in our waking reality, but in their dreaming reality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#39;ll see a place on TV, like say the National Geographic, a beautiful and exotic place, and again, they can basically find this place in their Dreams and have a real experience of it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea about the exact technicalities and methods they employ. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if surpasses the level of what people are capable of here or below it, but from what I&amp;#39;ve gathered from them is that sorcery is no competition or race, and they&amp;#39;re simply having fun with it and not trying to be serious or achieve everything with it. Almost like a &amp;quot;to each his own&amp;quot; sort of approach to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Don Juan&amp;#39;s and Carlos&amp;#39;s case I can see there was an actual goal to relay this knowledge to the modern and western world, which is why it seemed to be like such a big deal for Carlos to understand everything that DJ was showing and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mzivtf", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mzivtf/zen/gw71qco/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619630954.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1619630954.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gw6t3yg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gw6pl58", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;If nothing is permanent, or everything is impermanent, which is their own premise, then how can Enlightenment be permanent\n\nThat's become a popular westernized Buddhist master argument.

You mean the classical Jungian argument between a Zen master and a Yogi, about permanence?\n\nIsn't that universal knowledge?

I'm sure she's been waiting around for you to be available.\n\nPicture this: Last night I was trying to get all 3 of my inorganic beings to be present in the second attention fog, within a half hour period.  To test if I could have 3, like Vicente.\n\n\"Fancy\" got it.  She understood, so she gave me a fashion show to prove it was her.\n\nI couldn't find \"Mystery\". That's my worry.  But Cholita brought him to me, so maybe she has him back most of the time.\n\n\"Noname\" showed up on a purple streak of brilliant light, with jagged edges. It was like a long twisted nearly ultraviolet lightning bolt floating around the room, with his face and shoulders on the leading edge. It swirled back and forth, left and right, pulling me very far along the J curve.\n\nHe showed me how to enter dreams, how to enter the energy body, how to enter the dreaming double, and how to increase dream vividness.\n\nBut before anyone gets excited about entering the double, I was too far o ut there to understand how he did it.  He only wanted to show me what it felt like. That was his lesson, what \"depth\" feels like.\n\nHe called it, \"here and there\" (from Don Juan's explanation), and said that included all of the techniques the old seers used to assemble alternate worlds.  Here's the quote on what those guys knew how to do.  According to Noname, all they were doing is making \"there\" become \"here\".  And you only need to find \"things\" in the there, and focus on those, and forget the \"things\" in the current \"here\".\n\nHere's don Juan on the same topic, although it's not obvious:\n\n\"The inorganic beings tricked you and Carol Tiggs in your last journey by helping you two to get total cohesion on a grand shift,\" don Juan said.\n\n\"They displaced your assemblage points to the farthest possible spot, then helped you perceive there as if you were in your daily world. A nearly impossible thing. To do that type of perceiving a sorcerer needs pragmatic knowledge, or influential friends.\n\n\"Your friends would have betrayed you in the end and left you and Carol to fend for yourselves and leam pragmatic measures in order to survive in that world. You two would have ended filled to the brim with pragmatic procedures, just like those most knowledgeable old sorcerers.\n\n\"Every grand shift has different inner workings,\" he continued, \"which modern sorcerers could learn if they knew how to fixate the assemblage point long enough at any grand shift.

Most deny those exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard Joshu Sasaki, a fairly famous zen master in LA who lived beyond 104 (I lost track), say to new students, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t expect to fly to the sun!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What?  You should DEMAND to fly to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was clueless. Or, a liar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over in the Zen subreddit, I only run into anger and denial, and if you reason with them a bit about magic and point them here, they claim it&amp;#39;s evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, if you know anything about Asia, you&amp;#39;d stay away from Asian religions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to stay there a while to realize how bad it is.  And even then you probably need a tour guide who&amp;#39;s a local, and doesn&amp;#39;t keep secrets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve chatted a bit in this subreddit about the horrors of Asia, Daoism, and Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, I get attacked based on them claiming those  horrors are mine, just because I speak up about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Americans have their heads in sand when it comes to understanding the east.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I&amp;#39;m also quick to panic and flee&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get an IOB as fast as you can then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bring that one from childhood back. I&amp;#39;m sure she&amp;#39;s been waiting around for you to be available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Picture this: Last night I was trying to get all 3 of my inorganic beings to be present in the second attention fog, within a half hour period.  To test if I could have 3, like Vicente.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; got it.  She understood, so she gave me a fashion show to prove it was her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s my worry.  But Cholita brought him to me, so maybe she has him back most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Noname&amp;quot; showed up on a purple streak of brilliant light, with jagged edges. It was like a long twisted nearly ultraviolet lightning bolt floating around the room, with his face and shoulders on the leading edge. It swirled back and forth, left and right, pulling me very far along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He showed me how to enter dreams, how to enter the energy body, how to enter the dreaming double, and how to increase dream vividness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before anyone gets excited about entering the double, I was too far o ut there to understand how he did it.  He only wanted to show me what it felt like. That was his lesson, what &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; feels like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He called it, &amp;quot;here and there&amp;quot; (from Don Juan&amp;#39;s explanation), and said that included all of the techniques the old seers used to assemble alternate worlds.  Here&amp;#39;s the quote on what those guys knew how to do.  According to Noname, all they were doing is making &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; become &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;.  And you only need to find &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; in the there, and focus on those, and forget the &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; in the current &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s don Juan on the same topic, although it&amp;#39;s not obvious:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The inorganic beings tricked you and Carol Tiggs in your last journey by helping you two to get total cohesion on a grand shift,&amp;quot; don Juan said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They displaced your assemblage points to the farthest possible spot, then helped you perceive there as if you were in your daily world. A nearly impossible thing. To do that type of perceiving a sorcerer needs pragmatic knowledge, or influential friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your friends would have betrayed you in the end and left you and Carol to fend for yourselves and leam pragmatic measures in order to survive in that world. You two would have ended filled to the brim with pragmatic procedures, just like those most knowledgeable old sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every grand shift has different inner workings,&amp;quot; he continued, &amp;quot;which modern sorcerers could learn if they knew how to fixate the assemblage point long enough at any grand shift.

If a Zen Master is not willing to be humble enough to admit he doesn't have the capabilities that others have simply because he has not developed them, or lacks the ability to do so, he is no Zen Master, in my eyes.

Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts. I don't disagree with you one bit.\n\nSo, basically, first, let's clear up our miscommunication.\n\nTo my knowledge, when they say the Mind is already Englightened, and there is nothing *to do*, they are not referring to learning skills or abilities. I think what they're saying is that your own mind already knows what skills it needs to learn and develop on as it interacts with life, and what your interests and disinterests are, and what motivates you to do certain things vs other things. So, far example, an ignorant person, or someone that doesn't have conviction in their own mind, or own \"spirit\" might ask themselves, \"What would Jesus do? or What would Don Juan do? or What would and Enlightened person do?\" Or they'll just sit around and panic and do nothing, or they'll delude themselves to do something stupid and dangerous. And it's that sort of thinking that shifts a person from their naturally enlightened mind to a \"seeking mind\". But remember these are all words, that are essentially abstract in nature, so some misunderstandings can arise as we exchange them. We are not talking about seeking things, but seeking mind. Like people are basically seeking a state in their mind that they hope will give them what they want but it never quite does because no state is permanent.\n\nThank you for sharing your knowledge on sorcery. I'm really, really interested in learning more about it.\n\nSo going back to what you said, absolutely! There is no way you can learn sorcery or even how to tie your shoelaces without putting in some mental effort / concentration towards it.\n\nSo, when your perception and your realtionship with the world changes, then what happens? What is your motivation in bringing about this change? I need to read more of Carlos's books, I've only read the first three books, to get a better understanding of heightened awareness.\n\nSo, one can move their assemblage point at will, but there are no procedures for that, other than observing or interacting with your own mind? And after that you just gain a natural ability to do so, unique to you?\n\nSo, no, the spending 10 years in a temple thinking you have anything to do, in order to find or attain that enlightened mind should be attributed to religious deception or just a misunderstanding, in my opinion.\n\nSo the way you describe the ordinary person, it seems to be the position of the average person out there, and the way you describe heightened awareness, it seems to be reflective of, not only sorcerers, but even Saints, Sages, Zen Masters, Yogi's, hell, even people living an ordinary reality can exhibit that sort of behavior and disposition. Which is why I'm trying to find the common denominating factor between such beings, and what differentiates them from others, irresptive of what skills they possess, be it Sorcery, Kung Fu, or Astrophysics.\n\nThe reason I don't treat Sorcery as a special thing and different from other things is because all things seem equally important and unimporant, to me. I'm sure there are a lot of misreable people practicing sorcery, while there are a lot of joyful people who do absolutely nothing with their lives? \n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that I don't find it cool and fascinating.

I don&amp;#39;t disagree with you one bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, basically, first, let&amp;#39;s clear up our miscommunication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, when they say the Mind is already Englightened, and there is nothing &lt;em&gt;to do&lt;/em&gt;, they are not referring to learning skills or abilities. I think what they&amp;#39;re saying is that your own mind already knows what skills it needs to learn and develop on as it interacts with life, and what your interests and disinterests are, and what motivates you to do certain things vs other things. So, far example, an ignorant person, or someone that doesn&amp;#39;t have conviction in their own mind, or own &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot; might ask themselves, &amp;quot;What would Jesus do? or What would Don Juan do? or What would and Enlightened person do?&amp;quot; Or they&amp;#39;ll just sit around and panic and do nothing, or they&amp;#39;ll delude themselves to do something stupid and dangerous. And it&amp;#39;s that sort of thinking that shifts a person from their naturally enlightened mind to a &amp;quot;seeking mind&amp;quot;. But remember these are all words, that are essentially abstract in nature, so some misunderstandings can arise as we exchange them. We are not talking about seeking things, but seeking mind. Like people are basically seeking a state in their mind that they hope will give them what they want but it never quite does because no state is permanent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for sharing your knowledge on sorcery. I&amp;#39;m really, really interested in learning more about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So going back to what you said, absolutely! There is no way you can learn sorcery or even how to tie your shoelaces without putting in some mental effort / concentration towards it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, when your perception and your realtionship with the world changes, then what happens? What is your motivation in bringing about this change? I need to read more of Carlos&amp;#39;s books, I&amp;#39;ve only read the first three books, to get a better understanding of heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, one can move their assemblage point at will, but there are no procedures for that, other than observing or interacting with your own mind? And after that you just gain a natural ability to do so, unique to you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, no, the spending 10 years in a temple thinking you have anything to do, in order to find or attain that enlightened mind should be attributed to religious deception or just a misunderstanding, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the way you describe the ordinary person, it seems to be the position of the average person out there, and the way you describe heightened awareness, it seems to be reflective of, not only sorcerers, but even Saints, Sages, Zen Masters, Yogi&amp;#39;s, hell, even people living an ordinary reality can exhibit that sort of behavior and disposition. Which is why I&amp;#39;m trying to find the common denominating factor between such beings, and what differentiates them from others, irresptive of what skills they possess, be it Sorcery, Kung Fu, or Astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I don&amp;#39;t treat Sorcery as a special thing and different from other things is because all things seem equally important and unimporant, to me. I&amp;#39;m sure there are a lot of misreable people practicing sorcery, while there are a lot of joyful people who do absolutely nothing with their lives? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I don&amp;#39;t find it cool and fascinating. I am quite determined to know it more but my life&amp;#39;s circumstances have prevented me from doing so, up until now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mzivtf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mzivtf/zen/gweep0i/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619768788.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1619768788.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gw7z2so", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gw5kxrh", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "\\&gt; To my understanding, of Zen, there is actually nothing to practice, when it comes to Zen, because the Mind, or our own mind, is already englightened, and once we realize that, we dispel our ignorant ways. \n\n\\&gt; for sorcery, or shamanism (which I guess is one and the same), silence and the stoppage of the internal dialogue is imperative, simply because it is an activity that requires a high degree of concentration and mental effort.

[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "When I was a kid, I remember playing with my cousins, when, all of a sudden, one would say \"diablo\". Without a reason. You know, in our minds, that was like an invocation. I remember immediately feeling fear and feeling a presence coming into the room. Everybody would run out of the room giggling, but at the same time afraid. I guess it was fun.\n\nLike in every mexican town, there was a story my father once told me a about a local night club where the devil had once appeared. He had danced with a girl with a giant ego who refused every other man. She didn't know he was the devil, only that he was devilishly handsome. When they were dancing she looked at his feet and, with horror, saw, one was a goat's foot and the other a rooster's.\n\nOf course the story lingered in my mind. My kids' flexible mind. I don't remember the name of the night club, but I remember the freaking logo. It was the dark silhouette of an anthropomorphized fox face wearing a bow tie.  Needless to say, for me, it wasn't a fox, it was the devil himself.\n\nOne night I was watching the tv in the living room. I had the lights off, maybe I had been watching the tube for a couple of hours, and the night crept up on me. I realized then, that I was alone. The rest of my family were upstairs. I began feeling the darkness around me. I began feeling afraid. And then the word diablo came to mind. And that horrible story of the devil dancing. And his feet, and the dark ominous fox with a bow tie.\n\nMy fear began to intensify. More and more. I wanted to go, but felt paralyzed. If I stood still maybe I'd be okay. I don't remember at all what was on the tv, my fear overpowered something as frivolous as a tv. And then, boom...  The tv turned off all by itself, to come back on one second later with an explosion of light.\n\nThe screen was all white, not static like in the old TV sets, but like an undulating fog with depth. The screen dissapeared and in its stead a fucking tunnel opened up where something black began to slowly advance from its depths towards me. At first I couldn't discern what it was, but sure enough, it was the fucking black fox face with a bow tie grinning at me. Mocking me, intensifying my fear.\n\nNow, I want to be clear. It was not a regular image on the screen, it was not a regular tv program. I did not imagine it. I did not felt it was like I'm describing it. I saw it like I'm describing it. It was part of the living room and in front of me. I was not falling asleep. I was not taking any medicine or drugs. I was not ill. Not mentally, not physically. I was just a regular kid witnessing a fucking tunnel with depth opening and extending from somewhere behind the tv screen, and the devil coming out of it. It was glorious in your face 3d, and about that I've never had a single doubt. It was so fucking in your face clear.\n\nThat was too much to take, and finally I was able to get up and ran upstairs. My heart pounding and freaked out of my mind. Somehow, none the less, I got a grip of myself, I grabbed the remote control from a VCR we had upstairs. It was the same brand as the tv (Zenith), I came back the stairs a couple of steps and turned that vision/the tv off from there.  As I write this, it doesn't make much sense, but it did right then. I don't really remember if there was still something in there, I just remember that I turned it off.  I came back all the way upstairs and didn't say a word to my parents or my sister.\n\nSo what the hell happened? What is the morale of the story? Well for one, it's clear to me that children can easily alter their perception (shift the assemblage point). It's as simple as conjuring up a \"feeling\". Maybe my cultural context, playing with my cousins, and truly believing you could invoke the devil, hearing that story from my dad (an authority figure to my child's mind), helped.\n\nWhat did I see? Maybe an inorganic being. They're very attracted to fear. I guess not being a seer, and having that mental impression of the devil, I \"assambled\" my perception to see the IOB as that dreaded fox. I've had other experiences that make me think it was an inorganic being.\n\nFinally, I want to emphasize the fact that you can enter fully into the second attention from being awake. No need for power plants, no need to be asleep. And I add myself to Dan's cause on proving Castaneda and magic is real. For it, I think the best way is moving the assemblage point without those aids. You know, because people discard as a fantasy anything drug related or sleep (lucid dreaming/dreaming related). Of course those ways are valid too and we should use them in conjunction with practices such as dark room gazing.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nP.S. The image I grabbed it from the internet, but pretty much resembles the tv we had.\n\nEdited: Spelling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lrivb531ko51.png?width=1031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d7433b56df6dc0c47baeab0316d6a688938a1d5", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "On fear moving the assemblage point.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 108, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6lrivb531ko51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 83, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6lrivb531ko51.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=629aa40d0b150f18dd9ef12cae1ebb440fd3d3dd"}, {"y": 167, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6lrivb531ko51.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0fae6f3e7eb79c18141a228d939f509012014f7"}, {"y": 248, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6lrivb531ko51.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae126f08fdc5ec9003eb7027e1f7f4a70a093b41"}, {"y": 497, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6lrivb531ko51.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8c45c2d9aa74bb1d8aaf0da3ace434ac5de9f64"}, {"y": 745, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6lrivb531ko51.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bd9e962a3b1e9e4e38d25b550d9deb493240040"}], "s": {"y": 801, "x": 1031, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6lrivb531ko51.png?width=1031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d7433b56df6dc0c47baeab0316d6a688938a1d5"}, "id": "6lrivb531ko51"}}, "name": "t3_ix6mq5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 6, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_14k19j", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WzVXQ-1m8MNLjTi_lNThnSO3MZoJ1ZHD571jC4RBN2A.jpg", "edited": 1600717569.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1600714266.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I remember playing with my cousins, when, all of a sudden, one would say &amp;quot;diablo&amp;quot;.

Convincing people that sorcery is fake.\n\nIn private chat, weren't you insisting sorcerers go schizophrenic?\n\nMaybe because you're schizophrenic?\n\nAnd when contradicted, you claimed to know far more powerful sorcerers than any of us know.\n\nBut you couldn't point to any.\n\nAnd you couldn't explain why Jacobo, a friend of Carlos, never found any.  \n\nYou did better than a man who dedicated his life to seeking them out?\n\nAs if it was all common and no big deal?\n\nYou used that to bully and shame, so we'd shut up and not contradict you.  \n\nThe same way you toss around, \"elder\".\n\nNo one's impressed.\n\nIn here if you say, \"Elder\", most hear, \"Faker\".\n\nIt's just a pity I get stuck with policing the bad guys.

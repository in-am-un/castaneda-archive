Already when I saw the quote on the notification, without reading what you wrote, I felt the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I meant that connecting with our intention to reach silence, whenever we connect with some other emotion, or thought, stablishes more our intent(ion) in our brain/neurological connections&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because even if we feel it, and are connect with it, it\u2019s fighting with all the other neurological connections we\u2019ve reinforced&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by them being cyclic and abandoning us?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will try to look for the post, haven\u2019t seen it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s intent then? Don\u2019t remember a clear definition from the art of dreaming, but I do feel that behind/underneath our intentions there\u2019s something deeper than that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw it as intent, maybe a connection with intent (if it is just external)z&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe what I perceived as intent is just a deeper side of our intentions, and frame of mind, but I gotta learn about how it is perceived first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree that our intentions (or superficial intentions if it\u2019s not as a previously thought), but I mean something deeper than that, block intent.. but if it comes from on of the \u201csuperposing\u201d/overwriting systems on our brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gonna say that maybe I\u2019m putting what I\u2019m perceiving intuitively under the wrong names, and it\u2019s made me connect more with what I said about maybe we connect with intent energetically... but as I said, I don\u2019t know&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But definitely, it\u2019s the kind of thing that could reinforce someone\u2019s wrong perception&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  after editing it, I\u2019ve connected more with your perspective. In that part I\u2019m talking more about the intention to be silent, but I also think connecting with that connects us (more) to \u2014or allows us \u2014 intent... at least by guiding us in the proper direction&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ie7u3d", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ie7u3d/no_silence_intent_silence_intent/g2i1hm8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1598121028.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g2hwi4o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1598118766.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ie7u3d", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt; \u201cteaching\u201d our body and mind what our intent is;  \n\nThis is a dangerous statement.\n\nFelix made a similar remark when he condemned Carlos, Cleargreen, said the witches had abandoned us all, claiming to be \"cyclic\" with Reni.\n\nHe was trying to steal students.

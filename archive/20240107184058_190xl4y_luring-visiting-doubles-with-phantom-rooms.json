Just not stable ones at first.\n\nMaybe 10 seconds is all you'll get to see of it.\n\nWARNING: this picture is ChatGPT's idea of how phantom rooms are created by your gazing.\n\nBut it saved me 3 hours drawing it myself.  \n\n\nThat AI made it in 30 seconds!  \n\n\nAnd what's with ChatGPT's obsession with briefcases?  \n\n\nIf I rely on Dall-E to draw for me too much, I might find myself in infinity in a business suit.\n\nCarrying a briefcase.\n\nI'll run into Carlos, who will obviously be naked, and have to explain why I'm in formal wear.  \n\n\nBut the picture shows a good thing for people who want to share dreams with others, to know about.  \n\n\nYou need a \"landing spot\". Or maybe it's more like a \"lighthouse\".  \n\n\nA bundle of emanations all lit up with your own awareness, for someone who wants to visit you from sleeping dreaming, to locate.  \n\n\nIn this case, one person using waking dreaming, so that they have the \"purpose\" to create a phantom room that's stable.  \n\n\nThe other, a visitor using sleeping dreaming techniques where you find your hands and look from object to object to prove you aren't making up stuff, and then go off to find the person you want to visit in your double.  \n\n\nIt's pretty hard to ask a sleeping dreamer to find you in the real world. The double really isn't all that fond of that place, due to the endless suffering.  \n\n\nBut if you make an inviting phantom room for yourself, and can sit in it and wait at a time when you know the other person is going to make an attempt to visit, you'll be at an advantage.  \n\n\nSilvio Manuel did this for La Gorda.

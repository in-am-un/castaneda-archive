And I might move on and not post this useful info from an inorganic being.  So I made re-run pictures.\n\nSome history:  I feared I was neglecting my inorganic being Fancy, who is capable of amazing magic lessons.\n\nLily, the third of my inorganic beings,  is also. But hers are for the orange zone, whereas Fancy likes the red zone.  And who doesn't!\n\nBut I suppose the red zone is like drugs, which is why the power plant sorcerers believe you can learn sorcery via drugs.  They think sorcery is just getting very high.\n\nI gave Fancy the energy she needs to manifest more often, and she seems to have decided not to let me forget about her again, and so she's been \"helping\" me more than usual.\n\nFirst point: the tonal body has inorganic beings to help it do magic. We haven't yet discovered all that, but we know from the books that the old seers had very close relationships with their IOBs.  \n\nAnd the lineage too, using them to guard places, scout ahead and bring back the sights, move objects, push things over, scare people.\n\nIt's a bunch of cool stuff, and some day we might have a list.\n\nBut what the double can do is even better, because it doesn't need any help.\n\nOur darkroom practices do move our assemblage points, but they also lure the double to come around and play with us.\n\nWe stuff the puffs onto our pouches, because they tend to stick well there and then we have a \"puff body\".  Perhaps it's a little like \"dress up\" to the double, who comes closer to us, just because we have more energy stuck on the center.\n\nHe also seems to like \"kungfu\" as Zuleica called it to Taisha, so we do the tensegrity.\n\nWe're trying to lure him!\n\nI suppose at one point Carlos noticed that wasn't working, and figured it was because we didn't have a nagual to deliver the nagual's blow on his entire workshop crowd.\n\nSo he gave us a second way to gain access to the double.\n\nGo into your ordinary dream body, through sleeping,  disrupt it's activities by adding some lucidity, and then guide it out into the real world.\n\nThe situation is a bit like trying to lure your puppy out from under the couch with a piece of meat.\n\nUsually they're eager, and if you show them some tasty baloney, they'll come out even if they peed on the rug, and know you really want to punish them.  They can't resist the baloney.\n\nBut failing to lure them out, you have no choice but to crawl under the couch and pull them out physically.\n\nThat's 4 gates dreaming.\n\nAnd we need that double if we want magic.  It's true that the tonal can do some cool things, including gaze at the emanations.  Once you can gaze at the emanations, anything is possible.\n\nBut he can't gaze at them long.  For that, you need the double.\n\nAnd you also need the double for shapeshifting, flying, teleporting, scaring the bejesus out of friends, leaping across the universe, shrinking down to the size of an ant, being invisible, and living in southern Mexico, while you have a healer business in northern Mexico.\n\nThe truth is, the  double has the coolest magic.  The books aren't super clear on that topic, and sort of make it seem like both entities can do those things.  But, the double has no physical matter to hold it back.  So he wins.\n\nNow, if you truly get into the double fully, in the waking world, you don't need any advice on how to produce \"Practical Magic\".\n\nYou can do anything.\n\nYou need the advice when you're still mostly stuck in the tonal.\n\nAnd if you get good at darkroom, you soon learn that if you try to develop practical (repeatable) magic from darkroom effects, you slow yourself down so much, likely you will fail to learn in the long run.\n\nWe're not learning by ourselves, due to our amazing coolness.\n\nWe truly suck!\n\nBut we've been flattered and lied to by everyone, which includes any guru or spiritual \"teacher\" you ever ran into.  They want our stuff, so they lie to us to get it.\n\nBeginners are so blinded by this that all they can really think about is becoming the flattering guru who gets to take other people's stuff.\n\nThey don't really want to learn.\n\nThe goal of a teacher is to get them to stop being greedy, and actually want magic.\n\nNot for moral reasons.  But simply because, you have no chance to learn until you really want only that, and nothing else.\n\nOtherwise \"the spirit\" doesn't include you in our only chance.\n\n\"The Eagle's Gift\" is the only path to learn this form of magic.\n\nThat's what makes it a Gift!!!\n\nAnd since there doesn't seem to be any other, then it's the only chance you have to learn the real thing, instead of some \"made for profit\" pretending system.\n\nBut what does that have to do with practical magic?\n\nIf trying to turn what you do in the darkroom into something you can repeat destroys the Eagle's desire to carry  you along the path to learn, does that mean you can't gain any practical magic?\n\nNo.   You just have to sneak it in there.\n\nMake it part of the path the Eagle lays out.\n\nThe eagle gifts you, and if you try to find your own gifts you will fail.\n\nBut just because you only get his gifts, doesn't mean you can't enjoy them.\n\nFor instance, a few of  us have looked into the puffs, as we were scooping them up to put on our pouches.\n\nThe Eagle's Gift path we have (the tensegrity branch of it), calls for stuffing those puffs onto our torso so that we lure the double to come play with us.\n\nSo the puffs need to go on there.\n\nBut we can play with them a bit before we deposit them!\n\nFor instance, you can hold them in the air and use their glow to illuminate the room, creating \"surfaces\" that float in front of you.  I posted about that previously, with pictures.\n\nIf you can produce 10 \"surfaces\" in the air around you, in the space of a half hour, you're likely to translocate to a place where you exist in multiple places at the same time.\n\nThat's practical magic supreme, and not incompatible with our path at all.\n\nBut there are many other weird things you can do with the puffs.\n\nFancy showed me a few just an  hour ago.\n\nWhen you scoop the puffs, you can hold them against your eyes for a bit and look through them.\n\nLike, \"Puff Vision\".\n\nThey will even stick on a your face.  Or you can keep your hand in front of it, and look right through both the puff, and your hand.\n\nYou hand changes the focus of the details you see, but only slightly.\n\nThis is no good for a green zone person.\n\nThey won't be brilliant enough to be noticeable, and you'll be pretending your sorcery.\n\nDon't ever do that!  \n\nOur magic is real.  Don't accept pretend or you won't work hard enough to learn the real thing.  You'll flatter yourself, and stop doing any work.\n\nBut once the puffs are brilliant, place them on your eyes and play with looking through them a while, before you stick them on your energy pouches.\n\nLooking through them you can find remote views on the bed or floor.  I didn't have time to try it on the walls, but Fancy had a technique for looking through walls she taught me many months ago, and the only difference here is, the puffs are stuck to your face, not gathered into a lens in front of you.\n\nAnother form of puff play that won't interfere with the path, is to be more particular about the puffs.\n\nAt first, we greedily stuff any puff, no matter how sub quality it is, onto our pouches.\n\nWe use \"inferior puffs\".\n\nBut we don't have to put up with that.\n\nThe puffs are actually \"mini-mes\".   Meaning, that's you!\n\nJust a piece, but still it's you.\n\nYou can in fact turn each puff into a horrible tiny demon running around on your bed.\n\n(Don't ask...)\n\nSo you can certainly \"snub\" the puffs, and get them to become a little more helpful.\n\nCarlos alerted us to this fact, in the unbending intent long form I love to show at 5:22, where they look up for puffs, see one, leap up, and scoop it down.\n\nA beginner is so worried it will work at all, that they'll scoop anything they can find at all.\n\nBut I saw Carlos do that move right in front of me.  He literally was at risk of bumping into me as he leaped up.  I had to move back a bit.\n\nAnd he wasn't searching for any old puff at all.\n\nHe was \"puff shopping\".\n\nDidn't like what he saw at first, but a foot or two further in the air he found a good one.\n\nWhat's a good puff?\n\nA brilliant one for sure.  But beyond that, a puff with \"details\".\n\nSo here's some practical magic.  Look in the air for colors, and especially concentrations we call a \"puff\".\n\nThose become discrete objects in the deep red zone.  Above that, they can have diffuse edges.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with that, except it \"bores\" the double.\n\nIf you stuff a diffuse puff on  your pouch, he just yawns.\n\nBut if you find a brilliant puff, with sharp edges, you get him to look up from his newspaper, and look closer at what you are doing.\n\nIf you find a puff with \"details\" in it, he might even put his newspaper down, lean over the table, and look closely at what you're doing.\n\nThat's a stronger lure.\n\nAnd if you want practical magic, you mostly want him around, because on our own IOBs is about it.  And those don't move the assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nBut it's still not quite enough to insure you are luring the double with maximum effectiveness.\n\nYou need not only puffs with interesting things going on, such as brilliance or \"details\", but you need them to be \"real\".\n\nWhen the puffs are real, you have his undivided attention.  He'll come for sure.  You won't have the best memory of it at first, but it'll be enough to be obvious something cool happened.\n\nTo make the puffs \"real\", find ones with details, put your hand behind them, and memorize the details.\n\nThen very gently move them through the air, making sure the details don't change too much to still identify them.\n\nPlace them gently on your pouch, and verify that's the very same puff on there now, because the details are still here.\n\nIf not, you might have simply \"dropped\" the original puff in the air, and can back up and find it again.\n\nFor me, they tend to \"smash\" when I push them on the pouch.  And I must admit to rubbing them on there a bit, to make sure they stay.\n\nBut the details, even smashed, are still viewable.\n\nOnce you have the puff on your pouch (see comic book page 2), with details still visible, move around a few steps to see if they remain, and then repeat.\n\nYour eyes will switch over to the double's eyes, and you'll find yourself in a phantom room.\n\nNot a whitish light phantom room, like you find in the orange zone.    It'll be a colorful phantom room.\n\nIf you have an IOB, you'll likely be in his cave.\n\nThey don't all look the same, so try to learn the details.\n\nYou want to keep track of who's bringing you home to meet the family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fancy's Lessons On Practical Magic", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"obk7au86lj481": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 155, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/obk7au86lj481.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f3c0b4797a8118043566ccc13d869e52993e1cc"}, {"y": 311, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/obk7au86lj481.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8361ba8e102361359fe573853ceca6bfba595c67"}, {"y": 461, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/obk7au86lj481.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3ad595570900a991b427823a82f318a51b7008"}, {"y": 923, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/obk7au86lj481.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ca58ea73390fe27c4eedafd0c17dad3f8c27e7"}], "s": {"y": 1126, "x": 780, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/obk7au86lj481.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad8805a9530b00d53984770465b484db05039636"}, "id": "obk7au86lj481"}}, "name": "t3_rc8g7u", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zKSoh1irjkV0-B9tLabPDpdZ7F6S7VujbzWcdFbPx10.jpg", "edited": 1639066722.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1639020197.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/obk7au86lj481.jpg?width=780&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ad8805a9530b00d53984770465b484db05039636\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/obk7au86lj481.jpg?width=780&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ad8805a9530b00d53984770465b484db05039636&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A better picture for this one would be a bit too much to draw.

I didn&amp;#39;t have time to try it on the walls, but Fancy had a technique for looking through walls she taught me many months ago, and the only difference here is, the puffs are stuck to your face, not gathered into a lens in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another form of puff play that won&amp;#39;t interfere with the path, is to be more particular about the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, we greedily stuff any puff, no matter how sub quality it is, onto our pouches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We use &amp;quot;inferior puffs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t have to put up with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs are actually &amp;quot;mini-mes&amp;quot;.   Meaning, that&amp;#39;s you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a piece, but still it&amp;#39;s you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can in fact turn each puff into a horrible tiny demon running around on your bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Don&amp;#39;t ask...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can certainly &amp;quot;snub&amp;quot; the puffs, and get them to become a little more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos alerted us to this fact, in the unbending intent long form I love to show at 5:22, where they look up for puffs, see one, leap up, and scoop it down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A beginner is so worried it will work at all, that they&amp;#39;ll scoop anything they can find at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I saw Carlos do that move right in front of me.  He literally was at risk of bumping into me as he leaped up.  I had to move back a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he wasn&amp;#39;t searching for any old puff at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was &amp;quot;puff shopping&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t like what he saw at first, but a foot or two further in the air he found a good one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s a good puff?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A brilliant one for sure.  But beyond that, a puff with &amp;quot;details&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s some practical magic.  Look in the air for colors, and especially concentrations we call a &amp;quot;puff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those become discrete objects in the deep red zone.  Above that, they can have diffuse edges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that, except it &amp;quot;bores&amp;quot; the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stuff a diffuse puff on  your pouch, he just yawns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you find a brilliant puff, with sharp edges, you get him to look up from his newspaper, and look closer at what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find a puff with &amp;quot;details&amp;quot; in it, he might even put his newspaper down, lean over the table, and look closely at what you&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a stronger lure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you want practical magic, you mostly want him around, because on our own IOBs is about it.  And those don&amp;#39;t move the assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still not quite enough to insure you are luring the double with maximum effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need not only puffs with interesting things going on, such as brilliance or &amp;quot;details&amp;quot;, but you need them to be &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the puffs are real, you have his undivided attention.  He&amp;#39;ll come for sure.  You won&amp;#39;t have the best memory of it at first, but it&amp;#39;ll be enough to be obvious something cool happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make the puffs &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, find ones with details, put your hand behind them, and memorize the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then very gently move them through the air, making sure the details don&amp;#39;t change too much to still identify them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Place them gently on your pouch, and verify that&amp;#39;s the very same puff on there now, because the details are still here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, you might have simply &amp;quot;dropped&amp;quot; the original puff in the air, and can back up and find it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, they tend to &amp;quot;smash&amp;quot; when I push them on the pouch.  And I must admit to rubbing them on there a bit, to make sure they stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the details, even smashed, are still viewable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have the puff on your pouch (see comic book page 2), with details still visible, move around a few steps to see if they remain, and then repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your eyes will switch over to the double&amp;#39;s eyes, and you&amp;#39;ll find yourself in a phantom room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a whitish light phantom room, like you find in the orange zone.    It&amp;#39;ll be a colorful phantom room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have an IOB, you&amp;#39;ll likely be in his cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t all look the same, so try to learn the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to keep track of who&amp;#39;s bringing you home to meet the family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "e149107a-34fb-11eb-a30a-0ed8846f051f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "rc8g7u", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rc8g7u/fancys_lessons_on_practical_magic/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rc8g7u/fancys_lessons_on_practical_magic/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1639020197.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hnv3u3q", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hnun8bq", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I believe the Hindus still know that.\n\nThey never claimed enlightenment was permanent as far as I know.

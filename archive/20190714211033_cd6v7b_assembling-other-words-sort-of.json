My goal lately has been to shift my assemblage point until I can see the \u201cspace between the worlds\u201d.  It\u2019s sort of like a train station for other places.  I see it as a yellow/brownish world composed of what could be sand.  Around it on all sides are other places you can enter, although usually when you get there, your attention is focused on the one straight ahead.\n\nThe point of it is of course, to get the kind of dreaming you only have access to from silence.  Carlos mentioned it in Active Side of Infinity.\n\nIt\u2019s a superior form of dreaming, in that you don\u2019t lose lucidity. As long as you\u2019re there, you\u2019re awake and rational (mostly).  You don\u2019t have to fight like the dickens to keep it going. You can remain for weeks if you like.  And you don\u2019t have to battle all of the dreaming characters, so that they won\u2019t interfere with your exploration.  You\u2019re exploring the whole place, including the inhabitants.  Usually you already have a body there, and have for its entire life. You know it's history.\n\nThe Gates of Dreaming can certainly lead there.  But come back in 20 years when you succeed by that path, and we\u2019ll have an interesting talk about it.\n\nI\u2019m afraid to say, obsession with the \u201cGates of Dreaming\u2019\u2019 is like being obsessed with getting your own Lizard so you can turn him into an ally.\n\nIt\u2019s the lure, not the best path.  You got hooked by the books.  But once you\u2019re hooked, you need to reduce the obsession over that storyline, or your progress will be very slow.\n\nDon\u2019t posture!  Practice.\n\nThe space between worlds is difficult to get to.  You pretty much have to stop the world.  Carlos had don Juan to pull him into there, but we don\u2019t.\n\nThe problem with that is, when you stop the world, you lose all rationality.  It can be only for a brief instant, in which case your destination has probably already been selected for you.  Or it can happen for a long time, and you either wake up in bed not remembering anything, or you come out of it in your room and don\u2019t realize what just happened.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much like what Carlos described in his books, where if you stop the world you have angels circling overhead, heralding your great accomplishment. For us, it\u2019s probably more like, \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d\n\nThe problem seems to be \u201cspeed\u201d.  In order to get anything magical to happen, your assemblage point has to shift from its self-pity position, to somewhere else.  If it shifts slowly, we might call that \u201cdrifting\u201d.  Our rationality can come along with us, almost as if we were just taking a stroll into the woods.\n\nBut when it \u201cshifts\u201d dramatically, we lose consciousness for a while.  When we come out of it, we\u2019ve lost our purpose.\n\nIf you\u2019re practicing silence watching colors in the darkness, they\u2019ll start out vague.   They won\u2019t be directional, meaning, it\u2019ll be pretty pathetic of you to pretend you\u2019re really seeing something in the darkness. I mean, come on!  There\u2019s no such thing.\n\nIt\u2019ll feel like that until your assemblage point drifts a bit.  The colors will become a little brighter. The edges will become sharper.  The location of the colors in space will become more convenient for you to interact with.  You might even start to see the little dots of bright red, white, and blue.  Those behave differently than the puffs of colors, and only start to come after your assemblage point has already drifted.\n\nAnd before I forget it, don\u2019t fail to look for emanations while gazing at colors. Just keep them in mind. It\u2019s easy to become blind to the thin straight lines, which seem to be aware.\n\nSeeing slightly brighter colors and the flying dots takes about an hour of silence for me.  But it\u2019s still not a very impressive sight. And we DO want to impress ourselves.  If you\u2019re a \u201cwarrior\u201d, maybe you don\u2019t need that.  You\u2019re too proud even for pride.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a miserable Stormtrooper like me, you need a sense of accomplishment.  Stormtroopers are a dime a dozen. We have to look out for ourselves and pick up some of the spoils of war at any chance we get.\n\nIn that vein, I set myself to learning to get to the waiting room of the second attention, that train station between worlds. And I wanted to get there without stopping the world, so I could learn to do it gradually and keep my sense of purpose.\n\nIn other words, I don\u2019t have don Juan to bring me in there, so I need to find it on my own.  You guys probably do also, but I guess we\u2019ll see what happens when a lot of you can get silent.\n\nAfter an hour of silence last night, the colors had gotten bright enough to manifest my Fairy. She showed up on a puff of color right at my feet. I was sitting cross-legged on pillows in absolute darkness. I\u2019d recently upgraded my blinds, and there was no spec of real light to be seen anywhere in the room.  It was also absolutely impossible to see my hands, let alone my legs.\n\nBut there was the Fairy on a puff of purple light. She smiled at me, then turned into a perfect Siberian cat head.\n\nThat\u2019s just like cats!  They never do the trick when you want them to.  They do it when they feel like it. I\u2019d been trying to get her to do that for at least 2 weeks.\n\nShe returned to fairy form (a pleasing Disney animation style head), lay on her side, then floated off. I realized; she makes a much better ghost than a fairy. It\u2019s too hard to get the legs right with Fairies.  A ghost can have whatever it wants for a lower body, especially when drifting around.\n\nI was encouraged, but it wasn\u2019t what I was after. I wanted to assemble a different world, slowly.  I\u2019ve done that before, by forcing silence until the walls of my room have details on them. Details of other places.  With my pitch-black room, I didn\u2019t have to wonder if the details I was seeing were actually on the walls.  Nothing of the walls could be seen there.\n\nI tried to force out the last traces of fantasizing.  I\u2019d already shut off my internal dialogue.  But that\u2019s only a symptom, not the cause. The cause of the internal dialogue is our ability to focus our attention.  And to get silent enough to assemble another world, you have to focus that attention on only that which is happening right in front of you.\n\nYou have to \u201cBe Here Now\u201d.\n\nWho came up with that anyway?    I guess they actually knew something after all?\n\nWhile forcing even deeper silence, I felt a push on my shoulder, my head bobbed forward a tiny amount, and I lost consciousness.  My assemblage point had \u201cshifted\u201d, as opposed to \u201cdrifted\u201d.\n\nWhen I realized I had fallen asleep, my first reaction was disappointment in myself.  I screwed up!\n\nBut I have enough experience with it to realize, that\u2019s just the human form trying to re-assert itself.  You have to ignore that reaction, and realize you\u2019re in a new situation now.  The assemblage point has shifted somewhat dramatically.\n\nYou need to focus on the results, which usually also include a tingling up and down your back.\n\nI looked where the fairy had materialized earlier, and saw a patch of purple. But it was now intense, as if it was burning.\n\nI grabbed it with both hands (gently placed them beside it), and started to massage it the way Carlos had shown us in class. You use cupped hands to play with it as if it were a blob of something you can manipulate.  In other words, you use Tensegrity on the blob of light.\n\nUsually that means I can pull it apart and compress it together, as if it were some of that children\u2019s green goo.  When the assemblage point shifts, it can have very sharp edges. Although it\u2019s the same color as the vague puffs of light at a distance in the room, this looks like it\u2019s real.\n\nIt had gotten super bright, almost as bright as the sun.  Except that since there\u2019s no real light, it doesn\u2019t hurt to look directly into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContinued due to word limits on reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: twice", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Assembling Other Words (Sort of)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cd6v7b", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1563143654.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1563131433.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve reached a strange barrier in waking dreaming.

It wasn\u2019t created from colors in the darkness, which can have significant details on them.  Those are always obviously made out of \u201csomething else\u201d.  This was made of smooth light and dark, with shadows and highlights.\n\nThis wall was real, and all I could think of was to associate the color with an old nickel.  Not a tarnished one, but one from before they switched metals, which was still fairly shiny.  But not overly so.\n\nThe wall expanded towards me, as if it were breathing, revealing details. It was at least 12 feet wide, and 8 feet high.  It was rectangular, with rounded corners.  There was a head on the wall, pressed into the metal.  Or maybe cast there.  The wall also had other details, all ornamental. I sort of recognized the decorations, and they seemed early Greek or Roman.\n\nIt seemed like the gate to some kind of ancient vault.  And it wasn\u2019t made out of light, it was real.\n\nI was ready to watch it until I could get up and walk into that world, but there was nothing to walk into. It was a door, blocking the path.\n\nI\u2019d been trying to sneak around abstract dreaming, to keep my volition when I entered into another world.  But there was nowhere to go with that huge vault door blocking any entry.\n\nI lost consciousness, and found myself looking at a list.  I was in a formal room with dark brown furniture, which reminded me a bit of stories Carlos had told us, about people he knew.  This room felt like it was connected to Ellis (Amy).\n\nAt the top of the list was the name of a folder.  Except that it was animated, and abstact. The closest I can come to describing it was that it was like a computer folder icon, sitting on the paper.  But there wasn't really any paper.\n\nI'm not sure where the folder was located, but it was right there in front of me.  And yet I had the impression it had come from a heavy wooden drawer, in a living room related to Ellis.   I could see that the drawer had a lot of junk in it, which had become forgotten.\n\nIn that folder I knew, one of the men from Carlos\u2019 classes had stored information for his future use.  He put it away, knowing it was useful.\n\nI thought he'd given up!  But his information was still in play.\n\nBelow the folder was another.   I realized I\u2019d put that one on the list myself.  Mine was intrinsically different from his.  It was active, and his was long inactive.\n\nMine kept adding details.  It had subfolders, if you could describe the abstract in that manner.\n\nI \"knew\" it had been in a drawer for more than 20 years.  I was surprised to find that his entry was still there, as faithful as it originally was, and hadn\u2019t somehow been tarnished.\n\nI was worried that my incessant additions to my own folders would anger him, and he'd start deleting things.  Mine was evolving, and seemed to risk pushing his out.  Though I had almost no rationality, I *saw* that he was aware of my doings, and they might push him off the edge. He'd reached some kind of stability in his life.  A stability absent sorcery.\n\nI eventually figured out that I was caught up in abstract dreaming again.  I'd been trying to avoid it in the first place, but my rationality was gone.  While considering all the bizarre things about lists of folders on paper which doesn't exist, in rooms I'd never seen, I questioned nothing.\n\nBut I also had gotten no useful information from it.\n\nI tried to bring at least a tiny bit of rationality back, to channel a Ferengi merchant, to explain how I could profit from this situation.  The Ferengi don't judge and they aren't hampered by their social conditioning. They only evaluate how much profit is in something.\n\nBut I was tired.

It wasn\u2019t created from colors in the darkness, which can have significant details on them.  Those are always obviously made out of \u201csomething else\u201d.  This was made of smooth light and dark, with shadows and highlights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wall was real, and all I could think of was to associate the color with an old nickel.  Not a tarnished one, but one from before they switched metals, which was still fairly shiny.  But not overly so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wall expanded towards me, as if it were breathing, revealing details. It was at least 12 feet wide, and 8 feet high.  It was rectangular, with rounded corners.  There was a head on the wall, pressed into the metal.  Or maybe cast there.  The wall also had other details, all ornamental. I sort of recognized the decorations, and they seemed early Greek or Roman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed like the gate to some kind of ancient vault.  And it wasn\u2019t made out of light, it was real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was ready to watch it until I could get up and walk into that world, but there was nothing to walk into. It was a door, blocking the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d been trying to sneak around abstract dreaming, to keep my volition when I entered into another world.  But there was nowhere to go with that huge vault door blocking any entry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost consciousness, and found myself looking at a list.  I was in a formal room with dark brown furniture, which reminded me a bit of stories Carlos had told us, about people he knew.  This room felt like it was connected to Ellis (Amy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the top of the list was the name of a folder.  Except that it was animated, and abstact. The closest I can come to describing it was that it was like a computer folder icon, sitting on the paper.  But there wasn&amp;#39;t really any paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure where the folder was located, but it was right there in front of me.  And yet I had the impression it had come from a heavy wooden drawer, in a living room related to Ellis.   I could see that the drawer had a lot of junk in it, which had become forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that folder I knew, one of the men from Carlos\u2019 classes had stored information for his future use.  He put it away, knowing it was useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought he&amp;#39;d given up!  But his information was still in play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below the folder was another.   I realized I\u2019d put that one on the list myself.  Mine was intrinsically different from his.  It was active, and his was long inactive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mine kept adding details.  It had subfolders, if you could describe the abstract in that manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; it had been in a drawer for more than 20 years.  I was surprised to find that his entry was still there, as faithful as it originally was, and hadn\u2019t somehow been tarnished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was worried that my incessant additions to my own folders would anger him, and he&amp;#39;d start deleting things.  Mine was evolving, and seemed to risk pushing his out.  Though I had almost no rationality, I &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; that he was aware of my doings, and they might push him off the edge. He&amp;#39;d reached some kind of stability in his life.  A stability absent sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually figured out that I was caught up in abstract dreaming again.  I&amp;#39;d been trying to avoid it in the first place, but my rationality was gone.  While considering all the bizarre things about lists of folders on paper which doesn&amp;#39;t exist, in rooms I&amp;#39;d never seen, I questioned nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I also had gotten no useful information from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to bring at least a tiny bit of rationality back, to channel a Ferengi merchant, to explain how I could profit from this situation.  The Ferengi don&amp;#39;t judge and they aren&amp;#39;t hampered by their social conditioning. They only evaluate how much profit is in something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was tired. It had been a long time, with me not writing here about even 1/4th of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lay on my side, forced to watch that list of folders for the rest of the night.

It always gets brighter and larger when I do that, and I can make my entire leg glow and become visible.\n\nBut instead of behaving as usual, I ended with it stuck to both hands, peaked like a big glob of fairly stiff egg white meringue.\n\nBoth of my hands had half of the purple stuff stuck to them.  I\u2019d never seen that before.\n\nI put them back together trying to remember the technique Carlos had taught us in class, with an evil grin on his face. It\u2019s was just a gesture he did for about 15 seconds.  And nothing more.  We saw nothing.  But it\u2019s become the main technique I use these days.  Part of the reason is, he was looking directly into my eyes when he challenged us to see what had manifested.\n\nI rotated my hands 90 degrees, so they weren\u2019t on the sides of the goo.  They were above and below it.  I separated them. The purple meringue was still stuck to my hands.\n\nI switched them to see how it was stuck, putting the opposite hand on top.  It was still stuck.\n\nThat\u2019s when I remembered, Carlos had made a deal out of rotating the hands.  When he did it, it seemed as if he had a tiny bird baby in his cupped hands, and was gently turning it over, so as not to hurt it.  He did that a couple of times.\n\nThe idea was, he we was going to manifest something for us.\n\nI rotated my hands so they were on the sides of the blob, and separated them to see if anything manifested.\n\nI felt a shiver up my back.  I didn\u2019t get the push of a sudden shift of the assemblage point, but I got the accompanying tingle.  It was a major drift, but I didn't lose consciousness.\n\nThe purple goo was indeed stuck to both hands. It looked like a soft-serve ice-cream cone from \"Burger Habit\". They deliberately make them far too tall, so that you have to grab them immediately and carefully eat the top half.  Otherwise they\u2019ll topple over with the slightest movement.\n\nI took my right hand, with the ice-cream goo stuck to it, hanging down, and tried to shake it off.  The edges were as sharp as any real object now, and it was so bright that I forgot there was absolutely no light in the room. The glow from the ice-cream lit up the bed sheet and my leg.\n\nI tried harder to shake it off, and the top of the ice-cream flipped!  It literally reversed the direction it was tilting, and tilted in the same manner but to the opposite side.  It was a drastic movement, as if it were a bent strip of metal formed into a spring, now flipping orientation.\n\nI\u2019d never seen the blobs do that!  I moved my hand around with the point of goo downwards, close to the bed sheet, to see if I could smear it.\n\nIt was so utterly realistic looking, and even let me see details of the bed sheets, that I started to think again. The excitement is hard to avoid, and excitement typically means our internal dialogue tries to explain what\u2019s exciting, and figure out how to congratulate itself.  There's always a virtual book deal going on in most people's minds.\n\nThe ice-cream was gone.  I realized I\u2019d gotten distracted.  I went back to sitting up comfortably, trying to force more silence so that my assemblage point would drift more.\n\nAfter a few minutes my skin began to crawl, and I was certain I had goosebumps.  My right hand raised up on its own, moved all the way to the right of my body, and slowly began to pan across the room.\n\nI turned to look where my hand was located, and saw my fairy floating up there, but now more like a ghost.  Her head was predominating the view of her, especially her round facial features. And she was red-orange, instead of purple.\n\nAs my hand sweeped, details were visible on the wall.   I turned my entire body to face them, with my arm straight out in front, palm bent up, and I began to slowly sweep the wall.  I peered at my hand, and saw that the wall had grooves in it, as if it were made of a limestone and pebble conglomerate, with little streams wore in an otherwise perfectly straight cliff. It could have been a real wall in a canyon, formed by a fault in the ground, and pushed up over millions of years.  And streams of water dripping down it from the top, had worn grooves into it.\n\nWhen I finished my seep across the entire wall, which was located on the right side of my room, I saw something frightening.\n\nThe wall was covered in heads, which seemed to be formed on bubbles oozing out from the cliff. Each round bubble was the size of my Fairy\u2019s head, and they all had different expressions, different costumes, and different sexes.  I had the thought, \u201cThis is where she lives!\u201d\n\nI was scared out of my mind for an instant, remembering how Carlos had worried about being taken prisoner in the world of the inorganics.  Instantly, the heads disappeared.  It was like a swarm of insects fleeing, because you had a startled reaction to them.\n\nI now saw only one, with my Fairies familiar face on it.\n\nI scooped her head off the wall, and into my left hand. She was purple now, but the wall was still reddish orange as she had been.  I swept my right hand far away from it, gazing through my palm the entire movement. That meant I lost sight of the head in my left hand.  I wanted to see if there were still a lot of floating heads stuck to the wall, and perhaps it was only my vision of them which had been blocked.\n\nUp in the far-right side I found one, almost too far up to reach.  I scooped it into my right hand, and very slowly brought both hands together in the middle. I wanted to see if I now had 2 independent faces in my palms.\n\nThere were!  But they\u2019d shrunk to the size of a cherry tomato.  When my hands touched, the head on the right moved to give a big hug to the head on the left.  They actually cuddled up with smiles on their faces.\n\nI got up from the bed to see if I could walk into that \u201cFairy World\u201d.  Maybe it was where that low energy inorganic came from, as best I could perceive (interpret) it.\n\nAs I neared the reddish orange cliff, it receded from me. I realized,  I couldn\u2019t enter that world. I\u2019d hit the bedroom wall before I got there.\n\nI turned to the left to go towards a table I knew was at the opposite side of the wall.  I could feel my away around on it.  I had sinus congestion, and wanted to find some nasal spray.\n\nWhile my hands were fumbling around on the dark table top, I saw an intense purplish white light on the wall.  I looked up to find a face, made out of super bright lines and patches of color, so bright that it would have burned my eyes if there were any real light.  It seemed to be in the most intense range of light we can see, a super bright violet color.  Ultra-violent in fact.\n\nThe head was talking to me, explaining something. It was frantic for me to hear it, but no sound came from its mouth.  It tried changing to other human shapes in other costumes.  At one point, it seemed to be smoking a pipe, in profile.  It looked like a college professor giving an impromptu and clever lecture, puffing on his pipe to emphasize a point.\n\nBut there was still no sound.   I found my nasal spray, used some, and returned to the bed.  Although the talking head was intense, at that position of the assemblage point I had very little rationality left.  I didn't think to just stick around there and keep watching.\n\nRationality can\u2019t entirely be taken along when trying to assemblage another world. It doesn\u2019t behave itself. It\u2019s been taken over by the internal dialogue, and if you bring too much of it, it\u2019ll do a \u201cdouble take\u201d when it sees something impossible, and try to force it to go away.\n\nYou have to bring the volition, but leave the spoil-sport behind.\n\nOn the bed I looked towards the same wall where I\u2019d seen the frantic talking head.  I was still trying to assemble a real world I could walk into.\n\nI noticed I could now see the entire wall, despite the room being absolutely devoid of real light.  It looked like brushed nickel metal.  Shiny, but not too shiny.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContinued..\n\nEdited: three times", "edited": 1563150592.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_etrxvng", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled my hands apart, intending to scoop it onto my leg, and rub it in.

He got to fly through the air holding onto a Genie's skirt with evil hungry little gnomes peeking out from under it,  went back in time to witness past events the way only sorcerers can do, and he even went creepy graveyard hunting the way I suspect Cholita might do, if she needed some \"special dirt\" for a spell.\n\nJust hope she doesn't bring her foldable Army Shovel.\n\nWhich seems to be missing lately...\n\nAnd to top it all off, Scrooge met Death.  In a helpful mood!\n\nI really don't get the complaint.\n\nBut if you're obsessed with \"Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe, helps to make the season bright\", or you're worried you'll miss out on the one horse open sleigh rides with your new lover,  just relax.\n\nWe get to do BOTH.\n\nAnd we aren't so stupid as to believe those symbolic river of shit motivations like Christmas, will actually form your fondest memories in the future.\n\nThere's the Hallmark Family Movie Channel for that delusion!\n\nI just love the ones with Santa in them. Hiding out with ordinary people not realizing it's him, riding around on busses like he was real.\n\nI wish I knew how the old seers managed that one.\n\nBut that's surely an inorganic being to be proud of!\n\nI might have to manufacture one in Silent Knowledge some day.  Show a 3 year old witch to get \"group consensus\" he's real, and then together go burglarize people's homes via the chimney.\n\nInorganic beings love that sort of \"good time\".\n\nSomething to look forward to as your power grows!\n\nWhich is the whole point of this post.\n\nWith magic, you have something to look forward to.\n\nWithout it,  the sleigh rides will seem hollow and meaningless, as you slowly decay and die.\n\nFortunately, as the witches have informed us,  you don't have to leave your friends and family anymore.  Go ahead, spend \"Christmas at home\".\n\nAlthough \"Home Alone\" looked like more fun to me than \"Christmas with the Kranks\".\n\nAnd we don't need teachers anymore.  So groupies be warned. That kind of sentiment is not welcome in here.  This is a place to learn, not a place to \"kiss up\".  Stick with the Mistletoe and your old spinster Aunt,  for that one.\n\nNo more groveling to a \"Nagual\" to please keep his evil moth Ally \"Little Smoke\" away from you, because when she takes the form of a woven basket she bites too hard!\n\nWith the Nagual laughing behind your back, knowing that someday that ally will be the best friend you ever had.\n\nWe can go ahead and live in the river of shit, but still escape to dry land daily through sorcery.\n\nYou just use the tensegrity to do that.\n\nFocus all of your awareness on the movements, the smoothness of them, isolating just the muscles needed to do it perfectly, until your internal dialogue is absorbed in the Tensegrity and magic becomes fully visible.\n\nDarkness can help but we have skilled daylight waking dreamers in our community now.\n\nAll it takes is a \"sparkle\" of reliable magic,  gotten through any method, and you're on the right path to the North Pole!\n\nOr do womb dreaming and bring your double out of Elf Town, to play with some sorcery buddies in the real world.\n\nBoth being done now, almost (nearly) commonly.\n\nAnd then your fondest memories will be \"the real thing\".\n\nWhen you realize, spirits are real!  And visible, and solid, and scary as hell at first.  But if you overcome that, anything is possible.\n\nSleigh rides?  How about an actual ride on a magic carpet, manufactured by your handy Genie, which are abundant in Silent Knowledge.\n\nHow about using the Pandora's Box tensegrity pass to manufacture a \"Golem\".  An empty shell for a spirit to inhabit, in any form you like.\n\nYou could take your phantom spirit manifestation, using a borrowed witch's magical pet squirrel to give her life,  and go on that ride in the snow.  Looking like any lover in the world.\n\nI've seen Minx pretend to be Fred Astaire, dancing with Cholita as Ginger Rogers for a Christmas Special.\n\nWith an inorganic being world audience in the background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oh Yes, they DID!](https://preview.redd.it/g9dp6o5r4w5a1.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a0a9840a2af8dd86aeda4f7fe1f187c7335b44)\n\nAlthough I wouldn't recommend it.  Cholita's ally Minx is not to be trusted very far.\n\nShe (Minx) is hoping to become a solid \"real boy\" someday,  and will gladly use your energy to achieve that.\n\nCreepy as all hell that is.\n\nBack in the 90s, Carlos had Amy do an emergency call with 2 hours notice, to see who could show up in Los Angeles for a private class.  On Christmas Eve.\n\nOr maybe  the night before.  There's only 3 of us left, and neither of the other 2 remember that call.\n\nThe rest who might remember cursed Carlos, and leaped back into the river of shit where they are currently drowning. Or trying to cash in for having been there at all.\n\nI didn't understand why the emergency,  at the time.  But now I do.  He had a hoard of angry sorceresses on his hands.  Hooked on meaningless nonsense when they had magic right in front of themselves, better than the wildest rendition of \"A Christmas Carol\".\n\nIf they'd just put down the turkey for a while and be serious about learning sorcery.\n\nThat was the emergency.

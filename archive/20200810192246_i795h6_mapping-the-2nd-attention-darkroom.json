I also collected energy, that help me sooooo much to bring back fog to my view.   \n\n\nSome times I was feeling dizzy or nauseous, I kept breathing and not putting any mind to it, what is cool is, that after I pass that moment of bad feeling, my visuals become better. The fog becomes more clear, also some tipe of luminous color (grayish greenish, I do know that the shape are spheres and the borders have a different color) shows up once in a while. I was able to put it in my hand too. \n\nAnother interesting thing is that the fog effects increased also when i felt like falling asleep. Then when I kinda \"wake up\" the fog and the light increased.\n\nI felt tingles in my back multiple times, I mention them because I saw a correlation between my back \"feeling tired\" and the fog.\n\nIs valid to mention that last week I started to do Magical Passes. I practice them last night before sleep with my family heheheh. During darkroom I practice some of the beginners steps. They do help TREMENDOUSLY!!!!!!!!!

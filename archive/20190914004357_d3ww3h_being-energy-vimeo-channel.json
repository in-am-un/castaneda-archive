Half of the money is still in my safe. She thought it was too risky to deposit it all, since she's only recently given \"the hackers\" the slip.\n\nShe's not too sure about me though.\n\nBut there is one advantage for me, taking care of Cholita.\n\nShe likes to eat out.\n\nMinus the alcohol consumption, unfortunately.\n\nAnd she won't leave when she's done, to the chagrin of the restaurant hostesses who need the tables back.\n\nThat means I find myself in public, with nothing to do but wait for Cholita to decide to move on.\n\nUsually when I have nothing to do, I'm sitting in complete darkness at home.

I could still find cobwebs at her side, but they led back to themselves. None led to her left shoulder.\n\nAnd then she started to announce, presumably as a voice-over for her fountain video, that  Dan had become too blatant and was at it again.  She seemed to be confiding in some hidden audience, of fountain sorcery videos.\n\nI had to admit, what she was filming in the twilight was amazing.  Opposing beams of water were spewing from the mouth of giant fish, perfectly colliding in the middle to produce a spray of water drops. Speckles of light were dancing on the water, from the lights submerged below.\n\nShe didn't even glance my way when she narrated the video,  which I guess means I can't do that anymore.\n\nCome to think of it, don Juan's nagual blow might have been that way too.  As I recall, it had to be a surprise.\n\nAs for the contrary view, according to Cholita, and I tend to take what she says as a not-doing from Carlos,  words are very important.\n\nShe says it's important to learn some new words everyday, in whatever language you're interested in improving.\n\nShe suggested there was no clarity of thinking, without expanding one's available words.  And no true understanding is possible without the right assortment of words in your mind.\n\nIf you consider the 8 point diagram,  reason can't even access dreaming, without talking in the middle.\n\nI've watched her randomly wander around, making videos of the features she sees on buildings.  Each time she tries to sum it up in beautiful words.\n\nIt's like she's creating new meaning from what's already there, a sort of external version of shifting the assemblage point.   Maybe that's what Taisha means when she says, \"Stalking a position of the assemblage point\".\n\nCholita knows she's stuck in dreaming,  which explains her randomly shouting, \"WAKE UP!!!\"\n\nMaybe she's trying to find her way back using words to connect to reason.\n\nAfter explaining the importance of words, she started to curse everyone around us, saying it was the day of the ugly people, all being out and about.\n\nShe had a Spanish phrase for it.

Second Ring of Power is worth another look in that respect.\n\nFor new people, everything you see in the darkroom, once you start seeing actual magic, might all get lumped together.\n\nOutsiders will do that.\n\nIt's all \"not really there\" so it's all the same thing to someone who can't do that.\n\nBut it's NOT!!!\n\nThat would be like assuming everything you see in the wilderness, is all just \"wilderness stuff\".\n\nBut a wilderness brush fire, is not the same as a wilderness cave with rattle snake sounds coming out, or a wilderness cougar.\n\nEach is a completely different thing.\n\nAnd each with their own danger or use.\n\nIn the darkroom, a floating dream bubble is NOT the same as an inorganic being manifestation.\n\nBut you have to see them over and over to realize that.\n\nAnd someone's double making a visit, is also not the same thing as a dream phantom.\n\nEach has it's own \"qualities\", which don't change and can be used to tell things apart.\n\nThat manifesting bird for example, would be a dream phantom.\n\nI haven't seen one with a single thing in it, there's usually some background because it's in a dream bubble.\n\nBut \"manifested\" objects (sought instead of appearing at random) are individual objects without a background scene.\n\nIOBs can also do that. But the way it materialized, animating at full speed, is a sure indication it's not an inorganic being.\n\nThe IOBs seek us out because they're slow, and want to speed up.

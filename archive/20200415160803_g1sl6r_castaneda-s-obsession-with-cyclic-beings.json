I used to do it often when I was more fascinated with \"stopping the world\".\n\nI've switched to entering dream worlds lately,  on account of Cholita.  She needs the kind of protection only a dreaming body can give her.\n\nI can't do both; stop the world and learn to solidify my dreaming body.\n\nNot enough energy.\n\nBut don't be confused by that statement: not enough energy.\n\nIt's not magical at all.  It means, too much wine, too many re-runs on TV, too many arguments with Cholita, and on and on.\n\nEnergy may seem magical, but most of it is perfectly ordinary.\n\nThus, you \"save energy\" by being impeccable.\n\nI'd rather not.\n\nBack to skipping beads.\n\nSomewhere near stopping the world, you get offered a choice. To go into another world.\n\nAnd Carlos' allies can offer that also.  Very dramatically I might add. It's better to do it yourself unless you want a heart attack.\n\nThese are real worlds you just walk into.  Stable as can be.\n\nI presume, because it feels just as Carlos described in there, that it has to be a cyclic being.\n\nYou end up there with memories of living there.  People know you, you know them.\n\nIt's not like lucid dreaming.  In lucid dreaming, you have to fight to retain lucidity.\n\nAnd you have to fight to stay in it (in the beginning).\n\nAnd it's chaotic, and everything you stare at changes.\n\nAlso, if you get good at holding lucidity and learn to change dreams, you inevitably bounce from dream to dream, while trying to wake up.\n\nThat can be quite frightening the first few times.\n\nIt doesn't happen in these worlds. Entry and exit are clean.\n\nPossibly that's because, you aren't asleep as you are in lucid dreaming.\n\nYou're wide awake, eyes open, and you step in there.\n\nCarlos also said, some worlds are only accessible through silence. He was trying to help us understand that lucid dreaming worlds are not the same as the ones you get to with silence.  Maybe the ones you get to with silence have their own energy, but the lucid dreaming ones are almost 100% phantoms.\n\nSo finding a new world, while trying to stop the world, agrees with that statement.  That some worlds are only accessible through silence.\n\nConsidering how rare it is to be able to do that (because you have to be silent), it's not surprising that a lot of mythology got added onto that knowledge.\n\nThere's the \"real\" knowledge, but then there's the explanations that get added on.\n\nThose can actually alter what you perceive, because they change the *intent*.\n\nLet's say some Indian sage, 2000 years ago, learns to enter those worlds.\n\nOf course they did!  We're all using the same body.\n\nIn the process of describing it, he speculates it felt like \"him\".  It WAS him.\n\nBut he's here now.  So he concludes, it must be at another time.\n\nMust be in the past, since the future hasn't happened  yet.\n\nIt's a \"past life\".\n\nIt's such a fun idea, it's worth some money. So booklets are printed up explaining it.  People flock to that particular guru, because his tales of power are the most fun.  He becomes the \"re-incarnation\" guru.\n\nAlong come me-too re-incarnation experts, with their own books.\n\nOne guy named Miguel says, all the souls are waiting to be born, in a giant hall. On death you end up there, waiting for the next life.\n\nThat book deal is very lucrative, so along comes Armando and says, you get to pick your parents, and watch them have sex to make you.\n\nThere are so many me-too re-incarnation books, they need specialty book stores.\n\nTemples are built all over.  They earn a lot of their money from the re-incarnation books, but the community needs other things, so pretty soon they're handling funerals, weddings, and prostitution.\n\nAdd on that the tendency of people to cling to their beliefs, almost violently, and you end up with several major religions who will take a sledgehammer to you, if you want to talk factually about whether re-incarnation is real or not.\n\nI believe Carlos was actually leaning that way for a bit, but in private classes he took on the topic several times, in response to particular students who had a block in that area.\n\nHe made fun of the idea.\n\nI guess you could sum it up:  It's a predatory universe.  No little being is any more important than any other.\n\nIt's not a human-loving universe, which helps you perfect yourself over many lifetimes.\n\nI have no opinion on it. I try to keep out of the religion business, except to make fun of it when it's rather dogmatic.\n\nEdited three times", "edited": 1586995738.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fnhnyjf", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Carlos, humans (maybe all organic beings) are strung together like a bead curtain, with some kind of attachment to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can skip from your own normal &amp;quot;bead&amp;quot; (world) to one of the others on your string.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t skip to a different string.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t theoretical.

It means, too much wine, too many re-runs on TV, too many arguments with Cholita, and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Energy may seem magical, but most of it is perfectly ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, you &amp;quot;save energy&amp;quot; by being impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to skipping beads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere near stopping the world, you get offered a choice. To go into another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carlos&amp;#39; allies can offer that also.  Very dramatically I might add. It&amp;#39;s better to do it yourself unless you want a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are real worlds you just walk into.  Stable as can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I presume, because it feels just as Carlos described in there, that it has to be a cyclic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You end up there with memories of living there.  People know you, you know them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like lucid dreaming.  In lucid dreaming, you have to fight to retain lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you have to fight to stay in it (in the beginning).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s chaotic, and everything you stare at changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you get good at holding lucidity and learn to change dreams, you inevitably bounce from dream to dream, while trying to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That can be quite frightening the first few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t happen in these worlds. Entry and exit are clean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly that&amp;#39;s because, you aren&amp;#39;t asleep as you are in lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re wide awake, eyes open, and you step in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos also said, some worlds are only accessible through silence. He was trying to help us understand that lucid dreaming worlds are not the same as the ones you get to with silence.  Maybe the ones you get to with silence have their own energy, but the lucid dreaming ones are almost 100% phantoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So finding a new world, while trying to stop the world, agrees with that statement.  That some worlds are only accessible through silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering how rare it is to be able to do that (because you have to be silent), it&amp;#39;s not surprising that a lot of mythology got added onto that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; knowledge, but then there&amp;#39;s the explanations that get added on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those can actually alter what you perceive, because they change the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say some Indian sage, 2000 years ago, learns to enter those worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course they did!  We&amp;#39;re all using the same body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the process of describing it, he speculates it felt like &amp;quot;him&amp;quot;.  It WAS him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#39;s here now.  So he concludes, it must be at another time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must be in the past, since the future hasn&amp;#39;t happened  yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;past life&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a fun idea, it&amp;#39;s worth some money. So booklets are printed up explaining it.  People flock to that particular guru, because his tales of power are the most fun.  He becomes the &amp;quot;re-incarnation&amp;quot; guru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along come me-too re-incarnation experts, with their own books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One guy named Miguel says, all the souls are waiting to be born, in a giant hall. On death you end up there, waiting for the next life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That book deal is very lucrative, so along comes Armando and says, you get to pick your parents, and watch them have sex to make you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many me-too re-incarnation books, they need specialty book stores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Temples are built all over.  They earn a lot of their money from the re-incarnation books, but the community needs other things, so pretty soon they&amp;#39;re handling funerals, weddings, and prostitution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add on that the tendency of people to cling to their beliefs, almost violently, and you end up with several major religions who will take a sledgehammer to you, if you want to talk factually about whether re-incarnation is real or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Carlos was actually leaning that way for a bit, but in private classes he took on the topic several times, in response to particular students who had a block in that area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He made fun of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you could sum it up:  It&amp;#39;s a predatory universe.  No little being is any more important than any other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a human-loving universe, which helps you perfect yourself over many lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no opinion on it. I try to keep out of the religion business, except to make fun of it when it&amp;#39;s rather dogmatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_g1sl6r", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g1sl6r/castanedas_obsession_with_cyclic_beings/fnhnyjf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1586965823.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fnhcp6c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Grampong", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1586959862.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_g1sl6r", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_12w23f", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Finally got the time to start the thread.\n\nLet's get me up to speed on terminology.

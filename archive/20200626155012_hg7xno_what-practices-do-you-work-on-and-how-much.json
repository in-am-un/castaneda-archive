And I don\u2019t limit myself to just nagualist practices. I\u2019ve also put in plenty of time on eastern mystical pursuits, especially those associated with Taoism. I figure that building qi is pretty much the same thing as storing personal power. That said, these are the ones that I mainly practice now:\n\n1. **magical passes**: I\u2019ve learned about 95% of the passes in the book as well as the first two videos that were put out before the book even came along. I can do them now automatically without having to think about what\u2019s next at all. I do about 10 of each pass, which takes around 2 hours to do them all. Usually, I split them into two halves and do an hour\u2019s worth every other day.\n\n2. **meditation**: I originally learned Transcendental Meditation, which is a form of mantra meditation. That means you keep quietly repeating a mantra like \u201com\u201d in your head to displace other thoughts and help you achieve inner silence. I practice a few other techniques as well, including recapitulation, although I usually reserve that for clearing my mind of past events that are really bugging me and that I can\u2019t seem to let go of. I try to do an hour of meditation every day.\n\n3. **yoga**: I learned a form of yoga from monkey kung fu master Paulie Zink many years ago. It\u2019s similar to hatha yoga, but with more direct connection to the qi meridians and enhancing qi flow. I probably do a half hour at a time, maybe 3 or 4 times a week.\n\n4. **bagua**: Bagua is one of the three internal martial arts along with taiqi and hsing i. Bagua involves a lot of torso twisting to generate power and is very good for opening up qi flow along the spine. It\u2019s signature practice is \u201ccircle walking\u201d which is a kind of moving meditation.

It's in one of the books.\n\nCarlos argues with him and says that means it comes from the smoking mixture.\n\nDon Juan says he misunderstood, and he's given it that name for his own reasons.\n\nI'm assuming it's because it looks like a little puff of smoke when not \"seen\".  When using the ordinary eyes.\n\nBut I haven't seen any explanation.\n\nAnd as far as I know, the Devil's weed ally's name is never given.\n\nOne of them can also appear as a talking coyote.\n\nAnd as I recall, both can come along as a pair of growling beasts?\n\nIt's a good idea to give them names. It saves a lot of time.\n\nThey understand which one you mean when you use their name.\n\nMinx wanted to play this morning.  He's calling himself baybay in dreaming.\n\nI'd love to know where that name comes from. I'll try asking Cholita if she's seen baybay.\n\nBut it's unlikely she'll answer.\n\nThe other day I realized, I've never seen one of Carlos' allies, at the same time as Fairy or Minx.\n\nOr any of the others I learned to play with over the last year or two.\n\nIt could in fact be that Fairy is little smoke, and Minx is the devil's weed ally.\n\nWe won't know until some of you learn to get silent, play with colors, and capture your own IOB.\n\nOr until I can get Fairy and Little Smoke to be present at the same time.\n\nLast time little smoke hid as soon as I noticed him, and then Fairy emerged a couple of seconds later.\n\nThe last time Fairy showed up first, she warned me little smoke was about to come by simulating a scary scream, and when he arrived I didn't bother to see if she was still around.  He was too hypnotic to look away.\n\nAlso, the Devil's weed ally seems very much to prefer dreaming interactions, to waking ones.\n\nI always see him hiding behind the little smoke, when I'm viewing them awake. Over 25 years of time, since Carlos passed them on to his private class and I started seeing them almost immediately.\n\nAnd in dreaming, the little smoke tends to remain in the corner while the devil's weed ally takes the lead.\n\nMinx has been behaving like that, with his \"Baybay\" persona.\n\nThat would be a pity if they were the same.

I&amp;#39;ll try asking Cholita if she&amp;#39;s seen baybay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s unlikely she&amp;#39;ll answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other day I realized, I&amp;#39;ve never seen one of Carlos&amp;#39; allies, at the same time as Fairy or Minx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or any of the others I learned to play with over the last year or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could in fact be that Fairy is little smoke, and Minx is the devil&amp;#39;s weed ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;#39;t know until some of you learn to get silent, play with colors, and capture your own IOB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or until I can get Fairy and Little Smoke to be present at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last time little smoke hid as soon as I noticed him, and then Fairy emerged a couple of seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time Fairy showed up first, she warned me little smoke was about to come by simulating a scary scream, and when he arrived I didn&amp;#39;t bother to see if she was still around.  He was too hypnotic to look away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the Devil&amp;#39;s weed ally seems very much to prefer dreaming interactions, to waking ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always see him hiding behind the little smoke, when I&amp;#39;m viewing them awake. Over 25 years of time, since Carlos passed them on to his private class and I started seeing them almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in dreaming, the little smoke tends to remain in the corner while the devil&amp;#39;s weed ally takes the lead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx has been behaving like that, with his &amp;quot;Baybay&amp;quot; persona.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would be a pity if they were the same.

That leads to the 3rd attention in the long run.\n\nMove it very far daily, and you'll eventually be able to see the energy body.  Not to mention, changing worlds **for real**, is pretty damned cool!  \"Readers of Infinity\" publication from Carlos had the key to doing that.  He even taunted us with a picture of what can happen, on the cover of Wheel of Time.\n\nDid everyone get that this cover art is an actual thing you can do, and not an analogy?\n\nI didn't.\n\nAnd also shared dreaming comes from that technique, since you can gaze at the second attention fog and use that as a surface.

That leads to the 3rd attention in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Move it very far daily, and you&amp;#39;ll eventually be able to see the energy body.  Not to mention, changing worlds &lt;strong&gt;for real&lt;/strong&gt;, is pretty damned cool!  &amp;quot;Readers of Infinity&amp;quot; publication from Carlos had the key to doing that.  He even taunted us with a picture of what can happen, on the cover of Wheel of Time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did everyone get that this cover art is an actual thing you can do, and not an analogy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also shared dreaming comes from that technique, since you can gaze at the second attention fog and use that as a surface.

That path is death to sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rewards for following &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; instead, are much greater. It brings actual happiness (all day samadhi).

There's a lovely post in here about the Fire Kasina texts.  You have the Buddha playing with inorganic beings, assembling other worlds, and generally proving what Daniel Ingram says.\n\nDid you see the Daniel Ingram tape? I like that he even explains, magic makes you happy.\n\nHe's Tibettan Buddhism.\n\nThe Buddha was just a yogi who developed super powers.  He could do real magic.\n\nPeople go crazy over that stuff!\n\nIt doesn't matter where or when, there's a total magic shortage in the world, and human beings NEED it, to be happy.\n\nI supposed the way it went was, he felt like I do,  having made Carlos' techniques work.  He wanted to teach others, so they could explore together and push the limits.\n\nAs I recall, he had 4 close disciples.\n\nBut what happened next, was what always happens.\n\nThey found they could make money off it.\n\nThose 4 got their cut, their students went out to get their cut, and now we have the Buddhist religion.\n\nI supposed I took liberties there, but the basic principle is the same.  People make franchise schemes out of magic. And it spreads exponentially, until there's no chance in hell of any magic remaining.\n\nThere's a post in here with an interview with Felix.\n\nHe's gone Ken Eagle Feather, meaning, offering himself as better than Carlos, who according to him, had gone bad.\n\nHe claims, you should listen to him instead.\n\nFelix was sort of paired off with me and Corey for some things.\n\nIt was most of the heart of faction #3, an alternative to Cleargreen #1 and #2.  And #M.\n\nI had high hopes for both of those guys, but they're gone.\n\nJoined the ranks of the petty tyrants forever.\n\nWe don't have much in here about Taoist masters, but there is one post, with some pics of those guys in Taiwan.\n\nHowever, Daoism is rather impotent now.

I like that he even explains, magic makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s Tibettan Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was just a yogi who developed super powers.  He could do real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People go crazy over that stuff!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter where or when, there&amp;#39;s a total magic shortage in the world, and human beings NEED it, to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed the way it went was, he felt like I do,  having made Carlos&amp;#39; techniques work.  He wanted to teach others, so they could explore together and push the limits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I recall, he had 4 close disciples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what happened next, was what always happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They found they could make money off it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those 4 got their cut, their students went out to get their cut, and now we have the Buddhist religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed I took liberties there, but the basic principle is the same.  People make franchise schemes out of magic. And it spreads exponentially, until there&amp;#39;s no chance in hell of any magic remaining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a post in here with an interview with Felix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s gone Ken Eagle Feather, meaning, offering himself as better than Carlos, who according to him, had gone bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He claims, you should listen to him instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Felix was sort of paired off with me and Corey for some things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was most of the heart of faction #3, an alternative to Cleargreen #1 and #2.

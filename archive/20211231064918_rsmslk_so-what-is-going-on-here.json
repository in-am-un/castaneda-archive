Oddly, he was never grumpy with me.\n\nBut that Amy interview made him sound tyrannical.\n\nI think it's actually a natural evolution.  \n\nThis subreddit started with individuals, but the truth of the matter is it's going to turn into something a lot more like a lineage, if it survives.\n\nOr, to give credit to native americans, a \"counsel\".\n\nIf you read all of the books, you can remember some in the lineage were grumpy, some joking, some college professor like, and then there were the women...\n\nIt actually caused apprentices to \"pal up\" with a compatible lineage member and run when another one was headed their way.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to be the guy who gets pissed off, picks an apprentice up by the neck, and tosses them into the second attention without warning.  \n\nI recommend instituting a martial arts like \"belt system\".\n\nAnd I don't have to respond to anyone below green belt.\n\nEven assign specific \"forms\" at each level.\n\nForms selected to produce a visible result a person at that level can perceive.\n\nWhite belts MUST learn mashing energy.  It's a building block for a simple red zone phantom room.\n\nTrust me when I say, there's a lot more than \"puffs\" available to look at.  And I'm sure people would discover it, if they kept going.\n\nBut the puffs become somewhat boring, and you can lose people.\n\nIf there were \"goals\", like earning your black belt, that might not be such a bad thing.\n\nEspecially if you knew, each belt represented success in an entire area of magic.\n\nBlue meant you understand what the internal dialogue is, from direct experience.\n\nGreen means you can scoop a puff.\n\nRed means...  Well all of you know about the red zone.  It's hard to even pick something from the red zone, that you should learn to do in order to earn that belt.\n\nThe thing is, Tensegrity literally bores holes into reality out just before the purple zone.  I was looking at those the other day, wondering if Carlos wasn't intending to dig the floor out from under us, with us totally unaware.\n\nBut to sustain a view of that more than a second is extremely difficult.  It's more than absolute silence you need to do that, you have to have 0% \"self\" remaining.\n\nIn the mid orange zone,  you can open portals on your walls.  And jump through them!\n\nThere's so much more than puffs. I try to post about them, but new people will never find that.\n\nIn most martial arts studios (except rigid japanese ones), when you come in the studio there's a giant wooden sign showing the belts, and what you learn at each level.\n\nTo lure in paying customers.\n\nSo I suppose you could have a belt system, with each belt getting material that's actually very appropriate for that level.\n\nPlus each picks a \"special project\" to make sure we don't overlook new discoveries.\n\nThen at the more advanced levels, you have to write a \"thesis\" on something very advanced.\n\nSuch as, what are the textures of whitish light, and where are they relatively speaking, on the J curve?\n\nHow to maintain a phantom room's current appearance.\n\nHow many decorations can you produce in a phantom room, before their uniqueness is lost?\n\nAre some types of phantom floors better than others?\n\nDoes sharpness of focus of phantom objects indicate the stand alone energy content?\n\nMaybe that black belt comes with the ring I mentioned early on.\n\nI just must get Cholita to produce those...", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hqpov8m", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re in chat discussing how I can be piercing a reality bubble all night, trying to push it all the way to a flattened phantom copy of Pandora, with the help of my 3 spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then come in the next day and have to see 999 pointless questions and an angry new guy,  addressed to me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus 3 private chat requests including astral travelers trying to lure me to a new subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos got a reputation for being grumpy.  Oddly, he was never grumpy with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that Amy interview made him sound tyrannical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s actually a natural evolution.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This subreddit started with individuals, but the truth of the matter is it&amp;#39;s going to turn into something a lot more like a lineage, if it survives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, to give credit to native americans, a &amp;quot;counsel&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read all of the books, you can remember some in the lineage were grumpy, some joking, some college professor like, and then there were the women...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It actually caused apprentices to &amp;quot;pal up&amp;quot; with a compatible lineage member and run when another one was headed their way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;d like to be the guy who gets pissed off, picks an apprentice up by the neck, and tosses them into the second attention without warning.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recommend instituting a martial arts like &amp;quot;belt system&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;#39;t have to respond to anyone below green belt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even assign specific &amp;quot;forms&amp;quot; at each level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forms selected to produce a visible result a person at that level can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;White belts MUST learn mashing energy.  It&amp;#39;s a building block for a simple red zone phantom room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me when I say, there&amp;#39;s a lot more than &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; available to look at.  And I&amp;#39;m sure people would discover it, if they kept going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the puffs become somewhat boring, and you can lose people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there were &amp;quot;goals&amp;quot;, like earning your black belt, that might not be such a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially if you knew, each belt represented success in an entire area of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue meant you understand what the internal dialogue is, from direct experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Green means you can scoop a puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Red means...  Well all of you know about the red zone.  It&amp;#39;s hard to even pick something from the red zone, that you should learn to do in order to earn that belt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, Tensegrity literally bores holes into reality out just before the purple zone.  I was looking at those the other day, wondering if Carlos wasn&amp;#39;t intending to dig the floor out from under us, with us totally unaware.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to sustain a view of that more than a second is extremely difficult.  It&amp;#39;s more than absolute silence you need to do that, you have to have 0% &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; remaining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the mid orange zone,  you can open portals on your walls.

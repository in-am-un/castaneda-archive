I've tried sleeping mask too, but not as good.  I do want to try to black out a room for practice, I need to get on that ...\n\nWife and I decided to move our bedroom to another room in the house, light blue walls and white vaulted ceiling, white ceiling fan, several big windows, mild nightly ambient light. I've woken up in the night and gazed at the ceiling a few times, very different than the dark. The purple comes in clusters of intense dots of light, and large black areas float around. I think those black areas are something I've seen in darker settings and thought it was the sensitivity of my eyes gazing without blinking, don't really know. The white fan blends into the ceiling easily, and it's like a projector screen to watch the colors on. \n\nTwo things happened this morning I'd like feedback on. After about half an hour of watching the clusters of dots and black regions floating around the ceiling, I started seeing amber colored clouds floating around too. They were vividly bright, they'd spring up, grow to a size, and shrink to nothing, pop up somewhere else.. And as the daylight was just coming up, casting a light on the ceiling fan (which had been invisible up to now), shadows of the fan began becoming visible, and making various shapes, and a face. (I see faces a lot, much more than I think anything is actually there, I think it was all the Stephen King movies I watched as a kid coming to mind) This face stuck around, and appeared like it was wearing a bird-like mask. I thought \"put that face away, it's creepy AF\" and the face disappeared, but felt like something was still in the spot where it had been, like a blurry place keeper for someone going to change clothes and return. Then all the lights on the ceiling stopped, and an intense line of amber light connected from that spot to my chest, and a milder face appeared in the same spot. I blinked several times, it was unnerving and I wasn't sure what to do, but it persisted. The line was something I've never seen or dreamed of before, it was thick, like a shaft of lightning, but moved slowly and fluidly, like a column of glowing yellow water. It was like watching yellow lightning that stayed continuously reflected on the surface of water.I did not fall physically asleep, eyes open the whole time. The incident may have lasted three or four minutes of me watching the line, the face just sitting in the shadow of my fan, and the feeling was warm, electric, and my heart rate was increasing steadily, with an itchy/burning sensation.

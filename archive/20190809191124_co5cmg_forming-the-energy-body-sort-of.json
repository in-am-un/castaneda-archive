[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "I'm almost reluctant to post this, after the comments about whether  I might be pulling all of your legs, with the sleeping mask gift from intent.  I assure you, this is as close as I can get to describing what happened last night, when I tried out the mask.   I was as surprised as you would have been.\n\nAnything that's not precise is the result of trying to condense 4 hours into a short narrative.  So take it as you will, but it's the truth and you can do this also.\n\nJust give up on the idea that this path is \"spiritual\".  It is not, and never was intended to be. It's just an ancient technology.  Go find spirituality elsewhere.  I certainly hope the other students of Carlos haven't devolved to represent themselves as \"spiritual people\".\n\nIn classes, Carlos was often reluctant to give details on how to do any given technique. In the case of recapitulation for example, when someone asked him to show the precise head movement, he hesitated, looked over to Taisha, and she obliged. But she kept the description very short, and limited it to answering only the specific question asked. She also kept glancing at Carlos, to make sure it was ok to keep explaining.\n\nCarlos gave out the same lack of information for other things. And that led to doubt in his students. For example, there was a rumor that Carlos had \u201cstolen\u201d Howard Lee\u2019s Kungfu, and Howard wasn\u2019t happy. Carlos could have put that rumor to bed by giving more detailed explanations of the energy balls you can form with tensegrity, and showing how you could have put those moves into any other martial art. Especially perhaps Tai Chi.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t. He let the doubts stand. I also believe he was partly remembering the chaos of learning, and how each of the apprentices had come up with their own bizarre result of don Juan\u2019s techniques. La Gorda\u2019s third eye is a good example.\n\nThat\u2019s merely a manifestation of the second attention being accessible to her through closed eyes.  Many meditators see the room with closed eyes, and you could see \u201cthe wall\u201d instead of an eye.  But the impression la Gorda seemed to be giving was that anyone would end up seeing that eye.\n\nCarlos may have simply been trying not to prejudice what might develop, with so many apprentices available in his Sunday class and at workshops.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve been reading specific places in his books to find specific techniques which we might all practice. I\u2019ve come to believe that every single one will work if you actually try it. Even something as bizarre as one of don Juan\u2019s apprentices having been said to have grown an extra arm.\n\nI tried to find that just now in the searchable pdf, and was shocked to see that the word \u201carm\u201d led to technique after technique. I didn\u2019t have the patience to keep looking for the one referring to the extra arm. But we have a lot of cool techniques we can try out, from those books.\n\nLast night I continued my quest to make La Gorda\u2019s flying technique work. If you want to read up on it, here\u2019s a little you could use for a search:\n\n\u201cShe repeated the snapping movement of her fingers as she threw her hands over her head, and I saw a spray of long, luminous fibers flying away from her fingers. I had to tilt my head up to see them against the already dark sky. They appeared to be long, fine filaments of a reddish light. After a while they faded and disappeared.\u201d\n\nSo far I had this going for me. I had seen the red filaments of light in the past, while rubbing puffs of purple color on my legs, to make them brighter. I\u2019ll describe them in detail, but remember that Carlos probably would not have. The filaments look like a piece of cotton kite string in that they are thicker than thread, but not as thick as a rope. But instead of being perfectly straight, they\u2019re jagged in some indiscernible energetic way. You get the feeling when you look at them that if you could stick your finger in there, it would pick up a lot of energy, maybe even hurt a bit.  And the color stands out from anything else I\u2019ve seen watching colors in the dark. They are very distinct.  The closest analogy I can think of, is a heater filament which is glowing reddish orange on the way to fully heating up.\n\nWhile practicing la Gorda\u2019s flicking technique, I had caught a glimpse of a fiber or two in the last few days. If you can get a technique to do something, then maybe you can keep doing it to get more.\n\nThat\u2019s not always true with sorcery, but most of the time it is for the small things like seeing colors or filaments.\n\nI started by doing some tensegrity, because I had woken up around 2AM, felt bad from excessive wine drinking and binge TV watching, and wanted very badly to just go back to sleep. As soon as I did a little tensegrity, my assemblage point shifted. That usually takes at least an hour. You can tell it has shifted towards heightened awareness, because your breathing gets automatic and only the stomach moves, and you no longer feel tired.\n\nI looked around the room, only to find that there were solid purple patches everywhere. Not just floating in a specific spot, in random locations. The room was a patch of purple flat surfaces, with details of lines in them. If someone had exploded some light purple fabric so that all the pieces were tossed into the air, but all facing the source of the explosion, that\u2019s what it sort of looked like. You could see the weave of the purple fabric pieces.\n\nMy reaction was, \u201cWhat the hell???!!\u201d\n\nI realized, I had to go get that sleeping mask out of the oven. This was the ideal condition to try it out.\n\nAlthough the sleeping mask seemed to be a gift from *intent*, there was no way to know who delivered it. I pictured a homeless person stumbling by with their shopping cart, and a sleeping mask falling out onto the grass.  I was afraid to put it on for fear of one of the communicable diseases ravaging the homeless population in the LA area, so I put it into the oven and let it sit for an hour at pasteurization temperatures.\n\nIt was in the kitchen. I brought it back to my bedroom, and laid it next to my bowl of water. Both were contained in the same square bowl.  The bowls are unique. A Russian visitor had left them.  The two of them sitting next to each other on the table looked like I was practicing some kind of Zen water ceremony.\n\nI restored darkness by closing the door, worried the purple lights might not be so bright now. But they were every bit as bright. I walked over to the light switch, put on the sleeping mask, and turned on the lights.\n\nThe purple patches were still everywhere! The mask made no difference.  In fact, I could even open my eyes with it on.\n\nThinking I had my answer, I turned off the lights, took off the mask, and went back to trying out la Gorda\u2019s technique. I dipped my hands into the water, and flicked drops as hard as I could, up at a 45 degree angle.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the water drops traveling.  But I did see an amazing display of super bright blue lights, the kind I usually associate with an inorganic being\u2019s presence.\n\nI realized, that wasn\u2019t proof that the flicking technique was eventually going to work. The display of super bright lights seemed to be the result of flicking so hard that I jolted my back a little. I jolted my arms up and down so as to copy that feeling in my back, and it did indeed seem to be the cause of the brighter lights.\n\nThey were so amazing that I couldn't help but sit down on some pillows, and try to pull those super lights into my second attention\u2019s assemblage point, using Zuleica\u2019s harp movement.\n\nI seemed to be pulling an enormous amount of light into that area. I\u2019d never done that before. Usually it was just barely enough light to be satisfying. In the past it gave me the impression it might take forever to light up the energy body using that technique.\n\nI had such a mass of light now close to my stomach, that my little low energy inorganic being became interested. She drifted into the lights, and formed pleasing faces for me.\n\nI wiggled my fingers on the precise spot where Zuleica said the second attention has it\u2019s assemblage point, hoping to lure my inorganic into that area to help with bringing in colors. But I noticed something very strange. I had 4 hands!\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I had 4 arms and each had a hand, it was more like the 2 arms I had, with their 2 hands, were ghosted by another set. I hadn\u2019t anticipated anything like that. I thought that the \u201cenergy body\u201d was just a blob of light, like a luminous cocoon. I never thought it could simply be another copy of your \u201creal\u201d body.\n\nI rotated my wrists, moved my hands left and right, trying to figure out the rules. Are they independent? Or does the one only follow the other, like a lagging image?\n\nThe extra copy of my right hand had some junk stuck to it. It was like it had picked up stuff from the air. I wiggled it to see if the junk was attached or floating.\n\nMy little fairy rushed over at top speed, as if I\u2019d finally gotten home very late, and put out a bowl of dog food. She was eager to get that energy.\n\nI wondered if I could summon one of Carlos Allies using that energy, so I stretched my right arm towards the last place it had manifested. It had shown up as a frantically talking head, trying to tell me something, and made out of intense ultra-violet light.\n\nA patch of ultra-violet started to form on the wall, and details began to emerge. I had no doubt, it was going to appear.\n\nContinued due to word count limits\n\nEdited: three times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Forming the Energy Body (Sort of)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_co5cmg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1565546471.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1565370684.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m almost reluctant to post this, after the comments about whether  I might be pulling all of your legs, with the sleeping mask gift from intent.

All the information out there on Carlos, is posturing warrior way nonsense.

Yes, that&amp;#39;s all true. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what the heck happened to the Sunday class warriors? All gone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so bad that, if some of them read my postings, they wouldn&amp;#39;t believe it.

It finally got as near as five or six inches from my body. It was as if something in me had shrunk. I actually thought I could feel a dent. I then had another eerie sensation.

[\u2026] First I noticed the itch on the point of the second attention in my luminous shell. I massaged that point by moving my fingers on it as if I were playing a harp and the point sunk towards my stomach. I felt it almost on my skin. I experienced a prickling sensation on the outside of my right calf. It was a mixture of pleasure and pain. The sensation radiated to my whole leg and then to my lower back. I felt that my buttocks were shaking. My entire body was transfixed by a nervous ripple. I thought that my body had been caught upside down in a net. My forehead and my toes seemed to be touching. I was like a closed U-shape. Then I felt as if I were being folded in two and rolled inside a sheet. My nervous spasms were what made the sheet roll\ninto itself, with me in the center. When the rolling ended I could not sense my body any more. I was only an amorphous awareness, a nervous spasm wrapped in itself. That awareness came to rest inside a ditch, inside a depression of itself.  \nZuleica said that the right and left side awareness are wrapped up together. Both of them come to rest in one single bundle in the dent, the depressed center of the second attention. To do dreaming one needs to manipulate both the luminous body and the physical body. First, the center of assembling for the second attention has to be made accessible by being pushed in from the outside by someone else, or sucked in from within by the dreamer. Second, in order to dislodge the first attention, the centers of the physical body located in the midsection and the calves, especially the right one, have to be stimulated and placed as close to one another as possible until they seem to join. Then the sensation of being bundled takes place and automatically the second attention takes over. Zuleica also said that the feeling of being rolled up like a cigar and placed inside the dent of the second attention was the result of merging my right and left awareness into one in which the order of predominance has been switched and the left has gained supremacy.\n\nThe next step is sweeping the ground with the midsection to move at will, and then dreaming becomes a cinch.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ewrdoxv", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift&lt;/em&gt;, the tickling of that point creates a dent in the energy body, which brings the right and left-side awarenesses together so the second attention can predominate:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The longer I kept up the wavering motion, the closer I felt the itching.

I massaged that point by moving my fingers on it as if I were playing a harp and the point sunk towards my stomach. I felt it almost on my skin. I experienced a prickling sensation on the outside of my right calf. It was a mixture of pleasure and pain. The sensation radiated to my whole leg and then to my lower back. I felt that my buttocks were shaking. My entire body was transfixed by a nervous ripple. I thought that my body had been caught upside down in a net. My forehead and my toes seemed to be touching. I was like a closed U-shape. Then I felt as if I were being folded in two and rolled inside a sheet. My nervous spasms were what made the sheet roll\ninto itself, with me in the center. When the rolling ended I could not sense my body any more. I was only an amorphous awareness, a nervous spasm wrapped in itself. That awareness came to rest inside a ditch, inside a depression of itself.&lt;br/&gt;\nZuleica said that the right and left side awareness are wrapped up together. Both of them come to rest in one single bundle in the dent, the depressed center of the second attention. To do dreaming one needs to manipulate both the luminous body and the physical body. First, the center of assembling for the second attention has to be made accessible by being pushed in from the outside by someone else, or sucked in from within by the dreamer. Second, in order to dislodge the first attention, the centers of the physical body located in the midsection and the calves, especially the right one, have to be stimulated and placed as close to one another as possible until they seem to join. Then the sensation of being bundled takes place and automatically the second attention takes over. Zuleica also said that the feeling of being rolled up like a cigar and placed inside the dent of the second attention was the result of merging my right and left awareness into one in which the order of predominance has been switched and the left has gained supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next step is sweeping the ground with the midsection to move at will, and then dreaming becomes a cinch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_co5cmg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/co5cmg/forming_the_energy_body_sort_of/ewrdoxv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1565702779.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1565702779.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ewmrpks", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ewm76d2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;don\u2019t know how to order these on reddit\n\nAnyone can choose to order the comments in a post either by date (newest to oldest or vice versa) or by upvotes etc..

Step by step you\u2019re supposed to see the next thing happen.\n\nI was tickled pink when I darkened the room, sat on some pillows, forced silence, and saw a giant blob of purple and fuzzy white stuff around my stomach.\n\nRight on top of the purple light was a pretty hypnogogic head. It looked like my low energy inorganic wanted to try to repeat what happened before. Or maybe she was floating in bliss.\n\nThe purple blob took on the most intense form, a form Carlos described in class as a sworl, and which people who write to me have also seen.\n\nIt\u2019s a blob of purple light that\u2019s rotating, so it looks a tiny bit like a yin-yang shape. The half that isn\u2019t purple is jet black. I suspect that\u2019s what Carlos was describing in the mirror technique, where you find a water spirit.\n\nAlong with the purple and black were flat and wide edges of yellowish grey. Carlos had reported seeing yellowish green in some other accounts.\n\nWatching my little fairy head swim around, I wondered if I still had my *dreaming* hands. I wiggled my fingers, and they were still there.\n\nExcept, the reach of them had extended. They were no longer ghosting my \u201creal\u201d hand, but seemed to spread out too far, and in the wrong directions.\n\nThey were definitely evolving. I suspect if they evolve too far, I won\u2019t be able to give you accounts like this one, because I\u2019ll have forgotten them.\n\nHopefully by writing how techniques progress, we can get some in-between steps and make the path seem manageable.\n\nI don\u2019t believe we should expect techniques we pick up from Carlos\u2019 books to work exactly the same way as written. There are too many accounts in there of contrary information, such as La Gorda\u2019s take on things.\n\nRather, the technique is a starting point, and then you have to go with what happens. But I truly believe, each and every single technique in Carlos books will work for someone, if we get enough people who realize this is a big job, not a fanciful lifestyle.\n\nWiggling my hands, I started to see the tentacles very clearly. I still couldn\u2019t count them because of non-directionality, but there were at least 2. When they moved around, which they seemed to be doing by themselves, they cast out dark ripples.\n\nI felt a very strange sensation watching them. They seemed to have passed through something sticky. It echoed in me as a feeling coming with a concern. It wasn\u2019t a negative feeling. But the fact that it was pervasive and strong made it seem like a worry.\n\nThe feeling can\u2019t be described, but it was something like, the feeling you get when walking into an underground structure with wind blowing through it. It was the essence of what the right side of your body would feel when first walking in.   I associate it with other such physical feelings, like the feeling you get when walking too close to stucco walls, and subconsciously know to keep your distance, or your skin will scrape off.\n\nI inhaled while sweeping my head to the left, to see if I could recapitulate that sensation. It felt very much like a \u201cbundle\u201d of emanations, although a super small one that only produced one feeling. I could see all kinds of fibers in the air.  The sheer volume of them caused me to believe,  is indeed possible (inevitable)  to learn to *see* the emanations being inhaled and exhaled during recapitulation. After a couple of sweeps, the feeling was gone.\n\nMy conclusion was, discovering recapitulation is automatic, and even if no one told you, you'd discover it on your own.\n\nI firmly believe that every single crazy thing in Carlos\u2019 sorcery follows automatically and inevitably, from learning to get silent. That doesn\u2019t mean anyone who got silent would progress this far. We have the video of Shinzen Young mentioning a little drummer man who materialized on his hand, as solid and real as anything.  But then he dismisses it as an amusing problem for philosophers to figure out. He seems to have no knowledge of the energy body and how to assemble another world.  The *intent* of sorcery isn't there.\n\nMaybe he stopped there, because he didn\u2019t have an \u201cendorsed\u201d path to follow to get further.  But there's a horrible speculation possible from this.  Maybe we no longer have \"endorsed\" paths to follow, to make Carlos techniques work.   There was a visitor who commented all this was delusional. Since that visitor was perusing a Castaneda forum, and didn't recognize Carlos' own techniques and experiences, the implication is that someone out there is unendorsing Carlos' techniques, in order to promote something else.  \n\nA very bad thing.\n\nI kept wiggling my fingers, to see what I could stir up. And then, I stopped and just sat in silence, to see if I could feel my energy body as a whole.\n\nI slumped over on the bed, dangerously close to falling off and onto a low table. I keep my bowl of water there. I slowly let myself back up, blanked out for a bit, and was startled when I slumped again.\n\nThat was dangerous, so I decided I needed to find a position where I couldn\u2019t slump in that direction. After a good half hour, I still hadn\u2019t found one.\n\nI spread my legs outward and leaned in so low that I couldn\u2019t slump left or right. I remembered that when Carlos did the technique, he automatically ended up in that position. Folded up like a switch blade, with the feeling he was laying in a ditch.\n\nI\u2019d been hoping pulling on the colors would produce that result for me, but again, I suspect things go their own way and you have to go with what happens.\n\nSomehow I\u2019d discovered on my own, that many people trying to do that technique would eventually find out the best position is indeed to be folded up like that. It\u2019s just a little hard for most people to attain. I\u2019ve still got some left-over flexibility from martial arts.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get all the way down, but I was so far that I couldn't slump left or right. From that position I saw the mass of colors as a swirling pool of dreaming worlds. I saw my little inorganic first as a head, she morphed into a woman dressed in white medieval clothes standing up, she walked into a doorway, and other beings started to interact with her.\n\nI was looking through a dreaming window of sorts. I suspect its from bringing the energy of the calves closer to the stomach, as Carlos mentioned a few times in his accounts.\n\nAny movement of my hand in that position caused a flood of physical sensations of cobwebs touching everything. And the sensations were more solid then normal. It was unmistakably something coming from my newly (but weakly) formed second attention energy body.\n\nSo far that energy body has become solid enough to touch the wooden floor under my bed, with my right hand. It\u2019s been solid enough to create a foot that reached 2 inches down to the ground. And now feelings everywhere scattered around me, reaching out for things.\n\nBut the key is the floor. I realized, I was folded up in half like Carlos, and my energy body was trying to touch the floor, presumably with a tentacle that appeared when viewed through dreaming images, to be an actual body part.\n\nSo far Zuleica\u2019s technique works exactly as written, but you have to expect some twists and turns along the way.\n\nEdited once", "edited": 1565548124.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ewm76d2", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know how to order these on reddit, but this should be the 4th comment on Zuleica\u2019s technique, which is my second attempt after the start of this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I again got silent in darkness, specifically wanting to see if my progress in forming the energy body was still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing about Zuleica\u2019s technique, as given to Carlos,  is that it\u2019s a progression.

She mutated into a corpse, a person who is crossing their eyes, and someone in the middle of a scream.\n\nI put my arm down. Maybe not today. The allies are perfectly capable of chasing you, and I\u2019m still not sure I\u2019m immune to that.\n\nLooking down at the bed sheets, I could see very strong details. Carlos called that, \u201cthe wall\u201d, and it can appear anywhere. On the floor, on the wall, even on the ceiling. It\u2019s just \u201cin front\u201d of you. Doesn\u2019t matter which way your head is turned.\n\nThe details looked like stone which was previously dirt with worms living in it, which had been washed by water over millions of years, to reveal the tunnels dug by the worms. Very sharp little twists and turns, but not actual grooves, since it had been worn nearly flat.\n\nI picked up the sleeping mask to see if the details would change, but then I realized, I can use my hands instead.\n\nI cupped both hands over my eyes, blocking the view. The room was absolutely pitch black already.  I\u2019ve removed all sources of light leaks. So there\u2019s no reason I should have seen anything at all on those bed sheets.  That meant to me, blocking my eyes should make absolutely no difference.\n\nBut it did. The lines became a little blurrier. I removed my hands to confirm it. Indeed, the details became blurrier. Not by much. About as much as when the eye doctor switches lenses on you, and one is only barely sharper than the other.\n\nI cupped my hands back over my eyes, saw the level of blur relative to not having them there, and then closed my eyelids so that my view was double blocked. Again, with eye lids closed, it was even blurrier. But not enough to be an issue. Each level of blur would be tolerable, if you were playing with colors in the darkness.\n\nI\u2019d been looking at the details on my bed sheets, so I lifted my head up and looked straight ahead. I wanted to see the blur levels on my wall, which by then was covered with hints of other worlds I could assemble, hints looking very much like the painting the blue scout had made.\n\nWith nothing blocking my eyes, details were very sharp. Too sharp for someone who\u2019s as nearsighted as I am.  Clearly all of that was from the second attention.\n\nI cupped my hands over my eyes, and the details were slightly blurrier. But I also noticed, an inorganic being was materializing there in the middle of my sight. It was about the size of a silver dollar, and had very intense dots and squares, loosely connected by filaments. I closed my eye lids, and it got even brighter.\n\nI confirmed it. With eyes not blocked, it was not there. With my hands cupped it was visible. With my eye lids also closed, it was intense.\n\nIn fact, it was burning its way into the room. It started to shrink, I reached out my hand, and it got stuck on the end of my phantom hand.\n\nI\u2019d forgotten about that extra hand. It was stuck there. I could wave my left hand around and see the extra copy of my arm lagging behind, like a trail you might see on a hallucinogen. But the intense burning spot of lights was stuck to the extra hand only. It did not seem to be stuck to the \u201creal\u201d one.\n\nI\u2019d hit the jackpot! I gave a big thumbs up so that I would remember it all, and noticed I could actually see the thumb. It was almost rude, like a big fake plastic thumb stuck on my real thumb. Except that the details were blurry. I couldn\u2019t actually locate any edges. I could only see it, if I relaxed and didn\u2019t stare. When I did that, it was almost dreamlike.\n\nThe thought occurred to me that the second attention\u2019s energy body was sort of like an inorganic being. It didn\u2019t actually look like anything real, but it could reflect your intent and become anything you might find in a dream. Even a copy of yourself.\n\nI couldn\u2019t resist trying out that extra hand. I was sitting on the bed near the bowls. I reached out towards the bowl of water, and it lit up like a swimming pool at night. I could see ripples of water, much smaller than you\u2019d see in a pool with night lighting.  And the ripples were vibrating a little violently.\n\nBut they did indeed look very much like what you see at night, with a beautifully lit swimming pool.\n\nIt was in fact, too much light. Something was wrong. I turned around, and noticed that the sun had come up. It was already 6 AM. Four hours had gone by, and light was leaking from under my bedroom door, traveling all the way from the bathroom.\n\nI\u2019d been wanting to try out la Gorda\u2019s flicking technique with twilight conditions, in case it didn\u2019t work well in the dark. So I dipped my fingers into the bowl, and flicked drops onto my dresser drawers which were only about 5 feet away, in a corner.\n\nThe drips were clearly visible as flickers, and I saw 2 red fibers form. They vibrated violently, but they were only fragments, and faded away in a second.\n\nThen I got the scare of week. Sitting on the floor in the corner was my inorganic being. Except that she was full sized, had long straight blond hair with slight twists in it, and was dressed in a Japanese Sailor Girl Suit.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read much Japanese Anime, you know exactly what they look like. This one was white with black bows and decorations. It\u2019s the very kind many Japanese men go searching for at night, in one of the shops below the subway entrances.\n\nThe fright was nearly electric, but I trust her so it faded. While it was there, she was frightening. Beautiful, but frightening. There was something seriously wrong with how she was crumpled up in the corner, with her knees elevated a bit, and close to her chest. She looked both sad, and happy at the same time.\n\nAnd very real. I looked around the room. There was more light than twilight now. It was only slightly dark. Yet there she was.\n\nShe tilted her head back, and looked like a coyote howling at the moon. The more I tried to figure out what she was doing, the weirder her movements became.\n\nI glanced at the clock. I had to get up in one hour. So I lay on my side, and went to sleep.  She drifted by my closed eyes as a little round fairy head, with a peaceful smile.\n\nI ended up in a vast expanse of rooms, all carpeted and decorated like a Las Vegas endless hotel lobby. A bunch of people flocked up to me, and asked me to show them my extra arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1565546634.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ewfzpyc", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;continuation...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down at my little Fairy, and she made a horrible face.

I wanted to see the blur levels on my wall, which by then was covered with hints of other worlds I could assemble, hints looking very much like the painting the blue scout had made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With nothing blocking my eyes, details were very sharp. Too sharp for someone who\u2019s as nearsighted as I am.  Clearly all of that was from the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cupped my hands over my eyes, and the details were slightly blurrier. But I also noticed, an inorganic being was materializing there in the middle of my sight. It was about the size of a silver dollar, and had very intense dots and squares, loosely connected by filaments. I closed my eye lids, and it got even brighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I confirmed it. With eyes not blocked, it was not there. With my hands cupped it was visible. With my eye lids also closed, it was intense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was burning its way into the room. It started to shrink, I reached out my hand, and it got stuck on the end of my phantom hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d forgotten about that extra hand. It was stuck there. I could wave my left hand around and see the extra copy of my arm lagging behind, like a trail you might see on a hallucinogen. But the intense burning spot of lights was stuck to the extra hand only. It did not seem to be stuck to the \u201creal\u201d one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d hit the jackpot! I gave a big thumbs up so that I would remember it all, and noticed I could actually see the thumb. It was almost rude, like a big fake plastic thumb stuck on my real thumb. Except that the details were blurry. I couldn\u2019t actually locate any edges. I could only see it, if I relaxed and didn\u2019t stare. When I did that, it was almost dreamlike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thought occurred to me that the second attention\u2019s energy body was sort of like an inorganic being. It didn\u2019t actually look like anything real, but it could reflect your intent and become anything you might find in a dream. Even a copy of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t resist trying out that extra hand. I was sitting on the bed near the bowls. I reached out towards the bowl of water, and it lit up like a swimming pool at night. I could see ripples of water, much smaller than you\u2019d see in a pool with night lighting.  And the ripples were vibrating a little violently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they did indeed look very much like what you see at night, with a beautifully lit swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was in fact, too much light. Something was wrong. I turned around, and noticed that the sun had come up. It was already 6 AM. Four hours had gone by, and light was leaking from under my bedroom door, traveling all the way from the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d been wanting to try out la Gorda\u2019s flicking technique with twilight conditions, in case it didn\u2019t work well in the dark. So I dipped my fingers into the bowl, and flicked drops onto my dresser drawers which were only about 5 feet away, in a corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The drips were clearly visible as flickers, and I saw 2 red fibers form. They vibrated violently, but they were only fragments, and faded away in a second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got the scare of week. Sitting on the floor in the corner was my inorganic being. Except that she was full sized, had long straight blond hair with slight twists in it, and was dressed in a Japanese Sailor Girl Suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve read much Japanese Anime, you know exactly what they look like. This one was white with black bows and decorations. It\u2019s the very kind many Japanese men go searching for at night, in one of the shops below the subway entrances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fright was nearly electric, but I trust her so it faded. While it was there, she was frightening. Beautiful, but frightening. There was something seriously wrong with how she was crumpled up in the corner, with her knees elevated a bit, and close to her chest. She looked both sad, and happy at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And very real. I looked around the room. There was more light than twilight now. It was only slightly dark. Yet there she was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tilted her head back, and looked like a coyote howling at the moon. The more I tried to figure out what she was doing, the weirder her movements became.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced at the clock. I had to get up in one hour. So I lay on my side, and went to sleep.  She drifted by my closed eyes as a little round fairy head, with a peaceful smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up in a vast expanse of rooms, all carpeted and decorated like a Las Vegas endless hotel lobby. A bunch of people flocked up to me, and asked me to show them my extra arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/co5cmg/forming_the_energy_body_sort_of/ewfzpyc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1565370741.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_co5cmg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ewg49n0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1565373565.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ewg3xxp", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Wow, I guess I have Pablito's hand now.

Yesterday I had a proper encounter  with a scout during a dream (!).   \nUnderstand that I understood more when I  woke up as compared to when I was dreaming (which is why I probably missed a big chance here ;-(\u00a0 ).\n\nI  call such dreams \"high definition dreams\" as they go beyond LD or AP.  They are VERY realistic, there are also recurring places etc.   \n \n\nAnyways, allow  me to describe what happened.\n\nIt was some kind  of African setting; I was in a bar / shack in a remote place, close to  some forest. I was with  a group of people (some persons I am close to in real life were there  also). Everyone was having drinks and chatting. At first it was a  friendly, relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThen however, this little boy appeared (maybe 11 years old or so) and starts to persistently \"pick on me\". For example, he fools me, laughs about me, tricks me, annoyes me etc. He also  tries to separate me from the group. The whole situation was not very  comfortable because that character would not let go and \"misbehaved\" for his age.\n\nAt some point he  succeeds in stealing some money (bills) I had in my pockets and runs. I am quite annoyed by that \"bullying\" and \"distraction\". I was very annoyed and tried to  follow him.  Then, while I am walking around alone, I suddenly see him. He holds some papers in his  hand and those look like those bills he took from me before. I finally manage to take them back, but then when I look at those, these are some kind of  maps and lists, each headlined with the name of a specific place (I  guess places on the other side?). He was not happy that I read those notes for some seconds.\n\nThen, this character (very  'jester-like vibe' btw) continues harrassing me, being unpolite etc. At some point,  I try to scare him away by looking into his eyes and pretending to say a magical spell (do not ask me why I did that, it was not very conscious,  just as a mean to scare him off and finally put him in his place without using any violence). Suddenly,  the boy's eyes take on a squared shape. He turns into a \"proper\" IOB,  looking very alien (but also kind of \"digital\" for the lack of a better  word).\n\nNow, it gets even crazier. \n\nThe dream ends and I wake  up. However, firstly, I seem to have the option to get back into it  (unfortunately, I felt quite exhausted so I did not use that chance.......grrr),  secondly, on the \"way out\" I suddenly see these super strong visuals,  VERY similiar to the illustrations shown in the wiki here, in particular seeing some \"hands\", as clear as if they would exist in this dimension.\n\nI woke up and quickly took notes to not forget what happened.\n\nOnly  later, I realized that this is the first time I encountered a proper  \"scout\" (= the African jester boy), however, everything felt a little weird, like not very friendly. Because of all the \"trickery\", I was not keen on trusting that character. There was a general vibe of \"danger\" from my perspective. However, now after the fact, it feels a little wimpy of course. I guess I just should have taken a risk and ask the boy how to \"go into a deeper world\".\n\nI have experienced that IOBs are \"mocking\" us before  (i.e. to make us aware of our self-image, ego etc.). However, all this  seems now like a chance I have missed out on.  \n \n\nMy question;\n\n**what should I have done to go deeper?**\n\n**Should I have asked him where to find a 'portal'?**\n\nThe  whole thing felt a bit like a setup but also a shown opportunity to \"go  deeper\".

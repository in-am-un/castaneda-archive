They became \"the fallen angels\".\n\nIt happened because there was turmoil in heaven when everyone was created directly in the first place.  \n\nAll people that would ever live were already alive before Genesis.  As angels.\n\nBut they had no families, no childhood, and most importantly, no empathy.\n\nChildren only learn to be nice through hardship and reprimand by stronger beings.\n\nThe original angels had none of that. So they were like super spoiled children who grew up to be bad people.\n\nAngry politics in heaven lead to endless war.  \n\nI see hints that they were extremely cruel to animals also, possibly even messing with dinosaurs. \n\nThere's a human footprint out there next to dinosaur footprints.  Except that, someone took a sledge hammer to it. \n\nThat\u2019s a recurring theme in the Judeo/Christian world.  Someone finds an artifact that could prove a bible story, and someone else destroys it.\n\nTo solve the endless war in heaven (which was on earth at the time), God flooded the earth (probably with ice this time) and wiped out all they'd done, so they could start over. \n\nEveryone had to take a birth if they wanted to avoid the lake of fire on judgement day.  \n\nYou had to have something to judge!  If you didn\u2019t, you defaulted to be erased from history.\n\nThe worst of the bad angels decided to have sex instead of taking a birth. \n\nUsing space ships (see Ezekiel), they came down and attempted to wipe out the blood line of Messiah, by making sure all humans were part bad angel.\n\nThey also taught the people how to make weapons of war, and the women to gussy themselves up with jewelry and makeup (See second book of Enoch).\n\nThe offspring of those fallen angels were giants.  \n\nI guess the DNA wasn't compatible.\n\nThe oddest thing about that story is, there's evidence for it.  \n\nNot very good evidence. \n\nJust doorways from that period,  that are far too high.\n\nAnd helmets that are far too big.\n\nSomeone even found a giant body, but it disappeared from the place they were studying it.\n\nSome mystical Christians say that Cain, after killing Abel and being \u201cmarked\u201d by God to protect him, formed the cult that eventually led to Rasputin.\n\nThat cult also lives under that mark, so they\u2019re essentially unstoppable.\n\nAnd that cult, or at least people who claim to be of that cult, is out there.\n\nAnd still destroying relics that could convince people the bible stories are true.\n\nThe oldest surviving cult on earth.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fheq9j7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have &amp;quot;Sargon The Magnificent&amp;quot;, but I don&amp;#39;t recall if I have the Book of Giants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos himself told us to study the bible.

If you hear a person arguing about the bible mention that as a problem, they don\u2019t have enough knowledge to even be worth talking to.   They\u2019re just venting their fussiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you retain fussiness about religions, you\u2019ll have a much harder time assembling another world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the giants, in case anyone\u2019s curious about it, legend has it some of the angels refused to be born of woman.  They became &amp;quot;the fallen angels&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It happened because there was turmoil in heaven when everyone was created directly in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All people that would ever live were already alive before Genesis.  As angels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they had no families, no childhood, and most importantly, no empathy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Children only learn to be nice through hardship and reprimand by stronger beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original angels had none of that. So they were like super spoiled children who grew up to be bad people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angry politics in heaven lead to endless war.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see hints that they were extremely cruel to animals also, possibly even messing with dinosaurs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a human footprint out there next to dinosaur footprints.  Except that, someone took a sledge hammer to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s a recurring theme in the Judeo/Christian world.  Someone finds an artifact that could prove a bible story, and someone else destroys it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To solve the endless war in heaven (which was on earth at the time), God flooded the earth (probably with ice this time) and wiped out all they&amp;#39;d done, so they could start over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone had to take a birth if they wanted to avoid the lake of fire on judgement day.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You had to have something to judge!  If you didn\u2019t, you defaulted to be erased from history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst of the bad angels decided to have sex instead of taking a birth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using space ships (see Ezekiel), they came down and attempted to wipe out the blood line of Messiah, by making sure all humans were part bad angel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also taught the people how to make weapons of war, and the women to gussy themselves up with jewelry and makeup (See second book of Enoch).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The offspring of those fallen angels were giants.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the DNA wasn&amp;#39;t compatible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The oddest thing about that story is, there&amp;#39;s evidence for it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not very good evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just doorways from that period,  that are far too high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And helmets that are far too big.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone even found a giant body, but it disappeared from the place they were studying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some mystical Christians say that Cain, after killing Abel and being \u201cmarked\u201d by God to protect him, formed the cult that eventually led to Rasputin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That cult also lives under that mark, so they\u2019re essentially unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that cult, or at least people who claim to be of that cult, is out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And still destroying relics that could convince people the bible stories are true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The oldest surviving cult on earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_f0k1hg", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/f0k1hg/don_juan_asserted_time_and_time_again_that_the/fheq9j7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1581527692.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fhdhzbc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "monkeyguy999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fh8buns", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_14w1ssx0", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Im sure you have the book of giants?

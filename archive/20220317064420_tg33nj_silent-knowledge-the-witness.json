I was thinking in terms of \"spoilers\", where someone tells you \"The butler did it\" before you watch a movie you've been anticipating for days. And it's ruined for you.\n\nLily argued, the dark sea of awareness is so vast that the idea of a spoiler is non-sensical.  We're like a bug on a rock, on a planet, around a sun, in a galaxy, in a universe of galaxies, with an infinite number of alternate and phantom realities for each.\n\nFor the bug to think of anything it could perceive as being a potential \"spoiler\" is obviously delusional.\n\nBesides, she said, everyone loves a scout!\n\nI had lucked out tonight, due to battling a hoard of petty tyrants all in the same day.  It seems to disturb you enough to stir up energy, and that removes blockages. The night before, I'd had a hell of a time reaching the assemblage point position for Silent Knowledge.\n\nBut tonight I just woke up that way.\n\nI suppose it's like when Juan Tuma stuck his scrotum in Carol Tigg's eyes and made her stare, to resolve some \"energy flow issue\".  I really couldn't understand how you could justify that, in all seriousness.\n\nNow, it seems very obvious why that could work.\n\nWe had a new woman interested in this subreddit, from the \"mediums\" subreddit.\n\nBut when she heard Carol's scrotum story, she deleted her entire account.\n\nThe witches have a habit of doing that to people, when they lecture.\n\nThe orderly male point of view dominates, and then when the women completely contradict it during a lecture, everyone panics.  Even the women.\n\nThe Eastern Bloc Castaneda \"expert\" even tried to block Taisha's last book by claiming it was a fraud.  It disturbed him too much perhaps?\n\nBut despite having scared away a potential new witch using a scrotum (I'm not actually sure what body part that is), and having had to battle at least 4 stalkers on the same day, I lucked out big time in my practice.\n\nI \"woke up\" in Silent Knowledge.  And without having to learn what a scrotum is,  up close.\n\nThus the benefit of petty tyrants.  You can observe what a scrotum looks like, at a safe distance.\n\nSo last night when it was time to practice I sat up in bed, opened my eyes, and I was looking at a ticker tape display.\n\nAmong other things.  There was too much floating in the darkness to even describe.\n\nBut I noticed the text, because it was scrolling by.   It was in the air, but I could actually see a strip of paper moving along, as if it were coming from an old fashioned stock ticker machine.\n\nI realized what was going on instantly.\n\nIt was the advice don Juan gave Carlos about how he could choose the method of viewing silent knowledge, and he might want to simply read it as text.  The Olmecs had preferred to watch dreams in the sky or on the walls, but modern man reads. So why not read Silent Knowledge?\n\nAs I watched the text go by, trying to read it, the characters I focused on went from readable pinkish letters, to intense pink, almost burning from the paper.  I suppose that could have been the \"pomegranate dot\" Carlos told us to look for.  The \"ticker tape\" version, anyway.\n\nThis is tied to the \"shine\" of  the gaze, but I don't understand how yet.  Perhaps the \"shine\" is one potential \"selecting mechanism\" for Silent Knowledge?\n\nAt the least, it was re-enforcement that this was in fact Silent Knowledge (\"SK\") and not some other waking dream mode.  I could \"feel\" that.\n\nNow keep in mind, SK is not \"flat\".\n\nI suppose you could say, it's full on \"Heightened Awareness\".  Perhaps that's not completely accurate, but at the least it's one of the nicer \"spots\" within the HA range of assemblage point positions.\n\nLily was soon around, and sort of commenting on stuff.\n\nBut that's what makes this part so hard to explain.\n\nCarlos warned us about this, using the term \"intensity\".  He described HA as having experiences that had a higher intensity than normal perception, and then if you tried to tell them to someone, you had to \"flatten them out\".  From my experience so far,  the result is, 1 minute of HA could flatten out to 1  hour of describable activity.  In very rare circumstances.  Maybe even more.\n\nBut at least, a normal HA experience can cram 4 times as much activity into 1 minute, as ought to be there.  Due to the \"intensity\" of it.\n\nSo when you try to be a good \"scout\", and report exactly what you saw, you end up having to compromise.\n\nI'll give you an example. The night before when I  had so much trouble moving my assemblage point the final few inches to SK, I noticed my hands, resting on the bed, now had \"glass\" hands next to them.  I recognized those, and the way they echoed my real hands, but not exactly, as hands belonging to the double.  The instant I realized that, I remembered that he had just snuck onto the bed, and merged into me, like a ghost who wants to possess someone.  He simply \"drifted into me\".  But his hands and arms were slightly off.\n\nI could see his glass hands moving.  I commented, \"Where have you been?  I could have used some help.\"\n\nBut that memory didn't return to me, until hours after I had stopped practicing.\n\nAnd WORSE, I actually saw my own hands, as if the room lights were on.  I could see everything. My legs sitting on pillows, my arms at my side, my hands resting, and the glass copy of the double's hands.\n\nIn an absolutely pitch black room.  So what took place as an \"additional memory\" I recovered, didn't even make sense.  And yet, I actually had a conversation with my own double.  In response to where he had been all this time, he said, \"you weren't doing anything interesting.\"\n\nHA is weird.  SK even more so.\n\nThere's nothing you can do about it.    And at first when you come up with a \"word compromise\", to figure out how to explain some event, you suddenly realize, just by putting it into words you destroyed even more you could have \"extracted\" instead.\n\nYou \"fixed\" the event in time and space, and ended up limiting it.\n\nIt's still more than you ought to have  experienced in that much time, but far less than it could have become.\n\nLily commented at one point, \"Look over there.  That's the abstract.  Between \"normal\", here on the bed,  and the abstract way over there, it gets harder and harder to describe what went on. Until finally in the abstract you can't even form a sentence about an event.  So just be glad you can extract what you do, from intense heightened awareness.  Sometimes you can't.\"\n\nSo I was happily looking at the text scrolling by in the space in front of my bed, pleased to finally see the \"Readers of Infinity\" thing in a sustained fashion.\n\nI remembered don Juan advising Carlos to write his \"field notes\" with his finger in the air, instead of on paper.\n\nAnd later he could read his notes right in front of him in the air.  No paper wasted.\n\nCarlos balked at the impossibility of doing that. But don Juan told him as far as he knew, it hadn't been done by anyone yet, but the \"principle was sound\".\n\nI felt clever.   It now seemed very possible to do that.  Another mystery solved.\n\nLily commented, \"Not too bright, are you?\"\n\nLily isn't rude at all.   But when you try to translate what she said, it can come off that way.\n\nLike a wife would talk to her husband, after the honeymoon period was over.\n\nI wanted to know what she meant.  What did I miss here?\n\n\"The story teller!\", she replied.  \"Remember the Wuwonians?\"\n\n\"How can I forget?\", I complained.\n\nNo one liked that story, so I got the blame.  Another reason I don't like storytellers.  And then on top of that, the picture for that post enraged some bad players who decided to comment there.  I had to flee that post.\n\n\"So what about that story teller guy?\", I asked.  Remembering that although he didn't look anything like Mr. Rogers, now when I remembered him, that's all I could visualize.  Because I drew that.\n\n\"He's just a ticker tape machine!\", Lily responded.\n\n\"A method of display.  It's odd you saw him so early on, since you hate story tellers.  Or maybe that's why.  So you'd have to realize, the methods of display of Silent Knowledge are infinite and how you feel about each one, is irrelevant.  A barrier even!\"\n\nI saw what she was saying, but I still had questions about whether the story teller exists for real.  She had claimed he did.  But now she was saying he was just an \"optional display method\" for Silent Knowledge. I was afraid of the implications of that.\n\nI'm reminded of my visit to the Luiseno, a few months back, where I was shocked to see that the old reservation was completely gone.  I went into their casino, and asked the bar tender where the reservation had gone.\n\nHe remarked, \"You're standing on it!\"\n\nAn old man at the bar looked at me, realized what was going on, and said, \"Welcome home!\"\n\nI walked into a clear area not to far from them, looking around at all the machines.\n\nBut then something really odd happened.\n\n3 or 4 men riding on horses, dressed as the Luiseno might have dressed 200 years ago, came towards me. They were transparent like ghosts.\n\nI looked in the opposite direction, to see if I could flee, but there were another set of Indians on horses, charging towards them.\n\nThey collided right where I was standing, and I realized it was a game.\n\nAnd they were still playing it, on the \"reservation\".\n\nBut were they actually still alive?\n\nSo instead of asking about the storyteller,  I asked her \"What are other display methods?\"\n\nLily laughed.  \"Another one you'll hate for sure.  Those 'damned lizards'.\"\n\nLily was right.  Over the years a woman would correspond with me by email once in a while, telling me her \"boyfriend\" likes Castaneda, got her interested, so she wants to learn.\n\nMen are in their own little angry world, but if women want to join it with them they aren't shy about researching first, to gain an advantage.\n\nSo in the past when a woman seemed interested, I'd get excited.  There weren't many potential students in the first 2 decades after Carlos died and I feared total loss of the teachings of don Juan.\n\nI'd think, maybe I can teach a witch and get some help.  Sure, there's a tag along \"boyfriend\", but she can figure out that situation.\n\nThen I'd hear how \"advanced\" her boyfriend was.   A sense of dread would come over me, to hear what she believed constituted \"advanced\".\n\nAnd some would say, \"He almost has his lizards.  There's a big rock, and he found out how to grab them with a string loop...\"\n\nAnd I'd realize, no potential witch there.  He was probably just doing rude things with the string loop, showing her how to \"catch lizards\",  while she was sunbathing on a big rock.\n\nBut now Lily was telling me, those lizards were SK?\n\nLily explained, \"Of course not! However,  you've opened another can of worms.  The Allies can be a bridge between a person who isn't advanced enough, and Silent Knowledge.\n\nSo the old \"Men of Knowledge\", who never learned to see and had to use power plants and rituals, especially loved to find ways to get their Ally to bridge the gap.  Between their inability to view SK themselves, and some form of selected display mode.\"\n\nShe added, \"Don't you get it?!  You could have 2 lizards on your shoulders, one \"good\" and one \"evil\" talking to you with silent knowledge.  That's exactly the kind of thing you find so amusing!\"\n\nShe was right.  That did sound really cool.  Maybe the evil lizard could burp little flames, the way Little Smoke liked to make the water cooler burp?  Agreements from the world around you!\n\n\"So, the lizards in the story were not actually silent knowledge?\", I asked her.\n\n\"No more than the moth with the moth dust and the mushroom shapes.  Both were just ritual power plant sorcerers trying to tap into what they could not reach on their own.\"\n\n\"But you must admit, it was really cool!  Especially since you tend to look down on them so much.\", she said.\n\nShe added, \"I kind of liked those Men of Knowledge guys.\"\n\nI got the impression she admired their creativity, in the face of their severe limitations.\n\nBut maybe she simply admired that they were putty in the hands of inorganic beings, who back then \"had all the power in the relationship\".\n\nThen I got a silent knowledge \"presentation\" on how Silent Knowledge is the \"bridge between realities\".\n\nBut it was also the \"phantom reality translator\".\n\nAnd the \"memory gap resolver\".\n\nOr the \"reality splitter\".\n\n\"The means to open doors to other worlds.\"\n\nSilent Knowledge was based on the inner interactions of the emanations in Man's band.  But it came with stable control.\n\nYou could both alter the viewing method, and also summon the specific information you wanted.\n\nAnd information can be a sight, a sound, a smell. Just about anything you can perceive.\n\nThe method of \"viewing\" was a choice, and really ought to be called the \"method of perceiving\".\n\nWhen no choice was sought consciously,  or you no longer had a meaningful form for your body, so no choices made sense, your need became the criteria.\n\nIt's \"automatic\".\n\nSo if you shifted outrageously far horizontally, to experience some very vivid but bizarre view of reality, and then you shifted back, it was hopeless for you to remember it.\n\nPerhaps so hopeless, one could say, you can never remember it.  No one can. We don't live long enough to acquire that kind of control.\n\nSo SK is there to \"interface\" us.\n\nIt sees everything.  Everywhere.  All at once.\n\nThe implications are amazing.  SK can help  you to remember \"seeing\" from any point in your life.  Or it can show you that a lot more goes on in the darkroom, than we actually recall.\n\nThe tricky part for a sorcerer is getting it to repeat information you need, when you need it.\n\nBut you can be sure of one thing. If it happened, even in purely phantom realms, it was witnessed. And recorded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Silent Knowledge: The Witness", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 113, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"8iftg04uyxn81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 87, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8iftg04uyxn81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2250c6d2b6ca85bc300b43ac187eda64fa189c55"}, {"y": 174, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8iftg04uyxn81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0948754ba6b9712c1106196bad18fca9e662e79"}, {"y": 258, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8iftg04uyxn81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc134fa280756d7ed11e51b9b6d9ed933d6edd16"}, {"y": 517, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8iftg04uyxn81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=487779a39add7695708ca9481fd5710742235820"}], "s": {"y": 660, "x": 817, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8iftg04uyxn81.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca6d1d392f5879260d57809116510a0b4d2d9e8"}, "id": "8iftg04uyxn81"}}, "name": "t3_tg33nj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/E6aH7Tt7Ef2_st92FJgM8zVtibr221omd2OUNozKZ20.jpg", "edited": 1647646500.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1647495860.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8iftg04uyxn81.png?width=817&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1ca6d1d392f5879260d57809116510a0b4d2d9e8\"&gt;The Moth dust mushrooms, the lizards, reading text: All Silent Knowledge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was arguing with Lily in the last day or two, about whether reporting things far out on the J curve would harm beginners.

But when you try to translate what she said, it can come off that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a wife would talk to her husband, after the honeymoon period was over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know what she meant.  What did I miss here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The story teller!&amp;quot;, she replied.  &amp;quot;Remember the Wuwonians?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How can I forget?&amp;quot;, I complained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one liked that story, so I got the blame.  Another reason I don&amp;#39;t like storytellers.  And then on top of that, the picture for that post enraged some bad players who decided to comment there.  I had to flee that post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So what about that story teller guy?&amp;quot;, I asked.  Remembering that although he didn&amp;#39;t look anything like Mr. Rogers, now when I remembered him, that&amp;#39;s all I could visualize.  Because I drew that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s just a ticker tape machine!&amp;quot;, Lily responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A method of display.  It&amp;#39;s odd you saw him so early on, since you hate story tellers.  Or maybe that&amp;#39;s why.  So you&amp;#39;d have to realize, the methods of display of Silent Knowledge are infinite and how you feel about each one, is irrelevant.  A barrier even!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw what she was saying, but I still had questions about whether the story teller exists for real.  She had claimed he did.  But now she was saying he was just an &amp;quot;optional display method&amp;quot; for Silent Knowledge. I was afraid of the implications of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reminded of my visit to the Luiseno, a few months back, where I was shocked to see that the old reservation was completely gone.  I went into their casino, and asked the bar tender where the reservation had gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He remarked, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re standing on it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An old man at the bar looked at me, realized what was going on, and said, &amp;quot;Welcome home!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked into a clear area not to far from them, looking around at all the machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then something really odd happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 or 4 men riding on horses, dressed as the Luiseno might have dressed 200 years ago, came towards me. They were transparent like ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked in the opposite direction, to see if I could flee, but there were another set of Indians on horses, charging towards them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They collided right where I was standing, and I realized it was a game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they were still playing it, on the &amp;quot;reservation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But were they actually still alive?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead of asking about the storyteller,  I asked her &amp;quot;What are other display methods?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily laughed.  &amp;quot;Another one you&amp;#39;ll hate for sure.  Those &amp;#39;damned lizards&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily was right.  Over the years a woman would correspond with me by email once in a while, telling me her &amp;quot;boyfriend&amp;quot; likes Castaneda, got her interested, so she wants to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men are in their own little angry world, but if women want to join it with them they aren&amp;#39;t shy about researching first, to gain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the past when a woman seemed interested, I&amp;#39;d get excited.  There weren&amp;#39;t many potential students in the first 2 decades after Carlos died and I feared total loss of the teachings of don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d think, maybe I can teach a witch and get some help.  Sure, there&amp;#39;s a tag along &amp;quot;boyfriend&amp;quot;, but she can figure out that situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;#39;d hear how &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; her boyfriend was.   A sense of dread would come over me, to hear what she believed constituted &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some would say, &amp;quot;He almost has his lizards.  There&amp;#39;s a big rock, and he found out how to grab them with a string loop...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;d realize, no potential witch there.  He was probably just doing rude things with the string loop, showing her how to &amp;quot;catch lizards&amp;quot;,  while she was sunbathing on a big rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now Lily was telling me, those lizards were SK?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily explained, &amp;quot;Of course not! However,  you&amp;#39;ve opened another can of worms.  The Allies can be a bridge between a person who isn&amp;#39;t advanced enough, and Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the old &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot;, who never learned to see and had to use power plants and rituals, especially loved to find ways to get their Ally to bridge the gap.  Between their inability to view SK themselves, and some form of selected display mode.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She added, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you get it?!  You could have 2 lizards on your shoulders, one &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and one &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; talking to you with silent knowledge.  That&amp;#39;s exactly the kind of thing you find so amusing!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was right.  That did sound really cool.  Maybe the evil lizard could burp little flames, the way Little Smoke liked to make the water cooler burp?  Agreements from the world around you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, the lizards in the story were not actually silent knowledge?&amp;quot;, I asked her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No more than the moth with the moth dust and the mushroom shapes.  Both were just ritual power plant sorcerers trying to tap into what they could not reach on their own.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But you must admit, it was really cool!  Especially since you tend to look down on them so much.&amp;quot;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She added, &amp;quot;I kind of liked those Men of Knowledge guys.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the impression she admired their creativity, in the face of their severe limitations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe she simply admired that they were putty in the hands of inorganic beings, who back then &amp;quot;had all the power in the relationship&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got a silent knowledge &amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot; on how Silent Knowledge is the &amp;quot;bridge between realities&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was also the &amp;quot;phantom reality translator&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;memory gap resolver&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the &amp;quot;reality splitter&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The means to open doors to other worlds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge was based on the inner interactions of the emanations in Man&amp;#39;s band.  But it came with stable control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could both alter the viewing method, and also summon the specific information you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And information can be a sight, a sound, a smell. Just about anything you can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The method of &amp;quot;viewing&amp;quot; was a choice, and really ought to be called the &amp;quot;method of perceiving&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When no choice was sought consciously,  or you no longer had a meaningful form for your body, so no choices made sense, your need became the criteria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you shifted outrageously far horizontally, to experience some very vivid but bizarre view of reality, and then you shifted back, it was hopeless for you to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps so hopeless, one could say, you can never remember it.  No one can. We don&amp;#39;t live long enough to acquire that kind of control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So SK is there to &amp;quot;interface&amp;quot; us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sees everything.  Everywhere.  All at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The implications are amazing.  SK can help  you to remember &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; from any point in your life.  Or it can show you that a lot more goes on in the darkroom, than we actually recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tricky part for a sorcerer is getting it to repeat information you need, when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can be sure of one thing. If it happened, even in purely phantom realms, it was witnessed. And recorded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "tg33nj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tg33nj/silent_knowledge_the_witness/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/tg33nj/silent_knowledge_the_witness/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1647495860.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i112igf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1647531125.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i10j6d5", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I was thinking the same.\n\nIt turns out, SK was the goal of the men of knowledge too, but they had to use IOBs and drugs.\n\nI'm not sure why Carlos didn't seem to emphasize it in the books, but maybe you have to do all \"stations\" in the J curve.

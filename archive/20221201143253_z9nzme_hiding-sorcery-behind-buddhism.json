For a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought of a funny story on the way home, after I&amp;#39;d already answered you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it illustrates how wonderful it is to have Cholita around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize at first that Cholita had lost her mind.  I&amp;#39;m not sure how long ago that was, but years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t as bad back then as now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She ended up homeless because her husband tossed her out, and I took her in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And helped her get a job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she got steadily worse, and at one point it was obvious she would lose that job.   She kept accusing her co-workers of leaving secret messages on her desk, threatening her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to pick her up at Fashion Island,  where the Whole Foods is that she worked at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she wasn&amp;#39;t where she told me she&amp;#39;d be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking around, I saw 3 security guards coming towards me, with Cholita pointing her finger and explaining something to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They suddenly pulled out their guns and pointed them at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had convinced them I was a kidnapper, and this was her first chance to escape.  And insisted they needed to call the police, and keep me there until they arrived so they could haul me away to jail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The security guards looked a bit puzzled, but kept their guns pointed at me. One radioed for the police.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was walking around in circles saying now I was finally going to get what I had coming to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the security guards, if I kindnapped Cholita and was holding her prisoner in my basement, how come she was wearing $1000 worth of new clothes?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita denied it, but then I started at her shoes and named the prices going all the way up to her coat.  It was obvious I&amp;#39;d even gone shopping with her, and paid attention to what she liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I named the price of her coat she said, &amp;quot;Ah ha!!!  That&amp;#39;s only $600.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I pointed out, we hadn&amp;#39;t gotten to the jewelry yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She admitted, &amp;quot;Ok, maybe that&amp;#39;s right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She seemed proud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The security guards put down their guns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_z9nzme", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/z9nzme/hiding_sorcery_behind_buddhism/iyk9ye8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1669941741.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1669941741.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_izebbl9", "depth": 10, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "izebbl9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "infinite_unity01", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1670508624.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_izai3ps", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_43255b4s", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;Last night I tried to find out if she remembers levitating objects,  visiting in her double and running around the world playing hide and seek, materializing zombies, or even bringing Minx to meet me the first time.\n\nWhy are you fixated on her remembering things exactly the way that you do?

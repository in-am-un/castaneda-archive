To make him into a godlike figure to sell to people elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Chat will even imply how this teachings were altered to be a better con game in China,  merging it with their own 3 basic religions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it originally wasn&amp;#39;t like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then translating and sanitizing it to appeal to the western mind.  Done by bad players in the 1800s of the western countries, trying to make themselves a magical franchise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 1800s saw an explosion of woo-woo books in Europe.  There&amp;#39;s entire encyclopedia sets listing all the fake magic publications from that period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to collect the more notorious of those.  But never found any real magic in any besides Abramelin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who was very confused and lied a bit in what he wrote.  He even tried to warn readers in his introduction.

But if you are grounded and have a lot of energy, it\u2019s amazing what you can do when you are firing on all cylinders in your life. I\u2019ve tasted it for sure. Feels like you can do a lot and it\u2019s all so easy and rewarding! So I\u2019m getting optimistic over here. If you are interested in a book recommendation for shamanic journeys pm me.

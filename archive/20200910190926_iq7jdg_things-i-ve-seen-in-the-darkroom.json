To teach him to switch from his physical body, to his double.\n\nCarlos didn't know that, but he'd been pushed into DEEP heightened awareness by the Nagual's blow, so he was infinitely patient, and never got bored.\n\nHe was instructed one way at first by Zuleica, but then he FELT his energy body.\n\nIt's around 24 inches away from your torso, All around you.\n\nBut only AFTER you scoop some puffs onto your energy pouches.\n\nRemember, we DO NOT HAVE the benefit of \"the nagual's blow\".\n\nSo when you read techniques from the books, you have to find out if they had received the Nagual's blow.\n\nIf they had, you probably can't copy that technique.\n\nBUT, Carlos gave us the gift of darkroom, so we could simulate the nagual's blow ourselves.\n\nCarlos was listening to Zuleica's voice telling him what to do, when he \"felt\" his energy body, and became embarrassed.\n\nAs if he were masturbating in front of Zuleica.\n\nWho by the way, was as crazy as my witch friend Cholita, and had insisted she spread her vagina open on their first meeting, so Carlos could take a good look.\n\nCholita promises, but never delivers...\n\nAnyway, Carlos actually \"felt\" his energy body.\n\nS\n\no Zuleica had him wiggle his fingers on a spot 24 inches out from his belly button, 4 inches to the right, and maybe down an inch or two.\n\nHe wiggled for 200-800 hours!\n\nAnd I'm afraid, we will have to do that much too.\n\nBut eventually, you can feel the whole thing.  The \"blue ball of energy\" your second half of awareness (the Nagual) can form when it sticks to the Tonal body (your organic body).\n\nYou WILL feel that if you keep working.\n\nBut oddly, we get to SEE it also!\n\nWe kind of kick butt...    We have to do it all ourselves, but in the end we surpass the accounts of what Carlos did.\n\nSometimes...\n\nBy feeling that point, you create a dent.\n\nImagine a blue bubble around 5 feet in diameter, centered around your stomach.\n\nIt can project a PERFECT copy of yourself.\n\nThe \"Affection for the Energy body\" tensegrity pass does that.\n\nAnd it works!!!\n\nBut the double is a bit daffy. It has no organic body concerns, like earning money, eating, illness, or even \"friends\".\n\nHasn't got much, except it is infinitely magical and explores all of reality.\n\nNever gets to eat a donut...\n\nSo it's a toss up on what's better to be. Us or him.\n\nWhen you create a \"dent\", it moves his concentration of energy closer to that of your physical body, stored in the liver area, and the double gets \"infected\" with our rationality.\n\nMaking it a better helper to us.\n\nI suppose it's good you look at old stuff, because my knowledge 2 years after this post, is far greater.\n\nThe books repeat themselves...", "edited": 1653064138.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i9chgi7", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;quot;Zuleica&amp;quot; in the all in one pdf, and start reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point Carlos is sitting in the dark with just a voice (Zuleica liked to remain in her energy body most of the time), giving Carlos instructions designed to bring out his double. To teach him to switch from his physical body, to his double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos didn&amp;#39;t know that, but he&amp;#39;d been pushed into DEEP heightened awareness by the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow, so he was infinitely patient, and never got bored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was instructed one way at first by Zuleica, but then he FELT his energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s around 24 inches away from your torso, All around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only AFTER you scoop some puffs onto your energy pouches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, we DO NOT HAVE the benefit of &amp;quot;the nagual&amp;#39;s blow&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you read techniques from the books, you have to find out if they had received the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they had, you probably can&amp;#39;t copy that technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, Carlos gave us the gift of darkroom, so we could simulate the nagual&amp;#39;s blow ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was listening to Zuleica&amp;#39;s voice telling him what to do, when he &amp;quot;felt&amp;quot; his energy body, and became embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if he were masturbating in front of Zuleica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who by the way, was as crazy as my witch friend Cholita, and had insisted she spread her vagina open on their first meeting, so Carlos could take a good look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita promises, but never delivers...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Carlos actually &amp;quot;felt&amp;quot; his energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;S&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;o Zuleica had him wiggle his fingers on a spot 24 inches out from his belly button, 4 inches to the right, and maybe down an inch or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wiggled for 200-800 hours!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m afraid, we will have to do that much too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But eventually, you can feel the whole thing.  The &amp;quot;blue ball of energy&amp;quot; your second half of awareness (the Nagual) can form when it sticks to the Tonal body (your organic body).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You WILL feel that if you keep working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But oddly, we get to SEE it also!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kind of kick butt...    We have to do it all ourselves, but in the end we surpass the accounts of what Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By feeling that point, you create a dent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a blue bubble around 5 feet in diameter, centered around your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can project a PERFECT copy of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Affection for the Energy body&amp;quot; tensegrity pass does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it works!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the double is a bit daffy.

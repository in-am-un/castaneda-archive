But I've seen that change over time.\n\nSeems more like a talking point to me.\n\nSo if you can let go of the pretend stuff (which is NEVER pretend for witches), you might try plunging off the side of your bed, over a cliff, to fall deep into the cold ocean.\n\nNot hard to do.  Just takes practice at moving the assemblage point to Silent Knowledge.\n\nFortunately, you get \"previews\" of silent knowledge, even up at the green line on the J curve.\n\nI posted this pic more than a year ago, not understanding why I had fallen off the edge of my bed into the ocean, and had to climb my way back up onto the bed, along a sandy cliff.\n\nI didn't mind though. I landed next to a sunken ship.  I fancied it to be a pirate ship, but  there's no way to know that for sure.  It could easily have mutated into whatever I expected.\n\nSo let's review this, for the sake of new people.\n\nYou've been watching \"holy men\" all your life.  And you've been nagged by your crazy aunt, on how you ought to be more \"spiritual\".\n\nOr even by the Jesus freak lady next door.\n\nThose are all part of the Island of the Tonal.\n\nWe're trying to escape that island.  At least an hour or two a day.\n\nThere's no \"saints\" out there, off the island.\n\nAnd it's too cold and lonely for spiritual people.  They need to cling to others.\n\nBut it is exciting and if you really do get lonely, you can bring a sorcerer or sorceress with you.\n\nAnd if you have none, you can bring a spirit.\n\nBut first, to do this technique, you have to rise that energy that's down at our toes, up as high as your knees.  If you are self-conscious about your need to be more \"saintly\", it won't rise.  You have to seek silence and dedication to the purpose of learning to move the assemblage point.  Tensegrity is one option.\n\nThen you can play with your energy of awareness, noticing at that point in your knowledge level humans have 3 kinds of energy inside them.\n\nThere's the yellowish energy of the Tonal.  The part of your awareness that got trapped in your organic body.  In the \"energy pouches\".\n\nIt's very purposeful and rational! It's spent its entire life figuring out how to get the biggest share of cookies it can.\n\nAnother part did not get trapped in that organic body, and can eat a cookie anytime it likes.  It can just reach into the pocket it doesn't really have, and pull one out.\n\nIt's carefree, and irrational.\n\nBut it's also ALL POWERFUL.\n\nWhat we really need, is to merge the two. So that the all powerful dreaming awareness gains some sobriety and purpose.  Lucidity if you like.\n\nThen, is that enough to let you do what's in the picture here?\n\nTo just reach up and tap on the inside of your luminous egg, to create ripples in the shiny outer coating the fliers like to lick up, and thereby get the energy body's awareness to notice it.\n\nLike tapping on the side of a fish bowl, to get the fish to swim over and see what's up.\n\nIf you can ***see***, you can make that happen.  The blue energy of the energy body (one optional look the sorcerers of don Juan's party preferred) will break off a few purple puffs, and send them over to see why you are tapping on the egg there.\n\nThe tapping will produce a ripple in the whitish light and it will begin to form vague dreaming scenes.  We call that \"translocation\" on occasion.\n\nThe purple swarm of dreaming energy will pick up the intent of those ripples, and make them 3 dimensional.\n\nUsually, just a crummy flurry of strange objects vaguely floating above you.\n\nBUT, with a little dark energy from the inorganic beings you can \"travel\" much further.\n\nJust tap on the fish bowl to attract the purple puffs there, and combined with a little dark energy from inorganic beings or witches you can end up plunging off the side of your bed, falling 100 feet directly into the cold ocean.\n\nYou might find that unpleasant, until you realize you can breathe underwater and you got lucky and landed next to an interesting shipwreck.\n\nLikely it'll be so fun, you'll want to \"do that again!\"\n\nSo you crawl up the cliff, pulling yourself back onto the bed, and tap again.\n\nOff you fall on the other side, into a fishing village in France.\n\nHow do I know it was France?\n\nThey looked French to me...  But it could have been one of the countries France took over, perhaps one with a lot of African blood.\n\nOne fisherman was nice enough to toss a big fish up onto my bed, so it would be waiting there when I slithered up the sand bank leading down to the village.\n\nOr I suppose, if this sounds too scary,  you could skip the whole thing and go work on your \"sainthood\".\n\nThat will get you more approval from humans.\n\nBut I doubt any African French men will toss you a huge fish for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Instant Dreaming", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"n9242jsz0ay81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n9242jsz0ay81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142e70429d2861968e62b00b78ae3da237a3d81f"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n9242jsz0ay81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fbce5c5a6d8bc56cd7e8b99de74a39536d58113"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n9242jsz0ay81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=939c51774643a06e210f5b6905756b8be567aa98"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n9242jsz0ay81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b545d2e6dff29ceabf7605212011e057aa325932"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n9242jsz0ay81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b23ac8177d881f549c2e0ccabacab6bb88f50a3"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n9242jsz0ay81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3915486b873b4a0179e78ed30d80d72d6e8e295"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n9242jsz0ay81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2c1e89532e6daa18599e74932dfe6506810ffaa"}, "id": "n9242jsz0ay81"}}, "name": "t3_ul5d47", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WuGfN9gU0PMhhq4qDOdjxBi7fLrtRh9HBfePh6reV6Y.jpg", "edited": 1652027702.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1652027203.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n9242jsz0ay81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e2c1e89532e6daa18599e74932dfe6506810ffaa\"&gt;Just one \\&amp;quot;practical magic\\&amp;quot; result of silent knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if we can all get over our fierce desire to be &amp;quot;saints&amp;quot;, and to have no psychological or spiritual &amp;quot;issues&amp;quot; left to resolve, we might actually try some magic for a change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s nice to be spiritually &amp;quot;hip&amp;quot;.

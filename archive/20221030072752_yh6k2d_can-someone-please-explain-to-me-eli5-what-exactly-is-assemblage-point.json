That's what Monroe advocated.  \n\nI tried to alert his followers that they could could literally see anywhere in the universe, continuously, with their eyes open.  Awake.  \n\nSo no need to be pretending.\n\nThe mods in that sub accused me of smoking Salvia, and banned me so I couldn't explain further.\n\nActual remote viewing wasn't something they could even believe. Despite running the \"Remote-viewing\" sub.\n\nThey're just bad men trying to steal money using Monroe's lies.\n\nThey provide easy attention and endorsement to lazy men, instead of magic that takes actual hard work.\n\nMonroe's scheme paid off for him too! \n\nThere's an angry hoard of fake sorcerers out there, pretending magic using Monroe substitutes. They periodically find this sub, their head eventually explodes, and none ever resolve to change their ways.\n\nAs far as I know.\n\nMonroe's fake magic is the same thing as usual. Turn semi-lucid ordinary dreams into whatever you want to pretend them to be.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure he's the source of that particular binaural beat topic.\n\nI just know, no one doing that ever does anything interesting.  They're just \"hopeful\" as far as I can tell. \n\nAnd lazy.\n\nAnd in fact, shamanic drumming can move the assemblage point to the green line on the J curve.\n\nAs perhaps, can those beat sounds.\n\nIt's not much. \n\nYou could press the snooze button on your alarm in the morning and not move at all, and experience that pathetic level of \"higher states of consciousness\".\n\nIt's the green line on that diagram. Look at the pictures, you'll see everything you'll experience up there.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3](https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3)\n\nBut the green line, even though it's \"Buddhist Enlightenment\" is nothing.\n\nSeems like a big deal to a beginner, just as the cool stuff you saw is a big deal to you right now.\n\nBut later on you \"blow through that boring town\" for the red zone, and literally shapeshift into bizarre alien worlds. Surrounded by visible, semi-solid spirits.\n\nOne touched me last night.  I couldn't believe how real it felt.  It was my entity \"Mystery\".  I suppose he can push on solid objects too.\n\nEither that or a huge insect got into my room, because Cholita likes to leave windows and doors open with no screens, and the insect decided, in the middle of it being absolutely dark, to wake up and fly blindly in my direction.\n\nBumping by accident.\n\nI don't know. It was so real, I couldn't explain it.\n\nSo if those beats help go ahead, but they're like training wheels on a kid's first bike.\n\nIf you let the kids keep those on, they turn into \"training wheel terrorists\" in the neighborhood.\n\nBest to ditch them as soon as you can.\n\nMan, when I was a child there was a neighbor girl I had a big crush on, 8 years old I believe,  but she was \"forbidden\" because I was 12.\n\nIn fact, all the boys in the neighborhood had a crush on her. I only found out about that many decades later.\n\nAt the time, 4 years seemed like an immoral age difference.  \n\nShe was still speeding around with training wheels at 8 years old.\n\nShe could bank a turn like you couldn't imagine!\n\nBut I'm afraid the fake Monroe magic men can't even manage that.  They just lie a lot to get attention.  And can barely get their bikes going at all before they fall over into the dirt.\n\n\\&gt; have been working the ways of the Shaman for a little while \n\n\"Shamanism\" was coined by Russian Explorers who encountered Siberian magic some time earlier in the last century.\n\nI'm not clear on the dates, but then later some anthropologists \"incorrectly\" applied it native american magical systems.\n\nSome \"purists\" complained.\n\nBut then it turned out, they were right!\n\nProto-siberian shamanism traveled across the frozen Bering Straits, down through alaska and the USA main part, and into Mexico.  Around 13,000 years ago, completely arriving and establishing small villages, at 10,000  years ago.\n\nLuiseno artifacts verify that date.\n\nHalf went where I live, the Luiseno, but half went to the east coast of Mexico, where Siberian Shamanism became Olmec Shamanism.\n\nBUT, those Shaman, who relied on drugs and rituals and spirits to do anything cool, evolved to create \"seers\".\n\nPeople who no longer needed any of those.  Not the rituals, the drugs, or even the spirits.\n\nThat's \"sorcery\".\n\nWhat we're practicing.\n\nA big exponent of the drum beat was Michael Harner, perhaps 20 years senior to Carlos.  Carlos tried to interest him in a visit to don Juan, but before his books were best sellers.\n\nMichael didn't go see, which is too bad for us.  He said he always regretted it.\n\nBut he became a defender of Carlos, saying in response to accusations of native american cultural appropriation, that what Carlos had was NOT shamanism.\n\nIt was sorcery.\n\nVery insightful on the part of Michael, who took his shamanic drums on tour as a result of the popularity of Castaneda, and gave thousands a taste of the green line.\n\nShamanism is a dead end, especially these days.\n\nThey lost the rituals, lost the Allies, and only have the drugs left.\n\nNothing they do is particularly cool if you ask me.\n\nThey copy the rituals, but have no understanding at all.\n\nIn fact, they're greedy and angry.\n\nNot the real shamans. The tribal ones who haven't been corrupted by younger people trying to claim they have what was in the books of Carlos.\n\nBut their \"true tribal shamanism\" looks nothing at all like Castaneda's \"Men of Knowledge\".

That&amp;#39;s what Monroe advocated.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to alert his followers that they could could literally see anywhere in the universe, continuously, with their eyes open.  Awake.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no need to be pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mods in that sub accused me of smoking Salvia, and banned me so I couldn&amp;#39;t explain further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actual remote viewing wasn&amp;#39;t something they could even believe. Despite running the &amp;quot;Remote-viewing&amp;quot; sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re just bad men trying to steal money using Monroe&amp;#39;s lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They provide easy attention and endorsement to lazy men, instead of magic that takes actual hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monroe&amp;#39;s scheme paid off for him too! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an angry hoard of fake sorcerers out there, pretending magic using Monroe substitutes. They periodically find this sub, their head eventually explodes, and none ever resolve to change their ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monroe&amp;#39;s fake magic is the same thing as usual. Turn semi-lucid ordinary dreams into whatever you want to pretend them to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;m not sure he&amp;#39;s the source of that particular binaural beat topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just know, no one doing that ever does anything interesting.  They&amp;#39;re just &amp;quot;hopeful&amp;quot; as far as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, shamanic drumming can move the assemblage point to the green line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As perhaps, can those beat sounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could press the snooze button on your alarm in the morning and not move at all, and experience that pathetic level of &amp;quot;higher states of consciousness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the green line on that diagram. Look at the pictures, you&amp;#39;ll see everything you&amp;#39;ll experience up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the green line, even though it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Buddhist Enlightenment&amp;quot; is nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems like a big deal to a beginner, just as the cool stuff you saw is a big deal to you right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But later on you &amp;quot;blow through that boring town&amp;quot; for the red zone, and literally shapeshift into bizarre alien worlds. Surrounded by visible, semi-solid spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One touched me last night.  I couldn&amp;#39;t believe how real it felt.  It was my entity &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot;.  I suppose he can push on solid objects too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either that or a huge insect got into my room, because Cholita likes to leave windows and doors open with no screens, and the insect decided, in the middle of it being absolutely dark, to wake up and fly blindly in my direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bumping by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know. It was so real, I couldn&amp;#39;t explain it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if those beats help go ahead, but they&amp;#39;re like training wheels on a kid&amp;#39;s first bike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you let the kids keep those on, they turn into &amp;quot;training wheel terrorists&amp;quot; in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best to ditch them as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man, when I was a child there was a neighbor girl I had a big crush on, 8 years old I believe,  but she was &amp;quot;forbidden&amp;quot; because I was 12.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, all the boys in the neighborhood had a crush on her. I only found out about that many decades later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time, 4 years seemed like an immoral age difference.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was still speeding around with training wheels at 8 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She could bank a turn like you couldn&amp;#39;t imagine!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m afraid the fake Monroe magic men can&amp;#39;t even manage that.  They just lie a lot to get attention.  And can barely get their bikes going at all before they fall over into the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; have been working the ways of the Shaman for a little while &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shamanism&amp;quot; was coined by Russian Explorers who encountered Siberian magic some time earlier in the last century.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not clear on the dates, but then later some anthropologists &amp;quot;incorrectly&amp;quot; applied it native american magical systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some &amp;quot;purists&amp;quot; complained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then it turned out, they were right!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proto-siberian shamanism traveled across the frozen Bering Straits, down through alaska and the USA main part, and into Mexico.  Around 13,000 years ago, completely arriving and establishing small villages, at 10,000  years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luiseno artifacts verify that date.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half went where I live, the Luiseno, but half went to the east coast of Mexico, where Siberian Shamanism became Olmec Shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, those Shaman, who relied on drugs and rituals and spirits to do anything cool, evolved to create &amp;quot;seers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who no longer needed any of those.  Not the rituals, the drugs, or even the spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;sorcery&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;#39;re practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big exponent of the drum beat was Michael Harner, perhaps 20 years senior to Carlos.  Carlos tried to interest him in a visit to don Juan, but before his books were best sellers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Michael didn&amp;#39;t go see, which is too bad for us.  He said he always regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he became a defender of Carlos, saying in response to accusations of native american cultural appropriation, that what Carlos had was NOT shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very insightful on the part of Michael, who took his shamanic drums on tour as a result of the popularity of Castaneda, and gave thousands a taste of the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shamanism is a dead end, especially these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They lost the rituals, lost the Allies, and only have the drugs left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing they do is particularly cool if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They copy the rituals, but have no understanding at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, they&amp;#39;re greedy and angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the real shamans. The tribal ones who haven&amp;#39;t been corrupted by younger people trying to claim they have what was in the books of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But their &amp;quot;true tribal shamanism&amp;quot; looks nothing at all like Castaneda&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot;.

Delusional con artists.\n\nAsian systems?  Huge liars who want your money and give virtually nothing in return. Certainly none have any magic worth mentioning.\n\nIn fact, they're all \"snooze alarm\" levels of magic.\n\nThat's where you keep one of those modern tiny plastic alarm clocks by your pillow ($10 at Walmart), and when it goes off in the morning you hit the snooze alarm, not moving your body at all.\n\nYou'll be as enlightened\" as the Buddha himself!\n\nThat's all he ever got.  But he had 4 very good disciples who multi-level marketed him, and now we're stuck with a Temple system plague on Asia.  Which controls prostitution, corrupts governments with massive land deals, and generally steals as much money as they can, while providing a very small benefit of a place for marriages, funerals, and for unhappy or unwanted children to flee to, to put themselves in the hands of monks.\n\nNot a pretty sight.\n\nThat's the point  of view of most asians outside Thailand.  But we never hear about that over here, because Buddhism was \"remarketed\" to the west by a bunch of angry, delusional white guys, looking for their own con artist franchise. They \"sanitised\" buddhism, just as the Buddha himself \"sanitised\" Hinduism.\n\nFor profit.\n\nBut the same applies to the magic of the Jewish Prophets.  And thus enochian magic, and thus \"Magick\" in general.\n\nThe Prophets were slightly more advanced than the Buddha perhaps, but not enough to understand what they were seeing.\n\nThey saw something cool like Demons, one or two times, and then make up nonsense stories about it so they could get attention from their tribesmen. Oral stories at first, like \"Book of Job\".\n\nThey turned ordinary meditation effects into an entire delusional religion!\n\nMagic is NOT a religion, unless you have the pretend kind.\n\nWhat all of them were missing, perhaps because that knowledge was lost over time, was the ability to \"see energy\", and notice that our reality is created by a glow which moves down our back, and can actually go under, and up to the front.\n\nThat's the beam of our awareness.  The assemblage point.\n\nWe exist in a sea of dark superstrings.\n\nWhen awareness shines into them, it spreads out.  The harmonics of the glow of the \"emanations\" in use, creates our reality.\n\nEach sends back a tiny \"feeling\", and the zillions used to create a reality give the impression of \"causality\". Of a physical reality that can't be altered.\n\nBut in fact it's just feelings vibrating in an eternal sea which can never be changed.\n\nYou can learn to manipulate that with your own fingers!\n\nOnly the energy flowing into those superstrings can change. The dark sea of all of the superstrings, is perhaps the only \"real\" reality.  And infinitely beyond our comprehension.\n\nSorcerers know about the point at which reality is \"assembled\" (something you get to see with your own eyes if you work reasonably hard) because their ancestors could visibly see that glow, studied it,  and learned to move the center of it around the outside of the shell in which our awareness is encased.\n\nA very difficult thing to do, but it's the main focus of this subreddit.\n\nWhen the glow moves to the middle of the back you get \"Buddhist Enlightenment\".\n\nA beginner's state.  But it's so unusual, and comes with \"Bliss\" and closed eye visions, so that on arriving there (very easy to do) men on ego trips declare themselves a \"master\", sit on a little throne, then try to cash in on something anyone with a snooze button on their alarm clock can experience.\n\nThe Hindus do slightly better, I suppose. They can manage to move their assemblage point all the way down the back.  Not often though.  Maybe a few times in their crummy yogi-con artist career.\n\nWe do that daily for HOURS.\n\nAll kinds of intense magic happens down there.  Visible spirits begin to teach you, you can shapeshift (for real), leap to the other side of the universe and land on a real planet you can then explore,  and you can even manufacture your own realities.  \n\nBreak the laws of physics from time to time.\n\nBut none of that is what we're after in the long run.\n\nWe want to move that assemblage point under the bottom and up to the front.  To align it with the second copy of ourselves, which all humans have.\n\nA visible, potentially \"solid\", duplicate of yourself.  Something you absolutely will get to see, even daily, if you learn to move the assemblage point.\n\nNothing we do in here is a \"sacred scroll only the Masters can achieve\".\n\nEven beginners get to see the most extreme forms of magic in \"previews\", randomly,  once in a while.\n\nAnd attaining all of it is just a matter of how much time you can find to practice, each day.\n\nNo one wants your money to help you achieve that.

Delusional con artists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asian systems?  Huge liars who want your money and give virtually nothing in return. Certainly none have any magic worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, they&amp;#39;re all &amp;quot;snooze alarm&amp;quot; levels of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where you keep one of those modern tiny plastic alarm clocks by your pillow ($10 at Walmart), and when it goes off in the morning you hit the snooze alarm, not moving your body at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be as enlightened&amp;quot; as the Buddha himself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all he ever got.  But he had 4 very good disciples who multi-level marketed him, and now we&amp;#39;re stuck with a Temple system plague on Asia.  Which controls prostitution, corrupts governments with massive land deals, and generally steals as much money as they can, while providing a very small benefit of a place for marriages, funerals, and for unhappy or unwanted children to flee to, to put themselves in the hands of monks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a pretty sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the point  of view of most asians outside Thailand.  But we never hear about that over here, because Buddhism was &amp;quot;remarketed&amp;quot; to the west by a bunch of angry, delusional white guys, looking for their own con artist franchise. They &amp;quot;sanitised&amp;quot; buddhism, just as the Buddha himself &amp;quot;sanitised&amp;quot; Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the same applies to the magic of the Jewish Prophets.  And thus enochian magic, and thus &amp;quot;Magick&amp;quot; in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Prophets were slightly more advanced than the Buddha perhaps, but not enough to understand what they were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They saw something cool like Demons, one or two times, and then make up nonsense stories about it so they could get attention from their tribesmen. Oral stories at first, like &amp;quot;Book of Job&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They turned ordinary meditation effects into an entire delusional religion!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic is NOT a religion, unless you have the pretend kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What all of them were missing, perhaps because that knowledge was lost over time, was the ability to &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot;, and notice that our reality is created by a glow which moves down our back, and can actually go under, and up to the front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the beam of our awareness.  The assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We exist in a sea of dark superstrings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When awareness shines into them, it spreads out.  The harmonics of the glow of the &amp;quot;emanations&amp;quot; in use, creates our reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each sends back a tiny &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;, and the zillions used to create a reality give the impression of &amp;quot;causality&amp;quot;. Of a physical reality that can&amp;#39;t be altered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact it&amp;#39;s just feelings vibrating in an eternal sea which can never be changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can learn to manipulate that with your own fingers!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only the energy flowing into those superstrings can change. The dark sea of all of the superstrings, is perhaps the only &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; reality.  And infinitely beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers know about the point at which reality is &amp;quot;assembled&amp;quot; (something you get to see with your own eyes if you work reasonably hard) because their ancestors could visibly see that glow, studied it,  and learned to move the center of it around the outside of the shell in which our awareness is encased.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very difficult thing to do, but it&amp;#39;s the main focus of this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the glow moves to the middle of the back you get &amp;quot;Buddhist Enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A beginner&amp;#39;s state.  But it&amp;#39;s so unusual, and comes with &amp;quot;Bliss&amp;quot; and closed eye visions, so that on arriving there (very easy to do) men on ego trips declare themselves a &amp;quot;master&amp;quot;, sit on a little throne, then try to cash in on something anyone with a snooze button on their alarm clock can experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hindus do slightly better, I suppose. They can manage to move their assemblage point all the way down the back.  Not often though.  Maybe a few times in their crummy yogi-con artist career.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do that daily for HOURS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All kinds of intense magic happens down there.  Visible spirits begin to teach you, you can shapeshift (for real), leap to the other side of the universe and land on a real planet you can then explore,  and you can even manufacture your own realities.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Break the laws of physics from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But none of that is what we&amp;#39;re after in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to move that assemblage point under the bottom and up to the front.  To align it with the second copy of ourselves, which all humans have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A visible, potentially &amp;quot;solid&amp;quot;, duplicate of yourself.  Something you absolutely will get to see, even daily, if you learn to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing we do in here is a &amp;quot;sacred scroll only the Masters can achieve&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even beginners get to see the most extreme forms of magic in &amp;quot;previews&amp;quot;, randomly,  once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And attaining all of it is just a matter of how much time you can find to practice, each day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one wants your money to help you achieve that.  That&amp;#39;s also unique to sorcerers.

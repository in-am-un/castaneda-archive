I&amp;#39;ve surmised, the lineage of don Juan was VERY wealthy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little shack in Arizona was just a stalking exercise, to keep Carlos happy since he needed a &amp;quot;genuine Native American Informant&amp;quot; for his PhD thesis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the answer is, why do you think this is possible?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might even be connected to why don Juan said the people who had the best chance to learn sorcery, were the orphan kids licking the plates at the outdoor restaurant in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;inside the lineage, La Gorda is a good example.  She was a washer woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan saw moths flying around her head in a circle, and took that as an omen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she went to live in their compound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the apprentices of don Juan did, except for Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who earned a living from the lineage anyway, by documenting their activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s a way to do what you suggest, it&amp;#39;s up to us to find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had &amp;quot;high hopes&amp;quot; the Tensegrity would build energetic mass, making it a lot easier to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we fussed that chance away.

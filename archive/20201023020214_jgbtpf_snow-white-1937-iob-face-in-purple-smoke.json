Organised by a mason. Attended by crowley people. It was really dull. It was extremely elaborate. We had to do an enochian call before gazing into the mirror then we had to gaze into the obsidian mirror for an extended period. Then stop and write down what we saw. We then compared notes and compared it then again with the manuscript notes about the aethyr in which we called thru the enochian invocation. This was done after a complicated banishing and finished by a complicated banishing then a planetary evocation. Do you see the problem there? For the one part in that whole evening where we might have been open to see something really interesting; before during and after that, it\u2019s already being squashed by your internal dialogue and previous expectations around the whole elaborate scenario that your walking in with. \n\nI found it underwhelming and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the way it\u2019s performed in these circles is just as underwhelming to everyone involved all around the world. Like you say maybe an old remnant from someone who swam ashore from the river of shit years ago but the practice seemed to be very river of shitty in itself. I certainly went home that evening feeling like I\u2019d just been swimming in some shit. \n\nThe people in these circles who show off about scrying are the ones who know the most enochian calls off by heart or have the most expensive recreation of the John Dee holy table, or the ones who\u2019ve read the books about what\u2019s supposed to happen the most. You never hear about actual results \n\nThere\u2019s also no practical application to the scrying used in that way that was mentioned by even the organiser. It was just a way for him to experience a glimpse of something that was written described in this book. As in there is a book that says something like \u201caethyr 7 has a triceratops with big tits,\u201d and this whole elaborate ceremony is performed just so he can try and strain really hard into a mirror to try and see a triceratops with big tits. \n\nHe did want us to just write down what we saw, us who weren\u2019t familiar with the aethyr literature, funnily enough I did see energy spirals like I\u2019ve seen in gazing practice. I still have the notes and drawings I wrote on the night somewhere I remember distinctly my drawing of a multi spronged spinning spiral. But when I brought that up it gets dismissed because it doesn\u2019t fit with the whole triceratops with big tits game they\u2019re playing. What you actually see is almost immediately dissolved by the instant reference to literature immediately after the experience. You keep everything that fits to what you wanted to see and disregard everything that doesn\u2019t fit with what you were supposed to see. \n\nStill! Even though it seems to be a lost art no one seems to know what they\u2019re doing with, there are still people banging their head against it evidently. My point with Walt Disney being a Masonic Rosicrucian is just that you can bet, wether he got any real magic or not, he was exposed to the instruments that people told him were the instruments of real magic. \n\nWe know he was in a Rosicrucian chapter, you don\u2019t join the Rosicrucians just off the street you have to take your 3 Masonic degrees first. And the ones that go into the rosicrucian chapter are the ones who do actually have a little bit of esoteric curiosity, instead of just the conservative, or in our case unionist business men who get into it for social reasons, they\u2019d call the Rosicrucian chapters quacks probably.

Organised by a mason. Attended by crowley people. It was really dull. It was extremely elaborate. We had to do an enochian call before gazing into the mirror then we had to gaze into the obsidian mirror for an extended period. Then stop and write down what we saw. We then compared notes and compared it then again with the manuscript notes about the aethyr in which we called thru the enochian invocation. This was done after a complicated banishing and finished by a complicated banishing then a planetary evocation. Do you see the problem there? For the one part in that whole evening where we might have been open to see something really interesting; before during and after that, it\u2019s already being squashed by your internal dialogue and previous expectations around the whole elaborate scenario that your walking in with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found it underwhelming and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the way it\u2019s performed in these circles is just as underwhelming to everyone involved all around the world. Like you say maybe an old remnant from someone who swam ashore from the river of shit years ago but the practice seemed to be very river of shitty in itself. I certainly went home that evening feeling like I\u2019d just been swimming in some shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people in these circles who show off about scrying are the ones who know the most enochian calls off by heart or have the most expensive recreation of the John Dee holy table, or the ones who\u2019ve read the books about what\u2019s supposed to happen the most. You never hear about actual results &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s also no practical application to the scrying used in that way that was mentioned by even the organiser. It was just a way for him to experience a glimpse of something that was written described in this book. As in there is a book that says something like \u201caethyr 7 has a triceratops with big tits,\u201d and this whole elaborate ceremony is performed just so he can try and strain really hard into a mirror to try and see a triceratops with big tits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did want us to just write down what we saw, us who weren\u2019t familiar with the aethyr literature, funnily enough I did see energy spirals like I\u2019ve seen in gazing practice. I still have the notes and drawings I wrote on the night somewhere I remember distinctly my drawing of a multi spronged spinning spiral. But when I brought that up it gets dismissed because it doesn\u2019t fit with the whole triceratops with big tits game they\u2019re playing. What you actually see is almost immediately dissolved by the instant reference to literature immediately after the experience. You keep everything that fits to what you wanted to see and disregard everything that doesn\u2019t fit with what you were supposed to see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still! Even though it seems to be a lost art no one seems to know what they\u2019re doing with, there are still people banging their head against it evidently. My point with Walt Disney being a Masonic Rosicrucian is just that you can bet, wether he got any real magic or not, he was exposed to the instruments that people told him were the instruments of real magic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know he was in a Rosicrucian chapter, you don\u2019t join the Rosicrucians just off the street you have to take your 3 Masonic degrees first.

They typically weren't paid, but they got in for free, and maybe also help with transportation from LA. Some got a free place to live in Los Angeles.\n\nI wouldn't glamorize them by imagining who they could be.   Carlos was the only obvious sorcerer in that group.\n\nI could suggest names for who you ran into with the native look.   I suspect I'm about to pay a parking ticket for one of them.   But people from that close to Carlos are still very cagey.  They don't like attention, except within that group itself.   Carlos created that atmosphere, perhaps as a necessity.  But it's here to this day, and no longer useful if you ask me.    The hierarchy was so strong, a small part of the inner group even broke away, and the other part sued them over it.\n\nI also got dragged into that mode of thinking.  I'm not a huggy sort of guy.  I don't even like to hug my own family. But Carlos was a hugger.  And he'd even do the European double kiss on the cheek. Some of the hugs could be classified as very affectionate.  They were every bit as sincere as you'd give your best friend, if you hadn't seen them in 5 years.  But he even did that with people he'd seen just a few hours ago, before he boarded the plane to the workshop.\n\nCarlos even got into the habit of hugging *me* at workshops.  He was almost vindictive about it.  One time he saw me, I saw him, and I knew I might get hugged. So I turned my head a bit as if I didn't notice him.  He was about to shrug it off and continue walking, but when he saw me turn my head his face lit up. He changed his path to angle sharply towards me, and walked at a fast pace. He gave me a gigantic hug, even embellishing it with something he said in an animated fashion.  Afterwards I looked around, and people were talking about it.\n\nEvery person he hugged gained social power among the workshop participants. One time I was arguing with a woman outside a workshop, about whether bad breath comes from the stomach or the mouth.   She was quite insistent it came from the stomach.  There was a television commercial campaign at the time, to convince people of that so they'd buy garlic pills.  I've always felt it\u2019s my duty to fight against placebos, although I can\u2019t figure out why since they\u2019re often more successful than pharmaceuticals.\n\nWhile she was making her point, her friend walked closer, gasped and said, \"Don't you know who that is??\"   The woman stopped arguing with me immediately.\n\nPerhaps there's an important lesson to learn in this, if you want to get anywhere.  Sorcery is a practice, not a lifestyle.  It\u2019s not a fancy hat with eagle feathers on it.  It's also not a new inventory of relative social power.  Life is far too short to master it absent an actual sorcery lineage to belong to.   On your own, it's slim pickings and very hard work. And no one you know is going to admire you for pursuing it.  You won\u2019t even have anyone to tell, when you succeed at doing something amazing.\n\nUnfortunately, for many into whom Carlos put so much time and effort, sorcery is just a weird claim they make to boost their ego, but they don't actually do anything to learn it.  If you ask them what they've been doing lately, they'll say something like, \"I'm a stalker.\"  Which usually means, they\u2019re just running around with an attitude.\n\nSome will remind you that they almost committed suicide when Carlos died, as if that explains anything about why they never really tried his techniques.  Some decided they found something even better, but if you look into it, they\u2019ve just switched inventories.\n\nThe topic of outsiders pretending to be teaching the same thing as Carlos is particularly significant for me.  Not for the obvious reason, but for something almost magical.  Certainly Carlos was none too happy about Ken, Marilyn, Silvio, and 2 or 3 others. I'm remembering those names for the first time in 25 years, so I may be off.\n\nCarlos said they were \"riding on his back\".  In one case, they even seem to have stirred up lawsuit discussions.   He was noticeably aggravated with them, although that could also have been for show.\n\nI heard that Kylie was picked up at one of the \"me too\" teachers\u2019 workshops.   So it wasn't a death wish to go along with one of the copycat sorcerers for a while.  And I've heard there are now some in Hawaii who are actually pretty good.\n\nI believe, Carlos just didn't want them messing up what he was trying to do.  Now that he's gone, I can't imagine why he'd object.    But back then, he even objected to that famous author Carlos Castaneda, interfering with what he was trying to do.  He told us to \"stop reading his books\".  They were a hook.  You're hooked. So stop reading them.\n\nThat turned out to be a huge boost to me.  I did stop reading them. And at the time, his last 3 books were coming out. As a result of not reading those, I learned exactly what he wrote in them, through my own practices.   There's nothing more convincing than to be going down the sorcery path on your own, discovering things you aren't sure are worth emphasizing, and then later reading the same things in a book written by Carlos.\n\nThat's what brought me here.  Someone asked me a question about the fliers.  I couldn't figure out why they were obsessed with them.  To me, that was an obvious maneuver he did to create a worthy opponent for us.  For a group of thousands of followers, you need a universal opponent.  A single witch like La Catalina wouldn't do the job.\n\nThat gave me permission to read his last books, in my wacky way of looking at things.  And I discovered, darned if what he wrote didn't agree with what I'd learned on my own.   That's very convincing.\n\nAnd we all need constant convincing.  That\u2019s why people form discussion groups like this. Sorcery is so weird, that you can find an Indian complete with costume and feathers, materializing in your hotel room in Mexico City.  But that somehow still might not be convincing enough to get most of us to work hard enough.\n\nIt's always easier to just go back to sleep.  And I fear, that's what happened to so many, into whom Carlos poured so much time and effort.\n\nI\u2019m sure Carlos wouldn\u2019t have viewed that as a total loss.  He had something else going on, of which we were unaware.  He said he\u2019d gained access to new energetic configurations, as a result of the mass of the group.   Occasionally in practice, the word \u201cmass\u201d would even come up.  I wish I could remember the details.  I only vaguely remember one incident, where he surveyed the size and progress of the class as he moved to the front, to give his lecture.  He shook his head sideways at an angle with a big smile on it, and said, \u201cLook at that mass!\u201d  He clasped his hands together and shook them a little, bent palms, as he slowly lifted them a bit.  It was as if he was thanking a higher power for providing that mass.\n\nOnce in a while, during lectures in class, Carlos would turn his head towards various people, and say something that could have been part of his lecture, except that he was looking into someone's eyes when he said it.  When he did that to you, you never forgot.  I hate to remember some of the things he said when he was looking at me.  I can still remember how one of his eyes, probably the left one, was so different from the other.\n\nOne time he was talking about death.  I can\u2019t recall what brought up the topic, but at the end of it, he turned his head to me and said, \u201cCome find me.  I\u2019ll show you the way to go.\u201d  Then he rotated a bit and let his head gaze across the crowd, as if that were an open invitation to all.  I suspect that includes anyone reading this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "edited": 1553280448.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ej4sbvl", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women guarding the doors were given the task of &amp;quot;running the book store&amp;quot;.

Carlos was the only obvious sorcerer in that group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could suggest names for who you ran into with the native look.   I suspect I&amp;#39;m about to pay a parking ticket for one of them.   But people from that close to Carlos are still very cagey.  They don&amp;#39;t like attention, except within that group itself.   Carlos created that atmosphere, perhaps as a necessity.  But it&amp;#39;s here to this day, and no longer useful if you ask me.    The hierarchy was so strong, a small part of the inner group even broke away, and the other part sued them over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also got dragged into that mode of thinking.  I&amp;#39;m not a huggy sort of guy.  I don&amp;#39;t even like to hug my own family. But Carlos was a hugger.  And he&amp;#39;d even do the European double kiss on the cheek. Some of the hugs could be classified as very affectionate.  They were every bit as sincere as you&amp;#39;d give your best friend, if you hadn&amp;#39;t seen them in 5 years.  But he even did that with people he&amp;#39;d seen just a few hours ago, before he boarded the plane to the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos even got into the habit of hugging &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; at workshops.  He was almost vindictive about it.  One time he saw me, I saw him, and I knew I might get hugged. So I turned my head a bit as if I didn&amp;#39;t notice him.  He was about to shrug it off and continue walking, but when he saw me turn my head his face lit up. He changed his path to angle sharply towards me, and walked at a fast pace. He gave me a gigantic hug, even embellishing it with something he said in an animated fashion.  Afterwards I looked around, and people were talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every person he hugged gained social power among the workshop participants. One time I was arguing with a woman outside a workshop, about whether bad breath comes from the stomach or the mouth.   She was quite insistent it came from the stomach.  There was a television commercial campaign at the time, to convince people of that so they&amp;#39;d buy garlic pills.  I&amp;#39;ve always felt it\u2019s my duty to fight against placebos, although I can\u2019t figure out why since they\u2019re often more successful than pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While she was making her point, her friend walked closer, gasped and said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you know who that is??&amp;quot;   The woman stopped arguing with me immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there&amp;#39;s an important lesson to learn in this, if you want to get anywhere.  Sorcery is a practice, not a lifestyle.  It\u2019s not a fancy hat with eagle feathers on it.  It&amp;#39;s also not a new inventory of relative social power.  Life is far too short to master it absent an actual sorcery lineage to belong to.   On your own, it&amp;#39;s slim pickings and very hard work. And no one you know is going to admire you for pursuing it.  You won\u2019t even have anyone to tell, when you succeed at doing something amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for many into whom Carlos put so much time and effort, sorcery is just a weird claim they make to boost their ego, but they don&amp;#39;t actually do anything to learn it.  If you ask them what they&amp;#39;ve been doing lately, they&amp;#39;ll say something like, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a stalker.&amp;quot;  Which usually means, they\u2019re just running around with an attitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some will remind you that they almost committed suicide when Carlos died, as if that explains anything about why they never really tried his techniques.  Some decided they found something even better, but if you look into it, they\u2019ve just switched inventories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The topic of outsiders pretending to be teaching the same thing as Carlos is particularly significant for me.  Not for the obvious reason, but for something almost magical.  Certainly Carlos was none too happy about Ken, Marilyn, Silvio, and 2 or 3 others. I&amp;#39;m remembering those names for the first time in 25 years, so I may be off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos said they were &amp;quot;riding on his back&amp;quot;.  In one case, they even seem to have stirred up lawsuit discussions.   He was noticeably aggravated with them, although that could also have been for show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard that Kylie was picked up at one of the &amp;quot;me too&amp;quot; teachers\u2019 workshops.   So it wasn&amp;#39;t a death wish to go along with one of the copycat sorcerers for a while.  And I&amp;#39;ve heard there are now some in Hawaii who are actually pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe, Carlos just didn&amp;#39;t want them messing up what he was trying to do.  Now that he&amp;#39;s gone, I can&amp;#39;t imagine why he&amp;#39;d object.    But back then, he even objected to that famous author Carlos Castaneda, interfering with what he was trying to do.  He told us to &amp;quot;stop reading his books&amp;quot;.  They were a hook.  You&amp;#39;re hooked. So stop reading them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That turned out to be a huge boost to me.  I did stop reading them. And at the time, his last 3 books were coming out. As a result of not reading those, I learned exactly what he wrote in them, through my own practices.   There&amp;#39;s nothing more convincing than to be going down the sorcery path on your own, discovering things you aren&amp;#39;t sure are worth emphasizing, and then later reading the same things in a book written by Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what brought me here.  Someone asked me a question about the fliers.  I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out why they were obsessed with them.  To me, that was an obvious maneuver he did to create a worthy opponent for us.  For a group of thousands of followers, you need a universal opponent.  A single witch like La Catalina wouldn&amp;#39;t do the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gave me permission to read his last books, in my wacky way of looking at things.  And I discovered, darned if what he wrote didn&amp;#39;t agree with what I&amp;#39;d learned on my own.   That&amp;#39;s very convincing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we all need constant convincing.  That\u2019s why people form discussion groups like this. Sorcery is so weird, that you can find an Indian complete with costume and feathers, materializing in your hotel room in Mexico City.  But that somehow still might not be convincing enough to get most of us to work hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always easier to just go back to sleep.  And I fear, that&amp;#39;s what happened to so many, into whom Carlos poured so much time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sure Carlos wouldn\u2019t have viewed that as a total loss.  He had something else going on, of which we were unaware.  He said he\u2019d gained access to new energetic configurations, as a result of the mass of the group.   Occasionally in practice, the word \u201cmass\u201d would even come up.  I wish I could remember the details.  I only vaguely remember one incident, where he surveyed the size and progress of the class as he moved to the front, to give his lecture.  He shook his head sideways at an angle with a big smile on it, and said, \u201cLook at that mass!\u201d  He clasped his hands together and shook them a little, bent palms, as he slowly lifted them a bit.  It was as if he was thanking a higher power for providing that mass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, during lectures in class, Carlos would turn his head towards various people, and say something that could have been part of his lecture, except that he was looking into someone&amp;#39;s eyes when he said it.  When he did that to you, you never forgot.  I hate to remember some of the things he said when he was looking at me.  I can still remember how one of his eyes, probably the left one, was so different from the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time he was talking about death.  I can\u2019t recall what brought up the topic, but at the end of it, he turned his head to me and said, \u201cCome find me.  I\u2019ll show you the way to go.\u201d  Then he rotated a bit and let his head gaze across the crowd, as if that were an open invitation to all.  I suspect that includes anyone reading this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_b3j8bz", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/b3j8bz/gifts_from_gabrielle/ej4sbvl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1553275501.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1553275501.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ej3cwrb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ej2762c", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "I once encountered a Castaneda presentation at a hotel in Dallas.

You'll know you are pursuing sorcery, but you're not sure what you'll get. I don't know how that will \"look\" to you. That goes into *seeing* as another thread has shown, where *seeing* may or may not be visual.\n\nI have seen things you describe, like signs above my pets, reading \"Cat\" and \"Dog\" which was pretty funny. I have also seen an image about the size of a deck of cards. This image was of an indoor scene and it stayed fixed and clear even when I was distracted a little. But so long as I kept my gaze, it stayed there. I suppose I was waiting to see if I were scrying in a more modern way, and I have tried to repeat that event, but so far haven't been able to. I do see \"swipe right\" images and a sort of visual \"stuttering\". I don't intend these specific effects; I just do my practice and see what happens. Reading your response helps me understand I'm not as nuts as I think I am, but I do think it is Spirit doing the work, not necessarily the result of what I am doing, and that's because I can't repeat it.\n\nSo, to make a long story short, this is where I wonder if my intent is wrong and maybe that's why I'm not seeing the Cheshire Cat all the time. Your post points to that in that I am OK with aligning with the sorcerer's intent, but I am still curious about following Don Juan's intent of \"Freedom\". As with intent for the average man, intent for the sorcerer has a result, but I have to wonder what I am getting myself into following such a grand intent and maybe how I'm getting off the beaten path in the wrong way by not adhering to it more excitedly - I don't really understand what Don Juan meant by \"Freedom\" so I alter that a bit to say, \"Freedom to perceive.\"\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He told us to think up what you want to accomplish, then go outside and shout &amp;quot;Intent!!!&amp;quot; very loudly.

"&gt;So, to make a long story short, this is where I wonder if my intent is wrong and maybe that's why I'm not seeing the Cheshire Cat all the time.\n\nSo here's another \"dirty little secret\" of sorcery.  While intent can help you out, it might not do it more than once or twice. Then it's up to you.  Afterall, you didn't beg intent to be your daddy and take care of all the hard work for you. It wouldn't respond to a thing like that.  It was just a favorable intent you had, it got noticed in some unbelievable way, and you got some help. It pushed your assemblage point to the right position, at just the right time.\n\nBut how many times is it supposed to continue?  And don't forget Carlos' last books.  Even surrounded by all the sorcerer's in don Juan's group, on the edge of a cliff, Carlos fluctuates back and forth between doubt, and thinking everything is obvious.  Our old position of the assemblage point is always waiting for us to resume being \"normal\".\n\nBut it's also normal to have a cool experience after a bunch of hard work, or even better, with no effort on your part at all.  Perhaps it's just sheer dumb luck, or help from the external force of intent.   Maybe you crossed paths with a double being without being aware of it, and got charged up.\n\nThen you get excited from the cool experience, try it eagerly the next day, likely with success again, though typically not as spectacular. \n\nOn the 3rd day, you're out of energy.  Maybe you even take a rest and don\u2019t try it that day.  And that's it.  No more soup for you!  You have to gain it back on your own power.  Which also means you need more energy.\n\nThis is partly why I'm here. Carlos created a very interconnected and secretive group.  And as far as I know there isn't anyone out there explaining how things go, so that others can judge whether they're on the right track.  Some of those who would might even lose a place to live if they spoke out in anything other than quotes from Carlos' books.  Carlos intertwined everyone very well.\n\nPerhaps 6 years ago, I started looking around for that.  I was getting old, and I wanted to know what was up with the teachers Carlos created. \n\nI really didn't like what I read.   I was hoping to read amazing tales of super cool experiences, and advice on how they got that to happen.  Or cryptic remarks on sorcery which I would recognize as being hard learned lessons that were valid, and even new to me.\n\nI was hoping to see what to emphasize, since there's so much you could do to learn sorcery, and some practices can become sink holes which use up 10 years.  Dreaming is like that.  I advise to practice it, since it doesn't take up any of your actual waking time. But it's much better to learn to do it with your eyes open.  And by the way, here's how.  That\u2019s what I was hoping to hear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eja1erg", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, to make a long story short, this is where I wonder if my intent is wrong and maybe that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m not seeing the Cheshire Cat all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s another &amp;quot;dirty little secret&amp;quot; of sorcery.

Maybe because I was in Carlos' classes.\n\nHe told us to think up what you want to accomplish, then go outside and shout \"Intent!!!\" very loudly.  I seem to remember rumors that one of the women in his inner group really liked that idea, and went nuts with it. She was shouting it over and over again into the night.\n\nI suspect one time is better, if you do it right.  But either way, it\u2019s said to activate the external force part of Intent, which will help you out if your idea or plan is to go further down the sorcery road.  Intent seems to measure what you want, and it has to be in line with some sort of standard that furthers that kind of intent.  So you don\u2019t have to figure out how to duplicate \"the *intent* of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico\". All you have to do is want more of what Carlos was teaching.\n\nFor example, \u201cI want a new car\u201d is not the intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico.  But \u201cI need a car so I can explore the ruins near Mexico City, looking for power objects\u201d, is the intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico.\n\nThere's a guy on the web going on about what he thinks intent is (please make donations via PayPal), and it's rather complicated.   Which contributes to my confusion over what people think it is.  He\u2019s gotten fixated on the normal English usage of that word, and combined it with random pieces from the books of that famous author, Carlos Castaneda.  That kind of activity is why Carlos told us to stop reading that guy\u2019s books.\n\nIntent is what makes the world real.  You can't possibly get away from it.  If you're silent, and your assemblage point starts to drift, intent determines what you end up perceiving.    Your intent at this moment is that you\u2019re reading something on the computer.\n\nBut in fact, Carlos used to read stuff off the wall, the same way you\u2019re doing this.  He could summon the \"intent of reading\",  and even if he\u2019d been facing the computer with this message, he\u2019d likely still be able to see text forming from pure intent.   I\u2019ll add, hoping to interest someone in pursuing that technique, that the text can spin out, or scroll out of the mist. It can be in any font, even silly ones.  It\u2019s also capable of special effects, based on the residue of what you expected it do to.  If all you see all day long are electronic \"Special sale today!!\" signs blinking, your text could blink.  It's all intent.\n\nIntent is forced to change to the next most appropriate intent, when the assemblage point moves. And you can certainly learn to feel it moving as a sort of shock, or shift in consciousness that has some tingly feeling.  Back in the 70s people used to talk about \"peaking\".  They'd smoke something, or snort something, or take something, and as it took effect, it would push their assemblage point to a new position.  They could feel that, and everyone seemed to agree it was a strong feeling.  You skipped from one level of reality, to another, and it had a strong feeling.\n\nNote: From a former class member (not me) I'll paraphrase because he did a good job of explaining this:  Drugs do move you to new positions of the assemblage point, but you have no power with that method.  He went on to explain it in more detail, but it boils down to, drugs are not useful in the long run.  You won't learn to do things on your own power, and the drug will always determine where you end up.  You can't \"navigate\" that way.\n\nBut by practicing dreaming and recapitulation, you'll surely learn to feel the assemblage point move.\n\nAt first, what's blocking you is that you blank out when it moves.  Let\u2019s use a basic  situation to explain that.  Let\u2019s say you\u2019re practicing the simplest form of mantric meditation.  Repeat a sound over and over in your internal dialogue.\n\nPlease don\u2019t use OOOMMMM!!!! Grown men sitting cross-legged on a mountain top taking selfies in their underwear is quite unappealing.    Not to mention, that guy already has his reward.\n\nWell, it\u2019s just my thinking on that kind of attention getting.  If you do it and it works, fine.  But I think that\u2019s the intent of being an admired yogi.  Seeking attention from other people is not the right intent for making progress. It\u2019s the intent of getting more of the same as what you already have.\n\nWhatever mantra you use, it works. The mantra interrupts the normal internal dialogue, and the assemblage point can drift. The choice of mantra has an influence on how it moves.  I like to think of meditation forms as more marketable (profitable) techniques to pitch to people, because just forcing yourself silent is so awful that no one will do it. Or at least, they won't pay you to do it.  If a yogi in underwear tried to charge people for that technique, he\u2019d have to rely on charity to eat.  Even so, it\u2019s a lot more effective than mantras.\n\nBut the main part is, when the assemblage point moves, you\u2019re likely to blank out.   That\u2019s why you want to learn to feel it.  So you can notice that feeling. If you have to go on what you just experienced, in order to realize it shifted, you\u2019ll have a harder time.  By the time you realize you weren\u2019t paying attention to the same thing anymore (a second or two), you\u2019ll be a little disoriented.  It\u2019ll feel like you just forgot about the mantra, and fell asleep.\n\nOften there\u2019s a slight dream vision in your mind when you realize what happened.  A normal person would figure they fell asleep out of boredom, and had a quick dream.\n\nBut that residue image is either intent itself, or a more complicated manifestation of it.  That wasn\u2019t something you had to think about all day, imagining the sorcerers of ancient Mexico in just the right way.\n\nIt\u2019s just how we are.  I\u2019ll go even more mechanical. It\u2019s what our brain does.  We can never process all of the sensory info that comes in to us, so \u201cintent\u201d uses what\u2019s relatively easy to use, and then constructs the nearest \u201creal\u201d vision or object that might match that particular sensory input.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with inorganic beings, there\u2019s very little sensory info.  And so, if you perceive their presence, you\u2019ll come up with a very bizarre representation of them.  That\u2019s also intent.\n\nIn the case of the inorganics, you can mold that intent.  I\u2019ve got them portraying beautiful fairies for me every night.  Not nearly as stable as you\u2019d imagine, I don\u2019t want to give a false impression. But they materialize for a few seconds, inside clouds of visible purple mist that I can see in the dark when silent.  And they occasionally try to come out into the real world, at which point they\u2019d surely have to gain what looks like mass.\n\nWhile confined to the purple mist clouds, the intent of that is hypnogogic floating heads. Not because it always would be, but just because I noticed those, and exploited it.  I exploited it just by waiting for it. Expecting it. That\u2019s also intent.\n\nBut if they emerge into the real world, that intent isn\u2019t enough. They pick up an entire body.  And that\u2019s because, a being in the real world, who can interact with us, has to be a humanoid or animal form.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201cdoing\u201d of this world. Not all it could be, but just what we\u2019re used to.  So the intent that allowed them to appear as a hypnogogic head, has to mutate to turn them into a human or animal form.\n\nA bizarre one to be sure, and highly unstable.\n\nIntent is sort of like the residue of the mind. An expectation that doesn\u2019t have to be at a conscious level.  You can also embed a new intent with almost no effort. That\u2019s Carlos\u2019 technique where you go outside and shout \u201cintent!\u201d while you have the idea in mind.\n\nCan that alter events in the future?  Such thinking is a little too nutty for me, but I have seen it.  It\u2019s pretty hard to deny once you have some \u201ccoincidences\u201d.  Or cubic centimeters of chance you get lucky enough to pluck.\n\nDon\u2019t think about intent using the normal meaning of that word.  That is, as a willful insistence on what you want.    A mini-temper tantrum.\n\nIt\u2019s not that.  It\u2019s contained in that, but without so much baggage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited for errors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "edited": 1553374084.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ej7yfms", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a puzzling question to me.

It\u2019s a warning about dreaming practices, and how you could get stuck.\n\nWhat I meant with unlearning was, you need to unlearn holding your assemblage point in the normal position, and let it move to other places which produce other realities.   To do that, we unfortunately need all of the techniques Carlos gave us.  You can\u2019t do away with any of them, although you can show a preference.\n\nSilence is nearly impossible unless you do a complete recapitulation.  There are too many emotional thoughts that pop in, making it seem like an impossible task.   In fact, we\u2019re psychological messes from what was taught to us as children.  We\u2019re petty tyrants, all of us.  We have to unlearn that.  Or at least, get silent and drift away from it.\n\nBut to drift, you also need to unlearn the familiar, perhaps by making a new familiar.  That\u2019s stalking.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s possible to get help from the spirit. The trip to Mexico posted yesterday is a good example of that.  A bold, irrational, grandiose plan can attract intent.  If it does, you get a temporary boost.\n\nBut Carlos warned, it can\u2019t be for personal gain only.  It has to include something that ties into the intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, even if it\u2019s just a tiny connection.

Our primary reality is obsessed with me, me, me.  Buddhists would call it \u201cthe ego\u201d.\n\nIf you learn to get silent all day long, so that you\u2019re always practicing, there\u2019s a very lonely feeling that eventually comes from the inside, as the wonderful \u201cme\u201d in your mind begins to miss itself.  It\u2019ll threaten, warn of religious consequences, get lonely, feel sadness, and finally start to disassemble.\n\nWhen it\u2019s almost gone, your perception starts to move outward.  You\u2019ll hear conversations on the other end of a large parking lot.  Or smell bagels being made 10 miles away.   Eventually you\u2019ll see time coming towards you, instead of moving away from you.  When you close your eyes, you\u2019ll see relevant dreaming images.\n\nBut the coziness is all over.

It\u2019s a warning about dreaming practices, and how you could get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I meant with unlearning was, you need to unlearn holding your assemblage point in the normal position, and let it move to other places which produce other realities.   To do that, we unfortunately need all of the techniques Carlos gave us.  You can\u2019t do away with any of them, although you can show a preference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence is nearly impossible unless you do a complete recapitulation.  There are too many emotional thoughts that pop in, making it seem like an impossible task.   In fact, we\u2019re psychological messes from what was taught to us as children.  We\u2019re petty tyrants, all of us.  We have to unlearn that.  Or at least, get silent and drift away from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to drift, you also need to unlearn the familiar, perhaps by making a new familiar.  That\u2019s stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it\u2019s possible to get help from the spirit. The trip to Mexico posted yesterday is a good example of that.  A bold, irrational, grandiose plan can attract intent.  If it does, you get a temporary boost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos warned, it can\u2019t be for personal gain only.  It has to include something that ties into the intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, even if it\u2019s just a tiny connection.  I\u2019ll add, it doesn\u2019t hurt if it\u2019s very funny.  &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; has a sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You ask if gaining a foothold in the second attention is at the cost of our primary reality?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes.

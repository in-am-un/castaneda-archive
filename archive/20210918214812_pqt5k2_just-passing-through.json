But if you master Tensegrity, you can take him as a pet. Otherwise, it's too hard to catch him when he runs away.  With Tensegrity, it's possible to run REALLY fast.  Lily showed me.\n\nBut this picture was too full, and I needed to fit the Inorganic being's world into it.\n\nPassing from the red zone to the orange, I've been finding the inorganic being's realm attached to the \"structure\" formed by the tensegrity long form.\n\nAnd I can stop to charge up on dark energy.\n\nI was surprised to find it last night again, which makes 3 days in a row.\n\nTheory: 1 ups are because we try to do something with zero effort.  But if you have a \"ritual\", such as the preparation of the smoking mixture, or the Devil's weed lizard procedures, you have invested more \"intent\" and work into what you want to accomplish and it can be made to work every time.\n\nAnd so, Tensegrity is like the ritual to catch and prepare lizards.\n\nMakes perfect sense to me!\n\nThe dark energy \"filling station\" in the middle of a Tensegrity pass, is needed to move from Heightened Awareness at the start of the Orange Zone, to deep enough towards Silent Knowledge that you can enter the worlds you materialize in the whitish light.\n\nLook...  You can't go in there.\n\nBut the double can.  When you \"stop\" at the end of the tensegrity movement, and are face to face with \"the wall\", the double will come out if everything is perfect.\n\nFor you, it will just be a walk right through the wall.\n\nBut since you don't have a bruise on  your head in the morning, I have to figure some weird change over took place.\n\nI just wish I knew what happened to your physical body.  But as don Juan warned us, \"It just works out.\"\n\nI've been calling the scenes you can materialize in the air \"remote viewing\", but that's not the best name because it's polluted.  It might confuse new people.\n\nStill, remote viewing is a good description.  You can find an example Carlos wanted us to see, on the cover of \"Wheel of Time\".\n\nIn my case, I want to learn to \"remove view\" on the ground, so I can help out shamanic drummers.\n\nNyei does shamanic drumming.\n\nShamanic drumming can get you to the green zone. And in the green zone, it's possible to see dreams in the air or on surfaces.\n\nThey aren't as spectacular as in the orange zone, but no one is going to get that far with shamanic drumming.\n\nIf they glance at the ground while in a drumming circle, I suspect they'll be as pleased as one could hope for, to actually see a scene down there.\n\nLike the ground was a video screen.\n\nOnce they can see that, it should be a piece of cake to use Pandora's Box tensegrity pass, to materialize a dead person from a camp fire in the middle.\n\nE ticket ride!!!\n\nIs that too old of a cultural reference, like Eugene?\n\nSo back to the jeep.\n\nThat picture looks really bad to me.   The one I posted.\n\nBecause I got trapped in that red zone.\n\nI was playing down there and Fancy kept telling me, \"Hey bud, I can teach you some really cool magic today if you like...\"\n\nYea right.  She just wants to keep you down there.\n\nIt's a \"trap\" I missed.  Usually they try to scare you, put you into a cage, or just drag you into their world and seal it off.\n\nBut they need permission!\n\nWish I knew why...\n\nSo instead, they \"teach\" you.\n\nThat's the dreaming emissary thing.\n\nThey're \"grooming\" you, like a predator.\n\nBut you know it, because don Juan warned us they do that.  They give you the \"sales pitch\" between lessons.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is, they can trap you just by showing you magic in the red zone.\n\nIt should have been obvious!\n\nI got stuck, and Cholita had to pull me out, but the way she did it left some side effects.\n\nI was passing by the red zone, without experiencing it.\n\nI was in the green zone, watching green zone magic, then I saw some puffs that were too bright to be green zone, and the next thing I knew, I was seeing the whitish light.\n\nI never played with the red zone.  I just stepped on it  for a second, to get to the orange zone.\n\nThe result was, the red zone kept \"pulling me back\".\n\nNot as mystical as it sounds. I was simply playing with the whitish light in the orange zone, and would see some color to it,  walk over to that part of the room to investigate, and I found that the color I saw turned into brilliant puffs, such as you only see in the red zone.\n\nI was so amazed to see the instant formation of intense red, purple, yellow, and black, that I didn't realize that's what I was trying to avoid.\n\nIt would pull me back enough that the whitish light was gone.\n\nAnd I had to fight my way back to the orange zone.\n\nOne thing you won't like much, is if it takes you hours to get to the orange zone.\n\nThen you're too tired to enjoy it.\n\nWhat you want, is steady and rapid movement of the assemblage point, and you want to fully perceive each level, so you get the satisfaction of each position. But don't dwell there too long.\n\nWhat's the solution?\n\nI decided I wasn't doing enough Tensegrity.  The Tensegrity creates the most brilliant red zone effects, if you do it long enough.\n\nIt has some sort of \"flow\" in it.\n\nBut it was designed by Carlos, who would not leave us trapped in the red zone.\n\nSo that must be part of why he created long forms.\n\nI went back to study long forms in the darkness, to try to identify what that \"flow\" was.\n\nI discovered it forms a structure in the air. A tunnel.  But the shape can be anything.  Even an old house with a hallway with broken doors you can walk right through.\n\nOr a crack in a giant granite boulder, into which you can crawl to other cracks.\n\nYou can \"pass\" through it.\n\nAt specific points, you're in the blue, green, red, and finally orange zones.\n\nIt's a \"vehicle\"!\n\nSo while it might be dangerous to use single movements, if you have an addiction to the red zone, as long as you keep all hands in the vehicle, you can drive through it using Tensegrity long forms,  on the way to the orange.\n\nLike in a Jeep.\n\nI swear Lily wasn't happy about it.  She saw what I was doing, and made more appearances than usual.  And there was some kind of sadness in her, as I reached the orange zone.\n\nThey fade away in the whitish light, and I have to materialize a dream to give them a place to exist.\n\nFrom the green to the red, they can materialize in the air.\n\nIn the blue, they can appear in your dreams, or when the assemblage point shifts sideways and they become an annoying character in a feverish dream.\n\nBut in the whitish light, they fade into a nearly colorless \"pressure\" in the air.\n\nAs La Gorda described it.\n\nShe seemed proud she never saw the allies in \"real\" form anymore.\n\nBut I'm not happy about it.\n\nIf possible, I'll find a \"solution\".\n\nFor now, use long forms and you can pass through the red zone with no issues.  If you use short movements, just use one after the other.\n\nAnd if your IOB whispers, \"Hey bud. This red shit is really good!  You gotta try some!\",   just pass on it.\n\nGo ahead and tell her why.  She might do something about it, if that's possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Just Passing Through...", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"01b61k9iabo71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/01b61k9iabo71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e675d3addb53e921ebde401cd5478fa5a4fa1289"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/01b61k9iabo71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8082c50dd7e81f176c13e0dfe02ff518ec6aa27d"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/01b61k9iabo71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5bdc837ffa18b7f0ac10d755e26b383a848b4a5"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/01b61k9iabo71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c4185f685afe4427187f4cd07705f2e30344bac"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/01b61k9iabo71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c6f3c73dc70550e5c4721433c787ebe4435ea2"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/01b61k9iabo71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe9f115efce59951f3571790b660c2760c50e5c0"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/01b61k9iabo71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=373b837a1621d7ab253e94fbc64c4b68fbd1466e"}, "id": "01b61k9iabo71"}}, "name": "t3_pqt5k2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yGJTicvEvp4YKrcIKYdJbhOMG_YUftAyh-usqr10P8k.jpg", "edited": 1631996470.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1631994492.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/01b61k9iabo71.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=373b837a1621d7ab253e94fbc64c4b68fbd1466e\"&gt;How to do Red Zone, without getting trapped.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the Tensegrity long forms are like jeeps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean Eugene the Jeep.

If the assemblage point shifts far horizontally, it can be quite real.   For instance if you have a fever, or were pushed sideways by watching something \"hypnotic\".  But you always \"wake up\" from it, or \"snap out of it\".  You are separate from the remote viewing.  It was \"somewhere else\", or even \"someone else\".\n\n2 Green zone remote viewing = vision.  It crosses the line for daydreaming, although daydreaming can move you down to the green line. It can be a fast vision on the way out of blanking out or seemingly dozing off.  You remember the mini-dream after.  If it's continuous,  you've gone \"out to lunch\", staring off into space, eyes open, and seeing a vision.  As in \"seeing the room with your eyes closed\".

Silence!  Always try for more. You might stop the world!\n\nWhen the whitish light gets so energized from you gazing at it in perfect silence that \"disturbances\" (bubbles or bumps) form, and even little dreams, you can get your IOB back!\n\nIn fact, she's even more fun in that state.\n\nShe needs a dream in the air, if you are seeing the whitish light.\n\nAnd the dream can be as far away as 6 inches.  \n\nBut usually she'll be right on the edge of it.  At that point, you can use your hand to put her into the dream.\n\nGive her some instructions on what to do there.  Otherwise the dream might spin out of control.\n\nBut  it's not good for remote viewing.  \n\nSome things are \"incompatible\". Until you figure out how to make them not be!\n\nYou have to \"merge\" the intent of both, to make it compatible.  Change how you think about it.\n\nBut at first, an IOB running around in a dream bubble, messes up your ability to remote view on the bed spread later on.\n\nThat gave me an idea.\n\nI already got Lily to drive a truck with no brakes across a long bridge through a forest in Japan.\n\nIt resulted in a horrible accident!    \n\nBut Lily is ok.  As I recall, the truck even flipped on its side with her in it, and might have done a full roll over.\n\nI was covering my face out of dread.\n\n(They like to interact...)\n\nMaybe I can put her in a jeep on my bedspread, and she can drive around in my remote view.  Make it pan along by herself, just because her truck got too close to the edge.\n\nGet her excited by letting her pick her own \"jeep outfit\".\n\nIt's a common video game image, to have an overhead view pan as a little vehicle gets close to the edge,  so it ought to work just fine.\n\nThe same way Carlos said, \"We're Readers!\"  We're also, \"Gamers\".\n\nI'm now convinced, the key to repeatability of magic was given to us in the early books.\n\nRituals!  Procedures!\n\nEffort, with steady intent.\n\nIntent rewards effort.\n\nDoesn't seem to care what effort, or whether it even makes sense.\n\nSo, some dark room magic might in fact be repeatable. \n\nBy breaking it down into a number of pointless steps which seem meaningful at the time.\n\nFor example, red zone \"remote viewing\":\n\nGrab a bright puff, one hand on the left, one on the right, and \"stretch it\".\n\nNo, you won't feel it.  Not unless you switched to your double.\n\nSmear it across the middle of the room, at waist level.\n\nDon't worry if it's really dull and vague!   As long as you smeared anything at all, it'll get more vivid.\n\nThen smooth it out to make a flat surface.  Should get a bit brighter.  First time, maybe perfect from the start!\n\nIt's the \"looking for it\" that messes it up.\n\nBut when you do multiple steps on it, each one is a different \"looking for it\", and so while you're stuck on the previous \"deal killer\", the next step won't be as interfered with.\n\nA road is easier than a table like surface,  because you can sweep the entire road with one palm.

Silence!  Always try for more. You might stop the world!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the whitish light gets so energized from you gazing at it in perfect silence that &amp;quot;disturbances&amp;quot; (bubbles or bumps) form, and even little dreams, you can get your IOB back!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, she&amp;#39;s even more fun in that state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She needs a dream in the air, if you are seeing the whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the dream can be as far away as 6 inches.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But usually she&amp;#39;ll be right on the edge of it.  At that point, you can use your hand to put her into the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give her some instructions on what to do there.  Otherwise the dream might spin out of control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But  it&amp;#39;s not good for remote viewing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some things are &amp;quot;incompatible&amp;quot;. Until you figure out how to make them not be!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to &amp;quot;merge&amp;quot; the intent of both, to make it compatible.  Change how you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at first, an IOB running around in a dream bubble, messes up your ability to remote view on the bed spread later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gave me an idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I already got Lily to drive a truck with no brakes across a long bridge through a forest in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It resulted in a horrible accident!    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Lily is ok.  As I recall, the truck even flipped on its side with her in it, and might have done a full roll over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was covering my face out of dread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(They like to interact...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can put her in a jeep on my bedspread, and she can drive around in my remote view.  Make it pan along by herself, just because her truck got too close to the edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get her excited by letting her pick her own &amp;quot;jeep outfit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a common video game image, to have an overhead view pan as a little vehicle gets close to the edge,  so it ought to work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same way Carlos said, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re Readers!&amp;quot;  We&amp;#39;re also, &amp;quot;Gamers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now convinced, the key to repeatability of magic was given to us in the early books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rituals!  Procedures!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Effort, with steady intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent rewards effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t seem to care what effort, or whether it even makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, some dark room magic might in fact be repeatable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By breaking it down into a number of pointless steps which seem meaningful at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, red zone &amp;quot;remote viewing&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grab a bright puff, one hand on the left, one on the right, and &amp;quot;stretch it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, you won&amp;#39;t feel it.  Not unless you switched to your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smear it across the middle of the room, at waist level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry if it&amp;#39;s really dull and vague!   As long as you smeared anything at all, it&amp;#39;ll get more vivid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then smooth it out to make a flat surface.  Should get a bit brighter.  First time, maybe perfect from the start!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;looking for it&amp;quot; that messes it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you do multiple steps on it, each one is a different &amp;quot;looking for it&amp;quot;, and so while you&amp;#39;re stuck on the previous &amp;quot;deal killer&amp;quot;, the next step won&amp;#39;t be as interfered with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A road is easier than a table like surface,  because you can sweep the entire road with one palm.   Make it circular, and all you have to do is rotate while your palm sweeps the arch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And visualize how your IOB is going to play on that surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, decide what it is, and get your IOB to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy went treasure hunting for me, on the road.

The witch was trained in European traditions, and the man is a successful practitioner of Carlos\u2019 techniques, having learned to activate the second attention on demand.\n\nI was lucky enough to be privy to the argument.\n\nUnder the surface, it was actually about their ex-marriage. Naturally, that\u2019s always the case when men argue with women. The man is arguing one thing, the woman is concerned about something entirely different. Or maybe dozens of entirely different things all at once, none of which by itself warrants her mention of it, so she doesn\u2019t.\n\nI believe that\u2019s because men have a stronger connection to reason than women, but a weaker connection to words.\n\nCarlos never said that.  I\u2019ve just come to that conclusion from the bits and pieces of clues I receive from people who write to me.\n\nPlus, if you think about humans as apes, and purely the result of biological evolution, the man needs the reasoning ability for hunting. He has the stronger muscles, so he has to be the one to outwit and capture animals for food.\n\nThe woman\u2019s job is gathering food and medicines from plants.  For that she needs a silver tongue, to talk her way out of potential arguments over what she finds.\n\nHaving a stronger connection to words means women have a stronger connection to dreaming than men.  In don Juan\u2019s 8-point diagram, the only connection reason has to dreaming is through talking.\n\nAs Cholita has said, you can\u2019t understand **anything** without words.\n\nBut the stronger connection to reason, given to the men, makes it more likely they\u2019ll learn sorcery on their own. It takes discipline to become silent, and reason is the motivator of discipline.\n\nThe surface argument they were having, witch vs sorcerer, essentially came down to the sorcerer telling the witch that her view of the world wasn\u2019t real. And it wouldn\u2019t work. She needed to be more reasonable.\n\nBut how different is a witch\u2019s view of the world, from that of a Carlos style sorcerer?\n\nWitches use repetitious rituals to interrupt their internal dialogues. Some involve outstretched arms, or unusual body postures.\n\nThose are certain to redeploy energy trapped at the outside of their luminous cocoons. In the course of doing the ritual, they\u2019ll get an infusion of energy.\n\nThe spells and incantations can become a form of meditation, if practiced enough. Again, that helps them silence their internal dialogues long enough that they might notice the second attention.\n\nAnd they learn to \u201cfeel\u201d energy, both positive and negative. That gives them the ability to detect the onset of heightened awareness.\n\nThey also try to work with spirits, giving them practical experience using and manipulating the second attention.\n\nIn other words, they move their own assemblage points, using the witchcraft. There\u2019s no reason they shouldn\u2019t even be able to assemble other worlds.\n\nThey\u2019re no different than sorcerers.\n\nIf they have a barrier to learning, it\u2019s the same as for sorcerers.\n\nLaziness.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of actually practicing that would prevent witches from finding the same destination as sorcerers.\n\nBut what about witches\u2019 crazy claims of magical results from simply reciting a spell?\n\nDon Juan gave us the example when he advised Carlos to *intend* that the basement in his apartment building get flooded, to stop the piano practicing going on down there. Carlos needed that, because he was learning to be silent.\n\n*Intent* delivered, even though one might call that a \u201cnegative\u201d result.\n\nAnd sorcerers seem to claim that it\u2019s possible to learn to move things merely by looking at them, and also possible to learn to fly, and teleport yourself. They even claim you can transform into an animal or insect.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference in outrageous claims between witches and sorcerers? Nothing I can think of.\n\nHere\u2019s some advice for witches:\n\nFind a practical task, such as learning to move objects merely by looking at them.\n\nYou can look up how to do that in Carlos books, but it boils down to finding and controlling an inorganic being, teaching it to assume a specific form such as a cat or ghost, then making it solid enough in that form, so that it can be \u201clocated\u201d at a specific spot, instead of just being \u201cout there\u201d, floating around.\n\nIf you do that, it\u2019ll likely take you to its own world, where you can learn this technique by pushing and pulling on the entities there.\n\nIn general however, look for a sensation of light when practicing witchcraft. Close your eyes, and see if you can find it.\n\nThe light comes in different flavors. Orange is a happy, restful flavor. Nurturing.\n\nPurple and brown are \u201cdark energy\u201d. That shouldn\u2019t be confused with anger, although at first, the sensation that light gives off is frightening.\n\nThere\u2019s also a blue, alien light. I\u2019ve never seen that up close, but Carlos found a woman who had it. And at least one of the spirits Carlos controlled is overflowing with it.\n\nAlso try to summon dreaming images in the dark. You need something to quiet your mind, but it could be a repetitious movement, incantations, or anything you normally would not be thinking.\n\nLook for sensations when practicing. Especially important are \u201cgoosebumps\u201d, or any tingling sensation in the body. It can be mistaken for fear at first, so just relax when you feel it.\n\nFind the light, or dreaming images, and try to learn how to reproduce those more quickly. Then explore them.\n\nIf you can maintain the sensation of light when you close your eyes, or even better, dreaming images, then just watch them while you try to quiet your mind.\n\nIf you do a lot of that, you\u2019ll eventually learn to drift off into what\u2019s called, \u201cheightened awareness\u201d.\n\nAt first you'll fall asleep, but just keep trying. That's precisely what you're trying to learn:  to fall asleep, but while still awake.  To sleep walk, or practice \"dreaming awake\".\n\nIn that condition, you can see time as something coming towards you, instead of going away from you, giving you no control over it.\n\nThat's often called, \"the second sight\".\n\nYou can figure out how to do anything you really want to do, once you can *see* the oncoming time.  You'll just *know* all the steps you'll need to take.\n\nYou can also stop short of heightened awareness, and still do amazing things with any light you learn to see.  You can gaze through blotches of intense light if you manage to learn to see them with eyes closed, while drifting off to sleep.\n\nTell  yourself a story when you see that, a beautiful story about heaven or any place you'd like to visit.  Tell yourself only the story, don't let your mind wander back to your problems.\n\nYou're trying to learn to activate bliss, a feeling of comfort and happiness in the body.\n\nThe story you tell yourself guides the results.  Don't fret when nothing seems to happen. This develops over time as your dreaming body learns what you want it to do.  It's not used to being activated while you are still awake, so it can take days of storytelling to feel something.\n\nMake it a routine.  Make it the way you go to sleep for a couple of weeks. Your storytelling will improve. At first you'll run out of story, and have to start over. But when you begin to feel the story flow by itself, you're on the verge.   That's your dreaming attention taking over the story for you.\n\nBut don't forget to look through the color blotch you see.  Mine is purple.  If yours is merely empty space, it's still good enough, as long as there's some depth to it.  The color will come when the story starts to flow by itself.  It just needs a space in which to float.\n\nVisiting heaven is easy.  Just give it a try.  I've seen 4 places in heaven using that technique.  I've met people there, and seen them the next day in the \"real world\".\n\nIf you run into God, don't forget to ask him for something.   I wasn't aware of that the first time I visited heaven.  Even when he told me himself to ask for something, I just ran for my life and dived into the bathtub.\n\nDon't expect God to look like anything you can imagine from religious texts.  He won't be that.\n\nBut you'll know him anyway.\n\nIf you get into trouble, go into the bath and fill it with the coldest water you can tolerate. My tolerance is low, but it works anyway.\n\nBe fearless, that's also good advice. And as a woman, you can switch over to \"witch mode\" in a instant. You just need to \u201cturn your head\u201d.\n\nBut not on the physical body. It\u2019ll be your dreaming body which turns its head.\n\nThe other night I went looking for my little Fairy entity.  I raised her up from 2 dots on a puff of purple smoke I found in the darkness.\n\nAfter months of interaction, she'd become my best friend.\n\nBut now I\u2019ve lost her, because I didn\u2019t have any practice time left. I've been taking care of a witch who's gotten herself lost in waking dreaming.\n\nI searched all over for my entity in the darkness, visiting several realms.\n\nI eventually found myself in a new one. I\u2019d never seen it before.\n\nIt was composed of colors of melting light. The brightness wasn\u2019t overpowering, but there wasn\u2019t a single spot all around me, not covered in dripping colors of light.  The streaks of light were about 6 inches wide each, and overlapped as they ended.\n\nAnd yet, walking through them never caused any physical contact and I never felt closed in.\n\nAll the colors for the types of energy in women were represented there.  I recognized some of them.\n\nAnd I could *feel* them all at once,  sort of the same way you can mix various flavors of melting ice cream together, to get a new result that still has the taste of the single flavors.  I knew those feelings from women I'd known.\n\nIt was a joyous place, minus the excitement of joy.\n\nI realized, any woman can come here. They don\u2019t even need training.  They already have one foot planted in this realm.\n\nThey just have to turn their head.\n\nThe problem for them is, which direction is it?\n\nEdited: four times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Advice for Witches", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"a1e2kzjmmfn31": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 143, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1e2kzjmmfn31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e49ff5f3f9303e8bf3f07d8d4748c5a9e9883b97"}, {"y": 286, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1e2kzjmmfn31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=928e1b0af2987c6b764dd6229fb52a18a4fac01e"}, {"y": 425, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1e2kzjmmfn31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d53bca0581ad90cc2b44dfb772ae848e6d99f7e8"}], "s": {"y": 667, "x": 502, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1e2kzjmmfn31.jpg?width=502&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19f71aca3e1b726ecd6337c069b1c7c6876cfdb1"}, "id": "a1e2kzjmmfn31"}}, "name": "t3_d5mnqv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/khCyfbpoKhlXSzQCUJMWBHT-oFXRuVUXV8Zg5WcLnnA.jpg", "edited": 1568851090.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1568751856.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a1e2kzjmmfn31.jpg?width=502&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=19f71aca3e1b726ecd6337c069b1c7c6876cfdb1\"&gt;Yes there are real Witches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A witch and a man who works in the computer industry got into a mini-argument over witchcraft vs sorcery.

Carlos never touched her.   He showered her with attention, but didn't expect anything in return.\n\nBut, she's a woman.  She needed to commit to him.  Even if Carlos didn't expect anything in return, you can be sure Cholita did.\n\nSo she had to be intimate with him in some way. Women just do that.  I don't know why.  They force you to chase them, shower them with attention and shopping, but until they become intimate with you, they don't relax and just hang out for the ride.\n\nThey're still in chase mode, until they do something intimate with you.\n\nActually I kind of like chase mode, so ladies please don't give that one up. When you're celibate, as Carlos told his private class men to be, the chase is all you have.\n\nThe hair.  That was the commitment he extracted from Cholita.\n\nHer femininity.  She had to give it up for him.  It's like being faithful to a man, minus the sex.\n\nI'm still curious about whether she exposed her vagina in the sorcerers cave, as Carlos advised her.\n\nBut, I'm a guy. I'm always interested in vaginas.\n\nWait...  I just realized why Carlos had the private class women expose themselves to Malibu beach.\n\nIt was more of the same.  Commitment.

Carlos never touched her.   He showered her with attention, but didn&amp;#39;t expect anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, she&amp;#39;s a woman.  She needed to commit to him.  Even if Carlos didn&amp;#39;t expect anything in return, you can be sure Cholita did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she had to be intimate with him in some way. Women just do that.  I don&amp;#39;t know why.  They force you to chase them, shower them with attention and shopping, but until they become intimate with you, they don&amp;#39;t relax and just hang out for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re still in chase mode, until they do something intimate with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually I kind of like chase mode, so ladies please don&amp;#39;t give that one up. When you&amp;#39;re celibate, as Carlos told his private class men to be, the chase is all you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hair.  That was the commitment he extracted from Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her femininity.  She had to give it up for him.  It&amp;#39;s like being faithful to a man, minus the sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still curious about whether she exposed her vagina in the sorcerers cave, as Carlos advised her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, I&amp;#39;m a guy. I&amp;#39;m always interested in vaginas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait...  I just realized why Carlos had the private class women expose themselves to Malibu beach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was more of the same.  Commitment. Like cutting their hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the faintest memory of someone explaining all that to me, while I was in private classes.

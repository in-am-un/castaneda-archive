The witches taught her to be secretive.\n\nNot that she doesn't like it that way.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no way to find out, short of hacking her cellphone travel record. The Taiwanese Bosses' son  has offered to do that, but I have to get hold of the phone.\n\nAnd risk murder by Cholita.\n\nBut she obviously went somewhere, because she brought back the most unbelievable gift I could have imagined.\n\nShe found an inorganic being almost as powerful as the ones Carlos left to us.\n\nI had no idea she was returning.  The last information I saw about her was \u201cIn Miami!!!\u201d.\n\nWith Cholita gone, I'd had a lot more practice time.  And I took advantage of it, daily.\n\nIt really does build up. I wish it weren\u2019t so, because you\u2019d like to take a couple of days off once in a while to go on a drunken binge in a hotel.\n\nOr whatever.\n\nSomething you shouldn't be doing as an \"impeccable warrior\", which uses up all of your time.\n\nFor me, Magnum PI re-runs and Cabernet.\n\nBut the powers you have for waking dreaming depend on where your assemblage point is located.\n\nThe more continuously you practice, the easier it is to get it into heightened awareness in a short time.\n\nAnd if it takes you 2 hours each practice session to get to heightened awareness, there isn\u2019t much time left if you\u2019ve allocated 3 hours.\n\nIf it takes only a few minutes, you get the whole 3 hours to play with magic.\n\nI was allocating 5 hours while Cholita was gone.\n\nI had it down to a routine.\n\nAll I had to do was notice how bright the purple fog was, wiggle my fingers near my second attention\u2019s assemblage point until I could see some fibers of light, then feel around with my hand for cobwebs.\n\nPlay with those a while, and I was there.\n\nI was looking out over a very nice purple mist last night, seeing my little fairy entity pop her head out once in a while, and considering what to do next.\n\nShe was still doing her \"I'm a small coin\" thing.\n\nJust a head the size of a quarter, in a perfectly round disturbance in the purple mist, stationary as if waiting for something to do.\n\nBut only for a few seconds.\n\nThis little entity doesn't stay in one spot too long.  She seems to just show up to see if there's anything to do, and if not she's gone.\n\nI was wondering what to do also.\n\nShould I try to go into dreaming through the living room wall, try to get my inorganic being to form an oracle in my hand, or try to scoop dreams out of the air, to see how they behave in the hand?\n\nI was pondering how miserable the last dream I held in my hand looked, all dark as if it had burned up in the fireplace, when I heard something fall on the far end of the house.\n\nSomething long had fallen over and hit the wooden floor.  A broom perhaps.\n\nIt was too little to assume Cholita had returned, but it was enough to produce a little shiver of fright.\n\nThose are useful when playing with the second attention. They give the assemblage point a random push and the purple fog stirs up and things form.\n\nIf you can\u2019t maintain silence, you\u2019ll start thinking.\n\nBut I\u2019d gotten to the point, with Cholita gone, that my internal dialogue remained off on it\u2019s own.\n\nI only had to produce a feeling that I was, \u201cin the basement\u201d, in some odd way.\n\nThere\u2019s no internal dialogue, down in the basement.\n\nI heard the bathroom door slam.\n\nCholita was home!\n\nI kept scooping colors and playing with things I found in the darkness.\n\nOddly, I can\u2019t remember what I did next, because it wasn\u2019t until an hour later that Cholita must have fallen asleep in her bed, and decided to walk through the bedroom door to make a welcome home appearance.\n\nI recall a frantic thumbs up, motivated by fear I wouldn't remember something.\n\nAnd I don't.\n\nI only remember from the point when Cholita showed up.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since Cholita looked herself in her dreaming body.\n\nLately all I can see is a head, and a vague outline of a body, typically not aligned with the floor very well.  Sometimes even leaning at an angle, so that I have to turn my head to check if it's her.\n\nIt corresponds to some argument we had.  Something about her sticking a razor blade in my tires, trying to murder me with a heavy roll of art paper, or perhaps dumping sangria wine on my bed, and putting a dagger under it.\n\nWe had a talk about it each time.\n\nAnd she backed off on guest appearances in her dreaming body.\n\nBut this time, she was blue. And a bright blue.  Bright enough that it ought to have hurt my eyes, except that since there was no actual light and it was all a projection of energy from the second attention, it was just startling.\n\nPleasing.   Solid looking.\n\nAnyone who hadn\u2019t seen that before would have had a heart attack.\n\nA witch-like ghost has invaded the room, and is on fire with blue light!\n\nBut I was so silent, I had no reaction at all.\n\nI wanted to verify if this ghost was really Cholita.\n\nNot that I've ever seen one looking like that before.\n\nI didn\u2019t recognize the clothes she was wearing, but they were puffy like Cholita likes to wear when it\u2019s cold out.\n\nAs the Taiwanese Bosses' son calls them, \"old woman clothes\".\n\nBut in fact, they were merely clothes from the Era of Margarette, a good friend of Carlos, who had given clothes to Cholita on multiple occasions.\n\nBeing given clothes by a member of the inner circle was an honor.\n\nThe ghostly figure turned to me and smiled.\n\nThat\u2019s definitely NOT Cholita, I thought to myself.\n\nCholita has never smiled at me in her dreaming body, that I can recall.  Certainly if she had, it was rare.\n\nShe stretched out her arms to the side and floated up into the air. She became so bright, there was no way on earth to explain that away, other than that it\u2019s real magic.\n\nWhile she floated in the air, glowing very bright light blue, I got a good look at her face and hair.\n\nIt was indeed Cholita.\n\nBut in her 30s, the age she\u2019d been while in private classes.\n\nCholita had told me, nearly a year ago, \"I'm getting younger!\"\n\nAnd she seemed to be doing just that.\n\nShe remained super bright, moving around to my right for longer than I\u2019d ever seen her in her dreaming body.\n\n5 minutes must have gone by when she laid down on her side on the bed at my feet.\n\nHalf her body was below the mattress, so it was only her shoulders and head visible to me.\n\nHer face was turned away from me, towards the East wall.  Her cheek was resting on my leg.\n\nAn ultra-violet light began to burn above her. It was near the ceiling, and as intense as Carlos\u2019 allies can be when they show up in darkness.\n\nThe tint was a little different. It leaned more towards very light blue, than towards ultraviolet.\n\nAnd yet, it was obviously burning. It was so intense that I thought to myself, no one\u2019s going to believe this!\n\nIt expanded into a giant head of a man with an ugly big nose, threatening to bite me. The head floated towards me, chin jutting out.\n\nIt must have been 3 feet in diameter.\n\nI had absolutely no reaction other than to notice, he was light blue, but lately my low energy inorganic is pinkish.\n\nI hadn't realized that.\n\nMy little fairy entity had taken on a pink hue, along with shrinking into a flat disk.\n\nThe last time I saw her with that hue was when she took me to her world, and crossed the barrier.\n\nShe took on a reddish white color while in her own world.\n\nOn my side, she was bluish purple. But when she crossed \"into\" her world, she changed instantly to a darkish pink.\n\nLately she\u2019s only the size of a quarter most of the time.\n\nThis new monster inorganic being was like King Kong, compared to a mouse.\n\nFailing to get a reaction with it's threat to bite me,  it backed up a tiny bit and began to cycle through different faces and looks.\n\nThe heads became closer to normal size, but each was surrounded by a scene of where that head might be appropriate.\n\nBehind some pillars, next to  a painting. Each was a mini-scene, around 2 feet wide, by 3 feet high.\n\nIt wasn't a dream.  It animated only once or twice a second. When I recognized what it had become, it changed to something else.\n\nThat's the  mark of an inorganic being.  They just project your own expectations.  And until you see the previous look, they maintain what they've projected.\n\nIt became a rather plain woman.\n\nI didn\u2019t react.\n\nIt became a corpse.\n\nI said, \u201cIf you like!  That\u2019s fine with me.\u201d\n\nAnd it was.\n\nI was surprised. What's the point of making them appear a certain way?\n\nI hadn't felt that way before.\n\nThe intensity increased dramatically, as it continued to try different shapes and forms, all seemingly to get me to react in fear.\n\nI literally had no feeling whatsoever about it.\n\nIt was a puzzling sensation.\n\nI was silent, and there it was.\n\nI didn\u2019t want anything from it, and it couldn\u2019t take anything from me.\n\nThat\u2019s was all there was to it.   It was a standoff.\n\nI looked down, and Cholita was no longer laying on my bed. She\u2019d gone off into a formal dream.\n\nInto a virtual dream world.\n\nI turned my head right and I could see her walking down a hall to an elevator.\n\nI turned my head back from that dream, and looked at the new inorganic being.\n\nMy thought was, this one is almost as powerful as Carlos\u2019 allies.\n\nBut it seems to be a little clueless.\n\nIf you have your choice between Carlos' super powerful, super smart, super scary allies,  a little fairy who just likes to help,  and occasionally lifts her skirt so you can take a look, or a super powerful but completely clueless inorganic being, which is better?\n\nBeats me.\n\nIt finally gave up changing appearance and became what it likely really is.  Just a collection of lights.\n\nFor those who want to \"wrestle with the Ally\", this is an easier way to do it.\n\nJust have no reaction to it.\n\nIt's got no choice but to obey you, if it wants energy.\n\nThis one was different than any I've seen.\n\nIt was a little cloud built from 5 or 6 puffs of bluish white light. They were hovering very steadily.\n\nNone were intense, all were the same whitish blue, and despite having a lot more volume than the tiny dots of my little fairy, they were rather soothing to look at.  My fairy's dots are more insistent, or \"active\".\n\nIt looked quite different than Carlos\u2019 allies, or my low energy inorganic.\n\nIt seemed to be waiting for me to do something.\n\nI turned to the right to follow Cholita off to wherever she\u2019d gone.\n\nI don't know when it happened, but I was then in my dreaming body, having passed through the bedroom wall and into some kind of corridor.\n\nPerhaps a hotel.  Or maybe an airport.\n\nCholita had forbid me to follow her into her dreams, but the smile she gave me that time seemed to have suspended that rule.\n\nI followed her into an elevator, where a very annoying little dog was sniffing around on the floor below Cholita.\n\nI don't know why, but it struck me that the little dog was curiously looking for mice.\n\nI had a thought: That's an inorganic being for sure!\n\nEdited three times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cholita Returns from DC", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"61gigpxbxkv41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 173, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/61gigpxbxkv41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a53be4e9f79fe40405c5fcbddbb45f9d81221bc"}, {"y": 346, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/61gigpxbxkv41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7a1ceacac5fa11342bd1b76404dc28be8fa8ad"}, {"y": 513, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/61gigpxbxkv41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e719e60b4742c071d80f99a46ed280bce1ea4bd"}, {"y": 1027, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/61gigpxbxkv41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2c4773ca7054e9a005bf71f927f1a6eb5beeaf8"}, {"y": 1541, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/61gigpxbxkv41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69faaeb041bcd33a14225c5cd6ad49887208957f"}], "s": {"y": 1728, "x": 1076, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/61gigpxbxkv41.jpg?width=1076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80ff2b4b471cc6419bf15eace1d5c18b6ea58993"}, "id": "61gigpxbxkv41"}}, "name": "t3_g9pkch", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/L84lKZ-q932jZHVJE4PQg0IOcgjhi9OnJumViQwotxw.jpg", "edited": 1588176410.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1588088696.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/61gigpxbxkv41.jpg?width=1076&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80ff2b4b471cc6419bf15eace1d5c18b6ea58993\"&gt;Yes, there Really is a Cholita, and Witches do Exist!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did Cholita really travel to DC, then to Miami, and then return home nearly overnight, with only $100 in her bank account at the start, all in the middle of a deadly plague?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Cholita.

But when she crossed &amp;quot;into&amp;quot; her world, she changed instantly to a darkish pink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately she\u2019s only the size of a quarter most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This new monster inorganic being was like King Kong, compared to a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Failing to get a reaction with it&amp;#39;s threat to bite me,  it backed up a tiny bit and began to cycle through different faces and looks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The heads became closer to normal size, but each was surrounded by a scene of where that head might be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Behind some pillars, next to  a painting. Each was a mini-scene, around 2 feet wide, by 3 feet high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a dream.  It animated only once or twice a second. When I recognized what it had become, it changed to something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the  mark of an inorganic being.  They just project your own expectations.  And until you see the previous look, they maintain what they&amp;#39;ve projected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It became a rather plain woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t react.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It became a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said, \u201cIf you like!  That\u2019s fine with me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surprised. What&amp;#39;s the point of making them appear a certain way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t felt that way before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intensity increased dramatically, as it continued to try different shapes and forms, all seemingly to get me to react in fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally had no feeling whatsoever about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a puzzling sensation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was silent, and there it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t want anything from it, and it couldn\u2019t take anything from me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s was all there was to it.   It was a standoff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down, and Cholita was no longer laying on my bed. She\u2019d gone off into a formal dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into a virtual dream world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my head right and I could see her walking down a hall to an elevator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my head back from that dream, and looked at the new inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My thought was, this one is almost as powerful as Carlos\u2019 allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it seems to be a little clueless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have your choice between Carlos&amp;#39; super powerful, super smart, super scary allies,  a little fairy who just likes to help,  and occasionally lifts her skirt so you can take a look, or a super powerful but completely clueless inorganic being, which is better?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It finally gave up changing appearance and became what it likely really is.  Just a collection of lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who want to &amp;quot;wrestle with the Ally&amp;quot;, this is an easier way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just have no reaction to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s got no choice but to obey you, if it wants energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one was different than any I&amp;#39;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a little cloud built from 5 or 6 puffs of bluish white light. They were hovering very steadily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None were intense, all were the same whitish blue, and despite having a lot more volume than the tiny dots of my little fairy, they were rather soothing to look at.  My fairy&amp;#39;s dots are more insistent, or &amp;quot;active&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looked quite different than Carlos\u2019 allies, or my low energy inorganic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed to be waiting for me to do something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to the right to follow Cholita off to wherever she\u2019d gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know when it happened, but I was then in my dreaming body, having passed through the bedroom wall and into some kind of corridor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a hotel.  Or maybe an airport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had forbid me to follow her into her dreams, but the smile she gave me that time seemed to have suspended that rule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed her into an elevator, where a very annoying little dog was sniffing around on the floor below Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why, but it struck me that the little dog was curiously looking for mice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a thought: That&amp;#39;s an inorganic being for sure!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "43d4e582-6010-11ea-a748-0ef2a7bb995d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "g9pkch", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 34, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g9pkch/cholita_returns_from_dc/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/g9pkch/cholita_returns_from_dc/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1588088696.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fpeq0io", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "DreamingTheDouble", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fpeblnb", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5rco1mpq", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; Can I leave the \"gently\" part to Cholita?\n\nHehe, I almost removed the \"gently\" word, but decided to keep it.  \n\nAnd I must say this really was an excellent reply on your part, that I feel answered everything I was stirring up emotionally.\n\nI was a little afraid that what I was saying was going to come off as offensive, but I still felt the need to express it.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to acknowledge, the bit you said about evoking intent and hooking us.

When I get to see details, it's obviously formed by a deluge of water, over a very long time.  \n\nIt's a conglomerate of rocks and sand.\n\nExcept, you can't see any of those details. It just gives that impression, from memories I have of such places.\n\nThey live in holes in that wall, coming out like worms leaving tubes.\n\nYou can learn to levitate objects by standing there, in front of a large wall of them, and pulling them out with a hand gesture (wave palm slowly in), and pushing the back with a palm movement back.\n\nYou don't have to actually \"touch\" them, as I believed when I first tried that.\n\nDoes that look like Carlos' description?\n\nWho knows. You just take what you get.  There's a reason Carlos banned us from reading his books anymore.\n\nConsidering how many types of inorganic beings there are (multiple, we know from Carlos' writings), and how many entirely different bands of emanations there are (7 intersecting us), we really don't know what to expect there.\n\nNot to mention, the most puzzling thing of all!\n\nWe aren't limited in any way to perceiving inorganics that are of this earth, and the bands of emanations associated with our luminous shell.\n\nCarlos' allies come from the center of the universe!  He said so in his last books!\n\nThere's also Carol Tiggs saying we likely never get to see our cyclic beings as they and their world really are. For instance, if they have 4 legs there, we're still only going to perceive ourselves with 2.\n\nSecond: Silence, and running into them often.\n\nI suspect I'd still be afraid of Carlos' allies.  \n\nThe powerful one Cholita brought home (she now sort of admits it), was likely using the energy of her dreaming body to project itself.  That's probably why it seemed as powerful as Carlos' allies.\n\nI went looking for it last night, during the early evening, when Cholita was still awake.\n\nAnd for Cholita's double, which I never saw.\n\nI found a \"ghost\" swirling around my room, like a classic cartoon of a ghost in a \"sheet\", wafting around.\n\nI've never seen that before.\n\nSurely that image came from Haunted House at Disneyland, where the little ghosts are swirling overhead.\n\nAny appearance they have is from us, I suppose,  but can't yet say for sure.\n\nBut one thing was clear, it didn't have near the energy it had the first night.\n\nI walked over to the hallway that shows the door to Cholita's room, and also the living room.\n\nIt was still a little too light to call absolute darkness.\n\nAnd if you learn to *see* energy in darkness, you're sort of cheating. You haven't really gotten control over that.\n\nBut I gave it a try, and noticed that the floor under the door was buzzing, with black static.  \n\nBut only if I squinted, to further reduce the light.\n\nAt one point it bloomed into what looked like a patch of rotting seaweed, sitting on the beach.  \n\nYou know the way it clumps up, and looks quite creepy?\n\nThat was oozing out from under the door. \n\nIt was absolute black. So black, that was impossible.  You could only see that it had thousands of small tentacles, because vague yellowish lines were showing the shapes.\n\nTentacles from it were flowing up, as if to warn against trying to enter her space.\n\nI remembered that my little fairy entity had shown me golden light rays under the door, looking very much like that, but inviting instead of menacing.\n\nIt was, frankly, hard to believe my eyes.  It looked like a really scary movie special effect.\n\nThe weirdest part was, I was feeling completely normal, and not in darkness.\n\nIt was literally like being in a movie.\n\nI watched for at least a minute, when Cholita gently coughed from her room.\n\nIt was just the tiniest of a cough!\n\nCertainly not enough to startle me out of perfect silence (which is why I was able to see that).\n\nThe black tentacles and evil looking seaweed mass pulled back and disappeared under the door, like an octopus zipping away from a prey.\n\nThe door looked absolutely normal after that.\n\nVery creepy...\n\nIt didn't want to share Cholita, but it was more interested in interacting with her, than guarding the door.\n\nOr, I wouldn't put it past Cholita, to have sent it there, to stop me from bugging her. Then bringing it back, to show me she has control.\n\nYou just can't find out things like that, from Cholita. \n\nShe won't talk.\n\nDid I have tolerance to them before?\n\nNo!  \n\nI used to get sleep paralysis 35 years ago, and I was absolutely sure that Satan himself was looming over the bed.\n\nI wet the bed twice!\n\nNow, it's only curious when they're around.

It just gives that impression, from memories I have of such places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They live in holes in that wall, coming out like worms leaving tubes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can learn to levitate objects by standing there, in front of a large wall of them, and pulling them out with a hand gesture (wave palm slowly in), and pushing the back with a palm movement back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to actually &amp;quot;touch&amp;quot; them, as I believed when I first tried that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does that look like Carlos&amp;#39; description?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows. You just take what you get.  There&amp;#39;s a reason Carlos banned us from reading his books anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering how many types of inorganic beings there are (multiple, we know from Carlos&amp;#39; writings), and how many entirely different bands of emanations there are (7 intersecting us), we really don&amp;#39;t know what to expect there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, the most puzzling thing of all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t limited in any way to perceiving inorganics that are of this earth, and the bands of emanations associated with our luminous shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos&amp;#39; allies come from the center of the universe!  He said so in his last books!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also Carol Tiggs saying we likely never get to see our cyclic beings as they and their world really are. For instance, if they have 4 legs there, we&amp;#39;re still only going to perceive ourselves with 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second: Silence, and running into them often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect I&amp;#39;d still be afraid of Carlos&amp;#39; allies.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The powerful one Cholita brought home (she now sort of admits it), was likely using the energy of her dreaming body to project itself.  That&amp;#39;s probably why it seemed as powerful as Carlos&amp;#39; allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went looking for it last night, during the early evening, when Cholita was still awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for Cholita&amp;#39;s double, which I never saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a &amp;quot;ghost&amp;quot; swirling around my room, like a classic cartoon of a ghost in a &amp;quot;sheet&amp;quot;, wafting around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen that before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surely that image came from Haunted House at Disneyland, where the little ghosts are swirling overhead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any appearance they have is from us, I suppose,  but can&amp;#39;t yet say for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one thing was clear, it didn&amp;#39;t have near the energy it had the first night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked over to the hallway that shows the door to Cholita&amp;#39;s room, and also the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was still a little too light to call absolute darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you learn to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; energy in darkness, you&amp;#39;re sort of cheating. You haven&amp;#39;t really gotten control over that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I gave it a try, and noticed that the floor under the door was buzzing, with black static.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only if I squinted, to further reduce the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point it bloomed into what looked like a patch of rotting seaweed, sitting on the beach.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know the way it clumps up, and looks quite creepy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was oozing out from under the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was absolute black. So black, that was impossible.  You could only see that it had thousands of small tentacles, because vague yellowish lines were showing the shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tentacles from it were flowing up, as if to warn against trying to enter her space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered that my little fairy entity had shown me golden light rays under the door, looking very much like that, but inviting instead of menacing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was, frankly, hard to believe my eyes.  It looked like a really scary movie special effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weirdest part was, I was feeling completely normal, and not in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was literally like being in a movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched for at least a minute, when Cholita gently coughed from her room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just the tiniest of a cough!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly not enough to startle me out of perfect silence (which is why I was able to see that).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The black tentacles and evil looking seaweed mass pulled back and disappeared under the door, like an octopus zipping away from a prey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The door looked absolutely normal after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very creepy...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t want to share Cholita, but it was more interested in interacting with her, than guarding the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, I wouldn&amp;#39;t put it past Cholita, to have sent it there, to stop me from bugging her. Then bringing it back, to show me she has control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just can&amp;#39;t find out things like that, from Cholita. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She won&amp;#39;t talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I have tolerance to them before?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to get sleep paralysis 35 years ago, and I was absolutely sure that Satan himself was looming over the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wet the bed twice!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;#39;s only curious when they&amp;#39;re around.  Odd.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re kind of sweet, but also a little sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect they kidnap people because they know how temporary we are.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In their world, we can live a lot longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IO don&amp;#39;t know what all the worry is about being taken to their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, we&amp;#39;re prisoners here right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we escape to &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot;, we&amp;#39;ll be prisoners of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prisoners of the inorganics couldn&amp;#39;t be all that much worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re quite affectionate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_g9pkch", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g9pkch/cholita_returns_from_dc/foykihl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1588174163.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "foxrim3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1588153755.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_g9pkch", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": " **She took on a reddish white color while in her own world.**\n\n**On my side, she was bluish purple.

Living on the streets.\n\nShe actually engaged me in a 30 second conversation, which was unusual.\n\nBut I was a bit unhappy with her. I found a spell in the yard. I mistook it for her breaking more stuff, or attacking me more.\n\nMy mistake.\n\nIt was a spell to help me. With corona virus, I've had a hard time getting someone to come fix my car tire.\n\nIt's stuck on there, and I can't remove it without risking the lug bolts.\n\nMy misunderstanding of her spell made for a bad conversation, so I went to my room and locked the door.\n\nAfter a while I became curious.\n\nDoes Cholita's dreaming double ever show up, while she's still awake?\n\nI spent the next 4 hours trying to find out.\n\nI couldn't believe how much power I had!\n\nI was embarrassed to even think about explaining it.\n\nI'd been using cellphone sunlight glitter during the day, and for the last few weeks I'd never practiced less than 5 hours a night.\n\nThe room looked like a scene from \"The Matrix\", where the entire world seems to be built from green rays of light, with text scrolling down.\n\nExcept, this was yellowish lines of light. Everywhere. No text.\n\nI just wanted to explain that the walls were made of such lines of light. Not that they actually looked like a Linux Screen Saver.\n\nIt's the only analogy I can think of, other than the final scenes where Neo goes blind.\n\nI could clearly see the walls, in my dark room.\n\nI walked around to make sure.\n\nEvery corner, every floorboard, every detail of the walls themselves, was made out of lines of yellow light.\n\nEven though the sun had not fully set, my room was pitch black.  I shouldn't have been able to see anything.\n\nBut in fact, reality was made out of those lines of yellow light.\n\nMy body too!\n\nI could see them everywhere, forming the things in the room by the way they intertwined, and gave off \"feelings\".\n\nBut not strong or painful feelings. Just the feeling that there was more there, to see.\n\nWhen I wanted to switch back to seeing purple fog,  I could do it instantly.\n\nIt was so granular, and so filled with tiny objects and scenes, that it was like being in an alien petting zoo, surrounded by so many small creatures wanting my attention that I couldn't decide what to play with.\n\nIt was pure *intent*. I could summon it at any point in space, and hook into all the worlds we have access to at that point, or hook into the \"Akashic Record\".\n\nNot that I could control it.  It was essentially random.\n\nAkashic Record is a term Carlos never used in my presence, but something from which he regularly gave lectures. I realize now, when he was doing that he had a very particular blank look, like he was seeing without his eyes.\n\nAlways gazing south east to south west.\n\nI can only assume that from looking at google maps these days, and remembering the room.  The angle at which he looked, seemed to depend on what he was wanting to find.\n\nI realized, everyone has a big misunderstanding about \"*seeing*\".\n\nIt's the same misunderstanding we have about sorcery.\n\nEveryone wants to learn it, so they can lord it over other people.\n\nGet attention. Impress your friends.\n\nGet a book deal. Finally quit that dead end job, and take your place as the magnificent person you are.\n\nIt's fatal to learning sorcery.\n\nAnd it leads to a complete misunderstanding of *seeing*.\n\n*Seeing* isn't a prank you pull on Carlos, telling him about the \"button nosed boy\", so that he'll shut up and obey.\n\nIt's not a trick to impress your friends.\n\nWe don't have to inflate it to impossible levels, so that if someone actually succeeds in *seeing* for the first time, his sorcery buddies will beat him down, saying that's not actually *seeing*.\n\nTheir egos are so entwined in their imaginings of how great they'll be, that they don't like to hear it's not nearly as unfathomable as they believe.\n\nThe Zen folks have fallen prey to that lure also.  The idea that it's beyond ordinary people to understand the magnificence of \"Zen\".\n\nAnd so they never get there.\n\n*Seeing* is just anything you see, which can't be there.\n\nOr anything you feel, or hear.\n\nThat's why it's in italics!  A warning.\n\nTrust me on this.\n\nCarlos himself asked me about my *seeing*, and verified that was in fact it.\n\nAnd we have the story of Carlos' first time, *seeing* for don Juan.\n\nHe *saw* a bunch of windows, with people behind them.\n\nHe didn't know if it was *seeing*.  Don Juan told him it was, but it was too complicated to be useful.\n\nIt takes a while to get to the core of *seeing*, enough to realize what it's like.\n\nIt takes silence too.\n\nSince private classes, mine has gotten quite powerful.\n\nIn darkness only.\n\nBut that's enough to understand it.\n\nWhen you\u2019re absolutely silent, and when you\u2019ve done that enough to put Mr. DoubleTake to bed, you can pick up on *intent*.\n\nThat\u2019s all *seeing* is. You pick up *intent*, related to something useful to you.\n\nOr not.\n\nIt can be just a random dream someone is having, or left-over *intent* from the past.\n\nYou can look any direction in a dark room, at every tiny point in the room, and there\u2019s something to *see* there.\n\nBut you MUST be absolutely silent. Any thought pulls you back to this petty world of suffering, and bullying other people for attention.\n\nThat\u2019s the mindset that keeps us from understanding what Carlos wrote about.\n\nMe, me, me.\n\nDo you guys really want to give up such power, for a crummy book deal?\n\nOr a few workshops where you can make some cash, with fictional additions to Carlos\u2019s books, the way me-too Naguals do?\n\nLast night I finally sat on the bed, waiting to see if Cholita would show up in her dreaming body.  While she was also awake.\n\nI saw her new inorganic being floating around.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t nearly as powerful. In fact, the best he could do is imitate a ghost in a sheet, flying overhead.\n\nLike they have at Disneyland just past the crystal ball.\n\nHe went around and around, near the ceiling.\n\nNot very impressive.\n\nI got the idea that maybe he\u2019d been borrowing Cholita\u2019s energy.\n\nHe was in fact the same unusual light blue color, which seemed to be burning.\n\nI looked to see if Cholita would enter. A few dreams materialized, due to my *intent* to see dreaming bodies.\n\nBut none were Cholita.\n\nI walked to the bedroom door and opened it cautiously. The hallway wasn\u2019t quite dark yet. The sun was almost down, but there was plenty of light left.\n\nI had to squint my eyes to regain some of my *seeing* ability.\n\nFrom the space under the door, leading to Cholita, I saw a dark mass of frightening tentacles, looking like seaweed on the shore, at the beach.\n\nThey were waving up menacingly, as if to warn me against entering that door.\n\nI watched for a while, not believing what I was seeing. It was like a movie effect.\n\nI remembered that my low energy inorganic seemed to do the same. When in Cholita\u2019s room, he projected rays of golden yellow light.\n\nIt was inviting!\n\nThis was a warning. Don\u2019t enter.\n\nI heard Cholita cough lightly. It sounded pretend.\n\nThe dark tentacles pulled back and fled, like an octopus fleeing a prey because something scared it off.\n\nA little like this:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y2wqkD2KVM&amp;list=PLfXLthkDjGtvOZHprUptXGRIGwIX1fgVM&amp;index=32&amp;t=2m07s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y2wqkD2KVM&amp;list=PLfXLthkDjGtvOZHprUptXGRIGwIX1fgVM&amp;index=32&amp;t=1m56s)\n\nI returned to my bed to think about it.\n\nWhy was Cholita so powerful, and yet it seemed as if she had no interest in sorcery at all?\n\nI then had a clear memory of Carlos, in private classes. I wouldn\u2019t say I was \u201creliving it\u201d, but it was much closer to that, than a simple memory.  It was *seeing*.\n\nI was standing not 3 feet from him. He was to my left, I was facing him, he was looking just past me on my right.\n\nHis eyes weren\u2019t focused.\n\nAs I recall, he\u2019d been talking intimately to at least one of the women. Like they had a topic in mind and were already discussing it.\n\nHe started to speak to the room. He hadn\u2019t been doing that for a while.\n\nHe said, \u201cWith some people, their energy body is RIGHT THERE!\u201d\n\nHe pointed to his right-hand side, and slightly back.\n\nIt was puzzling. We hadn't been discussing anything like that!\n\nHe continued to explain, although I can\u2019t recall the precise words, that our dreaming double is always out there, wandering around, lost in endless worlds.\n\nIt was nearly impossible to find it.\n\nBut with some people, on some occasions, it would return to being near their physical body.\n\nAnd if you could *see*, you could find it standing, \u201cright there!\u201d, next to them.\n\nNext to you, if you were around.\n\nI waited to hear what you should do, if you find such a being.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say. He was almost sad about it, as if finding a person like that wasn\u2019t something you could always afford to take advantage of.\n\nI got the impression, you just had to move on. Can\u2019t help them out.\n\nI realized, that\u2019s what Cholita is!\n\nSomeone who\u2019s dreaming body is, on occasion, \u201cright there\u201d.\n\nWhich means, if you live in a house with such a person, you have access to their dreaming double.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge benefit for a sorcerer. You have someone who can keep up with you.\n\nEven teach you things.\n\nAs I\u2019ve seen with Cholita, even if the Tonal is insane, the Nagual is not.\n\nIt has its own personality.\n\nSome in here can attest to that, having run into their dreaming double on occasion.\n\nIt\u2019s matter of fact, bold, confident, and a little malicious.\n\nMaybe even a prankster on occasion.\n\nBut it\u2019s not hostile.\n\nPerhaps, even if the waking version is.\n\nI have to wonder, if other women from private classes were the same.\n\nEasy to learn to interact with their double.\n\nMaybe that's one criteria Carlos used, to select people.\n\nWith their double accessible, he could tinker with them.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1588198110.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_foysaaw", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2: What&amp;#39;s up with Cholita???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I got home and saw Cholita&amp;#39;s physical presence for the first time since she returned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her hair was flopping out to the sides, and slightly sun bleached.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had a fairly dark tan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d likely been homeless the whole time she ran away.

The idea that it&amp;#39;s beyond ordinary people to understand the magnificence of &amp;quot;Zen&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so they never get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing&lt;/em&gt; is just anything you see, which can&amp;#39;t be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or anything you feel, or hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s in italics!  A warning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos himself asked me about my &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;, and verified that was in fact it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we have the story of Carlos&amp;#39; first time, &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; for don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; a bunch of windows, with people behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t know if it was &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.  Don Juan told him it was, but it was too complicated to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes a while to get to the core of &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;, enough to realize what it&amp;#39;s like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes silence too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since private classes, mine has gotten quite powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In darkness only.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s enough to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you\u2019re absolutely silent, and when you\u2019ve done that enough to put Mr. DoubleTake to bed, you can pick up on &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s all &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; is. You pick up &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, related to something useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be just a random dream someone is having, or left-over &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; from the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can look any direction in a dark room, at every tiny point in the room, and there\u2019s something to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you MUST be absolutely silent. Any thought pulls you back to this petty world of suffering, and bullying other people for attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the mindset that keeps us from understanding what Carlos wrote about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me, me, me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you guys really want to give up such power, for a crummy book deal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a few workshops where you can make some cash, with fictional additions to Carlos\u2019s books, the way me-too Naguals do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I finally sat on the bed, waiting to see if Cholita would show up in her dreaming body.  While she was also awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw her new inorganic being floating around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn\u2019t nearly as powerful. In fact, the best he could do is imitate a ghost in a sheet, flying overhead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like they have at Disneyland just past the crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He went around and around, near the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the idea that maybe he\u2019d been borrowing Cholita\u2019s energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was in fact the same unusual light blue color, which seemed to be burning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked to see if Cholita would enter. A few dreams materialized, due to my &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; to see dreaming bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But none were Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked to the bedroom door and opened it cautiously. The hallway wasn\u2019t quite dark yet. The sun was almost down, but there was plenty of light left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to squint my eyes to regain some of my &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the space under the door, leading to Cholita, I saw a dark mass of frightening tentacles, looking like seaweed on the shore, at the beach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were waving up menacingly, as if to warn me against entering that door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched for a while, not believing what I was seeing. It was like a movie effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered that my low energy inorganic seemed to do the same. When in Cholita\u2019s room, he projected rays of golden yellow light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was inviting!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a warning. Don\u2019t enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard Cholita cough lightly. It sounded pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dark tentacles pulled back and fled, like an octopus fleeing a prey because something scared it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y2wqkD2KVM&amp;amp;list=PLfXLthkDjGtvOZHprUptXGRIGwIX1fgVM&amp;amp;index=32&amp;amp;t=1m56s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y2wqkD2KVM&amp;amp;list=PLfXLthkDjGtvOZHprUptXGRIGwIX1fgVM&amp;amp;index=32&amp;amp;t=2m07s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I returned to my bed to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why was Cholita so powerful, and yet it seemed as if she had no interest in sorcery at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then had a clear memory of Carlos, in private classes. I wouldn\u2019t say I was \u201creliving it\u201d, but it was much closer to that, than a simple memory.  It was &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was standing not 3 feet from him. He was to my left, I was facing him, he was looking just past me on my right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes weren\u2019t focused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I recall, he\u2019d been talking intimately to at least one of the women. Like they had a topic in mind and were already discussing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started to speak to the room. He hadn\u2019t been doing that for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, \u201cWith some people, their energy body is RIGHT THERE!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pointed to his right-hand side, and slightly back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was puzzling. We hadn&amp;#39;t been discussing anything like that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He continued to explain, although I can\u2019t recall the precise words, that our dreaming double is always out there, wandering around, lost in endless worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was nearly impossible to find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with some people, on some occasions, it would return to being near their physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, you could find it standing, \u201cright there!\u201d, next to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next to you, if you were around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I waited to hear what you should do, if you find such a being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn\u2019t say. He was almost sad about it, as if finding a person like that wasn\u2019t something you could always afford to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the impression, you just had to move on. Can\u2019t help them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, that\u2019s what Cholita is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone who\u2019s dreaming body is, on occasion, \u201cright there\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, if you live in a house with such a person, you have access to their dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s a huge benefit for a sorcerer. You have someone who can keep up with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even teach you things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I\u2019ve seen with Cholita, even if the Tonal is insane, the Nagual is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has its own personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some in here can attest to that, having run into their dreaming double on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s matter of fact, bold, confident, and a little malicious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even a prankster on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s not hostile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, even if the waking version is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to wonder, if other women from private classes were the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easy to learn to interact with their double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&amp;#39;s one criteria Carlos used, to select people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With their double accessible, he could tinker with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g9pkch/cholita_returns_from_dc/foysaaw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1588178243.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_g9pkch", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "foy43f1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1588164832.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_g9pkch", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "So a mental standoff is as effective as a 'physical' one.

If you start having catatonic episodes, you need to go get some medicine.\n\nTo be useful here (mental illness can make superb dreamers), you'd just have to learn to control yourself.  \n\nSomething we all have to do anyway!\n\nThe saddest part for me is, I can see from your writings that you're fairly intelligent.

Usernames, other than u/danl999 's, have been anonymized:\n\n\\[*username 1*\\]:  when i gaze at puffs sometimes they take on forms like food coloring poured in water, they sort of have those currents and dissipations coming out of them. ill try to change the shape tonight\n\n\\[*username 2*\\]*:*  Hello! I was wondering if anybody would have some advice. When i lay on my back I instantly fall into a dream, its really intense. I experience a quick sensaton of falling, I have to catch my breath, and when I come to I am slightly disoriented. Because the dream is so sudden, is there any advice on stabilizing it, or making it less of a shock?\n\n\\[*username 1*\\]*:*  The sensation of falling means your AP is moving. I would say just go with it by trying to silence your mind while it happens.\n\ndanl999:  Do it daily. There's no one or two time event that's meaningful. **I'm not talking about you, but bad men use single experiences to turn themselves into gurus based on some marginal experience of magic. It's what keeps ALL other magical systems going. Doing slightly cool stuff once or twice, and then implying you can do it all the time. It's a huge problem.** To learn sorcery, you have to do that 10,000 times until you not only follow all stages, but as you fall into the dream you find passages on the sides, into which you could select another dream. , learn to alter where you end up when you are finally inside the dream. **It's the control we're after, not the experiences. You can get weird stuff with drugs, sleep depravation, or any other extreme situation.**\n\nIf it's scary and that's the complaint, start learning in here. Real old posts. Until you could explain in detail how that happens, to someone who doesn't know anything about dreaming. **Analogy: You found a micrometer on the side of a road.** Seems to be a working micrometer! Now what? That depends on whether you're interested in measuring things, or have a use for it. Otherwise, just put it back where you found it, so the next guy can see if it's useful to them. **What you don't want to do, is go to a measuring convention in Vegas, and pretend to be an expert on micrometers (and start selling them \ud83e\udd11).**\n\n\\[*username 2*\\]*:*  Thank you this was really helpful. I had a feeling it was something to do with AP just by the feeling I was getting but wasn't entirely sure. Last night I played around with it and took a different approach.

I was wondering if anybody would have some advice. When i lay on my back I instantly fall into a dream, its really intense. I experience a quick sensaton of falling, I have to catch my breath, and when I come to I am slightly disoriented. Because the dream is so sudden, is there any advice on stabilizing it, or making it less of a shock?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;username 1&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;  The sensation of falling means your AP is moving. I would say just go with it by trying to silence your mind while it happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;danl999:  Do it daily. There&amp;#39;s no one or two time event that&amp;#39;s meaningful. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m not talking about you, but bad men use single experiences to turn themselves into gurus based on some marginal experience of magic. It&amp;#39;s what keeps ALL other magical systems going. Doing slightly cool stuff once or twice, and then implying you can do it all the time. It&amp;#39;s a huge problem.&lt;/strong&gt; To learn sorcery, you have to do that 10,000 times until you not only follow all stages, but as you fall into the dream you find passages on the sides, into which you could select another dream. , learn to alter where you end up when you are finally inside the dream. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s the control we&amp;#39;re after, not the experiences. You can get weird stuff with drugs, sleep depravation, or any other extreme situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s scary and that&amp;#39;s the complaint, start learning in here. Real old posts. Until you could explain in detail how that happens, to someone who doesn&amp;#39;t know anything about dreaming. &lt;strong&gt;Analogy: You found a micrometer on the side of a road.&lt;/strong&gt; Seems to be a working micrometer! Now what? That depends on whether you&amp;#39;re interested in measuring things, or have a use for it. Otherwise, just put it back where you found it, so the next guy can see if it&amp;#39;s useful to them. &lt;strong&gt;What you don&amp;#39;t want to do, is go to a measuring convention in Vegas, and pretend to be an expert on micrometers (and start selling them \ud83e\udd11).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;username 2&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;  Thank you this was really helpful.

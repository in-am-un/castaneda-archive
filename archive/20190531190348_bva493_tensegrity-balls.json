She had a box and brought it to him.  He reached inside and showed us some dirty ball bearings. They measured 27mm, which is just over 1 inch.\n\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t remember anything he said about their usage.  All I remember is that he told us to polish them by hand, then handed out a set to everyone who was there.    And he lifted them up and down in his hand, implying that the weight was part of their usage.\n\nThey didn\u2019t come up again as far as I know.  We polished our balls, and that was the end of it. He didn't even seem interested in seeing how shiny we got them.\n\nI'd completely forgotten the following, until I got the balls out in the darkness last night, and they accidentally struck each other and made a unique clanking sound.  A shock went over me, and I remembered more about the balls.\n\nAt some point Carlos had made a comment about how great it would be if the balls were made of solid gold.    If you\u2019ve never held a solid gold coin of decent size, you may not be aware that gold is so heavy that merely holding it in your hand produces a little puzzlement. It\u2019s far heavier than our minds expect.  Carlos said something like, \"Wow, that would be incredible, wouldn't it?\"\n\nOne of the men in my \u201cfaction\u201d decided we should take up a collection, to purchase solid gold balls as a gift to Carlos.  He was backed up on the idea by a second person from my faction.\n\nMy \u201cfaction\u201d could roughly be defined as those who show up whenever asked, aren\u2019t part of the inner group, and who have, or did have before they moved to LA,  an actual job.\n\nThe job part being the key point as far as taking up a collection goes.  They went from person to person, and as I recall one even gave $500, hoping to set the bar a little higher for further donations.\n\nBut the balls were a lot more costly than that. By the time they got to me they still only had about half of what they needed.    There was talk about using a lower carat gold to make it possible, or maybe making them a little smaller.\n\nI asked why I couldn\u2019t just pay the rest so we could be done.  I got an odd look from the collector who said, \u201cSure, that would work.\u201d\n\nSomeone went to a jeweler, and they produced solid gold balls about the same size as the ones you see in the image.  I never got to hold them, so I couldn\u2019t tell you what kind of gold it was. But I suspect, it was 14K.\n\nOn the day we were to give them to Carlos, some kind of impromptu ceremony was devised and someone from my faction walked up to the front,  where Carlos seemed to already be expecting a surprise gift.  He was handed the gold balls.\n\nCarlos acted like a beloved employee who has been given a gold watch at his retirement party. He had a smile on his face, and an \"aw shucks\" posture.  He seemed to have genuine tears below his eyes.  I couldn\u2019t figure out if he was really moved, or was imitating the appropriate behavior for an old person who gets a gift of a solid gold object before he's put out to pasture.\n\nHe made some remarks, but I\u2019ve also forgotten those.  You can bet it included appropriate jokes.  And inappropriate ones too.  That was Carlos.\n\nAfter I polished my balls, I realized they would roll around and get lost, if I didn\u2019t put them into something.  I had an old Indian basket from Morongo on my shelf.  I placed them in there, and that\u2019s what you see in the image.\n\nAnd then I forgot about the balls, until a few months ago.  Someone sent me a question and I remembered that the answer might be in the balls.\n\nI tried \u201cseeing\u201d them, hoping they had an energetic link to Carlos.  But they gave off nothing.  Even in darkness they were as black as the rest of the room.  I coerced my ally into going into the basket, to see if I could lock it in there with the balls.   I put my hand over the top of the basket, and it remained in there.  I lifted my hand to see how it was getting on, and a bluish smoke emerged, with a face attached to the front of it.   It drifted off with no indication it had any interest in the balls.\n\nLast night, I got the balls out in an attempt to lure an inorganic being into taking the shape of a pumpkin.  I had a theory about the weight of the balls.\n\nI had mixed success converting the inorganic being into a pumpkin.  But  I did figure out some ways to use the balls.\n\nIf I\u2019d just tried them out decades ago, I might have been further along in knowing their potential.\n\nContinued later\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: twice\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac4ex5svtk131.jpg?width=507&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=314e1468e4452ba5f75bbe2167faf12eff06180e", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tensegrity balls", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ac4ex5svtk131": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 162, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ac4ex5svtk131.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49c3e65ba0d922f3d16866b891f47137ca4183f0"}, {"y": 324, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ac4ex5svtk131.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0248b12abf45524ad49a50df7f04923d75767b24"}, {"y": 480, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ac4ex5svtk131.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c336ce9772ca62cc0ae8fc4596933e5b3e93d904"}], "s": {"y": 761, "x": 507, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ac4ex5svtk131.jpg?width=507&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=314e1468e4452ba5f75bbe2167faf12eff06180e"}, "id": "ac4ex5svtk131"}}, "name": "t3_bva493", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/m-BF0k_kuxqCyIVI9y5e-DlRimIKFBch5FZQoQnbIE0.jpg", "edited": 1559331321.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1559322228.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day at the start of a Tensegrity class at Dance Home in Los Angeles, Carlos motioned to one of the women.

He says it\u2019s not an actual blow, but more like a glow making a dent in another glow.\n\nI know all about glows.  I can manufacture balls of blue light in darkness and propel them.  But it never occurred to me that this was what don Juan was referring to.\n\nI still don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what he meant.  But a couple of days ago I felt my assemblage point being moved, as a result of an Ally swooping near me. After the swoop, I could see it as a full sized woman walking in my room.\n\nI\u2019d coerced it into a Fairy shape on my own, but it still wasn\u2019t as real looking as a Hollywood special effect.  Without its help, I might have been permanently limited to seeing it as flat. Seeming to know what I wanted, it decided to move my assemblage point on its own. The movement caused my shoulder and head to be bumped forward a bit, just as if someone had slapped my shoulder.\n\nI got the strange idea that if I could get the ally to form a ball of light in my right hand, I could hurl it at someone and alter the dent in their luminous cocoon.\n\nIt was such an absurd idea that I decided to turn it into a not-doing exercise, and make her into an actual Jack-o\u2019-lantern, like the kind thrown by the headless horseman of Sleepy Hallow.  I had a vision of a Fairy flying onto my hand, turning into a pumpkin, and letting me propel it to move someone\u2019s assemblage point.  And it had to be perfect in every detail, including the orange color.\n\nThere are 2 problems with this idea, aside from the obvious insanity of it.\n\nFirst is getting the hypnogogic image to sit on your hand, in 3D form.  They tend to be quite flat, and follow the movement of your head.   Being 3D has more implications than width and height.\n\nThe shape isn\u2019t a big problem.  Puffs of bright glowing light, which is where hypnogogic images are most likely to form, tend to be round by the time you can see a face in them.  But the color is an issue.  Hypnogogic faces tend to be monochrome.\n\nI figured that the weight of the balls in my left hand would encourage the inorganic being to assume a more 3D form.   I had no idea what the balls were really for, but they came from Carlos.  He gave us that Ally. That might make the balls more attractive to it.\n\nAnd it might notice I wanted something weighty in my left hand, and something round in my right hand. That might encourage it to remain there and keep the correct shape for a pumpkin.\n\nFor the color, I figured I\u2019d look around and grab a patch of orange as near as possible to the pumpkin shape, and smear it on top.\n\nI got out the balls.  The basket is ideal for holding them because the opening is wide enough to fit your hand, but curves inward so that it\u2019s nearly impossible for the balls to roll out.  And it\u2019s easy to feel around for in the dark, because of the course weave.\n\nIt also prevents the balls from making annoying noises rolling around, the way they would in a plastic container.  They roll silently in the basket.  It\u2019s perfect for locating them in a dark room, and bringing them out without much commotion.\n\nI began by rolling the balls together in my hand. I\u2019ve heard some use balls like that for stress relief.  I wasn\u2019t surprised to see that rolling them caused all kinds of lights to form.  Just about any movement in darkness results in echoes of light, especially hand movements. The hand seems to be a center of power. When \u201cseen\u201d, you can often make out somewhat violent emanations, vibrating in bright yellow in the center of the palm.  The tensegrity movement to make the fingers snap can cause those to appear also, if you are silent.\n\nBut the type of light being formed by rolling the balls was a surprise.  It consisted of many bright white small dots, flying around.  They were directional, meaning they didn\u2019t follow the movement of my head.  They seemed to be alive.\n\nI tried clanking the balls together. They make a unique tinkling sound. It almost rings like a bell. If you click them together quickly, they spawn of all kinds of light. The light seems to respond to the alien sound.\n\nAs I rolled them in my hands, my palms got warm and started to glow intense purple.  The glow was stuck on my hands like florescent purple paint. I rubbed it on my leg, which continued to glow for a long while after that.\n\nI was curious about the light on my hands, and rolled the balls in the other hand, to balance it out. Then I realized, I could look through the glow between my hands, and the second attention was activated.\n\nI realized, this is the very reason Zuleica said you needed to immerse yourself in light.  The light emanates from the second attention. If you look through it, you\u2019re looking with the second attention.\n\nViewing the room through that, I could see that I was not entirely in my own room. There were ruins of an ancient civilization\u2019s stone and plaster buildings, halfway dissolved by the passage of time, arranged all around me.\n\nI was curious about the shape of the ball of light I was looking through, and separated my hands a bit. It remained, but began to swirl. As it swirled, I realized that the orange coloration I was seeking was located right behind the purple glow.  As the purple swirled, it revealed that anything behind it was glowing in an almost amber color, and had a dense looking flatness to it.  It was even better for looking through, to see in the second attention. It was amorphous, and everywhere.\n\nI saw a smear of intense orange under it, grabbed both sides, extracted it, and put it onto my right hand.  I lifted the steel balls up and down in the left hand, and the Fairy head appeared in my right, superimposed on the orange ball I had manufactured.\n\nI wanted it to be a perfect Halloween pumpkin, so I examined it closer to see how the Fairy face had been superimposed.  It was kind of like a female head was inside the pumpkin, with a cutout for the face.  She looked a little odd like that, and certainly not something you\u2019d expect to see in a real Jack-o\u2019-lantern.\n\nThere\u2019s a grumpy cat video on YouTube, where the cat has been stuffed into a full padded fabric head mask looking like a strawberry, with a cutout for his face.  My Fairy looked like she\u2019d been similarly stuffed into a pumpkin mask, including the grumpy expression.\n\nI was thinking it might have to do, when I caught a glimpse of a stem. It was definitely green.  I looked closer, but it stretched until it was at least 6 inches in diameter.  Then I realized, it was indeed a carved pumpkin, but someone had removed the top!\n\nIt had a relatively 3D appearance. I lifted my right arm far out to the right and a little up, to simulate an Ally hovering on your right.  I looked to see if the Fairy was still there, and found it had pursed its lips into a worried look, like it was preparing to be smashed.\n\nI hurled it out as if it were a volley ball being spiked.  Instead of flying at the rate my arm had thrown it, it moved slowly and got stuck in some purple haze, which it distorted into the shape into a vortex. The vortex dissipated into an even larger cloud of purple haze.\n\nI pulled my hand back and found it was stuck in the purple light, which stretched as my hand pulled. There was a dense trail of sticky purple light.\n\nThe sight was so confusing, I realized that directing the glow to precisely dent another glow would be a tall order.\n\nI began to clank the balls together, and roll them frantically in my hands, to increase the oddly warm feeling they produced. The ally returned as a puff of blue smoke, watching my hand movements. It seemed to be concentrating on what I was doing, like a parent watching a child play with a toy.  I got the impression that it wanted to help, but couldn\u2019t figure out what I was up to.\n\nAs I clanged the steel balls, I realized that the shininess and roundness of them produced a highlight, like you see in the picture.  I could still see it, even in the pitch-black room.  When I realized that, my hands began to glow so that I could even see all the details of the wrinkles on my palms.\n\nThe ally moved back.  I reached a level of silence you can\u2019t describe to anyone. I began to see the entire room even in the darkness, but it was somehow flat and the details were merely jet-black ripples.\n\nTrying to see the room in total darkness was like looking at heat ripples coming off a hot desert dry lake bed.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what it was like with the lights off. I turned them back on and everything looked normal again.\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1559333143.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_epnlqrw", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could remember the precise quote, but in Carlos\u2019 books don Juan explains the \u201cNagual\u2019s Blow\u201d.

The basket is ideal for holding them because the opening is wide enough to fit your hand, but curves inward so that it\u2019s nearly impossible for the balls to roll out.  And it\u2019s easy to feel around for in the dark, because of the course weave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also prevents the balls from making annoying noises rolling around, the way they would in a plastic container.  They roll silently in the basket.  It\u2019s perfect for locating them in a dark room, and bringing them out without much commotion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began by rolling the balls together in my hand. I\u2019ve heard some use balls like that for stress relief.  I wasn\u2019t surprised to see that rolling them caused all kinds of lights to form.  Just about any movement in darkness results in echoes of light, especially hand movements. The hand seems to be a center of power. When \u201cseen\u201d, you can often make out somewhat violent emanations, vibrating in bright yellow in the center of the palm.  The tensegrity movement to make the fingers snap can cause those to appear also, if you are silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the type of light being formed by rolling the balls was a surprise.  It consisted of many bright white small dots, flying around.  They were directional, meaning they didn\u2019t follow the movement of my head.  They seemed to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried clanking the balls together. They make a unique tinkling sound. It almost rings like a bell. If you click them together quickly, they spawn of all kinds of light. The light seems to respond to the alien sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I rolled them in my hands, my palms got warm and started to glow intense purple.  The glow was stuck on my hands like florescent purple paint. I rubbed it on my leg, which continued to glow for a long while after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was curious about the light on my hands, and rolled the balls in the other hand, to balance it out. Then I realized, I could look through the glow between my hands, and the second attention was activated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, this is the very reason Zuleica said you needed to immerse yourself in light.  The light emanates from the second attention. If you look through it, you\u2019re looking with the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Viewing the room through that, I could see that I was not entirely in my own room. There were ruins of an ancient civilization\u2019s stone and plaster buildings, halfway dissolved by the passage of time, arranged all around me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was curious about the shape of the ball of light I was looking through, and separated my hands a bit. It remained, but began to swirl. As it swirled, I realized that the orange coloration I was seeking was located right behind the purple glow.  As the purple swirled, it revealed that anything behind it was glowing in an almost amber color, and had a dense looking flatness to it.  It was even better for looking through, to see in the second attention. It was amorphous, and everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a smear of intense orange under it, grabbed both sides, extracted it, and put it onto my right hand.  I lifted the steel balls up and down in the left hand, and the Fairy head appeared in my right, superimposed on the orange ball I had manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted it to be a perfect Halloween pumpkin, so I examined it closer to see how the Fairy face had been superimposed.  It was kind of like a female head was inside the pumpkin, with a cutout for the face.  She looked a little odd like that, and certainly not something you\u2019d expect to see in a real Jack-o\u2019-lantern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a grumpy cat video on YouTube, where the cat has been stuffed into a full padded fabric head mask looking like a strawberry, with a cutout for his face.  My Fairy looked like she\u2019d been similarly stuffed into a pumpkin mask, including the grumpy expression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking it might have to do, when I caught a glimpse of a stem. It was definitely green.  I looked closer, but it stretched until it was at least 6 inches in diameter.  Then I realized, it was indeed a carved pumpkin, but someone had removed the top!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had a relatively 3D appearance. I lifted my right arm far out to the right and a little up, to simulate an Ally hovering on your right.  I looked to see if the Fairy was still there, and found it had pursed its lips into a worried look, like it was preparing to be smashed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hurled it out as if it were a volley ball being spiked.  Instead of flying at the rate my arm had thrown it, it moved slowly and got stuck in some purple haze, which it distorted into the shape into a vortex. The vortex dissipated into an even larger cloud of purple haze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled my hand back and found it was stuck in the purple light, which stretched as my hand pulled. There was a dense trail of sticky purple light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sight was so confusing, I realized that directing the glow to precisely dent another glow would be a tall order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to clank the balls together, and roll them frantically in my hands, to increase the oddly warm feeling they produced. The ally returned as a puff of blue smoke, watching my hand movements. It seemed to be concentrating on what I was doing, like a parent watching a child play with a toy.  I got the impression that it wanted to help, but couldn\u2019t figure out what I was up to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I clanged the steel balls, I realized that the shininess and roundness of them produced a highlight, like you see in the picture.  I could still see it, even in the pitch-black room.  When I realized that, my hands began to glow so that I could even see all the details of the wrinkles on my palms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ally moved back.  I reached a level of silence you can\u2019t describe to anyone. I began to see the entire room even in the darkness, but it was somehow flat and the details were merely jet-black ripples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to see the room in total darkness was like looking at heat ripples coming off a hot desert dry lake bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least that\u2019s what it was like with the lights off. I turned them back on and everything looked normal again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bva493/tensegrity_balls/epnlqrw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1559329456.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_bva493", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

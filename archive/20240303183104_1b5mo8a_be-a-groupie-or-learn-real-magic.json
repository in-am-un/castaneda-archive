People endlessly discussing things about Carlos, the witches, death, whether there are naguals out there in the wild.\n\nStuff which ought to be of no concern to anyone who actually was a fan of the books of Carlos.\n\nBecause the only real reason to be a fan, was on the off chance they were all true!\n\nWhich they were.  With some names, places, and relationships likely obscured.  And with the characters \"sanitized\" so that even ChatGPT would approve of their language.\n\n(Don Juan actually had a foul mouth and the lineages were like college sexual hazing with the coeds.)\n\nI keep thinking, maybe people come here and don't even bother to look around before they comment or post?\n\nSo I made this picture I vowed last night NOT to make,  because it's of no use to anyone who can't reach Silent Knowledge.  And besides, I used Cholita's energy, not my own.\n\nBut it is in fact quite dazzling, and that is actually what I was doing last night. \n\nSo here's the post from Facebook:\n\n\\*\\*\\* from Facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\n In Silent Knowledge you can create phantom rooms, phantom scenes, or phantom anything at all, using your \"super powers\".  \n\n\nWhich all come from the energy body!  \n\n\nYou see here an accurate representation of what I was doing for a full 15 minutes or more last night.  \n\n\nAt least, it's the best I can do in a short time with my animation tools.  \n\n\nThe energy body forms from doing tensegrity with absolutely no internal dialogue. If you glance down you can see it there. It can even form a very smooth looking ball shape, which is probably why it's possible to \"dent it\" the way the new seers advised people to do, to make it easier to walk directly into sleeping dreams while awake.  \n\n\nBut the energy body consists of independent puffs of awareness, and one just the size of a soccer ball is close enough to fully sentient to do as you wish it to do.  \n\n\nIn this case I got 3 to cling to my arm, which made a jet black region in the middle very visible.  \n\n\nIf you get the puffs to swirl or form \"edges\" into the jet blackness, you can do \"practical magic\" with that.  \n\n\nSo I converted my darkroom floor to cracked mud (didn't pick that one on purpose), used my right hand's \"puff bracelet\" to form a \"sun\" above me from \"shiny outer coating\" on the luminous egg, and with my left hand I experimented to see if the \"energy\" to the left, was more useful than the energy to the right.  \n\n\nWhich Kylie explained in one of the tensegrity videos.  \n\n\nKeep in mind, no matter how crazy the descriptions in the Tensegrity videos seem, if it was one created when Carlos was alive they are 100% TRUE.  \n\n\nMeaning, you REALLY can judge whether the energy to the left, is more useful than the energy to the right.  \n\n\nWhich is how the old seers felt about it.  \n\n\nBut despite having this much power, don't expect that things will be like cartoon magic.  \n\n\nDon't fall victim to \"The Superman Effect\" where you assume everything a seer does is perfect and he's always in control.  \n\n\nI only got to do this, because I unclogged a stopped up bathroom sink for Cholita, and she lent me a block of energy.  \n\n\nSorcery is like that for a long time.  \n\n\nWhich is why don Juan said the old seers became DESPERATE for more ways to get energy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Be a Groupie, or Learn Real Magic?",

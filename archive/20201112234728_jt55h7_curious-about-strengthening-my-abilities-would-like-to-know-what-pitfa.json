I didn\u2019t really even need to work for them, and never worked on myself either. I think life gives you lessons tailored specifically to your own flaws. And due to my own decisions I lost a lot of those things. I also think that the trend of witches and practicing magic is making a return because life/society is getting more and more uncomfortable in the country where I live. But I digress.\n\nTo mentally/emotionally handle periods of loss I\u2019ve definitely had to re-asses values, and in the beginning my internal monologue told me that I was being lazy, and that deep down the only thing that would make me happy would be that familiarity and security. I viewed this as the ego trying to preserve everything it had ever known, and since it wasn\u2019t so easy for me to obtain the same security as before I had to analyze it and figure out what was important to me. Still the ego at work there, but I think it\u2019s led me to be very critical of my environment in general, and it\u2019s not the heartening experience. \n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but is this not what you are talking about? I imagine for practical purposes in magic, it requires deeper attention to -everything- that our subconscious believes and is processing at every moment, and learning to silence that so you have more mental space/awareness for the subtle changes in your environment.

I think progression here is reward enough for the depression / dissociation / lack of interest in societal norms that I\u2019m already experiencing.

I just didn\u2019t feel that they were affecting me negatively in any way, apart from seeming to be trying to scare me quite often; it doesn\u2019t really work, I\u2019m more just fascinated by them. The whole concept of good / evil doesn\u2019t really seem relevant in the encounters I\u2019ve had so I\u2019ve struggled to understand what it was that I was experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I asked if they could be offended is because I\u2019ve tried to push their buttons before - was frustrated by how they seemed intent to pester and I tried to insult them and see what happened. In the moment what I saw one of them appear to become angry, it had some large stick or spear type thing that it liked to poke / stab me with and when I was laughing at it because it couldn\u2019t hurt me I saw it whip around super fast and train the thing directly on my neck and hold it there really menacingly... I had never seen it move so fast, which suggested some sort of consciousness to me. It felt like I had stirred something up in it. I wonder why that happened now. They do seem to like it when I attack them back though. Or at least one of the does. He claps for me when I launch particularly successful assaults. I\u2019m not sure if this is the right way to interact with them though...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as for messing things up, your basically just saying that I am the only thing holding myself back from experiencing this more fully? The idea that I could \u201cmess it up\u201d is the type of thinking that could, but aside from that it\u2019s up to me to embrace it and let it be what it is? Think that\u2019s what you mean at least. If it\u2019s up to me then it\u2019s all fair game I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_jt55h7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jt55h7/curious_about_strengthening_my_abilities_would/gc4jao3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1605243788.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gc3sfqx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1605227883.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_jt55h7", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;Can they be offended?\n\nNo. They're not human.\n\n&gt;Are there some common ways that people mess this up for themselves and regress in ability?\n\n\" Only a minute to minute relentless struggle can balance one's natural but stupefying insistence to remain unchanged. \"\n\n*Taisha Abelar*\n\n&gt;How much is \u201cspirituality\u201d wrapped up in this?\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, that type of thought is a roadblock in the beginning, and where most populist-reformed systems go wrong.

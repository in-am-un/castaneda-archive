I worked on *dreaming* many years ago, before *The Art of Dreaming* had been published (so I knew nothing of scouts). I used to work nights overseeing a halfway house. I could usually get in 4-5 hours sleep on the job. When I went home in the morning, I would usually meditate for an hour to relax and get back to sleep. The combination of light sleep (from having slept overnight) and meditation seemed ideal for lucid *dreaming.*\n\nOnce I learned to find my hands (that was all the instructions I had to go on), I had to come up with my own next step (beyond just jumping off cliffs, which I really had a thing for). I decided to focus on trying to make the dream so real that I would be able to manifest my double.\n\nThis project really started to gain steam when I became able to maintain my awareness between dreams. In other words, I would end a dream and find myself back in my sleeping body. At first, I found this to be quite frightening -- I was literally paralyzed. I would fight to wake up and often thought I had woken up only to realize that that too was a dream (like something in a horror movie).\n\nAt this point, I had to take don Juan's advice here and proceed in spite of my fear. Eventually, I got used to the sensation of being aware yet asleep and, in fact, started to see that state as more useful to my task than normal lucid *dreaming*. My idea was that, if I could \"stand up\" in my dreaming body, I would be dreaming but still in the normal world.\n\nI spent many months working along these lines. I would get up out of my sleeping body and move into the kitchen. There, I would get into a cross-legged posture and try to meditate, to draw all my being to that spot and try to \"solidify\" myself. I would touch things, smell them, do everything I could to bring all my senses to bear and make the world \"real\".\n\nOne day, I was having the strongest dream ever of this type. The morning light streaming in through the kitchen window was mesmerizing. I stood up and went over to look at it, to bathe in its glory. Suddenly, I heard a scream. At that moment, I experienced myself in 2 places: one in the kitchen and the other lying in the bed. It seemed as if I could have awakened in either, but I woke in the bed.\n\nI sat up. The woman I was with was staring at me frantically. I didn't want to tip her off in any way, as she was unfamiliar with my *dreaming* pursuits. \"What?\" I asked. She answered, \"You ... In front of the window.\" I pointed out that I had been lying in the bed and that we were sleeping on a futon far below window level. She stopped talking and something seemed to rearrange itself in her mind.

I worked on &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; many years ago, before &lt;em&gt;The Art of Dreaming&lt;/em&gt; had been published (so I knew nothing of scouts). I used to work nights overseeing a halfway house. I could usually get in 4-5 hours sleep on the job. When I went home in the morning, I would usually meditate for an hour to relax and get back to sleep. The combination of light sleep (from having slept overnight) and meditation seemed ideal for lucid &lt;em&gt;dreaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I learned to find my hands (that was all the instructions I had to go on), I had to come up with my own next step (beyond just jumping off cliffs, which I really had a thing for). I decided to focus on trying to make the dream so real that I would be able to manifest my double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This project really started to gain steam when I became able to maintain my awareness between dreams. In other words, I would end a dream and find myself back in my sleeping body. At first, I found this to be quite frightening -- I was literally paralyzed. I would fight to wake up and often thought I had woken up only to realize that that too was a dream (like something in a horror movie).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had to take don Juan&amp;#39;s advice here and proceed in spite of my fear. Eventually, I got used to the sensation of being aware yet asleep and, in fact, started to see that state as more useful to my task than normal lucid &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt;. My idea was that, if I could &amp;quot;stand up&amp;quot; in my dreaming body, I would be dreaming but still in the normal world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent many months working along these lines. I would get up out of my sleeping body and move into the kitchen. There, I would get into a cross-legged posture and try to meditate, to draw all my being to that spot and try to &amp;quot;solidify&amp;quot; myself. I would touch things, smell them, do everything I could to bring all my senses to bear and make the world &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, I was having the strongest dream ever of this type. The morning light streaming in through the kitchen window was mesmerizing. I stood up and went over to look at it, to bathe in its glory. Suddenly, I heard a scream. At that moment, I experienced myself in 2 places: one in the kitchen and the other lying in the bed. It seemed as if I could have awakened in either, but I woke in the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up. The woman I was with was staring at me frantically. I didn&amp;#39;t want to tip her off in any way, as she was unfamiliar with my &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; pursuits. &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I asked. She answered, &amp;quot;You ... In front of the window.&amp;quot; I pointed out that I had been lying in the bed and that we were sleeping on a futon far below window level. She stopped talking and something seemed to rearrange itself in her mind. All she said was , &amp;quot;Nothing,&amp;quot; and she refused to ever talk about it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some time after that, an event in my life turned my path in another direction and I never completed my quest to manifest my double.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hh4638/regarding_lucid_dreaming_iobs_defeating_fear/fw9w6if/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1593359361.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hh4638", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fw7v9um", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1593303028.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_hh4638", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Read the wiki for a while.

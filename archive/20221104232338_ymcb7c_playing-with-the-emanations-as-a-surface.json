Even Carlos believed, if we could get a few doing such things it would become easier for those on the fence to do that too.\n\nAnd then you might even have enough \"energetic mass\" to pull anyone along, as long as they actually try a little.\n\nEntire small cities back in the time of the Mayans were said to have opened up a doorway to a better world, and left this place behind.\n\nUnder the direction of a rogue sorcerer.\n\nI believe, that's what Carlos had in mind.\n\nBut never forget, this path is VERY SPECIFIC.\n\nYou CANNOT come from something else, and get to what you see in that picture.\n\nEven thinking you can use your amazing talents gained from the lucid dreaming subreddit, or from all your vast experiences astral traveling, is a total misunderstanding of what's going on here.\n\nOf what sorcery is.\n\nIf you think you'll be the exception, you're even more confused.\n\nHere's a better way to look at it.\n\nThere are an infinite number of doors to magical destinations.\n\nBut all of them, were created by the people who oopened and went through them.\n\nThey were NOT created by a \"higher power\". Not by God, not by the Buddha.\n\nJust by many people, doing the same thing, over very long periods until a path is compressed into the mountain soil.\n\nMost just \"rabbit trails\" where you can barely notice there's less plants on there.\n\nBut a few are big enough to drive your jeep over, even in the rain.\n\nMost give passage to something fairly pathetic.  \"Dead ends\" Techno likes to call them, to be more kind to those stuck believing they're real.\n\nBut they do provide enough \"weird stuff\",  such as bliss and closed eye visions, to convince their followers that the nonsensical explanations and promises they use to suck people in and steal their money,  must be real.\n\nBecause, they really do feel some magic!  And it's so hard to get even that small taste, that they're happy to flatter themselves once they get even that. Seeing as how their \"master\" said it was the ultimate accomplishment.\n\nThey have permission to brainwash themselves, and to go out and spread that delusion to others.\n\nFor cash.\n\nIt's that green line on the J curve.  The very thing that convinces angry men they reached \"enlightenment\".  And have a right to pretend to be wise and kind, while lording it over others.\n\nSome of those people truly intend to be \"good\".  But they're just not honest with themselves, and even if at first they \"FEEL IT\", soon they'll feel like shit,  like everyone else.\n\nBliss is not that big of a deal.  Ask any drug addict.\n\nZen masters are famous for turning into grumpy bastards none of the monks can stand.  But the Monks always convince themselves, it's just their own bastard of a Zen master leader, and all the others must be just fine.\n\nAfterall, the Buddha and the Dali Lama said so!\n\nJust like everyone convinces themselves that even though their family and marriage really suck, and are totally screwed up, it's just them.  That out there elsewhere, the myth of the nuclear family and \"true love\" is doing well.\n\nI don't understand why people don't just look around to see the truth, but they almost never do.\n\nIt's one reason sorcerers are dangerous to ordinary people.  If they hang out with one, at first they think the sorcery opinions on things are crazy.  They laugh it off.\n\nUnfortunately, 10 years later if the keep hanging out with a sorcerer,  they'll be able to see it themselves.\n\nTheir \"shields\" wear down and they realize they've been glossing.  And the river of shit we all live in becomes visible to them.  They might even see \"dry land\" above, on the shore.\n\nUnfortunately, in here we have to deal with people who haven't seen that yet.\n\nSo when I \"diss\" the nuclear family and true love, it offends many. Especially the women.\n\nOdd.  I suppose they didn't really listen to, or read what Carlos had to say.  I'm not changing even a tiny detail of it.\n\nBut they assume I am.\n\nThe men???\n\nWell.\n\nYou know they figured that out long ago.  That the whole married life plan is nonsense. It's built into their biology to seek out new lovers as often as possible.\n\nEinstein himself called marriage \"unnatural\".\n\nAnd it is!\n\nWe're chimps!\n\nWe're supposed to be free.\n\nWe can't live in cages, and not go insane.\n\nIt's merely big cities and overpopulation, which have forced this myth of \"Happily Ever After\" into our minds.\n\nBut the men just won't say that out loud.  What they already know, once the hormones wear off.\n\nIt would be like contradicting Cholita.\n\nIt's just not a safe thing to do!\n\nFortunately even ordinary people, and people who have \"astral traveled\" all over the universe, can find the puffs in darkness. If they actually try.\n\nBecause those are real. Unlike your other beliefs.\n\nBut the problem is, if you think you have already \"succeeded\" at some form of magic, you'll refuse to suffer enough to learn to get silent.\n\nIt really hurts!\n\nSo we're back to what don Juan said.\n\nThe people who succeed at learning sorcery, usually come from the orphans licking the plates in the outdoor restaurant down near Mexico City, where don Juan and Carlos hung out. Or perhaps up where the Yaqui wars ended, and where the bus route from LA region to Mexico ends.\n\nCarlos felt sorry for the orphans, watching them scurry over to lick all the plates clean, when there were no customers to see it.\n\nBut don Juan told him, \"Don't!\"\n\nThey have a better chance than the wealthy businessmen whose plates the kids are licking.\n\nSo even if you aren't really in the right frame of mind, you can in fact find the puffs.\n\nWealthy businessmen can find the puffs if they really try.\n\nAnd if you can find the puffs, you can move down to the red zone.\n\nTo INTENSE magic.  Shapeshifting, Spirit helpers, The dreaming Emissary teaching you endless magic.  Travel to alien worlds, for real!\n\nIt's \"enough\" for most people.\n\nBut the REALLY GOOD stuff, is twice as far away.  You have to move that assemblage point down to the bottom, and then up to the front side, above the navel on the left side of the stomach, and then all the way to the right and down an inch.\n\nYou are aligning it with that of your double. Of the dreamer you become each night.\n\nYou're gaining back an entire HALF of your energy of awareness.\n\nAnd so what do you think you can perceive, with DOUBLE the energy?\n\nWonders!\n\nKind of explains what makes a \"Nagual\" special. The even has twice that amount of energy of awareness!\n\nAnd just pass the red zone, in the orange, the double becomes somewhat visible. But you aren't yet in alignment with him.\n\nIn the deep orange zone he even becomes solid at times.\n\nAnd occasionally meddles a bit in your darkroom practice.\n\nPlus, will help you make the tensegrity work even better so you can eventually move your assemblage point all the way along the J curve in just 20 minutes.\n\nNot so amazing though.  The witches could do it in 6, and Carlos in 8 seconds.\n\nAnd to \"burn from within\" it has to be less than 2 seconds.\n\nJust my own guess from what I've accidentally experienced from time to time when it slips a whole 2 feet in an instant.\n\nHowever, there's a \"fussiness barrier\" you must pass though to go from the orange to the purple where silent knowledge resides.\n\nAnd THAT'S where, if you are still a follower of Monroe, or Buddha, or Jesus, or Lao Tsu, you are screwed.\n\nI wish I could explain, but look at the picture. How even your fingers wiggling alter the nature of reality.  Right in your face.\n\nAnd that's just the stuff I could draw quickly.\n\nReality itself is up for grabs over there.\n\nMeaning, the impressions, opinions, wants and desires you have, are included in the list of \"wiggling fingers\".  You can't just \"ignore\" your very thoughts and impressions about things.\n\nThose are like blazing spotlights, shining so brightly back on where you came from, that where you wanted to go isn't even visible anymore.\n\nYou just can't have all of that going on!\n\nOtherwise you can't manipulate the emanations gently enough to pass into silent knowledge.\n\nYou won't be allowed to pass through that door.  \n\nTo that \"choice\" offered by The Spirit.\n\nYou were warned over and over by Carlos when he wrote, \"The Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\". \n\nHe wrote that there's only a single path for us.  \n\nJust one.\n\nSo if you want to be a \"Zen Master\", go for it!\n\nThose Jedi robes are very cool!\n\nBut don't hang around here and harm others.\n\nIf you think you \"Astral Traveled\", then please do!\n\nDo it a lot.  \n\nDaily for 3 hours, like we must do for sorcery.\n\nBut don't pretend you have mastered anything, when it's just a couple of misrepresented dreams once a month. Which you lie and say are once a week.\n\nYou won't get anywhere at all, until it becomes a real ability you actually have and one you use to explore and go further.  And even if you could do that, you'd surely find it's a dead end and switch over to what we do.\n\nUnfortunately, no other system has the means to get you to that \"turning point\".\n\nTheir techniques don't work that well. So you'll never discover that you were making a big mistake.\n\nWhich is what they had in mind. Keeping everyone prisoner, with techniques that only work a tiny bit.\n\nOn purpose.  They aren't stupid enough to put themselves out of business with techniques that can take you past your own \"master\" in a few weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Playing With The Emanations As A Surface", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"5j1v4l9x80y91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdbcdc6169ed030126da6e761c7495835617f349"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1acd7df114396673fc8da443eb023a144851a69"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe5b4454eaf45e8640ac9f3bc74659ab4fb1edfd"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46ff16d20f071eb4dab604942f71478bdbf5d847"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4b7ff176ce0e37c60c21ce83cd100c7cdc42e28"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f0471f0258c5edef66300df1c99245ebe66e50d"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0401e9a2ee14fa69766d34ac3c12d63ef54a2dc9"}, "id": "5j1v4l9x80y91"}}, "name": "t3_ymcb7c", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/OwNIe6dN1MPM8EZAYrIaqq_szGXVCX7IJB3CMpKLuyY.jpg", "edited": 1667601845.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667600618.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0401e9a2ee14fa69766d34ac3c12d63ef54a2dc9\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5j1v4l9x80y91.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0401e9a2ee14fa69766d34ac3c12d63ef54a2dc9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt this could be done anywhere along the J curve but in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s so crazy out there, nothing actually stands out as unusual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do something so amazing,  there&amp;#39;s nearly no one in the entire world you can tell about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhists, Daoists, Hindus, and Magick people will only become furious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what happens when you pretend for so long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They might try to claim they had one guy who did stuff like that, but when you tell them it&amp;#39;s with your eyes open, walking around, and no meditation is involved, they&amp;#39;re stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure that sometime in the future they&amp;#39;ll try to add it on, but the success rate is going to be zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in here, it&amp;#39;s very rare for people to be able to find the time to work hard enough to get to Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Carlos explained, you have to &amp;quot;be willing to change your life style&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is, to get there as things currently stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not so sure about that later.

The witches could do it in 6, and Carlos in 8 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to &amp;quot;burn from within&amp;quot; it has to be less than 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just my own guess from what I&amp;#39;ve accidentally experienced from time to time when it slips a whole 2 feet in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;fussiness barrier&amp;quot; you must pass though to go from the orange to the purple where silent knowledge resides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And THAT&amp;#39;S where, if you are still a follower of Monroe, or Buddha, or Jesus, or Lao Tsu, you are screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could explain, but look at the picture. How even your fingers wiggling alter the nature of reality.  Right in your face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s just the stuff I could draw quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality itself is up for grabs over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the impressions, opinions, wants and desires you have, are included in the list of &amp;quot;wiggling fingers&amp;quot;.  You can&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;ignore&amp;quot; your very thoughts and impressions about things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are like blazing spotlights, shining so brightly back on where you came from, that where you wanted to go isn&amp;#39;t even visible anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just can&amp;#39;t have all of that going on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you can&amp;#39;t manipulate the emanations gently enough to pass into silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t be allowed to pass through that door.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To that &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; offered by The Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You were warned over and over by Carlos when he wrote, &amp;quot;The Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wrote that there&amp;#39;s only a single path for us.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to be a &amp;quot;Zen Master&amp;quot;, go for it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those Jedi robes are very cool!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t hang around here and harm others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think you &amp;quot;Astral Traveled&amp;quot;, then please do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do it a lot.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daily for 3 hours, like we must do for sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t pretend you have mastered anything, when it&amp;#39;s just a couple of misrepresented dreams once a month. Which you lie and say are once a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t get anywhere at all, until it becomes a real ability you actually have and one you use to explore and go further.  And even if you could do that, you&amp;#39;d surely find it&amp;#39;s a dead end and switch over to what we do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no other system has the means to get you to that &amp;quot;turning point&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their techniques don&amp;#39;t work that well. So you&amp;#39;ll never discover that you were making a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is what they had in mind. Keeping everyone prisoner, with techniques that only work a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On purpose.  They aren&amp;#39;t stupid enough to put themselves out of business with techniques that can take you past your own &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ymcb7c", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ymcb7c/playing_with_the_emanations_as_a_surface/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ymcb7c/playing_with_the_emanations_as_a_surface/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1667600618.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ive7nx3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ivcdgsh", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I always confuse La Catalina with Soledad in the books.

I don&amp;#39;t even believe it myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I clearly &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; that we&amp;#39;re stuck stationary in space, staring at silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Makes no sense at all.  Except that don Juan and Carlos both did say, humans &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; all the time. They just forget it on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can only presume that we just got into &amp;quot;loops&amp;quot; on the topic selection.  Which gives the illusion that the blue line is any different from any other level on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if for whatever reason you don&amp;#39;t get to reach as far along the J curve as you did before, those &amp;quot;loops&amp;quot; from the blue line can be carried down more abundantly than normal,  as far even as the Purple zone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surely the red too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the red, they might even manifest as your amazing Ally wearing a wonderful costume for you, but while having a frankenstein bolt in her neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looks so beautiful!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you try to appreciate it, she&amp;#39;s hideous in the small details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was a big anti-porno guy.  Said it escalates,  until you are looking at pictures of women being choked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But these days with Xhamster, it seems a little judgy.  The women seem to pose for being choked on purpose, all over Xhamster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, maybe what Carlos was really worried about, was the type of images you flood your mind with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because out at SK, those come back to haunt you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As do arguments and battles you had with petty tyrants during the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the idea that you could bring J curve magic into the recap, to materialize the memories you need to resolve, as objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deal with the objects directly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that what &amp;quot;the fliers&amp;quot; really are?

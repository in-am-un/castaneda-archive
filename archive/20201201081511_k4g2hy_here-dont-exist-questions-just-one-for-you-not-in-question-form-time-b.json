It is about \u201cdesires\u201d. \n\nAt the moment, (when you start thinking) you desire not to think. But how can you do that, if that\u2019s already a desire? \n\nSo you wanna make ya don\u2019t desire anything, without desiring, just force yourself to be silent, \u201cunforcerly\u201d catch yourself.\n\u201cOops, I started thinking.. Ahhh\u201d then not specific mind appears, but feeling, that you have some kind of desire attached to not thinking. And if thoughts (mind analysis) appears firstly, when you have this feeling - you lose:D So with this is very easy and effective to play in no time. A few moments I had been decided to even let inside my ego worst form! With this mine method of dealing with thoughts I could even stop this destructive mind. In seconds. But if for example this \u201cnow active\u201d Ego don\u2019t want\u2019s to be free, if something very very destructive happens (mind) (everyday before my awakening:) i could feel not like before, like that suicidal person. But person who is now fearless, who is capable to feel everything even in those \u201chardly to even think\u201d moments, to remember it (while letting all suffer and mind in, on purpose) \ud83e\udd73 Then I was playing with those roles:D I could bring ego, or separate all kind of \u201churt\u201d. It was more like from my Spirit it self, all this lifetime. \n\n\u201cSo basically you need to do the opposite\u201d when avoiding thinking.\nTry it, fight it, and be rewarded :D \n\nSo in this form of fighting, i forced myself to be absolutely silent for 3 months (from my first day of awakening). Everyday I coul\u2019d catch any thought, and shut it down in seconds. So I coul\u2019d do that (effectively) in any extreme situatition, in any adventure. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t had \u201cmind information\u201d (yet) about all this happiness and this stuff.. I just had strong feelings about everything, because I felt everything, you know..(i will not start \u201cquetes for beginners\u201d:D)\n\nBefore my awakening I was Not practicing meditation.\nAll of this was a moment of miracle.\n\nAt those very first days, weeks, first months.. Everyday I was fighting my mind. \nI knew one: that I was kinda starting to appreceate my Ego that I hated all the time before. I was running, and running. From my mind. And I had that strong feeling (about my mind, about my ego) that it could destroy me, those suicidal thoughts.. Until I had one of those special Lucid Drems.\nBut it was different.\n\nMy Ego\u2019s scary looking black face in front of my eyes. Just staring at me. I felt in those seconds, that this is probably the \u201cworld-upside down\u201d situation. So, [how do I react]? In that moment, I was feeling love for my old \u201cbad side\u201d, I started crying. I was not afraid at all, for such level. For the first time in my life. In the worst ever scenario, where it\u2019s just catastrofical.\n\nFrom that night, I was able to be friends with my ego. I was still watching my mind, but not that carefully, because I had so much more power. Ofc weeks passed and I gathered lots of information about it, but from my own intuition. \n\nHad those LSD experiences, nearly death moments. \n\nKnow the \u201cAngel\u2019s of death\u201d feeling\nOne night, when my all existence merged: I was feeling overpowered, had best so ever experiences in that moments. For this thing to happen it\u2019s all clear that I had to accept all the energy of absolutely everything. It just happend, all the existence throw me happened. And ofc there was an a pretty scary one (energy). My reactions for it (like a cat:D) started to work all different then ever before. Felt like I was not seeing the devil.. Not in other room or something. But like I was that devil it self. And those moments was the most happy and beautiful actually, pretty scary :D But I was able to defend myself, and accept those scary energies the way they are - in few seconds. That \u201cscary\u2019nes\u201d was like my body reflect\u2019s, first time impression. In that kind of moments it\u2019s very easy to separate your internal health and \u201cego\u201d. So for about 15 minutes I had this trip, my reactions was \u201cwoooouu\u201d like always :Dd Then I started to feel colours. Literally, all the energy.. I closed my eyes. Rainbow colours appeared one by one, slowly. First: red, 5 seconds later: yellow.. About 10 different colours in 4K hd, in those moments I felt overpowered once again. Then I had a feeling, why not PURPLE? Purple was starting to appear after 3 seconds, but until that I had a bunch of visions (that my nagual already know) - how the purple created? How all of that feeling created that I\u2019m able to feel. I always felt that colour purple is everything \ud83d\udc9c (green and red colours secret) plays a big role before those 3 seconds, until the Purple. 3 seconds passed. And I\u2019m fully - there. Everywhere. Home. I was able to feel and understand time, universe, my spirit. \n\nIt was the same end like in avatar\u2019s \u201cAn\u2019s\u201d meeting with himself, in other dimension, in everywhere, in nowhere.. At the same time. And not in time.. \nIt\u2019s that moment, when you completely let go all existence actually. Not some specific mind, specific feeling.. But everything. \nThere was all of this universe\u2019s energy, absolutely everything. Talking was no needed. Nothing was no needed, there is no time actually. (Im such a adventurous kid, that sometimes I even catch myself seeking to have a debate with other \u201cPurple\u201d God energy with people\u2019s dialogue forms like actually talking:Dd) All of that always reminds me (Low-High) \u201cform\u201d. All that \ud83d\udc9cparadise\ud83d\udc9c has everything, the sound is gorgeous.. There is just everything, it\u2019s pretty hard to put everything in specific frame. (i could tell about other not frameble frames, then you could understand it lol xd) But at the same time? Guess what? That silence. . . . So I met myself there, in all time forms, with my spirit, fully awake, I didn\u2019t have (people\u2019s perspectice dialogue) with that energy, but I gave my energy, I also received, that\u2019s what happened. I felt like in a universe\u2019s debate, where from like every point goes some kind of energy and does things, being aware, just exists. Felt like in magical place, because everything is me, now, and I\u2019m everywhere. In every truth. Literally everywhere, even now lol. I could make myself like Sayian from \u201cDragon Ball Z\u201d and change levels between in seconds, how do I feel I want :)\n\nSo, lets call this a few, of my many \u201cwith bigger names\u201d experiences. I have lot\u2019s of other cool stuff to tell about, with all tiny details. About everything. Can talk about ego shit as well, it\u2019s not that hard, for real :D Can be ur guru, as you can see, im already pissed of writing. But I want to develop my english a little bit more, also it\u2019s pretty fun to talk about this kind of stuff. To catch everytime all of that existence talking thru me. What I\u2019m searching for is beyond limits, it\u2019s in \u201cmiracle\u201d in magical way, but not that \u201cthinkable\u201dSo if you\u2019re the same, please text me. (Don\u2019t know why, I just feel) All these months I throw a very little effort and it was very me, because I mastered to \u201cnot to do, not to want, don\u2019t think, accept absolutely everything\n\n, - ALL of this just in some different moments, and realise this in every moment. Without thinking. Omg I\u2019m so sleeeeeppyyyy:D And yeah, GO CHECK OUT AVATAR\u2019S VIDEO ABOUT MANTRA\u2019S!!!!!!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/StrbppmsZJw\n\nGreetings from Lithuania, I\u2019m 20 years old. 9 months of awareness. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c\n\nI woul\u2019d like to invite people who felt the secret of green/red energy. I have a few words for ya. Ofc if you see ma first comment in subreddit hehe:3\n\nLike this is the time when I write spontaneitly. Don\u2019t have any questions. Have all the answers. Also can have answer to no answers. So think about it, feel a little. But beyond all of this, there is more. God things. So I wrote all this to express myself somehow, for fun :D You can count that I have \u201cone Quest\u201d looking like a Question. But it\u2019s not in question form. Neither in answer form. It\u2019s just some kind of light, you know. . . \ud83d\udd06\ud83e\udd70 Not only I\u2019m feeling and remembering this for myself thru my nagual, but also able to express in this \u201cskin myself\u201d my 3d life - in fastest and best way. \n\nAlso our body reactions to everything in 3D also in 5D - is amazing. Who wants to talk about anything? Didn\u2019t had \u201cchallenging\u201d debates for a period of time \ud83d\udc9c\n\nPersonality type: \nCampaigner ENFP Ne-Fi \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*************************************************\n\nFor those who seek, but are missing.\n    -    1/4/10/10800/90/15 - hey it\u2019s just numbers lol xd\n\nYou ask questions and want to hear the answers you care about. There is no point in those issues, new and new ones are emerging. Question on question. It\u2019s like the answers are something weird, but nothing changes. The more you care about something, the more questions. I ask not one but several people. And most of all, you want them to confirm your imaginations. You want to experience feelings that are pleasing to the body. But they are full of mechanics and limitations. You want to experience fullness and you are looking for something to do, you are looking for someone who can fill you. You try to cling to the created image and look for it in the environment, in passing people you look for the created eye. Everything somewhere in the imagination. You build your home there, you build the foundations of a new relationship. Creates images and smells. You became unhappy, but after all you created so perfectly, there had to be happiness of happiness, but more and more to sink into the swamp, because there was no life left in life. Legs cling, harder to walk, harder to live. In life, as pop-up ads, you are increasingly interested in games, virtual chats, pictures, new people, other countries. There was a habit of being unhappy. Life is not like that, we do it that way. Complicated and unhappy, unsolvable or difficult to solve. Be angry because not under you. And so you would like to break the past, take away all responsibilities and dive into the fantasy in which happiness alone lives. But virtuality is not a reality.\nFear breeds confusion and a desire to defend, to preserve what you have already created. Despair, because anyone can ruin your dreams, get angry. There is despair and despair. Dreams are fragile. And at the same time hardness, biting and pain are born in you. You don\u2019t want to show that it hurts, but you want to blame or hurt others, they are guilty of taking your time. They are guilty because you would already be happy. They are guilty because you would be free and do whatever you think. The more you turn to the world of your dreams, the more you suffer. Fear causes doubt, doubt causes fear.\nYou try to put life on a swing, they rise and fall. It is what rises and what descends, only good or only bad. Rises and falls. You fail to rejoice and disappoint, you fail to inhale and exhale.\nYou will be disappointed and if someone shows you the unreality of your dreams, you will diminish in the big life. You are unworthy because you do not have, fail, do not learn. Because life is just good or evil. Something nailed, something justified. Lie in lie. You don't have to, but you're lying to someone who lives a different, something, better life. Will if you paint and renovate an old dilapidated house, its interior will change ??\nHow much longer do you marry yourself behind the leash?\nIf we have developed a habit of unhappiness, why not rebuild it and invent a habit of happiness. Then you won\u2019t have to play for life. Life will be full of itself. And we are full of him \ud83d\udc9c\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t find it once you\u2019ve found it. You found it differently than you searched. Seekers are glistening with gold, exclusive, special, just for you only. You are looking for every day, every free minute, every thought, every sigh that would be like a fain with him when he fills you with love, joy and happiness. Which day, which relationship, which feelings, which future. Who, as the creator of the universe, who creates fairy tales, short stories, novels and so on, has done nothing but is very tired. You come up with many scripts, you play them all, you play them, you grind your feelings and emotions. Alternating roles from director to screenwriter, scenery, massages, foreground and foreground roles. But where are you? Rejecting all this is an uninteresting life, you don't see colors in it, it's heavy because your shoulders are bent, your hands are heavy. For the creation, it is what you were looking for, but it is just a picture in your imagination, only the shots are reflected in the clouds, washed away and disappeared. And you\u2019re unhappy over and over again, not according to you, not according to the script you created. And again you look in the passers-by, you try to look into their eyes. Sometimes it becomes uncomfortable because you see the same search, confusion, fear. Closing your eyes and going further, looking below eye level. Coins, shards of glass, sometimes hit the sun so beautifully. You stop and admire, but when the sun hides behind the cloud found the real picture and continue your search. Don't know what, don't know who. Probably to be happy. When you find what you are looking for. But can\u2019t find what you already have\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Here don\u2019t exist questions.

For this thing to happen it\u2019s all clear that I had to accept all the energy of absolutely everything. It just happend, all the existence throw me happened. And ofc there was an a pretty scary one (energy). My reactions for it (like a cat:D) started to work all different then ever before. Felt like I was not seeing the devil.. Not in other room or something. But like I was that devil it self.

So for about 15 minutes I had this trip, my reactions was \u201cwoooouu\u201d like always :Dd Then I started to feel colours. Literally, all the energy.. I closed my eyes. Rainbow colours appeared one by one, slowly. First: red, 5 seconds later: yellow.. About 10 different colours in 4K hd, in those moments I felt overpowered once again. Then I had a feeling, why not PURPLE? Purple was starting to appear after 3 seconds, but until that I had a bunch of visions (that my nagual already know) - how the purple created?

I always felt that colour purple is everything \ud83d\udc9c (green and red colours secret) plays a big role before those 3 seconds, until the Purple. 3 seconds passed. And I\u2019m fully - there. Everywhere. Home. I was able to feel and understand time, universe, my spirit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the same end like in avatar\u2019s \u201cAn\u2019s\u201d meeting with himself, in other dimension, in everywhere, in nowhere.. At the same time. And not in time.. \nIt\u2019s that moment, when you completely let go all existence actually. Not some specific mind, specific feeling.. But everything. \nThere was all of this universe\u2019s energy, absolutely everything. Talking was no needed. Nothing was no needed, there is no time actually. (Im such a adventurous kid, that sometimes I even catch myself seeking to have a debate with other \u201cPurple\u201d God energy with people\u2019s dialogue forms like actually talking:Dd) All of that always reminds me (Low-High) \u201cform\u201d. All that \ud83d\udc9cparadise\ud83d\udc9c has everything, the sound is gorgeous.. There is just everything, it\u2019s pretty hard to put everything in specific frame. (i could tell about other not frameble frames, then you could understand it lol xd) But at the same time? Guess what? That silence. . . . So I met myself there, in all time forms, with my spirit, fully awake, I didn\u2019t have (people\u2019s perspectice dialogue) with that energy, but I gave my energy, I also received, that\u2019s what happened. I felt like in a universe\u2019s debate, where from like every point goes some kind of energy and does things, being aware, just exists. Felt like in magical place, because everything is me, now, and I\u2019m everywhere. In every truth. Literally everywhere, even now lol. I could make myself like Sayian from \u201cDragon Ball Z\u201d and change levels between in seconds, how do I feel I want :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, lets call this a few, of my many \u201cwith bigger names\u201d experiences. I have lot\u2019s of other cool stuff to tell about, with all tiny details. About everything. Can talk about ego shit as well, it\u2019s not that hard, for real :D Can be ur guru, as you can see, im already pissed of writing.

You want to experience feelings that are pleasing to the body. But they are full of mechanics and limitations. You want to experience fullness and you are looking for something to do, you are looking for someone who can fill you. You try to cling to the created image and look for it in the environment, in passing people you look for the created eye. Everything somewhere in the imagination. You build your home there, you build the foundations of a new relationship. Creates images and smells. You became unhappy, but after all you created so perfectly, there had to be happiness of happiness, but more and more to sink into the swamp, because there was no life left in life. Legs cling, harder to walk, harder to live. In life, as pop-up ads, you are increasingly interested in games, virtual chats, pictures, new people, other countries. There was a habit of being unhappy. Life is not like that, we do it that way. Complicated and unhappy, unsolvable or difficult to solve. Be angry because not under you. And so you would like to break the past, take away all responsibilities and dive into the fantasy in which happiness alone lives. But virtuality is not a reality.\nFear breeds confusion and a desire to defend, to preserve what you have already created. Despair, because anyone can ruin your dreams, get angry. There is despair and despair. Dreams are fragile. And at the same time hardness, biting and pain are born in you. You don\u2019t want to show that it hurts, but you want to blame or hurt others, they are guilty of taking your time. They are guilty because you would already be happy. They are guilty because you would be free and do whatever you think. The more you turn to the world of your dreams, the more you suffer. Fear causes doubt, doubt causes fear.\nYou try to put life on a swing, they rise and fall. It is what rises and what descends, only good or only bad. Rises and falls. You fail to rejoice and disappoint, you fail to inhale and exhale.\nYou will be disappointed and if someone shows you the unreality of your dreams, you will diminish in the big life. You are unworthy because you do not have, fail, do not learn. Because life is just good or evil. Something nailed, something justified. Lie in lie. You don&amp;#39;t have to, but you&amp;#39;re lying to someone who lives a different, something, better life. Will if you paint and renovate an old dilapidated house, its interior will change ??\nHow much longer do you marry yourself behind the leash?\nIf we have developed a habit of unhappiness, why not rebuild it and invent a habit of happiness. Then you won\u2019t have to play for life. Life will be full of itself. And we are full of him \ud83d\udc9c&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t find it once you\u2019ve found it. You found it differently than you searched. Seekers are glistening with gold, exclusive, special, just for you only. You are looking for every day, every free minute, every thought, every sigh that would be like a fain with him when he fills you with love, joy and happiness. Which day, which relationship, which feelings, which future. Who, as the creator of the universe, who creates fairy tales, short stories, novels and so on, has done nothing but is very tired. You come up with many scripts, you play them all, you play them, you grind your feelings and emotions. Alternating roles from director to screenwriter, scenery, massages, foreground and foreground roles. But where are you? Rejecting all this is an uninteresting life, you don&amp;#39;t see colors in it, it&amp;#39;s heavy because your shoulders are bent, your hands are heavy. For the creation, it is what you were looking for, but it is just a picture in your imagination, only the shots are reflected in the clouds, washed away and disappeared. And you\u2019re unhappy over and over again, not according to you, not according to the script you created. And again you look in the passers-by, you try to look into their eyes. Sometimes it becomes uncomfortable because you see the same search, confusion, fear. Closing your eyes and going further, looking below eye level. Coins, shards of glass, sometimes hit the sun so beautifully. You stop and admire, but when the sun hides behind the cloud found the real picture and continue your search. Don&amp;#39;t know what, don&amp;#39;t know who. Probably to be happy. When you find what you are looking for. But can\u2019t find what you already have&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ob8_3Bgdic4JOAQc2KLvX6-MnqY_-S2ZQlbMW1m62jk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=626cb6450ffecf94766b30cb79714e6b7a193398", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ob8_3Bgdic4JOAQc2KLvX6-MnqY_-S2ZQlbMW1m62jk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c831d3ab27b24233de660ab9af01bdc3281602", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ob8_3Bgdic4JOAQc2KLvX6-MnqY_-S2ZQlbMW1m62jk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cea8903a6120a272b10b6c09248b76bdb1e384cc", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ob8_3Bgdic4JOAQc2KLvX6-MnqY_-S2ZQlbMW1m62jk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93d5ef9dc5d0cd4f06af63f53b2d29e8e2018d4a", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "eZ9xo4rWUTYZzwE2AFrn8hHj2TM8VV7Ou252Z5H_xEQ"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1a0d5e9c-6005-11ea-8472-0e86798f0183", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "k4g2hy", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ToltecElite", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/k4g2hy/here_dont_exist_questions_just_one_for_you_not_in/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/k4g2hy/here_dont_exist_questions_just_one_for_you_not_in/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1606806911.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ge92gv9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1606824225.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ge92b50", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The OP of this thread deleted their previous duplicate post, after adding some to it and making this one.

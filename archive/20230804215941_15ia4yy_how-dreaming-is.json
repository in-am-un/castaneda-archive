But shrinking too.  \n\n\nThere's some risk to educating people on what real dreaming is like.  \n\n\nLying bastards will use it to make up stuff that will be hard to tell from the real thing.  \n\n\nRight now new people are so stupid, they can't lie well at all.  \n\n\nBut we do run the risk of creating better liars.  \n\n\nI'll keep tinkering with that scene, which includes a carpet to the left for Howard and Bruce to battle it out while Carlos films them.  \n\n\nBut I suspect they might have shrunk down to a bizarre size when the fight starts.  \n\n\nMaybe even fight on a \"tilted plane\" that isn't correct for the carpet.  \n\n\nThe IOB realm is often like that for a beginner.  \n\n\nIt can have very strange perspectives going on.  \n\n\nI suppose Bruce ought to end up holding nunchakus instead of the cup. When the camera looks away and returns.  \n\n\nBy the way, for those new to my social media I do things like that fully awake.  \n\n\nNot in sleeping dreaming.  \n\n\nYou might end up having to be asleep to do that, but it's not actually how our sorcery works once you learn to get silent.  \n\n\nDon Juan didn't like the name, \"Dreaming Awake\", but couldn't do much to fight it off since the witches loved that description of it.  \n\n\nFor a purist like don Juan, it was just an exotic position of the assemblage point.  \n\n\nAnd unrelated to slumber. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How Dreaming Is", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"v5fyb3p1e5gb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 121, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec1e82a4df659ce0f83e9a9b09d43979837bb95"}, {"y": 243, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ab7490eaa72b5d5aa18a914843c243ce485dbc"}, {"y": 360, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fa3612fe5061b6cd491df9d30e744fbae88c2"}, {"y": 720, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd698ded5aa76ab4b159972e41ae3840d0003479"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1f83294e841d116d80c0dbdde72023ecc888d15"}, {"y": 1215, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a65033e84762048efb6b1771c7f219f0802b69e"}], "s": {"y": 2160, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79477ff2496b0b5aac6fa9e8ff1309bfc33b21ad"}, "id": "v5fyb3p1e5gb1"}}, "name": "t3_15ia4yy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oslLPq3vdDVDzmlLxjmxHKHQr-z4Eid4JPFECtRDIaY.jpg", "edited": 1691179487.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1691179181.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=79477ff2496b0b5aac6fa9e8ff1309bfc33b21ad\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/v5fyb3p1e5gb1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=79477ff2496b0b5aac6fa9e8ff1309bfc33b21ad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone pointed me to a bizarre cartoon showing &amp;quot;The Death of La Gorda&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy just made it up, but pretended it was based on a true story.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And proceeded to make the kinds of mistakes people who only pretend do, when thinking about inorganic beings and dreaming worlds.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve concluded, we need to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot;

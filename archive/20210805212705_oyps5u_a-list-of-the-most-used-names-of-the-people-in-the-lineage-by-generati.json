One was made up of the two westerly women, Zuleica and Zoila, Silvio Manuel, and the courier Marta. The next was composed of the southerly women, Cecilia and Delia, don Juan's courier, Emilito, and the **courier Teresa** (!).  Another household was formed by the easterly women, **Carmela and Hermelinda (?),** Vicente, and the courier Juan Tuma; and the last, of the northerly women, Nelida and Florinda, and don Genaro.\n\nAccording to don Juan, his world did not have the harmony and balance of his benefactor's.\n\nThe only two women who thoroughly balanced one another, and who looked like identical twins were the northerly warriors, Nelida and Florinda.\n\nNelida once told me in casual conversation that she and Florinda were so alike that they even had the same blood type.\n\nFor me one of the most pleasant surprises of our interaction was the transformation of Zuleica and Zoila; who had been so abhorrent.\n\nThey turned out to be, as don Juan had said, the most sober and dutiful warriors imaginable.\n\nI could not believe my eyes when I saw them again. Their mad spell had passed and they now looked like two well-dressed Mexican ladies, tall, dark, and muscular, with brilliant dark eyes like pieces of shiny black obsidian.\n\nThey laughed and joked with me about what had happened the night of our first meeting, as if someone else and not they had been involved in it.\"\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**New names:** **Marta the southerly courier/scout, Teresa the southerly courier/scout, Hermelinda &amp; Carmela.

There was a group of four independent pairs of apparent sisters who worked and lived together; another group of three men who were don Juan&amp;#39;s age and were very close to him; a team of two somewhat younger men, the couriers Emilito (Zuleica&amp;#39;s dreaming double?) and Juan Tuma; and finally a team of two younger, southerly women who seemed to be related to each other, Marta and &lt;strong&gt;Teresa (???).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At other times it could be seen as consisting of four separate households, located quite far from one another in different areas of Mexico. One was made up of the two westerly women, Zuleica and Zoila, Silvio Manuel, and the courier Marta. The next was composed of the southerly women, Cecilia and Delia, don Juan&amp;#39;s courier, Emilito, and the &lt;strong&gt;courier Teresa&lt;/strong&gt; (!).  Another household was formed by the easterly women, &lt;strong&gt;Carmela and Hermelinda (?),&lt;/strong&gt; Vicente, and the courier Juan Tuma; and the last, of the northerly women, Nelida and Florinda, and don Genaro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to don Juan, his world did not have the harmony and balance of his benefactor&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only two women who thoroughly balanced one another, and who looked like identical twins were the northerly warriors, Nelida and Florinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nelida once told me in casual conversation that she and Florinda were so alike that they even had the same blood type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me one of the most pleasant surprises of our interaction was the transformation of Zuleica and Zoila; who had been so abhorrent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They turned out to be, as don Juan had said, the most sober and dutiful warriors imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could not believe my eyes when I saw them again.

Most boys of an adventuring kind get to imagine a jungle. It's a place of power and myth. I got to live in one. No great inventions will ever come out of the jungle, no masterpieces of world art. A jungle is both a terrifying and exhilarating place to grow up, for however vivid a person's mind, nature will always outstrip his imagination...\"\n\n\"...I leave the jungle, head for Europe, later claim a home in the desert lands of the American Southwest, and I never see the boy Carlos again. What is born in the jungle can never leave. I took the shell of my adult body out to meet the best of Western Civilization, but the shell was empty. I stood before the dry achievements of the world's greatest artists and architects, I read the fruits of centuries of writers and thinkers, and I was dazed. I cannot miss the boy Carlos, for even the part of me that is capable of missing him was left behind in the jungle. I was a desiccated man left to stuff his hollow body with a desiccated culture.\"\n\n\"People asked if my teacher Don Juan really existed. Of course he did. How could I have woken up without him?...\"\n\n\"...Do you imagine it needs (12) books to say all I have to say? Do you think it cannot all be said in this conversation between ourselves? Of course it can. Each book repeats itself, and then each book repeats the other. People thrive on repetition. They are so swamped with meaningless drivel that books are like amusement parks. There's nothing to take in but they come along for the ride. I figure if I keep writing they'll take the ride for longer. Who knows, if I keep their attention for long enough they might catch a sight of the reality behind all those words.\"\n\n\"What is that reality? I call it a Separate Reality, but that of course is a lie. Reality is reality, and it's our book-reading society that is separate from it.\"\n\n\"Then I am dying, and I realize I am a fool. I have kept myself out of the public eye, but I forgot about the public imagination. Millions on millions of people know my name, and they each have an impression of me. For some I am like a god, for others a charlatan, it makes no difference. There is this gargantuan figure out there, a being called Carlos Castaneda, who is far from imaginary. He finds his source in my life and work, and is fed by the energy of the hordes.\"\n\n\"My life was passing and I screamed and cursed. People said it was the pain of cancer, but they are fools. I saw the terror of my life force being tethered forever to this puffed-up, pain-filled ghost. I die, but the distorted Castaneda of people's imaginations will live on and drag me with it. To live in the public imagination, Martin, believe me that is damnation. It is fire and brimstone. Of course I screamed and cursed.\"\n\n\"And so I have come back. How I did so, as agreed, we leave till later. Why is very simple. I have two tasks. One, to reclaim the boy Carlos as part of myself and so be free to leave this world behind.

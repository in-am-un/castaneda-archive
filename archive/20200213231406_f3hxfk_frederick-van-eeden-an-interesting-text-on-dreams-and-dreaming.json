We've absorbed it from Carlos' books, but without it we'd end up making a complicated inventory, as van Eeden has.  No map, no understanding of which way to go, what's important, and what's probably not.\n\nHe says he's identified 9 types of dreams, each of which represents a well-defined type.\n\nFirst he calls, \"initial dreams\". It seems to be a bodiless lucid dream.\n\nHe speculates that a \"true dream\" doesn't have any influence from the physical body and it's possible ailments, except that they can manifest as symbols or objects.\n\nDreams that do are his second type.  Call it a fever induced dream.\n\nHis third type are ordinary dreams. Non-lucid.\n\nThe 4th type is \"vivid dreaming\".  It's very vivid and you have quite a bit of recall on waking.\n\nPeople who write to me, and put in at least an hour a day of learning to be silent, quickly figure out that the process of getting silent produces \"vivid dreams\".\n\nIt's how you can \"save energy\". At least, the best way to do that.  The fliers stop licking you, when you're silent.\n\nI like to call these vivid dreams \"episodic\", because of the interaction of inorganic beings in those types of dreams. They love \"vividness\".  So in addition to inducing vivid dreams, it makes the inorganics get involved more, and for longer periods.  You get guest appearances of the same characters.\n\nIf you get these, make a friend as soon as possible.  They'll come back.\n\nHe often finds this type unpleasant because they give the impression they should, \"mean something\".\n\nOn other days he feels super happy all day long as a result.\n\nThat's caused by his assemblage point having been moved towards heightened awareness.  But he's not aware of that because it's outside his inventory.\n\nHis fifth is where he becomes aware of an outside intelligence arranging the dream. He says, \"I call demoniacal those phenomena which produce on us the impression of being invented or arranged by intelligent beings of a very low moral order.  \"\n\nOf course, he's adding the low moral order himself.  Inorganics don't care how you play, as long as you do.  The details are up to you.  Naked is fine by them.\n\nMy little fairy figured out I didn't like her naked (much), and typically had on an excess of flowing clothing.\n\nMyself, I kind of like the immoral dreams better!  But the shame is on him, not the demoniacal forces of darkness.\n\nHis sixth type is abstract  dreaming. He's even used that word!  He says you're focused on one thing, or person, and stuck on it.\n\nI went through a period of getting stuck in this kind of dream, and have written about it in this subreddit.\n\nI was released by Cholita, who brought me that lovely dreaming fog.  And so much to worry about regarding her, that the worries which got me stuck in dreaming before she arrived are like a day at the beach.\n\nCarlos warned about abstract dreaming in class, with the implications you can get stuck, or it can become a stumbling block unless you know about it in advance.\n\nVan eeDen's seventh type is lucid dreams.\n\nHe had an interesting idea. To sing and shout in lucid dreaming, knowing you won't actually be doing that in your sleeping body.\n\nThat'll cause a dream change, and give you more time before you lose lucidity or wake up.\n\nIt's basically a technique to redeploy energy inside the dream.\n\nAn excellent idea!\n\nHe experiences false wake-ups from his lucid dreams, where he explains the dream to a friend, then realizes he's still asleep.\n\nHe's plagued by the \"book deal mind\".\n\nIt's a serious problem when learning sorcery. Instead of learning, you're focused on how cool you'll sound when you explain what you've learned to someone else.\n\nMany people have found themselves face to face with something incredible and magical, only to start to think of how they'll explain it to someone else, at which point it vanishes and won't return.\n\nIt's like pulling out your cell phone to send a text to a friend and tell him you have God himself standing right in front of you, asking what you'd like.\n\nIt's not a good idea.\n\nI actually was in that position. Apparently it's a known thing in Carlos sorcery.\n\nHe said, \"What would you like to ask\", or some odd equivalent.\n\nI ran for my life and dove into the bathtub.\n\nHis eighth type he calls a demon-dream.\n\nHe admitted that there was a previous type with some of the same influences. That one is symbolic-dreaming, this one is a demon-dream.\n\nThe symbolic dreams will be common to anyone pursuing the 4 gates.\n\nI'd better quote him on the distinctions:\n\n\" In the symbolic dreams the sleeper is teased or puzzled or harassed by various more or less weird, uncanny, obscene, lugubrious or diabolical inventions. He has to walk in slaughter-houses or among corpses; he finds everything besmeared with blood or excrement; he is drawn into obscene, erotic or horrible scenes, in which he even takes an active part. His moral condition is utterly depraved; he is a murderer, an adulterer, etc.; in a word, nothing is too low or too horrible for such dream \"\n\n\"Now in the demon-dreams--which are always very near, before or after, the lucid dreams--I undergo similar attacks; but I see the forms, the figures, the personalities of strange non-human beings, who are doing it.\"\n\nHe's splitting hairs there.  That's the problem with an inventory.\n\nHe was simply unable to find the inorganic being in the symbolic dreams. But it was there.\n\nHis 9th type is \"wrong waking\".\n\nIt's typical.  Carlos didn't copy anything. This is just how it works, and among people who liked to criticize Carlos, you can be sure they had almost no knowledge of the topic at all.\n\nThey're stuck at the level of the inventory, with very little personal experience.  And fighting to let everyone know, their inventory is superior.  So superior, it eclipses that of even Carlos.\n\nIf they actually had some experience, they'd be delighted on reading the commonality, instead of using it to plot the demise of Castaneda.\n\nHe also describes false awakenings where you sense a presence in the room, but haven't yet realized it's a dream.\n\nThese are basically 4th gate dreams, before they're fine tuned to get you into your \"real\" room.  And inorganic beings love it when you get closer to the real world.\n\nIt's horrible to let them step from a dream into the real world with you.\n\nI'd avoid meeting them that way.  Better to conjure them in the darkness, while awake.\n\nHe concludes that these false awakening dreams are a prank played on him by demons.\n\nThey are after all, of a very low moral character.\n\nEdited", "edited": 1581709485.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fhm3ms6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s super cool that he&amp;#39;s done this,  but the article is a tediously long inventory with dubious conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He believes he can chart the unknown with just the right inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t!  That just puts limits on you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is where it becomes obvious that the map of the second attention, created by the ancient sorcerers, is quite necessary to us. We&amp;#39;ve absorbed it from Carlos&amp;#39; books, but without it we&amp;#39;d end up making a complicated inventory, as van Eeden has.  No map, no understanding of which way to go, what&amp;#39;s important, and what&amp;#39;s probably not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He says he&amp;#39;s identified 9 types of dreams, each of which represents a well-defined type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First he calls, &amp;quot;initial dreams&amp;quot;. It seems to be a bodiless lucid dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He speculates that a &amp;quot;true dream&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t have any influence from the physical body and it&amp;#39;s possible ailments, except that they can manifest as symbols or objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreams that do are his second type.  Call it a fever induced dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His third type are ordinary dreams. Non-lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 4th type is &amp;quot;vivid dreaming&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s very vivid and you have quite a bit of recall on waking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who write to me, and put in at least an hour a day of learning to be silent, quickly figure out that the process of getting silent produces &amp;quot;vivid dreams&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how you can &amp;quot;save energy&amp;quot;. At least, the best way to do that.  The fliers stop licking you, when you&amp;#39;re silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to call these vivid dreams &amp;quot;episodic&amp;quot;, because of the interaction of inorganic beings in those types of dreams. They love &amp;quot;vividness&amp;quot;.  So in addition to inducing vivid dreams, it makes the inorganics get involved more, and for longer periods.  You get guest appearances of the same characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get these, make a friend as soon as possible.  They&amp;#39;ll come back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He often finds this type unpleasant because they give the impression they should, &amp;quot;mean something&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On other days he feels super happy all day long as a result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s caused by his assemblage point having been moved towards heightened awareness.  But he&amp;#39;s not aware of that because it&amp;#39;s outside his inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His fifth is where he becomes aware of an outside intelligence arranging the dream. He says, &amp;quot;I call demoniacal those phenomena which produce on us the impression of being invented or arranged by intelligent beings of a very low moral order.  &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, he&amp;#39;s adding the low moral order himself.  Inorganics don&amp;#39;t care how you play, as long as you do.  The details are up to you.  Naked is fine by them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My little fairy figured out I didn&amp;#39;t like her naked (much), and typically had on an excess of flowing clothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I kind of like the immoral dreams better!  But the shame is on him, not the demoniacal forces of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His sixth type is abstract  dreaming. He&amp;#39;s even used that word!  He says you&amp;#39;re focused on one thing, or person, and stuck on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went through a period of getting stuck in this kind of dream, and have written about it in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was released by Cholita, who brought me that lovely dreaming fog.

Lord knows, my best friends are all demons.\n\nExcept for the witch.\n\nAnd demons can be really helpful!\n\nI truly doubt Cholita the witch,  can levitate things.\n\nCall me a skeptic, but I just don't believe our tonal body can do any magic.\n\nIt's a causality based object!\n\nI hope someone proves me wrong, but when Cholita moves something merely by looking at it, it's rather suspicious to see a golf ball sized puff of brilliant white smoke, fly up to it.\n\nA \"Little\" puff of \"Smoke\" flies right up to it?\n\nI'm pretty sure, Cholita is cheating.\n\nBut there's no way to find out.\n\nShe can move something right in your face and if you ask how all she says is, \"That never happened.\"\n\nOk...\n\nPerhaps there is something to not talking openly so there's no risk of kidnappings?\n\nAnd it's true, Cholita is gone.  Someone took her.\n\nBut I wish the magic that never happened to Cholita, would never happen to me.\n\nThe truth is, the double is where the *real* magic comes from.  When you aren't \"cheating\" by using demons to assist you,  that is.\n\nBut it's sort of disappointing.\n\nOf course you can do magic in your dreams!\n\nAnd I suppose, if you got your dream personage to walk out of the dream, and into your bedroom, you might expect, he can still do magic!\n\nHe just did.\n\nThat's passing the 4th gate.\n\nBut \"doing magic\" using the double, is a little like pretending you're a tough kid in the elementary school playground, when in fact you just give your lunch money to the biggest kid for \"protection\".\n\nHe's the tough one.\n\nSo, you never quite get to be Superman.\n\nBut you can be \"Robin\" if you stick around this place, and work hard.\n\nIt'll have to do.\n\nAnd your double is in fact going to want that lunch money...\n\nOr, you'll have to work it off instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the link in the comment:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmi3bwhhn6781.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbe94a39af472b92c632ad54d1ce445dc7eda2ea\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Old Ways?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Lineage"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"stzc3p1h46781": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 158, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stzc3p1h46781.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d329dcc75920b3e26cc59ca10108098c0a92da6"}, {"y": 317, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stzc3p1h46781.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e69bbcbeade3a95d6f2ab9e05c4518810d0a7fde"}, {"y": 470, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stzc3p1h46781.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3c466e2940b9753259510a0ad4bdcdd88356b9"}], "s": {"y": 861, "x": 586, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stzc3p1h46781.jpg?width=586&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cb14f2d4aab1cb6d9d1642e468e06a8987945a4"}, "id": "stzc3p1h46781"}, "rmi3bwhhn6781": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 161, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rmi3bwhhn6781.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac84d9660c268bbf04cb6c97d5345c3a193414d4"}, {"y": 322, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rmi3bwhhn6781.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cd85f78885f7a874dfa51d577de83b0241d5ff1"}, {"y": 478, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rmi3bwhhn6781.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec3d79c87cf64fcd73eb9ea7e443c9488eaa4503"}], "s": {"y": 650, "x": 435, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rmi3bwhhn6781.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbe94a39af472b92c632ad54d1ce445dc7eda2ea"}, "id": "rmi3bwhhn6781"}}, "name": "t3_rmgdga", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Lineage", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3IoGm-qVERwZxTQpjk0qGUA5vfFX57lOQB4-mt8zK1w.jpg", "edited": 1640217615.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1640211710.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/stzc3p1h46781.jpg?width=586&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1cb14f2d4aab1cb6d9d1642e468e06a8987945a4\"&gt;What we&amp;#39;re really doing, in the darkroom.

It was a big basket, around 2 feet in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Took some effort to rip it into perfect pieces like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She never told me why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_rmgdga", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rmgdga/old_ways/hptbucj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640358500.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_rmgdga", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hpr2fja", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hpr2ed6", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rmgdga/old_ways/hpr2fja/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hpr2fja", "created": 1640307258.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1640307258.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hpr2ed6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "qbenzo928", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1640307243.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_rmgdga", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_cy0bxv1n", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I feel like I can \"feel\" that statuette there...feels strong.

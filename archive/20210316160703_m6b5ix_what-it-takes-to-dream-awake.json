Bliss is like fog, it&amp;#39;s everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly I&amp;#39;ve been calling it, &amp;quot;intent bliss&amp;quot;, because it&amp;#39;s localized, and more intense than meditation bliss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, it can also be a general feeling of happiness and mystery, like you would assume a Yoga master felt all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest, you can, &amp;quot;Zoom&amp;quot; through the abstract, and come out in another time and place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like a concrete link between things, whereas &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; is more of specific consciousness, pushing around reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think the abstract is conscious, the way we understand that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to prepare for fun, learn to get Fairy to sit on your hand, or at the least, be a face on your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then move into far heightened awareness, until you can materialize little dreams in the air, and learn how to send her in.  Like a &amp;quot;scout&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There a passage in the new Eagle&amp;#39;s gift forward, that someone asked about in the Six Explanatory Propositions.

concept if you are fixated on believing in solid matter and space.\n\nWhich aren't necessarily real if you consider how there's only the emanations, and awareness to flow into them.\n\nOur reality is an illusion created by the reliability of a specific group of emanations, to behave in a way you can learn about.\n\nNot completely different than physicists discovering all the fine particles which make the universe work, and then discovering all sorts of very bizarre things about how they behave.\n\nThat they aren't actually located in space at a single point in a given time, or that they might alter their location or behavior just because they were observed.\n\nI don't like it when weird cults use science to justify their bizarre claims.\n\nYou can end up with some weird theory on why the saint of Dzogchen has such an attention seeking Hitleresque moustache.\n\nBut, physics it is good in this case for explaining how you can get used to the results of a system you can't yourself perceive directly, and confuse the results with what's actually going on.\n\nSo as it turns out when you stretch a puff like that, and if you want to shapeshift, the direction you travel along it can

road, stretching across your darkroom around waist high.\n\nOr don't flip it up. Just flatten it with your hands once it's stretched.\n\nThen you can either walk along and touch the dirt where you want to shapeshift, or jump up on it and walk along the direction you want to go.\n\nYou can even leave the room if you are on a \"puff highway\".  The walls open with tunnels around the road.\n\nUnfortunately, now that I told you about it you're tainted with the book deal mind.\n\nSo NEVER pursue some magic you hear about in here, until you've seen things just as cool in the same region of the J curve.\n\nIf you \"pursue\" it,  you'll fail.

Even at a fixed location of the assemblage point, you could probably extract 10,000 &amp;quot;phantom variations&amp;quot; on reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic is more like having a swarm of stubborn agitated fairies floating around your head, and not particularly happy with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v6fo49tzqw0c1.png?width=575&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bd972b3e2f529bd45157d9d3944e7010158803b6\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/v6fo49tzqw0c1.png?width=575&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bd972b3e2f529bd45157d9d3944e7010158803b6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you can perfect your behavior until the swarm of fairies isn&amp;#39;t totally annoyed by you, you might be able to lure one of them to help you out with some magic, once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if she sees you smile while helping you, obviously enjoying making use of her power, she might be inclined to do that for you on your command.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More likely is that you&amp;#39;ll get random fairies from the swarm deciding to mess with  you once in a while.  So while learning magic, it&amp;#39;s just one random magical event after the other and not as often as you&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With you having no control over what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for stalking, don&amp;#39;t obsess over that. It&amp;#39;s totally misunderstood in our community, so that if you read what someone has to say about it on social media you&amp;#39;re almost certainly reading lies made up by someone on an ugly ego trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stalking is something that&amp;#39;s easy to pretend, and no one can call you out on it, unless they have very advanced knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s popular with the lazy attention seeking crowd among us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best way we have at this time, to learn stalking, is through darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_17wuuxc", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17wuuxc/how_do_you_shapeshift/k9ms2oy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1700226804.0, "media_metadata": {"v6fo49tzqw0c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 83, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6fo49tzqw0c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6ef10f6bb3c383b1443b7c901044321d047d7c1"}, {"y": 166, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6fo49tzqw0c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bfef95a73dfc6ca66368ac579f9b040ea1d9b4e"}, {"y": 245, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6fo49tzqw0c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab3b8b17dc54f70c8793ab2fdcb2cea4a0c7ee3"}], "s": {"y": 442, "x": 575, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6fo49tzqw0c1.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd972b3e2f529bd45157d9d3944e7010158803b6"}, "id": "v6fo49tzqw0c1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1700226804.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k9kgfm4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Brilliant_Draw9334", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k9jtxvi", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_k6vvk10ej", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "thank you.

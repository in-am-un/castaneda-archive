A quasi asleep form, slightly similar to what meditation does.\n\nMen have no womb, so they can't use that.\n\nWhen I say \"fast\", I mean, gets them into their double and allows shared dreaming, visiting other worlds, and maybe even gets some visits from my own Allies.\n\nWithout permission...\n\nBut spirits aren't bad.\n\nOur \"Inorganic beings\" are merely what Buddha saw in the \"Fire Kasina Texts\" with his 4 dancing girls in blue dresses.\n\nThat was actually a single entity.\n\nMy witch friend Cholita found one like that somewhere out there.\n\nShe likes to wander around on trains.\n\nDresses up sexy, and catches a sleeper train to thousands of miles away.\n\nBrings back spirits.\n\nThat one she brought to me, which pretended to be 4, I named \"Mystery\".\n\nShe put it into my room as a prank, but I liked it.

They live in a different time zone to us.\n\nBut they don't come with nametags and \"bios\", so you have to figure out what's up with them on your own. Or if you get lucky, they'll teach you in spoken words.\n\nBy learning to see them over, and over, and over again, you get to understand them a little better.\n\nThe Jewish Prophets had inept left over shamanism from north africa.\n\nThey were barely able to see spirits at all.\n\nSo when they did, they believed what they saw the first time since they were lucky to ever get a second viewing.\n\n\"Lucifer\" was one they saw.  And it tricked them with a story about being the most powerful dark angel in the heavens, in a battle with God himself.\n\nThey'd also seen God, but not enough times to understand what it really is.\n\nIn fact, they could have ordered \"Lucifer\" to turn into a kitten, and it would have obeyed them eagerly.\n\nBut they were inept.\n\nAnd we got 4 \"world religions\" from their mistakes.\n\nMagic done once,  or even \"rarely\" is nearly worthless.\n\nIt has to become a daily affair, with no exceptions.\n\nA baby who stands up once, doesn't learn to walk from that.\n\nHas to stand and fall daily, before it can hobble along.", "edited": 1668887767.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ix0ey8p", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to see a woman engage in &amp;quot;puffery&amp;quot; and move her assemblage point to the &amp;quot;purple station&amp;quot; at the end of this map Carlos left us.

A quasi asleep form, slightly similar to what meditation does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men have no womb, so they can&amp;#39;t use that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot;, I mean, gets them into their double and allows shared dreaming, visiting other worlds, and maybe even gets some visits from my own Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without permission...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But spirits aren&amp;#39;t bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;Inorganic beings&amp;quot; are merely what Buddha saw in the &amp;quot;Fire Kasina Texts&amp;quot; with his 4 dancing girls in blue dresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was actually a single entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My witch friend Cholita found one like that somewhere out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She likes to wander around on trains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dresses up sexy, and catches a sleeper train to thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brings back spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That one she brought to me, which pretended to be 4, I named &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She put it into my room as a prank, but I liked it.  Still have it after a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very old spirit.  At least 3 billion years old in my judgement.  By comparison to known others given to us by our teacher Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very old, and very &amp;quot;slow&amp;quot; too. They live in a different time zone to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they don&amp;#39;t come with nametags and &amp;quot;bios&amp;quot;, so you have to figure out what&amp;#39;s up with them on your own. Or if you get lucky, they&amp;#39;ll teach you in spoken words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By learning to see them over, and over, and over again, you get to understand them a little better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Prophets had inept left over shamanism from north africa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were barely able to see spirits at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when they did, they believed what they saw the first time since they were lucky to ever get a second viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lucifer&amp;quot; was one they saw.  And it tricked them with a story about being the most powerful dark angel in the heavens, in a battle with God himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d also seen God, but not enough times to understand what it really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, they could have ordered &amp;quot;Lucifer&amp;quot; to turn into a kitten, and it would have obeyed them eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they were inept.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we got 4 &amp;quot;world religions&amp;quot; from their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic done once,  or even &amp;quot;rarely&amp;quot; is nearly worthless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to become a daily affair, with no exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A baby who stands up once, doesn&amp;#39;t learn to walk from that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has to stand and fall daily, before it can hobble along.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_yzgd3l", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yzgd3l/why/ix0ey8p/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668887419.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1668887419.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ix0a8n6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "abc2jb", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ix04mce", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_14bmw6", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "absurd cover governor fine depend busy lavish scary file chubby\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "edited": 1709237775.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ix0a8n6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;absurd cover governor fine depend busy lavish scary file chubby&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was mass deleted and anonymized with &lt;a href=\"https://redact.dev\"&gt;Redact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_yzgd3l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yzgd3l/why/ix0a8n6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668885414.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1668885414.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ix04mce", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ix047tp", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That's fine.

Not being able to forge genuine, deeply felt, and loving connections to what's immediately around you in this moment, is less than what it means to be human... a living being with free will and innocently expressed desires moment to moment.\n\nWhat appears to be magic is just the exploration of our \"abilities\", through touching reality with a truly raw, innocent mind and an unburdened heart. You find that, given the absence of determined interference in your will to explore this realm of intention and freely felt connectedness, it comes to you as easily and quickly as breathing. Because it is truly as natural as breathing. It is free will combined with a knowingness of what you want, and the personal empowermemt to try and get it, when you can stand up out of insecurity and shame and self fighting and ingrained patterns of your existence, a strung out judgemental perception.\n\nSociety just shits all over that degree of freedom, of open minded connectedness and self love, because it has a hard on for control, forced understanding, communal perception, and the highly manipulative and usually unfair logical determination of events. Not to mention the strong *\"advisement\"* of SELF control, and a socially enforced framework on someone's degree and color of personal expression, so that we have a usable heiarchy of merit, confidence, artifical sense of belonging and perceived social worth, and so that shame, blame and judgement remain useful weapons of control over others. This is basically how the social sphere functions now, and so we get depression, prejudices and confusion on a mass scale, because now people don't know themselves and can't see the crazy shit all around them, simply because they genuinely don't want to, mostly because they truly believe it'll make them an outcast, \"crazy\" or overwhelmed, feel too bad around others or know too much, do too much and \"fuck up\" or what have you. \n\nThe fear of death and social destruction, the buddying up with insecurity, but then also the attachment to what could make a person \"good\" or \"better\" to gain perceived social standing or self-worth (in a slightly different way, being a positive reward), is usually the main driver for the avoidance of, or obsession with, the real energies and awarenesses we want to touch all around and within us.

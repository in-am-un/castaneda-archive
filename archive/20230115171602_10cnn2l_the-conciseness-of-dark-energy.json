Both facebook and the advanced subreddit.\n\n\\*\\*\\* From facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nWritten by Carlos:\n\nDon Juan was old, and yet he wasn't old at all. He was ages younger than I. He was free from encumbering thoughts and habit patterns. He was roaming around in incredible worlds. He was free, while I was imprisoned by heavy thought patterns and habits; by petty and futile considerations about myself, which I felt on that occasion for the first time weren't even mine.\n\nI asked don Juan on another occasion something that had been bothering me for a long time. He had stated that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico had discovered the magical passes as some sort of hidden treasure placed in storage for man to find. I wanted to know who would put something like that in storage for man. The only idea that I could come up with was derived from Catholicism. I thought of God doing it, or a guardian angel, or the Holy Spirit.\n\n\"It is not the Holy Spirit,\" he said, \"which is only holy to you because you're secretly a Catholic. And certainly it is not God; a benevolent father as you understand God. Nor is it a goddess; a nurturing mother watching over the affairs of men as many people believe to be the case.\n\n\"It is rather an impersonal force that has endless things in storage for those who dare to seek them. It is a force in the universe; just as light and gravity are forces. This impersonal force is an agglutinating factor; a vibratory force that joins the conglomerate of energy fields that human beings are into one concise, cohesive unit. This vibratory force is the factor that doesn't allow the entrance or the exit of energy from the luminous ball.\n\n\"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico,\" he went on, \"believed that the performance of their magical passes was the only factor that prepared and led the body to the otherworldly verification of the existence of that agglutinating force.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI assured don Juan that I did not want the inorganic beings' world no matter what advantages it offered. My statement seemed to please him to no end.\n\n\"You are ready then for one final statement about that world. The most dreadful statement I can make,\" he said, and tried smile, but did not quite make it.\n\nDon Juan searched in my eyes, I suppose for a glimmer agreement or comprehension. He was silent for a moment.\n\n\"The energy necessary to move the assemblage points of sorcerers comes from the realm of inorganic beings,\" he said, as if he were hurrying to get it over with.\n\nMy heart nearly stopped. I felt a vertigo and had to stomp my feet on the ground not to faint.\n\nDon Juan went on, \"This is the truth, and the legacy of the old sorcerers to us. They have us pinned down to this day. This is the reason I don't like them. I resent having to dip into one source alone. Personally, I refuse to do it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOnly don Juan was hungry. Carol remarked with a touch of anger that he was eating like a pig. Quite a few heads turned in our direction on hearing don Juan's laughter.\n\nIt was a warm night. The sky was clear. There was a soft, caressing breeze as we sat down on a bench in the Paseo Alameda.\n\n\"There is a question that's burning me,\" Carol said to don Juan. \"We didn't use awareness as a medium for traveling, right?\"\n\n\"That's true,\" don Juan said and sighed deeply. \"The task was to sneak by the inorganic beings, not be run by them.\"\n\n\"What's going to happen now?\" she asked.\n\n\"You are going to postpone stalking the stalkers until you two are stronger,\" he said. \"Or perhaps you'll never accomplish it. It doesn't really matter: If one thing doesn't work, another will. Sorcery is an endless challenge.\"\n\nHe explained to us again, as if he were trying to fix his explanation in our minds, that in order to use awareness as an element of the environment, dreamers first have to make a journey to the inorganic beings' realm. Then they have to use that journey as a springboard, and, while they are in possession of the necessary dark energy, they have to intend to be hurled through the medium of awareness into another world.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from the advanced subreddit \\*\\*\\*\n\nThere's a point in the books when Carlos has the same fears many have on hearing that without the \"dark energy\" of the inorganic beings sorcerers cannot move their assemblage points the way sorcerers do.\n\nIt's a reasonable argument to say that's why other magical systems fail to get beyond the green line on the J curve.\n\nThere are of course \"intent gifts\". \"Previews\" of magic beyond your current ability which \"the spirit\", a force of intelligence arising from the emanations themselves, bestows on those who are exploring to help them go in the direction they have chosen.\n\nThat in itself is a fascinating topic. Why does \"the spirit\" help a religious fanatic see what their religion tells them they should see? Even if it's only the result of the collective visualizations of it's followers, creating a phantom reality.\n\nThe answer to that is in this post, but I can't afford to point it out. You'll have to surmise it yourself.\n\nBut I will point out that each religion's followers will swear on their own mother's life that they REALLY DID...\n\nTalk to Jesus\n\nSee God is all about love and has a purpose for everyone\n\nSee that Allah provides 49 virgins to the faithful who die in holy battle\n\nSee how Guru Dev is still with us, and has an astral plane we can visit to commune with him\n\nAny one of those might be convincing, if it weren't that there are dozens. And none of them agree with each other.\n\nAll perceive demons. Angels, spirits.\n\nThat they all seem to have in common.\n\nBut Lucifer was never spotted in all of Asia, until the Christians started going there to convert people.\n\nThey saw Shiva, Agni, or those cute Japanese Tengu demon figures tied to dying after wrongdoing.\n\nEndless different \"bad demons\" and good spirits have been seen by the world's religions.\n\nSo you can toss out \"eye witnesses\" as being of any use if you want to understand reality.\n\nAnd that right there, is the very thing we ought to research.\n\nNot what anyone saw, but why. And how.\n\nSo that you can see it yourself.\n\nAnd not once or twice.\n\nThere's a passage in the bible where one of the kings gets greedy and is complaining to God that he ought to deserve more visions.\n\nMore prophetic dreams in his case.\n\nGod answers that he got two! And that's one more than most others got!\n\nWhich tells you a lot about the prophets of other systems.\n\nThey're very lame. But like all bad players they don't want others to know they can't repeat the things they wrote about.\n\nThey saw it once, or once and a half, but when they tell the story they don't point that out.\n\nThey let you assume exactly what everyone believes about magic and the exploration of reality.\n\nThat once you can do something you have \"learned\" to do that, and it's now yours.\n\nBut that ignores the why and how of seeing such things.\n\nWhich is the second reason you need to see those things for yourself, so you can figure out what's really going on.\n\nNot just to familiarize yourself with Lucifer.\n\nOr Agni. Or whatever king of evil a religion has.\n\nBut rather, to familiarize yourself with how they did it, to see that it's really just the same as we do but in a more confused fashion.\n\nSilence the internal dialogue, or distract it with a substitute.\n\nThat's pretty much how everyone sees spirits.\n\nIt's that \"substitute\" that makes it confusing, because there can be so many.\n\nA mantra! Just replace your internal dialogue with \"Aing... Aing...\" and you are doing it Maharishi's way.\n\nReplace your internal dialogue with bible verses, and you are doing it the Pope's way.\n\nPuzzle over some pointless Zen Koan, and you are not only doing it the \"Zen Master\" way, but also gratifying your ego which will grow to gigantic proportions when you move into the green zone as a result of changing your internal dialogue to something else, and get bliss and visions while you ponder the \"answer\" you found.\n\nContrast that with listening to Native American drum beats done around a nice campfire, and you can see the insidiousness of how you can manipulate people with the green zone effects.\n\nBliss, visions, and lame explanations for how you got those.\n\nUnless you are a student of **how and why,** you'll never see through it.\n\nThe how is a great help towards realizing your religion is not the best or the only true one, or even one that makes any sense at all.\n\nBut the why...\n\nThat's something they don't ever see.\n\nAnd all we care about.\n\nThose emanations and the way in which our awareness flows out into them.\n\nAs a student of how and why, you go exploring.\n\nBut best if you do that while moving around, so you can remove the possibility of falling asleep and misrepresenting what happened as being a spiritual event.\n\nWe dream every night. Endlessly.\n\nYou can't pick and choose dreams to build your own ego puffing verification of a religious delusion you picked up.\n\nHow about the dream where your little brother stole your lunch snacks?\n\nWhere you don't realize, you aren't a kid any more.\n\nOr the one where you aren't even in the dream, and are watching an episode of Star Trek. Except that somehow you're the captain. Despite not being in the dream as an actual separate being.\n\nThe double, who is half of our energy of awareness, does the same thing we do all day long.\n\nIt flows it's awareness into the dark sea of emanations, to see what echos back.\n\nWhich reality emerges.\n\nThe difference between us as physical beings, and the double as nothing but awareness, is that we're tied to a particular point of view.\n\nA particular range of reality.\n\nThe double is not.\n\nSo you want to avoid mixing up results, with ordinary dreams motivated by waking obsessions.\n\nAnd the best way to do that is not to go to sleep. Or not to even close your eyes.\n\nAnd just to make sure involve yourself in some physical activity, like Tensegrity.\n\nSo you're in the darkroom doing your tensegrity forms in silence, to reduce thoughts about our normal reality.\n\nBecause as sorcerers we know the \"why\". The emanations and the assemblage point.\n\nOr at least at first we've been told a \"why\" that took thousands of years on the part of the Olmec seers to figure out.\n\nWhereas other religions never bothered with that why. Their why was to get money, to perpetuate the religion.\n\nOnce money was invented the world was doomed to an endless flow of bad beliefs. Perpetuated by religious politics and greed.\n\nAs sorcerers you could say, you do Tensegrity in silence in order to insure that your thoughts of your normal reality don't keep flowing yoru awareness into the same old emanations.\n\nInto the same old position of the assemblage point up at the shoulder blades, which glows in order to produce our normal view of the world.\n\nLet me add that within that view there are 20,000 possible variations. Up at that blue line on the J curve. But those are not particularly pleasant or calming to experience, compared to staying in the middle on that line and not shifting too far horizontally to access those other 20,000 variations.\n\nMaybe because in those others you are still \"you\". So whether you shift to the right due to a high fever, or shift to the left because you won the lottery, or dreamed that Jesus spoke to you, it's still just \"you\".\n\nBut that's just me theorizing.\n\nAnd some day, I'm pretty sure that exploring in \"depth\" along the J curve, trying to stay in the middle to make it go more easily, will give us the control to explore the horizontal shifts too.\n\nThe distance along the J curve is around 6 feet, whereas the distance horizontally is only 1 foot. And at all depths of the 6 feet there's 1 foot to explore horizontally.\n\nSo it stands to reason that exploring in depth is a wiser strategy.\n\nBut you have to get rid of that internal dialogue, or your thoughts will continue to shine your awareness into the baseball sized portion of the emanations passing through that place up at your shoulders.\n\nAnd as awareness flows back into your ordinary view of the world you won't be able to get your assemblage point to move downwards. Towards the green and red zones.\n\nFor an absolute beginner, pretend we're talking about drilling into ice to get \"core samples\".\n\nMaybe you're in Alaska on a giant iceberg, and you know that 10 feet down is 100,000 years ago. That's when that ice got formed on the iceberg.\n\nSo you drill a \"core\" using a special huge ice drill that's hollow, and you slide out the very long piece of ice which you can map out.\n\nAt the start is now, at 5 feet down is 50,000 years ago and so on.\n\nAnd you want to know how much nitrogen was in the atmosphere at those points in time.\n\nSo you cut out a baseball sized chunk of that 100 foot long ice pole from somewhere in the middle, and test that.\n\nIt tells you what was happening as far as nitrogen goes, at that depth in time, along the rod of ice.\n\nOur assemblage point moves like that testing the baseball chunk sized portion at any point along the J curve, to sample the reality there.\n\nBut we sample without needing a long slow test.\n\nOur very being can detect what we want to know about each location. We perceive it directly.\n\nAs an altered reality.\n\nWe get to live for a while in each location.\n\nThe real problem is how to get that baseball sized glow to move down? To sample deeper regions of the icey unused emanations.\n\nAnd you have to do that by focusing your awareness on those emanations. And not on the ones up at the top.\n\nOur baseball sized glowing assemblage point is not \"stretchy\" at our experience level.\n\nIf something put at the top on the J curve is glowing with our own awareness, but also something from down below in the green zone is glowing, the assemblage point will be stuck.\n\nLike having a big chain tied to the bumper of your car in the driveway, when you want to leave.\n\nIf the chain is stronger than your car engine, you aren't going anywhere.\n\nWe need to stop focusing our awareness on our thoughts of our normal reality, and instead move them to focusing downwards.\n\nFor that we made the J curve map, complete with pictures. To show you the kinds of things to look for in the darkness, while doing tensegrity.\n\nCarlos decided to tell us stories for each tensegrity form, and count on Intent to help us move our assemblage points to make the story come true.\n\nWhich might have worked if people had kept the story in mind, and done the tensegrity in silence.\n\nBut no one did. Except maybe Kylie.\n\nKeep in mind, there's genius in the method that Carlos had expected to work. He just ran out of time to nag us to keep working hard.\n\nSo it failed.\n\nAnd we have to resort to pictures, and darkness.\n\nTo find sights to perceive, where we were taught none could exist.\n\nOr that if they did exist, that meant you were \"broken\". Crazy, because you are seeing a demon right there, in front of you.\n\nOr because you have been infected by the Prince of Darkness, who wants to add you to his collection of lost souls.\n\nOur normal reality will do anything to pull us back, because it's cozy for them if everyone they know sticks around until they die. No one wants to be alone. And the more who surround your dying bed, the more successful you are considered by our current socialization.\n\nWhich becomes a barrier to practicing. That believe that trying to escape means you are \"broken\".\n\nAt one point you'll realize there really is a demon waiting for you there in the darkness.\n\nBut if you go off to visit with it you are slowly moving away from the coziness of your ordinary life. And people will say bad things about you.\n\nAlso it's scary out there, in sorcerer's realms.\n\nIt gets scarier and scarier as you go along until you mutate into something less \"human\".\n\nWe're stuck between forces at the top pulling us back, which includes our own insecurities, and the amazing sights of the \"unknown\" available down below.\n\nAnd there again is part of the genius of Tensegrity.\n\nIt gives you \"something to do\", while you are heading off into the scary unknown.\n\nTo see the amazing sights.\n\nThe \"something to do\" helps you forget about how \"uncozy\" it gets as you move down.\n\nBut for most, it's still a stalemate.\n\nBetween the internal dialogue chain tied to your bumper, and the power of your car engine.\n\nThank goodness for towing services!\n\nThe inorganic beings can hook their own chain to the front bumper and pull you in the direction your car engine is trying to go.\n\nWarning: They tend to pull you the direction they want. But it's only a small deviation from the direction we want to go, so it's an acceptable price.\n\nAnd like a car stuck in a dip on a muddy road, the inorganic beings can pull you up and out so that you can start moving on your own.\n\nOr to continue the first analogy, overcome that chain tieing you to your home.\n\nAnd you can feel when it snaps!\n\nYou move down to the green zone and bliss becomes palpable. You can even get goosebumps the first few times.\n\nBecause you know you're moving!\n\nBut the feeling is so welcome that you look back to the chain on the bumper. To see how others might \"feel\" about what you just did.\n\nAnd focusing your awareness on it, on that internal dialogue chain, makes it strong again and it yanks your car back into the driveway.\n\nI guess it's a magical chain.\n\nSo let me explain. Your awareness looks back at the chain because it flows into your memories of it.\n\nOf all the things in your internal dialogue.\n\nThe glow of that baseball sized chunk up at the top, is the chain. Not of the assemblage point, but rather the glow of those emanations you perpetually call \"reality\".\n\nYou're trying to make it glow below, into new realities.\n\nBut the assemblage point can't stretch into a line yet. The way sorcerers learn to do as their last task.\n\nSo even with an inorganic being helping out, if you \"look back\" you will stop moving.\n\nOr worse be pulled back entirely.\n\nWithout the inorganic being, you don't have anything \"concise\" to look at.\n\nThe puffs are pieces of that dreaming double being I mentioned before. The one you try to avoid dipping into, during meditation. To avoid falling asleep, so you don't dive into his random madness of endless dreams and call that \"proof\" of some made up magical system.\n\nFortunately while we're awake and still possess some \"reason\", he's very useful.\n\nBecause to view his energy \"puffs\" you have to move at least to the green line. And to see them vividly down to the red.\n\nWe don't quite know the \"why\" of that part, but we live it everyday. You have to put the conscious mind to sleep in order to activate the double's dreams.\n\nBut perceiving a glow is nowhere near as powerful as perceiving a real spirit, right there in front of you.\n\nBecause it's still too vague. Or lacking in strong meaning.\n\nA puff of purple swirling is nowhere near as powerful of an image, as a tiny fairy standing on your hand, smiling at you.\n\nOr a gigantic demon with its mouth wide open, rotten teeth bared, obviously ready to bite you in half any second now.\n\nA \"glowing puff of purple\" can't compete with a visible spirit for pulling your attention in that direction.\n\nBut where did that little Fairy actually come from?\n\nIt's a \"puff\" from a third being that has no organic body but shares reality with us.\n\nIt's not from you. It's not from your double.\n\nIt's from a separate being, wanting to help you. An \"Ally\".\n\nSome live here on our planet but some come from distances so far away we can't even imagine such a thing.\n\nThey live so long they're like old seers would have become, after millions of years of practicing continuously.\n\nAnd they can reach out to make emanations glow just below where your assemblage point is located, as long as you can get it even slightly into their range.\n\nWhich is at that green line.\n\nThey will hook their little chain to your assemblage point and tug it along by making emanations lower down your back glow with their own awareness, so that you can notice it and focus your own awareness there too.\n\nYou are then both focusing awareness into that version of reality, and if you don't really mess up and turn around to look back (which you WILL due to the fright of seeing a spirit), they can tow you along.\n\nIt's tempting to think you can simply \"eat\" one of their exotic puffs, sent to you from so far away.\n\nSo that you don't have to actually be threatened by a giant demon.\n\nAnd I suppose you can. Because you can also get that \"concise\" dark energy from women.\n\nBut I have no idea what that means. It's a fact, but not very useful unless you can surround yourself with women.\n\nWhich Carlos did.\n\nBut that's actually a lot more work than just calling the inorganic being towing service to help you move your car out of the mud.\n\nThey hook a glowing chain to you. The emanations in that downward direction.\n\nTo help you overcome the chain pulling you back. Your internal dialogue, thinking thoughts about that reality up there at the shoulder blades.\n\nIf you succeed in removing those thoughts you get to travel along the J curve and see the sights.\n\nThe tensegrity helps because it stimulates them to be more visible.\n\nIt stores the memory of having seen some exciting and new part of the unknown, during specific locations in the tensegrity moves.\n\nDone in silence of course.\n\nSo that the tensegrity itself becomes like the \"road\" you are moving along.\n\nAnd you now recognize sights along that road leading further and further away from your home.\n\nBecause of the Tensegrity, while seeing those sights along the depth of the J curve you are \"doing\" something.\n\nYou aren't sitting still with your eyes closed.\n\nYou're moving. Engaging in activity.\n\nAnd so \"activity\" becomes associated with those sights, which only exist further down along the J curve road.\n\nYou come to \"expect\" that as you finish a turn in the tensegrity long form, a specific sight comes into view.\n\nIt becomes very much like driving off along an unknown road, to see the sights.\n\nWhich are amazing enough to help you not think about back home and returning there.\n\nThere's a lot more here than can be explained with words. And I can't afford to make good picture of it.\n\nBut we could do more with an animation.\n\nCarlos gave us stories. To paint a picture in our mind.\n\nBut he always used pictures too. To lure you to read his books. The pictures are on the covers.\n\nAnd later, he even got some painted by his inner circle.\n\nSo there's nothing wrong with pictures.\n\nHe just wasn't enough of an artist to make an entire illustrated \"Tales of Power\".\n\nHe had to rely on stories to paint a picture in your mind.\n\nWhich was unreliable. Most men reading his books came up with an image of themselves being cheered on by other people, on account of their \"magic man\" status.\n\nThey pictured themselves with a red headband on like Rambo, who shoots arrows as well as any Native American ever did.\n\nCaros was unable to implant the \"scenery of the unknown road\" into our minds.\n\nMost just thought up new ways to be even more cozy back at home.\n\nBut we can fix that with animations. And we don't have to be artists these days.\n\nThe computer takes care of the drawing part.\n\nNot to mention, when the cartoons show real magic you can't pretend, the men who normally picture themselves playing \"Shaman Teacher\" will clearly realize they are not.\n\nBecause they can't do that.\n\nWhereas with the books of Carlos there were \"some\" things they could do.

Both facebook and the advanced subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** From facebook ***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Written by Carlos:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan was old, and yet he wasn&amp;#39;t old at all. He was ages younger than I. He was free from encumbering thoughts and habit patterns. He was roaming around in incredible worlds. He was free, while I was imprisoned by heavy thought patterns and habits; by petty and futile considerations about myself, which I felt on that occasion for the first time weren&amp;#39;t even mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked don Juan on another occasion something that had been bothering me for a long time. He had stated that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico had discovered the magical passes as some sort of hidden treasure placed in storage for man to find. I wanted to know who would put something like that in storage for man. The only idea that I could come up with was derived from Catholicism. I thought of God doing it, or a guardian angel, or the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is not the Holy Spirit,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;which is only holy to you because you&amp;#39;re secretly a Catholic. And certainly it is not God; a benevolent father as you understand God. Nor is it a goddess; a nurturing mother watching over the affairs of men as many people believe to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is rather an impersonal force that has endless things in storage for those who dare to seek them. It is a force in the universe; just as light and gravity are forces. This impersonal force is an agglutinating factor; a vibratory force that joins the conglomerate of energy fields that human beings are into one concise, cohesive unit. This vibratory force is the factor that doesn&amp;#39;t allow the entrance or the exit of energy from the luminous ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The sorcerers of ancient Mexico,&amp;quot; he went on, &amp;quot;believed that the performance of their magical passes was the only factor that prepared and led the body to the otherworldly verification of the existence of that agglutinating force.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assured don Juan that I did not want the inorganic beings&amp;#39; world no matter what advantages it offered. My statement seemed to please him to no end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You are ready then for one final statement about that world. The most dreadful statement I can make,&amp;quot; he said, and tried smile, but did not quite make it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan searched in my eyes, I suppose for a glimmer agreement or comprehension. He was silent for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The energy necessary to move the assemblage points of sorcerers comes from the realm of inorganic beings,&amp;quot; he said, as if he were hurrying to get it over with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart nearly stopped. I felt a vertigo and had to stomp my feet on the ground not to faint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan went on, &amp;quot;This is the truth, and the legacy of the old sorcerers to us. They have us pinned down to this day. This is the reason I don&amp;#39;t like them. I resent having to dip into one source alone. Personally, I refuse to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only don Juan was hungry. Carol remarked with a touch of anger that he was eating like a pig. Quite a few heads turned in our direction on hearing don Juan&amp;#39;s laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a warm night. The sky was clear. There was a soft, caressing breeze as we sat down on a bench in the Paseo Alameda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is a question that&amp;#39;s burning me,&amp;quot; Carol said to don Juan. &amp;quot;We didn&amp;#39;t use awareness as a medium for traveling, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s true,&amp;quot; don Juan said and sighed deeply. &amp;quot;The task was to sneak by the inorganic beings, not be run by them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s going to happen now?&amp;quot; she asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You are going to postpone stalking the stalkers until you two are stronger,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Or perhaps you&amp;#39;ll never accomplish it. It doesn&amp;#39;t really matter: If one thing doesn&amp;#39;t work, another will. Sorcery is an endless challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He explained to us again, as if he were trying to fix his explanation in our minds, that in order to use awareness as an element of the environment, dreamers first have to make a journey to the inorganic beings&amp;#39; realm. Then they have to use that journey as a springboard, and, while they are in possession of the necessary dark energy, they have to intend to be hurled through the medium of awareness into another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** from the advanced subreddit ***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a point in the books when Carlos has the same fears many have on hearing that without the &amp;quot;dark energy&amp;quot; of the inorganic beings sorcerers cannot move their assemblage points the way sorcerers do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a reasonable argument to say that&amp;#39;s why other magical systems fail to get beyond the green line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are of course &amp;quot;intent gifts&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Previews&amp;quot; of magic beyond your current ability which &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot;, a force of intelligence arising from the emanations themselves, bestows on those who are exploring to help them go in the direction they have chosen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That in itself is a fascinating topic. Why does &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; help a religious fanatic see what their religion tells them they should see? Even if it&amp;#39;s only the result of the collective visualizations of it&amp;#39;s followers, creating a phantom reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer to that is in this post, but I can&amp;#39;t afford to point it out. You&amp;#39;ll have to surmise it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I will point out that each religion&amp;#39;s followers will swear on their own mother&amp;#39;s life that they REALLY DID...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talk to Jesus&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See God is all about love and has a purpose for everyone&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See that Allah provides 49 virgins to the faithful who die in holy battle&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See how Guru Dev is still with us, and has an astral plane we can visit to commune with him&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any one of those might be convincing, if it weren&amp;#39;t that there are dozens. And none of them agree with each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All perceive demons. Angels, spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That they all seem to have in common.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Lucifer was never spotted in all of Asia, until the Christians started going there to convert people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They saw Shiva, Agni, or those cute Japanese Tengu demon figures tied to dying after wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Endless different &amp;quot;bad demons&amp;quot; and good spirits have been seen by the world&amp;#39;s religions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can toss out &amp;quot;eye witnesses&amp;quot; as being of any use if you want to understand reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that right there, is the very thing we ought to research.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not what anyone saw, but why. And how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you can see it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a passage in the bible where one of the kings gets greedy and is complaining to God that he ought to deserve more visions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More prophetic dreams in his case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God answers that he got two! And that&amp;#39;s one more than most others got!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which tells you a lot about the prophets of other systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re very lame. But like all bad players they don&amp;#39;t want others to know they can&amp;#39;t repeat the things they wrote about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They saw it once, or once and a half, but when they tell the story they don&amp;#39;t point that out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They let you assume exactly what everyone believes about magic and the exploration of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That once you can do something you have &amp;quot;learned&amp;quot; to do that, and it&amp;#39;s now yours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that ignores the why and how of seeing such things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is the second reason you need to see those things for yourself, so you can figure out what&amp;#39;s really going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not just to familiarize yourself with Lucifer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Agni. Or whatever king of evil a religion has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But rather, to familiarize yourself with how they did it, to see that it&amp;#39;s really just the same as we do but in a more confused fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence the internal dialogue, or distract it with a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty much how everyone sees spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s that &amp;quot;substitute&amp;quot; that makes it confusing, because there can be so many.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A mantra! Just replace your internal dialogue with &amp;quot;Aing... Aing...&amp;quot; and you are doing it Maharishi&amp;#39;s way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Replace your internal dialogue with bible verses, and you are doing it the Pope&amp;#39;s way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Puzzle over some pointless Zen Koan, and you are not only doing it the &amp;quot;Zen Master&amp;quot; way, but also gratifying your ego which will grow to gigantic proportions when you move into the green zone as a result of changing your internal dialogue to something else, and get bliss and visions while you ponder the &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; you found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with listening to Native American drum beats done around a nice campfire, and you can see the insidiousness of how you can manipulate people with the green zone effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bliss, visions, and lame explanations for how you got those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you are a student of &lt;strong&gt;how and why,&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;#39;ll never see through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The how is a great help towards realizing your religion is not the best or the only true one, or even one that makes any sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the why...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s something they don&amp;#39;t ever see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all we care about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those emanations and the way in which our awareness flows out into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a student of how and why, you go exploring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But best if you do that while moving around, so you can remove the possibility of falling asleep and misrepresenting what happened as being a spiritual event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We dream every night. Endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t pick and choose dreams to build your own ego puffing verification of a religious delusion you picked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about the dream where your little brother stole your lunch snacks?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you don&amp;#39;t realize, you aren&amp;#39;t a kid any more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the one where you aren&amp;#39;t even in the dream, and are watching an episode of Star Trek. Except that somehow you&amp;#39;re the captain. Despite not being in the dream as an actual separate being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double, who is half of our energy of awareness, does the same thing we do all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It flows it&amp;#39;s awareness into the dark sea of emanations, to see what echos back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which reality emerges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference between us as physical beings, and the double as nothing but awareness, is that we&amp;#39;re tied to a particular point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A particular range of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you want to avoid mixing up results, with ordinary dreams motivated by waking obsessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the best way to do that is not to go to sleep. Or not to even close your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just to make sure involve yourself in some physical activity, like Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re in the darkroom doing your tensegrity forms in silence, to reduce thoughts about our normal reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because as sorcerers we know the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot;. The emanations and the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or at least at first we&amp;#39;ve been told a &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; that took thousands of years on the part of the Olmec seers to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas other religions never bothered with that why. Their why was to get money, to perpetuate the religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once money was invented the world was doomed to an endless flow of bad beliefs. Perpetuated by religious politics and greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As sorcerers you could say, you do Tensegrity in silence in order to insure that your thoughts of your normal reality don&amp;#39;t keep flowing yoru awareness into the same old emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into the same old position of the assemblage point up at the shoulder blades, which glows in order to produce our normal view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me add that within that view there are 20,000 possible variations. Up at that blue line on the J curve. But those are not particularly pleasant or calming to experience, compared to staying in the middle on that line and not shifting too far horizontally to access those other 20,000 variations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe because in those others you are still &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. So whether you shift to the right due to a high fever, or shift to the left because you won the lottery, or dreamed that Jesus spoke to you, it&amp;#39;s still just &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just me theorizing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some day, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that exploring in &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; along the J curve, trying to stay in the middle to make it go more easily, will give us the control to explore the horizontal shifts too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The distance along the J curve is around 6 feet, whereas the distance horizontally is only 1 foot. And at all depths of the 6 feet there&amp;#39;s 1 foot to explore horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it stands to reason that exploring in depth is a wiser strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to get rid of that internal dialogue, or your thoughts will continue to shine your awareness into the baseball sized portion of the emanations passing through that place up at your shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as awareness flows back into your ordinary view of the world you won&amp;#39;t be able to get your assemblage point to move downwards. Towards the green and red zones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For an absolute beginner, pretend we&amp;#39;re talking about drilling into ice to get &amp;quot;core samples&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;re in Alaska on a giant iceberg, and you know that 10 feet down is 100,000 years ago. That&amp;#39;s when that ice got formed on the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you drill a &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; using a special huge ice drill that&amp;#39;s hollow, and you slide out the very long piece of ice which you can map out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the start is now, at 5 feet down is 50,000 years ago and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you want to know how much nitrogen was in the atmosphere at those points in time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you cut out a baseball sized chunk of that 100 foot long ice pole from somewhere in the middle, and test that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It tells you what was happening as far as nitrogen goes, at that depth in time, along the rod of ice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our assemblage point moves like that testing the baseball chunk sized portion at any point along the J curve, to sample the reality there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we sample without needing a long slow test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our very being can detect what we want to know about each location. We perceive it directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an altered reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get to live for a while in each location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real problem is how to get that baseball sized glow to move down? To sample deeper regions of the icey unused emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you have to do that by focusing your awareness on those emanations. And not on the ones up at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our baseball sized glowing assemblage point is not &amp;quot;stretchy&amp;quot; at our experience level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If something put at the top on the J curve is glowing with our own awareness, but also something from down below in the green zone is glowing, the assemblage point will be stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like having a big chain tied to the bumper of your car in the driveway, when you want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the chain is stronger than your car engine, you aren&amp;#39;t going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to stop focusing our awareness on our thoughts of our normal reality, and instead move them to focusing downwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that we made the J curve map, complete with pictures. To show you the kinds of things to look for in the darkness, while doing tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos decided to tell us stories for each tensegrity form, and count on Intent to help us move our assemblage points to make the story come true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which might have worked if people had kept the story in mind, and done the tensegrity in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one did. Except maybe Kylie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, there&amp;#39;s genius in the method that Carlos had expected to work. He just ran out of time to nag us to keep working hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we have to resort to pictures, and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To find sights to perceive, where we were taught none could exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that if they did exist, that meant you were &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot;. Crazy, because you are seeing a demon right there, in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or because you have been infected by the Prince of Darkness, who wants to add you to his collection of lost souls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our normal reality will do anything to pull us back, because it&amp;#39;s cozy for them if everyone they know sticks around until they die. No one wants to be alone. And the more who surround your dying bed, the more successful you are considered by our current socialization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which becomes a barrier to practicing. That believe that trying to escape means you are &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point you&amp;#39;ll realize there really is a demon waiting for you there in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you go off to visit with it you are slowly moving away from the coziness of your ordinary life. And people will say bad things about you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also it&amp;#39;s scary out there, in sorcerer&amp;#39;s realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets scarier and scarier as you go along until you mutate into something less &amp;quot;human&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re stuck between forces at the top pulling us back, which includes our own insecurities, and the amazing sights of the &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; available down below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there again is part of the genius of Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gives you &amp;quot;something to do&amp;quot;, while you are heading off into the scary unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To see the amazing sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;something to do&amp;quot; helps you forget about how &amp;quot;uncozy&amp;quot; it gets as you move down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for most, it&amp;#39;s still a stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between the internal dialogue chain tied to your bumper, and the power of your car engine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness for towing services!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic beings can hook their own chain to the front bumper and pull you in the direction your car engine is trying to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warning: They tend to pull you the direction they want. But it&amp;#39;s only a small deviation from the direction we want to go, so it&amp;#39;s an acceptable price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And like a car stuck in a dip on a muddy road, the inorganic beings can pull you up and out so that you can start moving on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to continue the first analogy, overcome that chain tieing you to your home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can feel when it snaps!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You move down to the green zone and bliss becomes palpable. You can even get goosebumps the first few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you know you&amp;#39;re moving!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the feeling is so welcome that you look back to the chain on the bumper. To see how others might &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; about what you just did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And focusing your awareness on it, on that internal dialogue chain, makes it strong again and it yanks your car back into the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#39;s a magical chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let me explain. Your awareness looks back at the chain because it flows into your memories of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of all the things in your internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The glow of that baseball sized chunk up at the top, is the chain. Not of the assemblage point, but rather the glow of those emanations you perpetually call &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re trying to make it glow below, into new realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the assemblage point can&amp;#39;t stretch into a line yet. The way sorcerers learn to do as their last task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So even with an inorganic being helping out, if you &amp;quot;look back&amp;quot; you will stop moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or worse be pulled back entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without the inorganic being, you don&amp;#39;t have anything &amp;quot;concise&amp;quot; to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs are pieces of that dreaming double being I mentioned before. The one you try to avoid dipping into, during meditation. To avoid falling asleep, so you don&amp;#39;t dive into his random madness of endless dreams and call that &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; of some made up magical system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately while we&amp;#39;re awake and still possess some &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot;, he&amp;#39;s very useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because to view his energy &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; you have to move at least to the green line. And to see them vividly down to the red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t quite know the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; of that part, but we live it everyday. You have to put the conscious mind to sleep in order to activate the double&amp;#39;s dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But perceiving a glow is nowhere near as powerful as perceiving a real spirit, right there in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s still too vague. Or lacking in strong meaning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A puff of purple swirling is nowhere near as powerful of an image, as a tiny fairy standing on your hand, smiling at you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a gigantic demon with its mouth wide open, rotten teeth bared, obviously ready to bite you in half any second now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;glowing puff of purple&amp;quot; can&amp;#39;t compete with a visible spirit for pulling your attention in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But where did that little Fairy actually come from?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;puff&amp;quot; from a third being that has no organic body but shares reality with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not from you. It&amp;#39;s not from your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s from a separate being, wanting to help you. An &amp;quot;Ally&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some live here on our planet but some come from distances so far away we can&amp;#39;t even imagine such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They live so long they&amp;#39;re like old seers would have become, after millions of years of practicing continuously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they can reach out to make emanations glow just below where your assemblage point is located, as long as you can get it even slightly into their range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is at that green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They will hook their little chain to your assemblage point and tug it along by making emanations lower down your back glow with their own awareness, so that you can notice it and focus your own awareness there too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are then both focusing awareness into that version of reality, and if you don&amp;#39;t really mess up and turn around to look back (which you WILL due to the fright of seeing a spirit), they can tow you along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s tempting to think you can simply &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; one of their exotic puffs, sent to you from so far away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you don&amp;#39;t have to actually be threatened by a giant demon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I suppose you can. Because you can also get that &amp;quot;concise&amp;quot; dark energy from women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I have no idea what that means. It&amp;#39;s a fact, but not very useful unless you can surround yourself with women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s actually a lot more work than just calling the inorganic being towing service to help you move your car out of the mud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They hook a glowing chain to you. The emanations in that downward direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help you overcome the chain pulling you back. Your internal dialogue, thinking thoughts about that reality up there at the shoulder blades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you succeed in removing those thoughts you get to travel along the J curve and see the sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity helps because it stimulates them to be more visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It stores the memory of having seen some exciting and new part of the unknown, during specific locations in the tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Done in silence of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that the tensegrity itself becomes like the &amp;quot;road&amp;quot; you are moving along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you now recognize sights along that road leading further and further away from your home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of the Tensegrity, while seeing those sights along the depth of the J curve you are &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t sitting still with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re moving. Engaging in activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so &amp;quot;activity&amp;quot; becomes associated with those sights, which only exist further down along the J curve road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You come to &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; that as you finish a turn in the tensegrity long form, a specific sight comes into view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It becomes very much like driving off along an unknown road, to see the sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which are amazing enough to help you not think about back home and returning there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot more here than can be explained with words. And I can&amp;#39;t afford to make good picture of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we could do more with an animation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave us stories. To paint a picture in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he always used pictures too. To lure you to read his books. The pictures are on the covers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And later, he even got some painted by his inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just wasn&amp;#39;t enough of an artist to make an entire illustrated &amp;quot;Tales of Power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had to rely on stories to paint a picture in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was unreliable. Most men reading his books came up with an image of themselves being cheered on by other people, on account of their &amp;quot;magic man&amp;quot; status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They pictured themselves with a red headband on like Rambo, who shoots arrows as well as any Native American ever did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caros was unable to implant the &amp;quot;scenery of the unknown road&amp;quot; into our minds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most just thought up new ways to be even more cozy back at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can fix that with animations. And we don&amp;#39;t have to be artists these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The computer takes care of the drawing part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, when the cartoons show real magic you can&amp;#39;t pretend, the men who normally picture themselves playing &amp;quot;Shaman Teacher&amp;quot; will clearly realize they are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas with the books of Carlos there were &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; things they could do. Like pretend to be impeccable. Write a journal. Pretend to disrupt routines. Or pretend to be a stalker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cartoons can make people more aware that there&amp;#39;s a very specific road to the unknown that is available to them. But that to explore it you have to keep moving in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And look for magical sights along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "10cnn2l", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10cnn2l/the_conciseness_of_dark_energy/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/10cnn2l/the_conciseness_of_dark_energy/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1673799362.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_10cnn2l", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j4k3f4b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1673852489.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j4ixa4k", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's not that hard to learn to visibly see it, and switch over to it.  \n\nWhy not try?\n\nI live with a witch who is fully capable of being out in the yard, and in the kitchen at the same time.\n\nI've long since had to give up on caring about weirdness like that.\n\nAnd who's double doesn't care about locked bedroom doors.

Even traditional ones like Buddhism have a hostile attitude (in general) towards women.\n\nNot here.\n\nIt's the men we'd rather see killed.

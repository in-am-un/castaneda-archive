I think in a sense we want to die. So it happens, encouraged to \"be that way\" for all the reasons you described and more. A whole lot of \"ways of being\" and feeling, and very strong and persistent worldviews, that naturally make death preferable to sustaining this body that doesn't know how to transform and be free, feel free, and see reality more clearly, so death feels like that freedom, release, completion. And being surrounded by hundreds of thousands of humans who \"know\" they're going to die, while NOT yourself \"knowing\" you're going to die, is incredibly fearful, cold and isolating and other terribly large feelings we dont have words for. So the ordinary path and story may naturally be preferable. \n\nFor a sorceror it gets tricky. If you genuinely want to be immortal, and you sincerely intend it, you'll find in you what wants that, and why, it will grow to take up stake in existence, and find its path. If it's genuinely larger or more energetic than the parts that are planning to die basically, your life will go down that road, and whatever happens happens. \n\nVery elementary way to put it, but idk how else to describe the living of life. What do you want and why? You can get it, it's just a matter of the conditions at hand and what else in you doesn't sincerely want/intend that, and why, basically, where it comes from. I dont think it's possible to genuinely want something impossible, much like its probably impossible to be attracted to someone you're simply not attracted to. If the energy and resonance is there, if the intent carries, it's possible. It's just that we lack the perfection and internal \"evenness\" (silence) necessary to take many things as far as we genuinely want to - and without forgetting or displacing it for reasons.\n\nWether that be living a full open magnificent life. Or never dying. Or whatever else we can possibly want. If what you want requires you to break thousands of years of social conditioning and very deep \"ways of living\" in the humans of our time, you can expect one hell of a challenge, stemming from the insistence of \"the way it is\" and all the people who \"genuinely want\" their life/reality to be that way. As well as whatever in you agrees, and won't *not* want that. (*Unless given certain experiences???*)\n\nThe beauty is that our parts find ways to balance and co-exist. Everything in existence does. Castaneda and his personal history getting ravaged by the adventures with Don Juan. Forgetting most of what happened as he naturally chose a way of life afterwards that naturally didn't reflect the full scope of those experiences. And his heart reminding him later on because it couldn't not matter to him, because of all he wanted. \n\nI think it really is this simple. Getting into \"energetic facts\" is kind of confusing for reasons yall understand. When you start considering wether or not immortality is \"possible\" you have the intent of \"doubt\" and \"confusion\" etc. Not doing whatever you want. Or doing what you want, but making it to be a harder more tedious road. Because of learned habits, \"ways of being\" from society. This intellectual yearning for \"truth\". When reality simply makes more sense and you can \"feel\" what is happening in our mind, without any \"reality bullshit testing\" going on in our mind. We know as reality. And I truly believe what our heart wants is the best way into any of it. \n\nWhich even includes the supposed necessity of constant practice and everything else on a sorcerors path. Believing it's necessary or helpful and then getting results on that path is limiting to our perspective and reason. Like how someone who has sex and falls in love and starts living with their partner, gets all those amazing loving feelings, and then naturally fully believes all of those rituals and acts are *necessary* to build such a feeling and reality of affection and closeness. \n\nWhen for all we know, given the right intent and willingness, locking eyes or just breathing in each others presence, and exchanging a few deeply heartfelt genuine words, is all that's needed to get all those feelings happening. \n\nMaybe given crystal clear perfect sincerity, willingness, and true desire, all that's needed is to simply *want it* and you naturally do whatever is perfect for you in these circumstances to \"attain it\". Edit: even these words are hopelessly bound to these times and circumstances. Living in a time where we can even define the difference between someone being \"sincere\" or having \"clarity\". If we lived \"perfectly\" already, say, in a \"utopian\" society where we have perfect reason and \"seeing\", we would simply more often say what we *WANT*, then waste time trying to discover what's \"right\". Even our internal dialogue, rather than waste time with descriptions and judgements, would accurately reflect those realities in us that in *these* times, we're taught to avoid, or change, or adopt for strange purposes. \n\nClearly a huge variable in how all of this takes shape, Is the conditions of our planet, our bodies, minds, society, and all the people and beliefs in it. How could you build that connection with someone so quickly if they aren't willing? How could their mind, taught and conditioned to be agorophobic with reality, others, nature, not resist such an open hearted and deeply felt advance? Hence the assistance of Mescalito in giving Carlos such \"incredible\" experiences.\n\nWhich is why I think us being able to see and be genuine with each other, will make magic easier, than constantly trying to do magic. Even when you get some results, temporary or otherwise. Theres a million people defeating magic in there lives for everyone 1 succeeding. It's not about trying to get them to accept or do magic. It's about getting them to be innocent and free enough to accept what they want, and do it, without unnecessary interferrence. And I think all of us want to be able to perfectly intend to do whatever we want out of all eternity, with sincerity and clarity. Which as far as I can tell, is perfectly and ironically, the sincerest and most impenetrable path to doing and seeing magic. \n\nLiving as if we are reality. Leaving the world of the tonal to be free from competing descriptions and self insisting limitations. Yearning for everything we want, as everything we naturally are, and doing whatever we can to get all of it, as surely and openly and easily as we live and breathe.", "edited": 1709486480.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kt60zos", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont think we have to die.

Believing it&amp;#39;s necessary or helpful and then getting results on that path is limiting to our perspective and reason. Like how someone who has sex and falls in love and starts living with their partner, gets all those amazing loving feelings, and then naturally fully believes all of those rituals and acts are &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to build such a feeling and reality of affection and closeness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When for all we know, given the right intent and willingness, locking eyes or just breathing in each others presence, and exchanging a few deeply heartfelt genuine words, is all that&amp;#39;s needed to get all those feelings happening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe given crystal clear perfect sincerity, willingness, and true desire, all that&amp;#39;s needed is to simply &lt;em&gt;want it&lt;/em&gt; and you naturally do whatever is perfect for you in these circumstances to &amp;quot;attain it&amp;quot;. Edit: even these words are hopelessly bound to these times and circumstances. Living in a time where we can even define the difference between someone being &amp;quot;sincere&amp;quot; or having &amp;quot;clarity&amp;quot;. If we lived &amp;quot;perfectly&amp;quot; already, say, in a &amp;quot;utopian&amp;quot; society where we have perfect reason and &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, we would simply more often say what we &lt;em&gt;WANT&lt;/em&gt;, then waste time trying to discover what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;. Even our internal dialogue, rather than waste time with descriptions and judgements, would accurately reflect those realities in us that in &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; times, we&amp;#39;re taught to avoid, or change, or adopt for strange purposes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly a huge variable in how all of this takes shape, Is the conditions of our planet, our bodies, minds, society, and all the people and beliefs in it. How could you build that connection with someone so quickly if they aren&amp;#39;t willing? How could their mind, taught and conditioned to be agorophobic with reality, others, nature, not resist such an open hearted and deeply felt advance? Hence the assistance of Mescalito in giving Carlos such &amp;quot;incredible&amp;quot; experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why I think us being able to see and be genuine with each other, will make magic easier, than constantly trying to do magic. Even when you get some results, temporary or otherwise. Theres a million people defeating magic in there lives for everyone 1 succeeding. It&amp;#39;s not about trying to get them to accept or do magic. It&amp;#39;s about getting them to be innocent and free enough to accept what they want, and do it, without unnecessary interferrence. And I think all of us want to be able to perfectly intend to do whatever we want out of all eternity, with sincerity and clarity. Which as far as I can tell, is perfectly and ironically, the sincerest and most impenetrable path to doing and seeing magic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Living as if we are reality. Leaving the world of the tonal to be free from competing descriptions and self insisting limitations. Yearning for everything we want, as everything we naturally are, and doing whatever we can to get all of it, as surely and openly and easily as we live and breathe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1b5ef4t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1b5ef4t/why_did_carlos_body_give_up_to_cancer/kt60zos/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1709484210.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1709484210.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kt5vuhc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kt5tk9o", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I still have \"high hopes\" we can all create REAL magical flying carpets, like Sufism claims exist.\n\nOf course, the \"carpet\" would just by your energy body using a single puff to give the appearance of a carpet, and then you'd stand on it in the remainder of your energy body, with your tonal \"shrunk\".\n\nAnd fly off for real! \n\nSeemingly in your physical body, since you never laid or sat down.

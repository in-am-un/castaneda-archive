We don't want people to realize what those cartoons are designed to do.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from advanced subreddit \\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is very hard to explain, but you'll likely see it yourself.\n\nIn SK some things from the books begin to be obvious. So obvious, you feel a little shame for not realizing it.\n\nBut they don't have to be revolutionary things! Sorcery is all about tiny details at times, such as how much do you have remaining, in terms of traces of the internal dialogue.\n\nAnd is that impinging or being echoed, by your muscle memory?\n\nI love Zatoichi movies. The original japanese ones.\n\nAnd then even the TV series, which still plays weekly in Hawaii the last time I checked. Same slightly overweight japanese actor.\n\nZatoichi has super hearing, super awareness of what's around him, and none of it is from his physical sight.\n\nAs you get silent, that will happen to you. It's kind of odd, because you wonder how such legends as Zatoichi's amazing awareness of all around him, come into being?\n\nZen masters are supposed to have super reflexes too. People even admire Zen archers as if reaching enlightenment lets you shoot the arrow in some magical way.\n\nUnfortunately, the truth is Zen archers could not even compete in a high school level archery contest.\n\nThey suck.\n\nBut there is still \"something\" to that, such as relying on your emergency response muscle memory, to actually shoot.\n\nThe Zen archer doesn't shoot. \"It\" shoots.\n\nBut that's the same as what happens in MMA fighting. Or Boxing. Or any sport.\n\nYour muscle memory learns to take over for you. And then to your surprise, you find you caught your opponents leg just as he thought he had you dead in his sights, with a roundhouse kick.\n\nYOU didn't catch his leg so that he's nearly helpless. Not by conscious thought. That's too slow to make it possible.\n\n\"It\" did. Your muscle memory.\n\nLeave it to the Japanese to hype up the ordinary, and confuse people into thinking it's magical.\n\nOr maybe the translation of Japanese culture for westerners, produces the confusion.\n\nIn Japan, there's always \"one best way\" to do anything. They still use Yahoo and word processor machines! Their DMV driving test is precisely the same all over Japan. A fixed obstacle course everywhere.\n\nAnd since it's a \"shame based society\", according to the United Nations department which analyzes such things, you have to believe that the \"one best way\" is magical.\n\nOr why bother?\n\nSo you really can't ask a Zen archer if he's actually full of shit, and suggest that the person sitting next to you in the restaurant who just caught his empty wine glass with his right hand, as it was about to accidentally fall off the table, didn't do exactly what the Zen master was bragging about?\n\nUse his muscle memory to accomplish things without the conscious mind intervening.\n\nIt can give you a full 2 second advantage at times!\n\nBut wait, don't the Jedi see into the future a tiny bit, which is what seems to give them superhuman reflexes?\n\nAccording to Kwaigon that's how it works.\n\nSo somewhere in there, is a hidden truth about what happens when you become a sorcerer.\n\nAnd one thing you'll notice for sure, is hyper awareness of what's going on around you.\n\nMostly because you aren't lost in your internal dialogue.\n\nSo it's not actually magical. We have our animal side, where our entire being is listening for danger, so that we flee if necessary.\n\nExcept that normally we're drowning in grief, and it's inoperative.\n\nBut even so, if you go for walks around your job during breaks, where there's cars coming and going in the parking lot, you'll find that as you walk along you are almost supernaturally aware of cars entering the lot far away, behind you. And know where they are. So that as they approach where you're walking, you just move over to the side to make it easier for them,without even looking to see, there was indeed a car back there.\n\nFringe benefits of sorcery. You become a bit like James Bond.\n\nAnother is that reflex thing.\n\nTensegrity disengages the muscle memory from how you feel about it.\n\nI'll use an example.\n\nOne of the very first \"emergency responses\" a child learns is don't put your hand on the hot stove.\n\nIt comes with screaming and crying and running to Mommy to get help from the horrible pain.\n\nBut it also comes with a new \"subroutine\" being added to muscle memory.\n\nAn IMPORTANT one, due to the level of emotional content.\n\nThose super cool emergency responses that take place before your conscious mind is aware of the situation are \"rated\" by that part of the brain. High priority ones are learned quickly.\n\nLow priority ones require endless repetition to produce them.\n\nBut all of them are not just a command to move a muscle group.\n\nThat wouldn't work!\n\nThey have to involve every single part of your physical being, to be effective.\n\nI have a car with an unfortunate plastic bump near the floor as you enter.\n\nAnyone who owns that car will bash their shin on that plastic if they get in too fast.\n\nMaybe you have a \"hot date\", so you zip into your car.\n\nBut then suddenly, \"SHIT!!!!\". Your shin hurts like hell.\n\nIt doesn't take many of those until your entire body automatically alters its position, whenever the visual information and motivational information duplicates what the muscle memory has learned is a dangerous event.\n\nYour spine twists, the right leg extends a bit far, you \"slide\" the foot in gently, and the hands and arms prepare for the shock of the pain should this movement not work. So that you don't fall over.\n\nIt's a GIANT subroutine.\n\nYour muscle memory is very aware of what seems to be \"all input\". And can control \"all output\".\n\nAll of it! Even \"how you feel about it\".\n\nAnd it's trained with the screaming out in pain part also.\n\nYou know that's so from experience. Your muscle memory detects a harmful situation, you jerk with the correct physical movements, and shout, \"SHIT!!!! GOD DAMN!\"\n\nAnd your friend says, \"Did you just hurt yourself?\"\n\nAnd you sheepishly admit, you thought you had but it turns out it wasn't true.\n\nSo then why did you curse God?\n\nIt's built into the muscle memory! People often say, \"ouch, ouch, ouch!!!\" over something, when it didn't actually hurt.\n\nTensegrity on the other hand lets you \"retrain\" that.\n\nTo change \"how you feel\" for all sorts of physical movements.\n\nAnd it spills over into the entire subroutine library of your muscle memory.\n\nIt changes you from screaming out in pain, to expecting to see magic.\n\nIf you placed your hand on a hot stove and instead of feeling pain you felt bliss, and purple puffs began to circle all around you, it would greatly change that particular subroutine in the cerebellum.\n\nDrugs do the same to people. Turn them \"slap happy\" over time.\n\nTensegrity \"trains\" your muscle memory to expect magic.\n\nInstead of always expecting anguish.\n\nSo Zatoichi's amazing awareness of all, even tiny sounds, isn't entirely nonsense.\n\nSilence does that.\n\nNot fake silence like \"enlightened\" people develop with weak meditation techniques.\n\nThat's just the green line on the J curve.\n\nWe're talking about silence so deep that the assemblage point becomes super fluid, and reacts to even a tiny body movement done in darkness.\n\nI have to add the darkness comment because I'm not a daylight gazer, and that's more my familiar territory. Muscle movements in darkness. But it carries over to daylight.\n\nI was watching that just now in silence so deep that the room was entirely filled with swirling purple puffs. Intense ones.\n\nI was on the edge of silent knowledge.\n\nMy \"cartoon feed\" was about to start up.\n\nMy ally \"Fancy\" showed up.\n\nNow, I'm going to blame Fancy for this. But in fact, it was something else going on.\n\nHere's a theory. It doesn't matter if the IOBs actually talk to you, because they're 46 billion light years away. At least, \"Fairy\" and \"Minx\" live that far away according to Carlos.\n\nDuh!\n\nWhere's captain obvious when you need him?\n\nAll they can do is \"hook\" to your awareness using their awareness, and trigger silent knowledge.\n\nSo what does it matter if you actually heard a sound, or it was telepathic?\n\nThe telepathic is less creepy.\n\nWhich is a bad thing if you ask me. \"Creepy\" moves the assemblage point the fastest.\n\nI kind of like a demon moaning once in a while, just to prove the Christians right. I'm rooting for them to get to heaven. They work so hard trying to get there.\n\nAnd make such pests of themselves.\n\nUnfortunately the only explanation they have for why we kick the Jewish Prophets butts all day long is, \"You're possessed by a demon!\"\n\nSo just now Fancy was here in very pleasing form, which was easy with all those puffs around.\n\nAnd I got the idea, \"If these lead to the inorganic being's world, why can't I locate Julian? Offer him a ride out, hopefully minus the sex change operation.\"\n\nFancy said, \"Don't ever say such a thing! Don't you realize you can't take some things back?\"\n\nI understood. I made a promise to Cholita perhaps 26 years ago, a huge one. But when Carlos died and everything fell apart, there seemed no point in doing that.\n\nAnd yet, 26 years later it came to pass without me even realizing it.\n\nI just suddenly noticed at one point, it had taken place.\n\nIt seems to be as don Juan said, that in the past words had power. He even said you could summon your ally just by speaking it's name, which should be reserved for special occasions.\n\nWe kind of don't care anymore, and even gossip about our allies like cute grandchildren.\n\nBut in fact words have power, and that becomes obvious as you approach the deepest levels of silence.\n\nBecause they leave traces in the emanations which NEVER go away.\n\nSo when you're trying to \"tune in\" a distant radio station of reality, perhaps because you're halfway from LA to Vegas and it's just desert, and the radio towers are far away, there's just no way to escape the faint sound of Mariachi music as being the only thing you can pick up.\n\nYou want to tune in some lovely rock and roll, but all you can find is really cheesy mariachi music. And even that too dim to enjoy.\n\nThat's what you do when you speak out loud! You create mariachi band stations off in the void, and if you ever pass through there again you can't escape it.\n\nI actually got a chill down my spine when Fancy warned me not to say that.\n\nSo I quickly took it back.\n\nAnd was happy to see, I was SURROUNDED by cartoons.\n\nFancy said, \"This is why there are specialized seers in each lineage. It's mostly just because they got good at a certain thing, so it became their speciality. You'll do the same. If one of your group becomes super good at peering into the inorganic being's realm, you'll all be happy to let her be the expert on that.\n\nBut what's really happened is, the person has gotten used to a \"Silent Knowledge Presentation Method\".\n\nDon Juan suggested reading text, but here you are watching cartoons all night.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Half A Post From The Advanced Subreddit", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"gmo9tb618jma1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59fff6280091c27b24b5525ac75c147715d708db"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d899d797cca559d379da5b2e9fb87ef20d9bc72"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98bc565b7d990c4d6f4269f813760c8643621b08"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2f68a366bb35f91fe8ff8eae506e76e44b3f13"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c126a5bc8eb812bb0f732a5ad3395bce630a47a2"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b15defe20ec23c3ab796c85cfba3101fd869129d"}], "s": {"y": 675, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84c04c62a8a25ecdd4dd63e3395c250617eb808"}, "id": "gmo9tb618jma1"}}, "name": "t3_11lyyhh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ePUO57gwMJa4-m1j-vVm_piUN70VMBW609-UlAlz9iI.jpg", "edited": 1678289521.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1678288671.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f84c04c62a8a25ecdd4dd63e3395c250617eb808\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/gmo9tb618jma1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f84c04c62a8a25ecdd4dd63e3395c250617eb808&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s evil inorganic beings behind the planning of the cartoons, so this is just half a post from the advanced subreddit.

It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the IOBs actually talk to you, because they&amp;#39;re 46 billion light years away. At least, &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Minx&amp;quot; live that far away according to Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Duh!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where&amp;#39;s captain obvious when you need him?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All they can do is &amp;quot;hook&amp;quot; to your awareness using their awareness, and trigger silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does it matter if you actually heard a sound, or it was telepathic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The telepathic is less creepy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is a bad thing if you ask me. &amp;quot;Creepy&amp;quot; moves the assemblage point the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of like a demon moaning once in a while, just to prove the Christians right. I&amp;#39;m rooting for them to get to heaven. They work so hard trying to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And make such pests of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the only explanation they have for why we kick the Jewish Prophets butts all day long is, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re possessed by a demon!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just now Fancy was here in very pleasing form, which was easy with all those puffs around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I got the idea, &amp;quot;If these lead to the inorganic being&amp;#39;s world, why can&amp;#39;t I locate Julian? Offer him a ride out, hopefully minus the sex change operation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t ever say such a thing! Don&amp;#39;t you realize you can&amp;#39;t take some things back?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understood. I made a promise to Cholita perhaps 26 years ago, a huge one. But when Carlos died and everything fell apart, there seemed no point in doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, 26 years later it came to pass without me even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just suddenly noticed at one point, it had taken place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to be as don Juan said, that in the past words had power. He even said you could summon your ally just by speaking it&amp;#39;s name, which should be reserved for special occasions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kind of don&amp;#39;t care anymore, and even gossip about our allies like cute grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact words have power, and that becomes obvious as you approach the deepest levels of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they leave traces in the emanations which NEVER go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you&amp;#39;re trying to &amp;quot;tune in&amp;quot; a distant radio station of reality, perhaps because you&amp;#39;re halfway from LA to Vegas and it&amp;#39;s just desert, and the radio towers are far away, there&amp;#39;s just no way to escape the faint sound of Mariachi music as being the only thing you can pick up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to tune in some lovely rock and roll, but all you can find is really cheesy mariachi music. And even that too dim to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what you do when you speak out loud! You create mariachi band stations off in the void, and if you ever pass through there again you can&amp;#39;t escape it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually got a chill down my spine when Fancy warned me not to say that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I quickly took it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And was happy to see, I was SURROUNDED by cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy said, &amp;quot;This is why there are specialized seers in each lineage. It&amp;#39;s mostly just because they got good at a certain thing, so it became their speciality. You&amp;#39;ll do the same. If one of your group becomes super good at peering into the inorganic being&amp;#39;s realm, you&amp;#39;ll all be happy to let her be the expert on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s really happened is, the person has gotten used to a &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Presentation Method&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan suggested reading text, but here you are watching cartoons all night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "11lyyhh", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11lyyhh/half_a_post_from_the_advanced_subreddit/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/11lyyhh/half_a_post_from_the_advanced_subreddit/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1678288671.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbpgd4t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbpdol6", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Nope.

The people from the pyramid in the south east were the ones featured in that exhibit, and it included the famous Chacmool statue. However, the Mayans were taken over by them (around 1200?).   And if you dig under stuff at the Mayan pyramid area, you can find a pyramid which had an entry room with a giant Chacmool statue, followed by a throne room for the king.   The throne was bright red and just a flat bench, except it had the head of a dragon or serpent on the left side as you viewed it. I've seen that head materialize in purple clouds seen in the dark by silence.\n\nThe point of that pyramid was that you have to pass the Chacmools to get to the leader.

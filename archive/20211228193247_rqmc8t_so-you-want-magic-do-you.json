If you do any zooming and you are not lucid, it's just a dream of a memory of it.\n\nZooming is an easy way to find an IOB realm.\n\nThe scouts eventually do what IOBs do and try to trap you, scare  you, or whatever emotion they're trying to tap into.\n\nIf it comes down to a chase, you get at least 30 feet away with a clear view of  a distant high point, gaze fiercely at it, trying to make it mutate, while you lean in slightly until it pulls you.\n\nYou can zip over there super fast, or in the middle of travel, gaze down to slow it or land.\n\nThere's never an altitude problem, because it's your gaze at the distant point, modifying the dream to stretch to over there.\n\nEach time you zoom, you renew  your ability to stay in the dream for at least 30 seconds.\n\nIn the beginning, the big problem is not lucidity. It's waking up.\n\nYou can fade from lucidity into non-lucidity, but that's actually a useful technique for holding the dream longer.  You \"go along\" with the dream, but keep the lucidity hidden in the back.\n\nZooming is used when waking up from the dream, or being held down by the inorganic beings is your problem.\n\nYou'll get better and better at a \"quick getaway\", until you dare to pull it even when there's an iob only 8 feet behind you.\n\nHe'll grab on and ride with  you, but while you are zooming, he can't do anything.  It's your gaze \"mutating\" the dream.\n\nIf you do this a few times until he likes it,  and learns to \"come along\" with only a barely perceptable pressing on  your back, he'll alter the course without you realizing it and you'll land right in an inorganic being realm.\n\nIt's not the tunnels properly.  But the perspective is absolutely impossible.  Up is far away, down is nearer, but space in between can do anything.  And the more you gaze at it, the more you realize it's a flat surface. Or at least, it's not the great vista scene it appears to be.\n\nAnd you'll find the IOBs who live there acting out little scenes.\n\nEven murder, as Milarepa saw.\n\nLooks like a Bosch painting.\n\nYou can tell it's an IOB realm for sure, by trying to go into there and seeing how ill you get due to the impossible perspective.\n\nThe IOBs can make \"realms\".  I don't know where they exist.  Their world must be \"extensible\".\n\nThey pulled that on Carlos and Carol, by putting them into that shack.\n\nI've been into the IOB realm in my current state to visit a sorcerer in there multiple times, but I never have any memory of the place he was located.  It was a room of some type, but my memory of it is gone within seconds of leaving.\n\nWhen you get to the very far orange zone, where every surface in the room is manifesting dream scenes or beings, you run into parallel timelines.\n\nBut you won't be able to recall them and write them in the sub.\n\nEach one is only recallable while out in that position of the assemblage point.\n\nSo at first it's like, \"Hey...

If you do any zooming and you are not lucid, it&amp;#39;s just a dream of a memory of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zooming is an easy way to find an IOB realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The scouts eventually do what IOBs do and try to trap you, scare  you, or whatever emotion they&amp;#39;re trying to tap into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it comes down to a chase, you get at least 30 feet away with a clear view of  a distant high point, gaze fiercely at it, trying to make it mutate, while you lean in slightly until it pulls you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can zip over there super fast, or in the middle of travel, gaze down to slow it or land.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s never an altitude problem, because it&amp;#39;s your gaze at the distant point, modifying the dream to stretch to over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each time you zoom, you renew  your ability to stay in the dream for at least 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, the big problem is not lucidity. It&amp;#39;s waking up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can fade from lucidity into non-lucidity, but that&amp;#39;s actually a useful technique for holding the dream longer.  You &amp;quot;go along&amp;quot; with the dream, but keep the lucidity hidden in the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zooming is used when waking up from the dream, or being held down by the inorganic beings is your problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll get better and better at a &amp;quot;quick getaway&amp;quot;, until you dare to pull it even when there&amp;#39;s an iob only 8 feet behind you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll grab on and ride with  you, but while you are zooming, he can&amp;#39;t do anything.  It&amp;#39;s your gaze &amp;quot;mutating&amp;quot; the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do this a few times until he likes it,  and learns to &amp;quot;come along&amp;quot; with only a barely perceptable pressing on  your back, he&amp;#39;ll alter the course without you realizing it and you&amp;#39;ll land right in an inorganic being realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the tunnels properly.  But the perspective is absolutely impossible.  Up is far away, down is nearer, but space in between can do anything.  And the more you gaze at it, the more you realize it&amp;#39;s a flat surface. Or at least, it&amp;#39;s not the great vista scene it appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll find the IOBs who live there acting out little scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even murder, as Milarepa saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like a Bosch painting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can tell it&amp;#39;s an IOB realm for sure, by trying to go into there and seeing how ill you get due to the impossible perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The IOBs can make &amp;quot;realms&amp;quot;.  I don&amp;#39;t know where they exist.  Their world must be &amp;quot;extensible&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They pulled that on Carlos and Carol, by putting them into that shack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been into the IOB realm in my current state to visit a sorcerer in there multiple times, but I never have any memory of the place he was located.  It was a room of some type, but my memory of it is gone within seconds of leaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get to the very far orange zone, where every surface in the room is manifesting dream scenes or beings, you run into parallel timelines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t be able to recall them and write them in the sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each one is only recallable while out in that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So at first it&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Hey...  Did I...   Last night?  No, that&amp;#39;s not possible!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you recall it.

read the books, but I'm assuming you mean, lay in the same position you used when entering a new dream at the 3rd gate?\n\nIf it's 3rd gate you're doing, you should read some early lecture notes where someone asks Carlos a question like this, and he interrupts the question to tell him it's impossible he's doing what he says, because you can't get to the 3rd gate without getting rid of the internal dialogue.\n\nAnd for a sorcerer, just listening to a question like that tells him all he needs to know about whether that person can get silent.\n\nI'll add,  don't skip gate 2 or you will fail.  You MUST identify a scout, and follow it to their world.  You need the dark energy. And besides, trying to find a scout is the most fun you can have.  You can play hide and seek with him, zipping from the top of tall buildings, over to mountains.\n\nEventually your scout will decide he likes that, and ride along with you, as you zip around in the air changing dreams.  If you backup a bit in the posts, you can find a figuring of an old seer, shapeshifted, riding on his scout.\n\nYou can do that one!\n\nBecause once you identify a scout, the inorganic beings inevitably try to capture you and hold you on the ground.  They'll be after you for weeks.  Months even if you don't learn how to deal with them.\n\nBut eventually you can turn your scout into a \"pet\", and retain lucidity much longer in dreams.\n\nAnytime you \"defeat\" a bad activity of  the inorganic beings (twice?), they surrender to you.\n\nYou \"wrestled\" them.\n\nI believe that's the best use Taisha and Florinda found for inorganic beings.  A companion in the second attention.  To sustain your dreaming attention.  It's in some lecture notes posted in the last month.\n\nThe real problem is, can you get lucid often enough to find a scout?\n\nThat's the \"trick\" of it all.\n\nThe entire 4 gates path is a series of tricks!\n\nLet me lay it out.  Once I do you'll realize, it's so obvious!\n\nTrick 1 )\n\nFind your hands, to elevate you from making up stuff about your dreams, to get attention.\n\nIf people would just follow that, half the misery in the Castaneda community would be eliminated.  You wouldn't have angry men insisting they have sorcery abilities, because they've gotten away with misrepresenting ordinary dreams for decades.\n\nWith daddy gone (Carlos), all hell has broken loose in the pretend sorcery community.  There's no one to slap the bad players down.\n\nIf you have to find your hands and go from object to object each time, you can't lie to  yourself.  And don't skip over the look from object to object and then back at your hands part!\n\nThat eliminates pretending you found your hands through lucidity.\n\nAnd it also charges the air with the energy that causes inorganic beings to send a scout after you.  If you didn't find a scout, you skipped that step.\n\nFor them, that's like the smell of In-N-Out hamburgers.  When they smell that, they'll send a representative with a long \"to-go\" order. Often they pretend to be a crowd, with as many as 5, maybe so no one will ask why their order is so long. But it's just one.\n\nTrick 2 )\n\nLocate a scout and follow it to their world, so that you can't lie about how often you succeed at getting lucid, exaggerating once a year into \"on demand\".\n\nTo find a scout and follow it, you have to do it several times EACH NIGHT.\n\nYou have to break the lucidity barrier, with unbending intent.\n\nAnd yes, you need that dark energy.  But the main purpose of gate 2, is to force you to notice that you can't get lucid often enough to learn by this path.\n\nInstead of feeling good about success once a week, proudly displaying your \"accomplishments\" on your social media,  you feel like a failure and have to re-examine your efforts.\n\nTrick 3 )\n\nDisturb your ability to wake up so that you can get more chances at the 4th gate.  You would normally just wake up, and that's the end of it.  But you cause waking up to be very difficult.\n\nYou disturb that ability by going to sleep inside dreams, so that you aren't guaranteed to actually wake up into the real world.  Otherwise, how many chances would you get to succeed, per lucid dream?\n\nAnd it does allow sustaining the dream much longer.\n\nMy record is 2 weeks in a lucid dream, continuously.\n\nWould have gone longer, but I didn't know how much time had passed in the real world.\n\nIt turned out to be just 12 hours.  And at that point, Carlos discouraged us from practicing that. He got tired of all the bad players making up stuff about their dreams.\n\nTrick 4 )\n\nIf you did gate 3, you'll find it VERY hard to wake up for real.  You'll even panic!\n\nAnd you'll forget that your goal was to bring the double here.  Instead, you'll just be worried about waking up at all.\n\nSo you'll be transitioning from one dream to another, in your double.  Good practice!  But you won't see it that way.\n\nI once woke up several times, went to the shower during each, only to find our reality wasn't behaving.\n\nOn one of those, as I recall now 25 years later, an inorganic being was laying on the bed when I returned from another attempt to wake up. She commented something \"encouraging\".\n\nBut I didn't notice that weird detail.  By the 4th gate, you get used to the presence of your scout.\n\nFinally it seemed real that I had really woke up, so I got into my car to drive to work.\n\nHalfway there, I realized I was still in a dream.\n\nWhat happens at that point, is that the double comes out to \"rescue\" us.\n\nWhich really just means, you finally amused him.\n\nBetter to do that in the darkroom.  My double comes out continuously, for hours.\n\nIn lesser forms mostly, but it's not limited to that.\n\nLast night Fancy and I were digging in the wall of hell (a phantom room I like), furiously, so that I could leap through the resulting portal. I'm trying to connect it to a known phantom reality.\n\nYou can't leap through a portal in your tonal body. It needs the double.\n\nKeep in mind: That was awake. Eyes open, sober, walking around my darkroom, as if it were a real cave, in hell.\n\nSure looked like one!\n\nMy suggestion: switch to darkroom.\n\nBut if you do 4 gates, follow the instructions very closely.\n\nEveryone tries to skip ahead.  That in itself, is a deal killer.\n\nIt means you want human attention a little too much, to go very far in sorcery.\n\nAnd you MUST learn silence, according to Carlos.\n\nBest way to learn that?\n\nWhen you decide on what position to go to sleep in, lay in it and force all thoughts from your mind, until you find yourself standing in a dream.\n\nIn other words, make practicing silence what you do, before you fall asleep.\n\nThen you get \"temporary silence\", which in my opinion is good enough for 4 gates dreaming.\n\nWhile you are doing that, notice when you blank out or doze off for an instant, and have  a mini-vision.\n\nFor example, I once saw a spider when I was forcing silence. I blanked out, came back in an instant, and realized I had been looking at a spider.\n\nSo while silent I visualized that spider in as much detail as I could recall, forcing silence fiercely.\n\nI started to see a series of hills, forming a dark wall of some kind.  Like a wall of rolling hills at dusk, over which an attacking army comes.\n\nHundreds of spiders were coming over the top of the hill, marching towards me.\n\nI soon found myself standing on dirt in a dream.\n\nMinus the spiders.", "edited": 1640883359.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hqk560r", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a while since I read the books, but I&amp;#39;m assuming you mean, lay in the same position you used when entering a new dream at the 3rd gate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s 3rd gate you&amp;#39;re doing, you should read some early lecture notes where someone asks Carlos a question like this, and he interrupts the question to tell him it&amp;#39;s impossible he&amp;#39;s doing what he says, because you can&amp;#39;t get to the 3rd gate without getting rid of the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for a sorcerer, just listening to a question like that tells him all he needs to know about whether that person can get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll add,  don&amp;#39;t skip gate 2 or you will fail.

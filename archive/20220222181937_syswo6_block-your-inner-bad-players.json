Why show it?\n\nBut it's also not something they could try to copy, to get attention for themselves.  It's not a \"technique\" they can pretend they succeeded at.\n\nIn fact, if they want to pretend to be \"impeccable\", it certainly won't hurt anything as long as they're doing that hoping to open a portal and leave their darkroom, in their full physical form.\n\nThat's what \"impeccable\" is really for!  When you need massive amounts of dreaming energy, and silence.\n\nYou do not do this asleep...  Not using shrooms either.\n\nPlease, don't bring your nightmares into here.  I've been told one of you is sharing experiences you had while high, without mentioning that little detail.\n\nCome on...  If too many do that, this place withers and dies.\n\nDon't piss on the lawn!  It leaves obvious brown spots.  You aren't fooling anyone.\n\nAnd this place now exists in the realm of the doubles.  A phantom copy is out there. So don't bring your bad dreams into this subreddit, or you'll have to battle them later in the phantom realm where it's no longer just a dream.\n\nAs for this picture, there are a few sorcery techniques which require so many skills that if you do them over and over you're really doing 10 different things, over and over.  It's 10 times harder, but it saves 10 times the minutes you need to learn sorcery.\n\nOne is Pandora's Box. The pass Carlos gave to us after 2 weeks of rumors, to show us some real magic.  We were too clueless to realize what he'd done.\n\nHe just grinned.  Seed planted.\n\nI was doing it last night, and Fancy was amused by it.  She floated between my hands, upper body only, and when I compressed the ball of purple light she flattened too.\n\nUp and down, she squished and unsquished. When I rotated the hands so the opposite was on top, she temporarily vanished, then bubbled up from the center.\n\nI finally had her squished to the size of an egg.  I could see her though my hands, though it didn't occur to me, that was kind of weird.  Some things slip your mind, when you're compressing an ice demon into a golf ball.\n\nWhen I released the top hand, to my side to be safe, Fancy exploded out of the ball, and materialized as a full sized woman.\n\nBut she was mostly transparent so I figured that was a \"fail\", and moved on to my next \"complex\" technique.\n\nAnother technique which takes 10 different things to accomplish,  is opening an exit to  your darkroom and walking through it in full lucidity.   That's shown in the picture.\n\nYou go through the solid bedroom wall, in a continuous walking motion, with nothing to explain how that's possible. You could stop at any second and turn on the lights in the room, to head for the bathroom. But instead, you break the laws of physics by walking so far you're no longer even on the same street as your home.\n\nI believe you need an inorganic being for this, but it's possible you can substitute having the presence of a witch near by.  It's the dark energy.  Without it, your sight will become too blurry at very distant positions of the assemblage point.  And you'll blank out.  It's too dark out there, without some extra illumination.\n\nThe inorganic beings help you keep your attention focused where it's needed, by illuminating things with their alien energy.  It's \"hypnotic\".\n\nWhen you get that far out on the J curve, so that it's possible to grab the air and pull it apart,  revealing a passage way to another realm, the entities that exist only as phantoms in your emanations, will try to call you back.  To prevent you from leaving.\n\nBut they do the same to this subreddit!  We get bad men who come here only to destroy or stop this place.  It exposes their pretending, so they try to end it.\n\nIt's no different when you try to cross through a magical opening.  \"Things\" try to stop you.\n\nAs I practiced this last night,  with surprising levels of \"power\", I began to smell the scent of Cholita.\n\nBut it was only a vague cloud.  Nothing that could give me any certainty.\n\nI probably should have noticed, I could literally see the size and shape of the cloud of Cholita smell.  And it was greenish.\n\nBut sometimes you're just too silent to notice odd details like that.\n\nAnd I also smelled some kind of French pastry,  so I doubted it.\n\nIt didn't occur to me that there's a French pastry shop right down the street.  I can't eat those, so I never remember how close that place is and how likely it is for Cholita to end up in there sipping coffee.\n\nThere was a time when Cholita would sip coffee with me.  She choose Mexican style coffees, like using brown sugar to sweeten it.\n\nWondering if my great luck that evening was actually just Cholita, I glanced down at the floor and found it was composed of cracked mud and fine moss.  The focus was extremely sharp.\n\nThat changed my mind, and I got suspicious that perhaps Cholita had snuck into her studio.  Or had visited again recently.\n\nI glanced up, to see if she'd come into the room in her double.\n\nBut all I saw was a whitish passage way, extending way too far out my west wall.\n\nIt was empty.  Again, it didn't occur to me that a rectangular bank of fog extending 20 feet from the walls of my room, into the living room, was something I ought to question.\n\nIn the morning, I confirmed it.  Cholita had visited twice yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Block Your Inner Bad Players", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"fic12j8g2fj81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fic12j8g2fj81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478fe1f88300faacdf4b59d3dd3636054f751b53"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fic12j8g2fj81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff33f8082877287214d2c891f5a9892bd6a4e59a"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fic12j8g2fj81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b848e881c5e2bb878b5bc9a43b37c12beb19b42b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fic12j8g2fj81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75604270cfbcf2656d686f47e42290072beec0e3"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fic12j8g2fj81.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=246ccdbb6a0b71e5af16836034c5fd451488bc27"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fic12j8g2fj81.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe5387025c602738a966ca287d5438dc0f103e0f"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fic12j8g2fj81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2632f28bb626661f888767ac66c3ac2a77435b13"}, "id": "fic12j8g2fj81"}}, "name": "t3_syswo6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PqYQ6TjD-tx26zKMC9nh685rqAzBlKH57vclyPJ_gdY.jpg", "edited": 1645569772.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1645550377.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fic12j8g2fj81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2632f28bb626661f888767ac66c3ac2a77435b13\"&gt;A strange lesson from Lily on how leave your darkroom by ignoring your \\&amp;quot;friends\\&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, this is hopeless for a beginner.

afraid, we don't live under the Rule that's in the books of Carlos.\n\nThe rule is said to be endless, covering all aspects of sorcery.\n\nBut it doesn't fit us in the current form, because we don't have old naguals, interacting with the next generation.\n\nI looked to see if there's a clue for how to uncover the aspect of the rule that applies to   \n us, from the books.\n\nMy theory is, the women are the ones who do that sort of thing.\n\nI found this, indicating twice before people started from scratch, and used nothing but their seeing, to find their way:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"The ancient seers were very fortunate indeed,\" don Juan began, \"because they had plenty of time to learn marvelous things. Let me tell you, they knew wonders that we can't even imagine today.\"\n\n\"Who taught them all that?\" I asked.\n\n\"They learned everything by themselves through seeing,\" he replied. \"Most of the things we know in our lineage were figured out by them. The new seers corrected the mistakes of the old seers, but the basis of what we know and do is lost in Toltec time.\"\n\nHe explained. One of the simplest and yet most important findings from the point of view of instruction, he said, is the knowledge that man has two types of awareness. The old seers called them the right and the left side of man.\n\n\"The old seers figured out,\" he went on, \"that the best way to teach their knowledge was to make their apprentices shift to their left side to a state of heightened awareness. Real learning takes place there.\n\n\"Very young children were given to the old seers as apprentices,\" don Juan continued, \"so that they wouldn't know any other way of life.

He said that my experience was similar to his own. His benefactor, the nagual Julian, had created a profound schism in him, by making him shift back and forth from one type of awareness to the other. He said that the clarity and freedom he experienced in heightened awareness were in total contrast to the rationalizations, the defenses, the anger, and the fear of his normal state of awareness.\n\nThe old seers used to create this polarity to suit their own particular purposes; with it, they forced their apprentices to achieve the concentration needed to learn sorcery techniques. But the new seers, he said, use it to lead their apprentices to the conviction that there are unrealized possibilities in man.\n\n\"The best effort of the new seers,\" don Juan continued, \"is their explanation of the mystery of awareness. They condensed it all into some concepts and actions which are taught while the apprentices are in heightened awareness.\"\n\nHe said that the value of the new seers' method of teaching is that it takes advantage of the fact that no one can remember anything that happens while being in a state of heightened awareness. This inability to remember sets up an almost insurmountable barrier for warriors who have to recollect all the instruction given to them if they are to go on. Only after years of struggle and discipline can warriors recollect their instruction. By then the concepts and the procedures that were taught to them have been internalized, and have thus acquired the force the new seers meant them to have.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo, not only do we not have a previous lineage, to see how the story applies to us, but we don't have hidden left side awareness memories to recover.\n\nWe get to heightened awareness by ourselves.

What it does.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It extracts stories from us on death,  or we can give those up with recap, and then it repeats the stories to others when they pick up the life path of another living being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It creates &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; paths.  Such as, &amp;quot;The Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a story told by the eagle, which implants ideas and prejudices in your mind when you hear it, causing you to select certain behaviors in favor of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like taking a little kid, and telling them how cool it is to be a fireman, with little stories about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can manipulate them to grow up to be a fireman that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intent of the old seers is strong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now keep in mind, all this is totally not in the books as far as I know, and it came from a spirit who likes to catch on fire in purple flames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While traveling down the sheet of paper, &amp;quot;intent surface&amp;quot;, we ran into a &amp;quot;damaged&amp;quot; spot, and Lily said, &amp;quot;If you have a deviated intent you go that way and never continue on the path of the old seers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down and to the right, and could see another surface sliding off that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the nasty Buddha deviation!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Lily didn&amp;#39;t say anything.  Instead she pointed to the left and said, &amp;quot;You can dive off into the abyss that direction, and then you can change surfaces a long ways down.  Skip to the end of other paths, or return to one you have lost. But you won&amp;#39;t have all the in between memories, so you&amp;#39;ll never be quite right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much more I can&amp;#39;t recall, but at the end she was trying to argue that our path was lame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she knew much better ways to do &amp;quot;darkroom&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I argued with her.  &amp;quot;Yea, but we can&amp;#39;t do that sort of thing.  We have to stick with what Carlos gave us, otherwise who&amp;#39;s going to be the one to decide about new paths, and how are we going to know we aren&amp;#39;t screwing things up?  Have you been paying attention to how horrible Castaneda followers can be?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Suit yourself&amp;quot;, is kind of what she said after that, but it was just with a gesture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she also implied, our very consciousness of what&amp;#39;s happening, is a movement from surface to surface as if we&amp;#39;re really more like children being read a picture book story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot; is the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_syswo6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/syswo6/block_your_inner_bad_players/hy8yoyg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1645715320.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hy6edkv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1645664724.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_syswo6", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Wow, I love the ancient sorcery stories.\n\nToday I've realized, it is actually automatic to modify reality for a sorcerer.\n\nWe do it all the time, while getting silent and moving through the J Curve.\n\nAnd that modification can be so strong that affects how others around focus their attention.\n\nI have to warn, new people don't get obsessed with the following.\n\nWe don't want our assemblage point trapped in the shift below, for selfish witchcraft.\n\nBut since the Old Sorcerers liked that place, a \"Reddish perspectice\" is accurate here!\n\nSilence has a lot of hidden possibilities.\n\nFor instance, when there are intruders around, it becomes normal to make them leave, without moving any muscle.\n\nSomeone's car could break, just because you made a spell.\n\nOr you could manage to be warm while sitting in a cold place.\n\nI'm not saying \"total control\", at all.

(Is eyes-closed/laying down okay on this path?)\n\n2)  Eyes Check: Find 'energy body' eyes, looking for the purple or orange-red in the darkness. \n\n3) Ear check: Find either the a) inner-ear ringing, or b) A/C, or anything, one sound to lock in on.  This is my cheat for reducing thought.  I find it nearly impossible to talk to yourself and listen to the outside environment at same time.  \n\n4)  Silence with colors reached between 3 seconds on perfect day and 30+ minutes on rough day.

However, where it gets interesting:\n\n8) Wake up about 90min -2 hours minutes later, clear but with loose AP.  \n\n9) Change beds, and go to sleep again in new room. \n\n10) This is typically when I luck into dreaming.  1-2 times out of 7 night's sleep, I wake up in my 'energy body'?  Whatever that state that Carlos experienced in Zuleica's teachings, I feel my body all folded up, and I'm floating in darkness.\n\nExample: just yesterday going through these steps, I woke up at step 10 in my energy body, laying in blackness, floating in my room.  i think Castaneda referred to this as restful vigil?  I intended to roll over and fall into the gutter between the bed and wall, like a floating potato sack, then intended to jump through wall, but i had no vision... made it through the wall (I have done this many times with vision) and felt a string pulling me back, back... to my body.... then a being was tugging on my ankles... i felt folded in half, upside down.... i reached up and touched the being, there was shock/blast of energy, and I woke up.\n\nThat place, 'restful vigil', appears to be the right track, and where I want to end up, in accordance with Zuleica.  I \"feel\" that is my next step in the path, I've been in that body/state so many fucking times, but always through falling asleep first, I just can't get there through the front door.   I don't even know what I'm trying to do, once the dream starts.  Enter it?  How? Should I tamper with it, or leave it alone? If you start dreaming of a beach scene, should you manipulate, like add characters to the scene?  Should I add trees?  An ice-cream vendor?  Should I be creating the dream ?  Or should I do the exact opposite.... just be an observer?  What if nothing happens?  Should I spur it along by adding something?\n\nAnyway these are my prime questions; \n\n1)  At step 6 - How does one enter the dream, when it just begins, while maintaining awareness?  \n\n2) Once entering a dream, how do we reach restful vigil/energy body?  Do you just intend it? \n\n3) Sometimes when waking up at step 10, inside the floating energy body, I hear a loud rumbling like a jet plane, a bullroar as Carlos called it.  Is the idea behind darkroom and 4th gate dreaming that we can circumvent that sound/process, enter dreaming, and THEN reach the energy body? \n\n4) Is there a direct path where you don't enter dreaming, and you just ride awareness directly into the energy body, THROUGH the bullroar, right into restful vigil?  \n\nEntering the dream with awareness is the next step, but ironically, as soon as a dream begins, awareness seems to be hardest to hold, and I enter the dream unaware/fall asleep.  That's the biggest obstacle.  Anyway any thoughts appreciated, I am planning to work this path until I sweat blood.  I've been on both sides of the blackout portion... all the way up until the dream... and then on the other side.... waking up in the energy body.  It's those missing steps, that are so hard to stalk. I really feel like I am inches away from reaching the energy body directly... and yet those inches feel like they are as wide as the grand canyon and will take years of dedicated practice to bridge.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hy9q7qk", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate this conversation and would appreciate more advice on this path.  i am decent at setting up dreaming, and getting lucky 1-2 times a week; lucid dreaming, IOBs, scouts, other worlds, even shapeshifting.

I intended to roll over and fall into the gutter between the bed and wall, like a floating potato sack, then intended to jump through wall, but i had no vision... made it through the wall (I have done this many times with vision) and felt a string pulling me back, back... to my body.... then a being was tugging on my ankles... i felt folded in half, upside down.... i reached up and touched the being, there was shock/blast of energy, and I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That place, &amp;#39;restful vigil&amp;#39;, appears to be the right track, and where I want to end up, in accordance with Zuleica.  I &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; that is my next step in the path, I&amp;#39;ve been in that body/state so many fucking times, but always through falling asleep first, I just can&amp;#39;t get there through the front door.   I don&amp;#39;t even know what I&amp;#39;m trying to do, once the dream starts.  Enter it?  How? Should I tamper with it, or leave it alone? If you start dreaming of a beach scene, should you manipulate, like add characters to the scene?  Should I add trees?  An ice-cream vendor?  Should I be creating the dream ?  Or should I do the exact opposite.... just be an observer?  What if nothing happens?  Should I spur it along by adding something?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway these are my prime questions; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)  At step 6 - How does one enter the dream, when it just begins, while maintaining awareness?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Once entering a dream, how do we reach restful vigil/energy body?  Do you just intend it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Sometimes when waking up at step 10, inside the floating energy body, I hear a loud rumbling like a jet plane, a bullroar as Carlos called it.  Is the idea behind darkroom and 4th gate dreaming that we can circumvent that sound/process, enter dreaming, and THEN reach the energy body? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Is there a direct path where you don&amp;#39;t enter dreaming, and you just ride awareness directly into the energy body, THROUGH the bullroar, right into restful vigil?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Entering the dream with awareness is the next step, but ironically, as soon as a dream begins, awareness seems to be hardest to hold, and I enter the dream unaware/fall asleep.  That&amp;#39;s the biggest obstacle.  Anyway any thoughts appreciated, I am planning to work this path until I sweat blood.  I&amp;#39;ve been on both sides of the blackout portion... all the way up until the dream... and then on the other side.... waking up in the energy body.  It&amp;#39;s those missing steps, that are so hard to stalk. I really feel like I am inches away from reaching the energy body directly... and yet those inches feel like they are as wide as the grand canyon and will take years of dedicated practice to bridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_syswo6", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false,

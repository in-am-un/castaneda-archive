I doubt don Juan knew his face would be on the basket, as it threatened to devour Pablito.\n\nSo he got what he \"deserved\", based on his own internal dialogue.\n\nBut it's just my speculation.\n\nOddly, the first time I scooped Fairy into my hand it was with the idea of putting her into a basket, so I could mail her to someone.\n\nSo I do in fact have a basket touched by an ally.   Fairy was all the way inside, at the bottom, and I could see her face down there.  I covered it up with my hand, to see if she'd stay in there.\n\nNope.  A smoke like vapor of white light floated between my fingers, and materialized as Fairy's smiling head.\n\nAgain, a reminder why don Juan called her, \"The Little Smoke\".\n\nIf it actually is her.  That's still unknown.\n\nThe sight of Fairy drifting from the basket as smoke was as close to a genie coming out of a lamp as anyone is likely to see in the real world.\n\nCholita took a fancy to that basket all by herself,  without knowing what it was.    I had left it on a shelf over the fireplace, along with a bunch of other stuff.\n\nCholita tossed out all of the other stuff, and kept just the 2 baskets.\n\nThe one Fairy has touched is in the right of the pic.\n\nI'm not sure why Cholita keeps it upside down.  It's always like that, even if she moves things around.\n\nWhen I got home yesterday Cholita was standing right there in that picture, facing the larger basket.\n\nBoth baskets are from Morongo, back in the 60s when Carlos visited there.\n\nCholita was in her exercise shorts and tank top, bending over repeatedly. Then she started rolling her hips round and round with her hands on her waist.\n\nI couldn't believe my luck!\n\nIt's nice not to get beaten up when I get home, but to get to watch her exercise is  very rare.\n\nBut then I found out, she wanted me to go up the street 4 houses and haul 45  bricks back.  Someone put a sign on them saying, they were free.\n\nAnd it was as hot as Bangkok in the summer.\n\nI was dripping sweat just to walk over and see what she was pointing to.   Cholita followed me, at a distance of 1 house so that I couldn't talk to her.\n\nWhen I got there, I couldn't find any sign.\n\nCholita was still 1 house away, so I walked over to ask her where the sign was, which said it was ok to take the bricks from someone's driveway.\n\nShe began to jog away in her thin, tiny shorts, so that I couldn't catch her.\n\nIt was almost like she was jogging in slow motion. The scene was right out of  a movie, where the female movie star jogs away, and the camera zooms in a bit closer to her butt.\n\nDarn, I wish I'd had my cellphone!\n\nI certainly wasn't feeling like complaining about it.\n\nI just went and got the bricks.\n\nHalf were to cover up a very small patch of dirt near the garage.   It's just a little dirt so you could plant something there, amidst the concrete driveway.\n\nCholita said, \"They try to get into the garage through there.\"\n\nCholita's she-shed is in that garage, complete with place to sleep. She's been doing that lately, which means I can't gain entry to the phantom copy of  the house we made.\n\nThe remaining bricks seemed to be for building a higher protection wall in the backyard, to separate the fountain area from her private garden.  The current wall is only 4 inches.  This will bring it up to 8 inches high.  There's a small break in the wall so that you can walk into the fountain area, but Cholita has a harsh cactus there, for further protection.\n\nThe \"skulls\" live in the backyard.\n\nThe first time I heard about them, the backyard hadn't yet been cleared for the fountain.\n\nCholita stood at the entrance to the backyard and asked, \"What are you going to do about those?\"\n\nShe'd just moved in.  Unfortunately, against her will.\n\nShe had no where else to live.\n\nI replied, \"I'll clear it all out, and you can do whatever you like with the entire house, except for my room.\"\n\nShe said, \"What about the skulls?  Are you going to remove those?\"\n\nHere's that quote:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI asked Pablito about his meetings with the nagual and he told me the story of his first encounter with it. He said that once don Juan gave him a basket, which he took to be a gift of good will. He placed it on a hook over the door of his room, and since he could not conceive any use for it at that moment he forgot about it all day. He said that his idea was that the basket was a gift of power and had to be put to use with something very special.\n\nDuring the early evening, which Pablito said was his deadly hour also, he walked into his room to get his jacket. He was alone in the house and was getting ready to go visit a friend. The room was dark. He grabbed the jacket and when he was about to reach the door the basket fell in front of him and rolled near his feet. Pablito said that he laughed his fright away as soon as he saw that it had only been the basket that had fallen from the hook. He leaned over to pick it up and got the jolt of his life. The basket jumped out of his reach and began to shake and squeak, as if someone were twisting and pressing down on it. Pablito said that there was enough light coming from the kitchen to clearly distinguish everything in the room. He stared at the basket for a moment, although he felt he should not do that. The basket began to convulse in the midst of some heavy, rasping and difficult breathing.\n\nPablito maintained, in recounting his experience, that he actually saw and heard the basket breathing, and that it was alive and chased him around the room, blocking his exit. He said that the basket then began to swell, all the strips of bamboo came loose and turned into a giant ball, like a dry tumbleweed that rolled towards him. He fell backwards on the floor and the ball began to crawl onto his feet. Pablito said that by that time he was out of his mind, screaming hysterically. The ball had him trapped and moved on his legs like pins going through him. He tried to push it away and then noticed that the ball was the face of don Juan with his mouth open ready to devour him. At that point he could not stand the terror and lost consciousness.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nEdited three times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cholita's Baskets", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"nmx3mycknte51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nmx3mycknte51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=664c93edbed2a22418f34baf2b25bfbe74047ad1"}, {"y": 163, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nmx3mycknte51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=035951e465a18ba9a51cbe34a9056625b9c60465"}, {"y": 241, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nmx3mycknte51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49971d38b4231566516c8160cd18d7e29a1d5a2a"}, {"y": 483, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nmx3mycknte51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6da99380ee65402f6fb45db314e3991c977f305c"}, {"y": 724, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nmx3mycknte51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48fbf36925b1127875fbbea31d79f5ef393f4fe4"}], "s": {"y": 763, "x": 1011, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nmx3mycknte51.jpg?width=1011&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96d7589012f717d062834040475d5ceb2eec009c"}, "id": "nmx3mycknte51"}}, "name": "t3_i30hzv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sEY_VviOjsN9GpCNTitKXZxpkFGZAlBpMT5cUnrBAck.jpg", "edited": 1596495005.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1596473183.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nmx3mycknte51.jpg?width=1011&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=96d7589012f717d062834040475d5ceb2eec009c\"&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s Baskets and Exercise Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the risk of being a terrible person, this &amp;quot;inspirational quote&amp;quot; (at the end) sounds to me like a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even for the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t someone  just post that they&amp;#39;d stop at nothing, if someone could do this sort of thing for them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll have to ask Fairy how to do it, since she was behind it in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess: It was Pablito who frightened Pablito.

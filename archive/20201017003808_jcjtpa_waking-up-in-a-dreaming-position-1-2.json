It was quite a chase to get to it, and it kept changing forms, but for some reason I never forgot it was my dog. On this time, I was still \"crossing\" the 2nd gate, and sometimes instead of zooming into a dream directly, I'd choose a spot and close my eyes to \"appear\" in that new place. Whenever I did this sucessfuly, I'd feel the middle of my body getting pulled and I'd be there when I opened my eyes. Though most of the time, whenever I closed my eyes, I'd completely forget where I was previously and where I wanted to 'zoom' into and I'd have to start over in whatever random scene materialized from there. This was a special case that worked (later on I stopped closing my eyes and the zoom is much more efficient in this way, at least for me) and when I finally reached my dog, it did the weirdest thing. It kinda of rolled over to show me its belly but at the same time changed to a very strange shape with multiple limbs. When it did that, I was completely frozen in place, enchanted by the vision, for some reason it seemed such an attractive sight (attention wise). Suddenly I realized that I could 'feel' the dog, literally. Like, if I pet one his limbs, I felt it on an unknown part of my body somehow. I petted it for a while and then suddenly I started feeling \"wetness\" in the limbs of the dog, like it was raining on it or something. Hell broke down when in a split second my mind simply made sense of what was happening. I was laying down on my bed, looking at my crossed arms and hands and I was drooling (presumably from 'sleeping') on my arm. So I was petting myself lol. After this, I felt like moving, but my body was really stiff and it was really hard, all I could do was look at the wall with my eyes. There, I saw that the wall was made of endless multi-colored hexagons. Very strange sight. For some reason that consumed me and I had to close my eyes. At the moment I did though, I saw a perfectly clear \"ball\" of blue energy. I felt myself propelling to it but when I got too close I lost lucidity and soon woke up.\n\nOk, that might not be the most exciting journey, but it does resemble some of the experiences I've read here in the forums. I don't think it was my energy body, it was literally me, 'half-awake'. Pretty crazy. Maybe waking up in a dreaming position? Maybe just sleepwalking?

It's obvious you can do such things, and not even worth thinking about much.\n\nYou are at the \"Place of no Pity\".\n\nIt turns out, pity is the motivation for many things we don't realize.\n\nPity makes you get excited, because you now have something to run with to your friends, to get some attention and status with them.\n\nMost of our behavior doesn't hold up, in the place of no pity.\n\nAnd then, one of  the strangest things happens out there.\n\nBut ONLY for us!\n\nI mean, only for the new subreddit lineage.\n\nI can't imagine this being discovered anywhere else because the old lineages used stalking to hide themselves, and prevent outside forces from attacking.\n\nWe're standing in the middle of a battle field, challenging all comers!\n\nOr at least I'm stuck with that job right now, but a few in here are stepping up.\n\nThis next part is hard to explain, but it turns out, everyone carries around social weapons to use in emergency.\n\nAnd one of them is a \"Pity pie\".\n\nIf you insult them, they smash you in the face with a \"Pity Pie\".\n\nAnd it stays there!\n\nIt's a brownish yellow substance, and having it all of your face makes you feel sad.\n\nIt sticks to everything, and by the end of the day, after being smashed in the face with a pity pie, it's even under your armpit, and likely smeared all over your balls.\n\nI'm doing the best here I can to describe something \"abstract\", in concrete terms.\n\nSo if you want to learn sorcery, you MUST move to the deep orange, but over there you begin to see through those \"pity pies\" everyone has in their clown outfit big pockets.\n\nYou \"see them coming\"  a mile away.\n\nIf this were a \"clown convention\", you could just smile at the attacking clown, shake your finger, and he'd instantly know you were on to him. And not hit you with a pity pie in the face.\n\nBut unfortunately, the clowns we face are more like Pennywise.\n\nFrom the movie \"It\".", "edited": 1644784468.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hwtkp9t", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t get kicked out.

But it sounds like you are saying, practice, practice, practice and then you understand and feel more comfortable with all of this.  You and Dan both speak in...mystery? Symbology?

But nowhere they look or listen reveals anything real.\n\nYou can introduce your Ally to someone, by having it \"swoop\" them.\n\nDon Juan did that with Carlos at the campfire.  The big moth flying back and forth over the fire without being burned, was Little Smoke.\n\nThe campfire, and maybe a beer the story didn't mention, gave Carlos just enough \"overlap\" with their world, to perceive the swooping motion of a large moth.\n\nCarlos introduced us to his own allies, by having them swoop us from the water cooler.\n\nI've done the same to someone in Asia.\n\nBut after 5 beers...\n\nWhat happens is, if you can pick up anything at all from the allies, now you have more \"emanations in common\".\n\nStrands of reality that are glowing, for both you and the Ally.\n\nThe introduction creates the starting connection.\n\nThat can happen on your own, by hunting for an ally.\n\nBut for the sake of this, consider that we need to get a few hundred \"strands\" glowing, to make a connection that's strong enough to pull your assemblage point to where they are fully visible.\n\nIn the middle of the J curve, all the way down to the bottom, the ally is likely just a face on a puff.\n\nTo get them super real, you have to be pulled sideways at any level.\n\nAnd to be pulled by them, means they seem as real as possible.\n\nFear is the easiest way to set that up.\n\nSo the allies like to scare people at first, because it's the only way they get full contact.\n\nIf you get over that the fear fades, you begin to play with them openly, but eventually the ally gets less and less vivid.\n\nIt's just because you no longer have fear, or intense interest, helping keep that connection alive.\n\nIt's a good reason not to get 3 allies, instead of 1.  More allies, less \"interest\" per ally. Thus they're dimmer.\n\nIf one gets very dim, you can make a new connection.\n\nLearn to say hello, talk to them, and enjoy their company from an \"emotional\" level.\n\nIt's a slow process, so don't be impatient.  It can take many days to restore a \"working link\".\n\nLove works best since it's non-destructive.\n\nTaisha used to cuddle Phoebus all night long.\n\nThe Nagual Julian seems to have been able to fake a whole range of emotions. \n\nSo much that don Juan criticized it as \"keeping the allies in bondage by dolling out emotions\".\n\nI prefer a \"project\".\n\nEngage your ally in a learning experiment.  It works well, as long as your interest in the results are intense.\n\nYou NEED the \"interest\". For good or bad.\n\nConsider that yesterday I was practicing outdoor gazing.  Just because I went for a walk around my business complex.\n\nI've reached a level of silence that's pretty good, and there's plenty of \"weird stuff\" to see. Even in daylight.\n\nAt one point a little \"Devil Wind\" came by.  Just 3 feet high, and only visible because leaves were swirling around like it was a miniature tornado.\n\nI got the idea that maybe it wasn't the wind at all, but rather an inorganic being.\n\nThat alone was enough to cause my view of reality to start to mutate into dreaming.\n\nI realized, it didn't matter if the whirlwind was a spirit or just physics at play.\n\nIt was \"unusual\".\n\nAnd that was enough of a change in the emanations that were glowing, to allow reality to mutate further.\n\nSo don't forget \"the basics\".\n\nIt's easy to create a false narrative of what you are experiencing.\n\nIn fact, it's our biggest problem.\n\n\"Re-explaining\".   Creating a new trap for our awareness.\n\nWhen in reality all that matters is silence, and which emanations you focus  your awareness on.\n\nThe story you are believing at the time, is not relevant to the process of sorcery.\n\nIt's just an \"aid\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tips for Beginners", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"0gk0ditpqkja1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53acde2c325d7da21c6b983b9885c9aaaab8b46f"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7206d86f02789503a67281c45a40ef58279d8e98"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf3e3189611f282858507fb11f7836d4b9ea282f"}, {"y": 358, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c583d45a46fdca150b14bf67409fbf0a47628b5"}, {"y": 538, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871fd737aaa63492e823946ae82989a466a46ad5"}, {"y": 605, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c914d6d762859f7ff318ff1179ef217b994eb371"}], "s": {"y": 673, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=031c04ad4cb35c8fb5f91e5a1e1f5b2964e2cf58"}, "id": "0gk0ditpqkja1"}}, "name": "t3_118a9ry", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vmn_jgT7roKu1IunBUxg8aNaqiMrSnenkaPt5FQApwo.jpg", "edited": 1677013219.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1676999340.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=031c04ad4cb35c8fb5f91e5a1e1f5b2964e2cf58\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0gk0ditpqkja1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=031c04ad4cb35c8fb5f91e5a1e1f5b2964e2cf58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a lesson on how much influence is needed, to alter the current &amp;quot;skimming&amp;quot; of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got it from Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t run to the computer to write it down, so it&amp;#39;s mostly all gone now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Manipulation of the Abstract Glue&amp;quot; was the most startling, but I can&amp;#39;t remember any of that, which can be translated to words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some of what I learned can be reconstructed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings are very VIVID at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you really do start to run into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason is FEAR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re off in their own little world, and we&amp;#39;re off in ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s very little overlap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the average person can only &amp;quot;sense&amp;quot; something creepy is around.

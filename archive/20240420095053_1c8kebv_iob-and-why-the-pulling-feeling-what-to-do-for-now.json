[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "Hello, I've gathered courage to write this post, because I'm confused about a particular experience I had that is holding back my practice. To add background, I'm reading Eagle's Gift starting from book 1, plus Art of Dreaming and both Taisha and Florinda Donner's books. I have to be honest I'm not the most disciplined person and practice Tensengrity (the basic life-saving ones and Clara's horse stand) and recapitulation when I feel something distracting my mood or creating unnecessary inventory. I have tried darkroom, but I don't feel I'm ready for that just yet. More on this later.\n\nI've had a few experiences from my childhood, one of which I believe is described in Castaneda books, and it's what I want to ask about.\n\nWhen I was about 7, I was watching TV alone and suddenly felt the worst dread and nervousness in my body. It felt like static whiteness drenching me from head down. So I rushed to my parent who was on the other side of the room, but while I was crossing the room, I saw a white illuminated floating fabric that seemed to be hanging from above. was about a meter and maybe half tall, and it moved like a long skirt in water. I was shocked at first, but what caused deep dread and freight was that I felt myself being pulled towards it, and I knew if I kept standing frozen there, I'd be dead. It was frozen in place, but at the same time pulled towards it. I willed myself to move like you would when you're in sleep paralysis and jerked my way out, towards my parents who obviously didn't believe a word I said. So believing I was crazy, I tried walking back to the TV, but I saw this the second time - the same feeling all over again. This time I KNEW it was real, then willed myself out and hid in the corner of the room until I lost consciousness. I think I lost consciousness, because there is no memory; not loss of memory from aging, but actually having no memory like when you faint.\n\nI was forced to forget about this memory and go on with life, but it's not surprising what this does to a person. Though I believe in magic especially in nature (like psychically talking to the wind), anything that is viscerally weird like that fabric or vivid dreams was pushed out of my memory as a coping mechanism. I gradually lost my 'mojo' over time. That is, until I had an awakening phase where this ghostly experience, as well as other strange memories and dreams came flooding, and I had to accept that I was not crazy and all was real. I looked into Buddhism, law of attraction, magical traditions, etc but they all lacked something central. I kept looking until I came upon Castaneda's material and got hooked into descriptions of IOBs, the feelings and techniques used in gazing. Even the tip about putting stones in between fingers... I used to ruffle up my blanket between my fingers as a kid because it made me dream better; how would I had known this as a kid? I can't live on remembering these strange habits and realise I can barely do them now, while knowing this was all real and there are people who are doing them today, thriving and experiencing freedom and magic.\n\nI side-tracked. Back to that white fabric being. I'm convinced it was an IOB, and I've read that these beings can be anything unless you communicate with it. Since that day, I have not seen it, but when I try doing darkroom or anything that uses second attention, I chicken out because I feel that IOB wil appear and I won't be able to will myself out and get killed.\n\nBut this is fright talk, right? Or is it actually something I have to be aware of and take things slower, like not engaging in darkroom until I do more recapitulation or dreaming? Or all this talk indulging and I just need to get over it?\n\nAlso a few months ago, after an hour of recap and Clara's Tensengrity move from 'The Sorcerer's Crossing', my left ear drum made 4 automatic knocks (?). It was beating by itself and very loudly. I was a little scared, because I didn't expect it and thought I might face something that will screw me up.

Don't doubt you can do that! I do it all the time, but not nearly as often as I'd like. And that's what sorcery is all about. Learning to repeat stuff, by \"Cleaning the Link to Intent\".\n\nMaybe a story will explain why you can't repeat the cool magic you discover using sorcery. It's so obvious, but seems so mysterious.\n\nI originally thought, it's because the first time you are using new emanations, and more energy is released. And then the second time, it's mostly used up.\n\nThat's true also.  But later when you've gone everywhere and done what seems to be everything,  so that there's no huge bursts of \"new energy\" left within reach, yet it still happens that repeating stuff is hard, a new explanation comes to the surface.\n\nThe one don Juan gave us in the first place!\n\nAnd hopefully this picture will explain why you don't need to worry if the puffs of your energy body you scoop up in darkness need you to turn your head to make it look like they are following your hand. See the unbending intent long form video just past the 5 minute mark to notice that tensegrity is designed that way also.\n\nThe story: A 4 year old loves Big Bird. Personally, I hate that big dumb chicken. Almost as much as screeching Shaman Eagles flying to warn Walker, Texas Ranger, of danger.\n\nDirty birds those carnivores are.\n\nBut to please your kid you buy a giant chicken suit, take him to the park, and ask him to go exploring because there's a surprise.\n\nYou put on the giant chicken suit and surprise him behind some bushes. He's overjoyed with happiness to see the huge yellow creepy bird.\n\nWhich hangs out with midget puppets all the time, and weird angry creatures who live in trash cans. It's like the inorganic being's world!\n\nYou can't repeat that trick for your kid the next day?\n\nWhat kind of an idiot would expect the same reaction from a previously \"innocent\" 4 year old, twice in a row?\n\nHe'd be \"on to you\". Probably already laughing as he approached the bushes from where you emerged the last time.\n\nThat's what happens when you try to repeat cool magic. You already expect it. So your \"link to intent\" is dirty and the results are all mangled, or don't work at all.\n\nThat's the difference between real magic, and pretend magic. Pretend magic always works, and everyone is like superman. That's because it's NONSENSE.\n\nAsian mysticism is a con game designed to steal. Don't fall for it! Do you really want to be a lame \"Buddha Boy\"? Sitting with a stupid grin, hoping someone will snap your photo and upload it so you can let everyone know how \"superior\" you are, because you're happy and they're not?\n\nReal magic is unreliable and difficult, and scary at times. But when it works it will literally bring tears to your eyes.\n\nIn fact, Iron Man in that picture looks a bit teary eyed too.\n\nThink I exaggerate with the iron man suit?\n\nNope. The real thing is 10 times better than that picture! I just can't post that sort of thing anymore. Beginners need to concentrate on finding colors in darkness while learning to be silent. Leave the \"Iron Man Suit\" for much later.\n\nSo how do you overcome non-directionality?\n\nYou don't.  It's a matter of how far sideways your assemblage point has moved.\n\nIf it stays in the middle, so does the non-directionality!\n\nPerhaps even at the far reaches of the J curve!\n\nIt's because the horizontal shift is a measure of how much your tonal has shrunk, and how much your double has taken over your perception.\n\nBut when you get to the end of the J curve, you won't care about that.\n\nYou'll have bigger birds to fry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Three pouches  \\(green, red, yellow\\) and the double behind \\(blue\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7fd6v9jflal91.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5de250619e3c752fa99afb12f72819fab98602b4)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Directionality Vs.

You have to &amp;quot;be there&amp;quot;, and then notice it&amp;#39;s available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can cause phantom rooms to &amp;quot;bloom&amp;quot; into full realness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe I have 4 of them at this point.  You can &amp;quot;save them up&amp;quot; as a collection you can recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Force silence to loosen the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do tensegrity to cause it to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for colors in the darkness, to help move the assemblage point downwards, instead of towards the fantasies and fussiness you can&amp;#39;t yet remove from your mind.  Those are up at your shoulder blades (the blue line).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Play with what you see as if it were real.  That moves the assemblage point horizontally where you find it, so that the double gets a bit more control over the situation and you can borrow his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are sitting on the bed like a lazy Buddha with your eyes closed, you are royally screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got to follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or try another sorcery path.

I still didn't follow your line of thought.  It just seemed, \"off track\" to me.\n\nDarkroom is both a doing, and a not-doing. Take your pick.\n\nIt starts as a not-doing perhaps, because it's NUTS that you'd see anything real in darkness.\n\nBut as you see more and more and some just can't be explained away, it becomes a doing.\n\nThat's ok.  Doings aren't automatically \"bad\", and not-doings \"good\".\n\nOr at least, if you are following darkroom instructions well, it's not a consideration at all.\n\nBecause the only thing you should be \"doing\" is forcing silence.\n\nAnd some tensegrity so that there's a chance to see the puffs (the energy body that comes closer when you do tensegrity).\n\nWhen you forget to force better and better silence, you stop at your current level of achievement and don't completely understand why that happened.\n\nPerhaps the coolest stuff mostly happens with new levels of silence?\n\n  \nBut when you see something you like and try to repeat it, you've possibly de-emphasized the most important thing.\n\nDeeper and deeper levels of silence.\n\nSo if you want to repeat something, one method is to just say so out loud, then forget about it.\n\nAs if you have a wealthy uncle hiding in the room, and the best you can do is ask.  If he wants to help, great. If not, you tried.\n\nThat's the only way you'll be able to do it, outside of SK mode.  By *intending* it.\n\nAnd we don't control that. We can only summon the intent, and if our link isn't clean it won't work.\n\nSo no reason to \"try\" to do anything.  Just ask, and if you don't get it you just have to accept that for now.\n\nYou won't be able to follow this advice, but hearing it will speed up when you can.\n\nThe opposite of this is to realize that the assemblage point moves along the J curve, even if nothing cool seems to have materialized.\n\nThere are \"general sights\" associated with a position.\n\nSo soon you'll learn the green line sights, the red line ones, the orange, and the purple.\n\nThat's something you CAN repeat.

Like electricity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re more like a monkey wrench, messing up the machinery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the next day you go to toss it in there again, and you find it&amp;#39;s grown over. Sealed.  Can&amp;#39;t toss it into there again, and cause the same thing to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not to worry!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s 10,000 more on their way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are doomed to learn one tiny magical result at a time, never able to repeat anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until we reach silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, everything becomes easy and obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_x394xi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/x394xi/directionality_vs_nondirectionality_and_how_to/imz9nzg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1662241895.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "imz3xms", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dorbim", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1662239419.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_x394xi", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_b5vqacf2", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt;Maybe a story will explain why you can't repeat the cool magic you discover using sorcery.

I\u2019m asking.\n\nI\u2019m not answering.\n\nLast night I was continuing to try to intercept Cholita\u2019s dreams, but got interested in how it was possible to manifest any visible scene at all. I\u2019ve learned to \u201cburn\u201d Cholita's  purple dreaming fog with silence, and it results in a viewable dreaming scene nearly every time.\n\nAround 6 months ago we had a discussion in here about the frustrating fact that, even if you do something completely wonderful, that doesn\u2019t mean you can do that again.\n\nYou work your butt off, get something magical to happen, and you think you\u2019ve \u201carrived\u201d.\n\nNow you can stuff that ability into your Quikoin purse, and continue to fatten it up until it bursts open, unable to hold more,  and you can be a **real** sorcerer.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t work that way\u2026\n\nBut you can learn to do whatever you did, that summoned the cool phenomena.\n\nIt\u2019s the technical expertise you can gain.\n\nWhat it summons isn\u2019t under your control at first.\n\nI\u2019m not sure it ever is.\n\nIf you read between the lines, don Juan seems to just \u201cgo with the flow\u201d from time to time, giving the impression things were controlled and planned.\n\nAlong the way of developing dreaming abilities, you\u2019ll encounter \u201cthe Nagual\u201d.\n\nI ran into it last night. I switched back and forth between viewing it, and not viewing it.\n\nWhile viewing it, it was impossible to think about. And certainly I couldn\u2019t have talked about it.\n\nDon Juan defined the Nagual as all the delusional stuff society has decided to toss out.\n\nThe refuse. The junk. The impossible.\n\nYou can't talk about it, or even think about it.\n\nIt\u2019s outside the Island of the Tonal.\n\n**But**, you can \u201chandle\u201d it.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nThe picture you see is all I could retain of last night's view of \"the Nagual\".\n\nMinus the nipple. I suspect that the Nagual has no nipple, but I couldn't bet my coin purse on it.\n\nI saw a red/orange structure, folded over on itself, flowing along. It conveyed a message, but it couldn\u2019t be put in words.\n\nThe message was more like a feeling. A positive one, but very abstract.\n\nAs it flowed, I realized that the flow could be continuous. I might experience one aspect of the Nagual after the other, until it seemed to be an entire world I could interact with.\n\nBut the interaction was beyond my abilities.  It was too \u201cabstract\u201d.\n\nAlthough it was abstract, I just *knew*, that came from the Nagual.\n\nCarlos used to talk about \u201cabstract dreaming\u201d. It was more like a warning. Each time, I got the impression someone in private classes had run into it, it became a barrier, and as a consolation prize Carlos brought it up in class.\n\nMaybe to encourage the person by giving their new experience a name. And some group recognition, even if the person wasn't named.\n\nAbstract dreaming became a barrier for me, shortly before Cholita came along. I'd be practicing my waking dreaming, but get stuck in a vision I couldn't escape.\n\nIt would hold me there for hours, so that I had no time left for waking dreaming.\n\nMy theory at the time was, inorganic beings had captured my attention by focusing it on something, and were holding me there.\n\nSince Cholita came to live with me, it\u2019s not a barrier. I can observe it more closely, without completely blanking out. And coincidentally, or not, the inorganics influence on my *dreaming* has been greatly reduced. They seem to be afraid of Cholita, and only make small appearances, in my hand or on my lap.\n\nThat's intriguing, because at this point, I also only make small appearances in my own home.\n\nCholita's madness requires me to be scarce most of the time.  Which is fine by me. I'd rather lock myself in my room, in the darkness.  There's so much to gain.\n\nSo here\u2019s my question. I\u2019ve been banned from reading the books by Carlos himself, and if I don\u2019t honor his instructions I suffer a huge loss.\n\nI'd have to read all the books again, to find all the places needed to resolve this simple question:\n\nIs the Nagual the same as dreaming awake?\n\nIt can\u2019t be!  Dreaming awake is like the Tonal, except at a different level.\n\nIs the Nagual the dark man people see?\n\nIf you force yourself silent for hours, participate in waking dreaming for a few of those, and then finally decide to stop the world, you might easily run into the \u201cdark man\u201d.\n\nYou can also run into it as a beginner, just by doing a lot of semi-lucid dreaming.  It seems to take an interest and \"show up\".\n\nThe Chinese bosses\u2019 son, who only practices sorcery by absorption, saw the dark man last week.\n\nHe said the man was completely black, but he still *knew* it was him. Himself.\n\nIs that \u201cthe Nagual\u201d?\n\nIf it is, how come it wears clothes?  I even saw it with a hat once.\n\nBut I sure wouldn't have had the courage to ask him about that.\n\nCouldn't that be an inorganic being, in dreaming form?\n\nI\u2019m really puzzled about where the dividing line is between \u201cthe nagual\u201d,  inorganic beings, and *dreaming*.\n\nBut the expertise in this group might be able to find the right inspirational quotes to resolve this.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nI guess it's possible to search the pdf for \"nagual\", and resolve this, but it would take many searches.  That would be nearly the same as reading his books again.\n\nEdited: twice", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What is The Nagual?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 84, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6h73digeghz31": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 65, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6h73digeghz31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb218ea5420b1f54b2298eb95870455d16c17078"}, {"y": 130, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6h73digeghz31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddc064a7fff55d345c165220e8c21e13fa00a0aa"}, {"y": 192, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6h73digeghz31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c58f088b359bc24aff66b277914db5c0ba484b9"}, {"y": 385, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6h73digeghz31.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f79b1242f635b8ccda3bb119ebfdf5d925a14a2d"}, {"y": 578, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6h73digeghz31.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f001aec5058c9d5b4fd537898324311e8ad91298"}], "s": {"y": 581, "x": 964, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6h73digeghz31.jpg?width=964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cec1e6d11ca37b7f01d7be2b8e520a8237996216"}, "id": "6h73digeghz31"}}, "name": "t3_dy6s9j", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TgzJYT8o-yL62OVxK9nbHW6K0Zqp9H11CFsPw5bDv5U.jpg", "edited": 1574102061.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1574100210.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6h73digeghz31.jpg?width=964&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cec1e6d11ca37b7f01d7be2b8e520a8237996216\"&gt;A Quikoin Purse from the Amazing Plastics Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is The Nagual?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really!

Most of the truths about awareness were discovered by the old seers, he said. But the order in which they were arranged had been worked out by the new seers. And without that order those truths were nearly incomprehensible. He said that not to seek order was one of the great mistakes that the ancient seers made. A deadly consequence of that mistake was their assumption that the unknown and the unknowable are the same thing.  It was up to the new seers to correct that error. They set up boundaries and defined the unknown as something that is veiled from man, shrouded perhaps by a terrifying context, but which, nonetheless, is within man\u2019s reach. The unknown becomes the known at a given time. The unknowable, on the other hand, is the indescribable, the unthinkable, the unrealizable. It is something that will never be known to us, and yet it is there, dazzling and at the same time horrifying in its vastness. \u201eHow can seers make the distinction between the two?\u201d I asked. \u201eThere is a simple rule of thumb,\u201d he said. \u201eIn the face of the unknown, man is adventurous. It is a quality of the unknown to give us a sense of hope and happiness. Man feels robust, exhilarated. Even the apprehension that it arouses is very fulfilling. The new seers saw that man is at his best in the face of the unknown.\u201d He said that whenever what is taken to be the unknown turns out to be the unknowable the results are disastrous. Seers feel drained, confused. A terrible oppression takes possession of them. Their bodies lose tone, their reasoning and sobriety wander away aimlessly, for the unknowable has no energizing effects whatsoever. It is not within human reach; therefore, it should not be intruded upon foolishly or even prudently. The new seers realized that they had to be prepared to pay exorbitant prices for the faintest contact with it. Don Juan explained that the new seers had had formidable barriers of tradition to overcome. At the time when the new cycle began, none of them knew for certain which procedures of their immense tradition were the right ones and which were not. Obviously, something had gone wrong with the ancient seers, but the new seers did not know what. They began by assuming that everything their predecessors had done was erroneous. Those ancient seers had been the masters of conjecture. They had, for one thing, assumed that their proficiency in seeing was a safeguard. They thought that they were untouchable?that is, until the invaders smashed them, and put most of them to horrendous \n\ndeaths. The ancient seers had no protection whatsoever, despite their total certainty that they were invulnerable. The new seers did not waste their time in speculations about what went wrong. Instead, they began to map the unknown in order to separate it from the unknowable. \u201eHow did they map the unknown, don Juan?\u201d I asked. \u201eThrough the controlled use of seeing,\u201d he replied. I said that what I had meant to ask was, what was entailed in mapping the unknown? He answered that mapping the unknown means making it available to our perception. By steadily practicing seeing, the new seers found that the unknown and the known are really on the same footing, because both are within the reach of human perception. Seers, in fact, can leave the known at a given moment and enter into the unknown. Whatever is beyond our capacity to perceive is the unknowable. And the distinction between it and the knowable is crucial. Confusing the two would put seers in a most precarious position whenever they are confronted with the unknowable. \u201eWhen this happened to the ancient seers,\u201d don Juan went on, \u201ethey thought their procedures had gone haywire.

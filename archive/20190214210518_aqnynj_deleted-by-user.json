Carlos himself was nice enough to say so.  But there's just a huge range of it, and it's a shame if people set up expectations that make it impossible to notice when they start to do it.  \n\nAnytime you have a vision due to your own efforts, that's seeing. Might be crummy seeing, might be only phantoms that you saw, but it's along the same path.  And you need to notice it as soon as possible or suffer the same fate as most of Carlos' students.  \n\nMost were lazy to begin with, waiting around for Carlos to do something for them.  Some practiced hard, but with the guru/disciple relationship,  perpetual beginners are almost guaranteed.   \n\nI'm sure Carlos knew if anyone would make progress, it would be after he was gone. While a guru is in place, students police themselves, based on jealousy or trying to win points with the guru.  They become territorial, and add to the fear of asking good questions.  \n\nYou end up with reverse magical thinking. This is magic, this isn't, that's good enough,  that isn't.  Such territorial behavior attempts to suppress anything that doesn't fit into it's new, social pecking order.  We have plenty of that in the Catholic, Buddhist, Daoist, and Hindu communities.  \n\nAlthough the Hindus have a good gimmick. They adopt any new ideas as their own.\n\nAmy was very close to Carlos. When he came in the room, she was often at his side.  I suspect Carlos knew she'd write a contrary book when she left.  He encouraged her in those kinds of things.\n\nIt was probably his plan in fact, seeing as how he wrote that lineages break themselves apart when the previous leader leaves.  I believe that's to give everyone a true choice, since sorcerery won't necessarily make your life better.  And the chance of success if you don't do it on your own power is practically 0.\n\nCult leader?  Not by choice.  He was horrified when the heaven's gate people killed themselves.  He was sort of querying to see if any in his classes might do something stupid like that.  He certainly didn't start a cult to get women. Carlos was famous for having various women hanging on his arm, at Martial Arts picnics and Indian reservation festivals.  People who knew him  used to warn the young ones to stay away from him.\n\nMy belief?  He messed with the women too much.  However, women are really difficult to manage in that kind of a group.

But there&amp;#39;s just a huge range of it, and it&amp;#39;s a shame if people set up expectations that make it impossible to notice when they start to do it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anytime you have a vision due to your own efforts, that&amp;#39;s seeing. Might be crummy seeing, might be only phantoms that you saw, but it&amp;#39;s along the same path.  And you need to notice it as soon as possible or suffer the same fate as most of Carlos&amp;#39; students.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most were lazy to begin with, waiting around for Carlos to do something for them.  Some practiced hard, but with the guru/disciple relationship,  perpetual beginners are almost guaranteed.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure Carlos knew if anyone would make progress, it would be after he was gone. While a guru is in place, students police themselves, based on jealousy or trying to win points with the guru.  They become territorial, and add to the fear of asking good questions.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You end up with reverse magical thinking. This is magic, this isn&amp;#39;t, that&amp;#39;s good enough,  that isn&amp;#39;t.  Such territorial behavior attempts to suppress anything that doesn&amp;#39;t fit into it&amp;#39;s new, social pecking order.  We have plenty of that in the Catholic, Buddhist, Daoist, and Hindu communities.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although the Hindus have a good gimmick. They adopt any new ideas as their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy was very close to Carlos. When he came in the room, she was often at his side.  I suspect Carlos knew she&amp;#39;d write a contrary book when she left.  He encouraged her in those kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was probably his plan in fact, seeing as how he wrote that lineages break themselves apart when the previous leader leaves.  I believe that&amp;#39;s to give everyone a true choice, since sorcerery won&amp;#39;t necessarily make your life better.  And the chance of success if you don&amp;#39;t do it on your own power is practically 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cult leader?  Not by choice.  He was horrified when the heaven&amp;#39;s gate people killed themselves.  He was sort of querying to see if any in his classes might do something stupid like that.  He certainly didn&amp;#39;t start a cult to get women. Carlos was famous for having various women hanging on his arm, at Martial Arts picnics and Indian reservation festivals.  People who knew him  used to warn the young ones to stay away from him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My belief?  He messed with the women too much.  However, women are really difficult to manage in that kind of a group.  Maybe he simply found a way that wasn&amp;#39;t all that socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_aqnynj", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/aqnynj/deleted_by_user/ego2m42/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1550420942.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "egmx0d4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_egm64d5", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "I get what you're talking about, but I don't think that's the *seeing* Don Juan referred to.\n\nAlso, what do you think of Amy Wallace and her book?

Some people have blockages in that regards.  No one's ever told me what's bothering them that can't be resolved by more recapitulation, but it does seem to happen.

Carlos made fun of mine, but some darned wonderful things happened to me in that crate.

I was recapitulating several hours a day.\n\nAfter months of that, I was in the crate recapitulating and my head kept stopping midway. I'd blank out.  When I realized I'd blanked out, I resumed moving my head (and breathing of course) in the direction it was going, but it stopped again before I completed even 1 sweep.  That kept happening until in the course of 10 minutes, I probably only completed 2 sweeps.\n\nI became aware that when I was \"blanked out\",  I was actually looking into a tunnel of light.

I wanted to know if that lock was still in place.\n\nHalfway to the other room, I realized something was weird about the curtains in the living room. I couldn't put my finger on it. The shadows were too dark. Or maybe they were moving slightly.  But everything else seemed absolutely normal.  I jumped up and down a little,  to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  Nope, it was all normal.  It even seemed silly to be so suspicious.\n\nThen I felt something so creepy in that living room, that it could only have been alien.  I froze in terror on the spot, unable to even turn to see what was there. But my body started lifting up into the air.  It floated until my head was nearly going to hit the ceiling.\n\nI was in dreaming!   And I still had no answer on how I got out of the crate.  I managed to get myself to sink down onto the floor again, went to check the crate, but everything looked normal.

What works for some won&amp;#39;t work for others. If moving your head and breathing a certain way is distracting for you, try something different. Analyze your technique to find what works or doesn&amp;#39;t. Happy Dreaming!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/aqnynj/deleted_by_user/egj8y7u/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1550244998.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_aqnynj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}]

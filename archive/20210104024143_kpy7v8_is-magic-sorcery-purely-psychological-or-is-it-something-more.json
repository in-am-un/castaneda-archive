I heard Carlos complain about him on several occasions.\n\nHe's yet another dishonest angry man, who tries to dominate the Castaneda world by pretending to have knowledge.\n\nWe have to fight those off in here, on average every 3 weeks.\n\nVictor tricks people with made up sorcery, mixed with stuff Carlos was teaching,  and speculations which seem logical extensions but have no basis in fact, all just to get money.\n\nFor money!  He's close to a murderer in my book, because he kills people's chances to escape to freedom.\n\nBut the main problem is, he makes it nearly impossible for you to get assistance from \"intent\".  Intent is a magical force.  Probably the only one we have available to us, unless you want to count spirits.\n\n**Without** the help of intent, it's like being 8 years old and trying to lift 300 pounds.\n\n**With** help from intent, it's like having Arnold Schwarzenegger standing behind you, invisible, but able to help you lift without you realizing he was doing that.\n\nVictor is pure poison!\n\nAs to your question:\n\nSo far I've walked through solid walls, leaped into portals which appeared in front of me, remaining in another world for hours, I've followed a witch into a phantom copy of the house she created, then walked right back out and directly into the shower, to go to work.\n\nI've seen more than 15 objects move by themselves, after I spent a lot of time playing with my spirit friend, \"Fairy\".\n\nI've had my \"evil\" spirit friend, \"Fancy\", create huge commotions in my normally silent warehouse.\n\nThey can only push around 2 ounces as far as I have discovered, but with 2 ounces you can break a plastic bag filled with metal parts, hanging on a shelf.   Just push the sharpest into the side of the bag.\n\nThe resulting sound can be like a train wreck in the next room. In the wild, they can topple old trees, using just that small push.  They're far more intelligent than we are, due to their extreme age.  So to figure out how to make a tree crash down on you from above, using only a 2 ounce force, is not even difficult for them.\n\nI once had dim sim with my witch enemy Cholita, who absolutely despises me. But for some reason that day, she was in a friendly mood.\n\nShe even showed me her luminous body for an instant.\n\nWhile we ate, she asked me about Redditt.\n\n\"What are your little friends up to these days?\"\n\nOr it could have  been (it's been a long time), \"How are your little friends on Reddit?  Still making millions off me, and never giving me my share?\"\n\nShe's said both versions before, quite a few times.  And add to that, \"Do they want to drink my blood too?\"  Or, when I asked her to let me video tap levitation she said, \"What, am I Jesus now, to save the world?  Do I have to be the virgin sacrifice too?\"\n\nBut she was sort of friendly that evening. And ordered nearly everything on the menu.\n\nThe table was covered in food I couldn't eat due to food allergies.\n\nI was explaining levitation to her,  and how it's significant to \"prove\" there's a physical side to sorcery, when she glanced down at a dim sum plate.\n\n\"Fairy\", her inorganic being spirit, flew under the plate. I could visibly see it, in full restaurant lighting.\n\nFairy looked like a golf ball sized perfect puff of white smoke,  not dissipated by the air.  Sparkling lines of yellow and white were visible in the center of the puff. It was \"alive\".\n\nIt flew at a fairly fast rate.  You might have been able to grab it, but not without seeing it coming.\n\nThe plate jumped 1 to 2 inches up. Straight up.\n\nI shouted, \"There Cholita!  Like that!!!\"\n\n\"I didn't know you could do that.  Can you do it again?\"\n\nCholita was looking straight into my eyes. Her eyes had turned blood red, and they were watery as if she were really angry.

Who told you to read that nonsense?\n\nI wish you'd go explain to them, it's not nice to expose people to Victor.\n\nIt's like giving out poison candy.", "edited": 1609785079.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gi2wydy", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toss out Victor&amp;#39;s book!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s harmful to anyone who wants to learn sorcery!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Victor was an enemy of Carlos.   I heard Carlos complain about him on several occasions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s yet another dishonest angry man, who tries to dominate the Castaneda world by pretending to have knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to fight those off in here, on average every 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Victor tricks people with made up sorcery, mixed with stuff Carlos was teaching,  and speculations which seem logical extensions but have no basis in fact, all just to get money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For money!  He&amp;#39;s close to a murderer in my book, because he kills people&amp;#39;s chances to escape to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the main problem is, he makes it nearly impossible for you to get assistance from &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.  Intent is a magical force.  Probably the only one we have available to us, unless you want to count spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without&lt;/strong&gt; the help of intent, it&amp;#39;s like being 8 years old and trying to lift 300 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With&lt;/strong&gt; help from intent, it&amp;#39;s like having Arnold Schwarzenegger standing behind you, invisible, but able to help you lift without you realizing he was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Victor is pure poison!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to your question:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve walked through solid walls, leaped into portals which appeared in front of me, remaining in another world for hours, I&amp;#39;ve followed a witch into a phantom copy of the house she created, then walked right back out and directly into the shower, to go to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen more than 15 objects move by themselves, after I spent a lot of time playing with my spirit friend, &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had my &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; spirit friend, &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;, create huge commotions in my normally silent warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can only push around 2 ounces as far as I have discovered, but with 2 ounces you can break a plastic bag filled with metal parts, hanging on a shelf.   Just push the sharpest into the side of the bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The resulting sound can be like a train wreck in the next room. In the wild, they can topple old trees, using just that small push.  They&amp;#39;re far more intelligent than we are, due to their extreme age.  So to figure out how to make a tree crash down on you from above, using only a 2 ounce force, is not even difficult for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once had dim sim with my witch enemy Cholita, who absolutely despises me. But for some reason that day, she was in a friendly mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even showed me her luminous body for an instant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we ate, she asked me about Redditt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are your little friends up to these days?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it could have  been (it&amp;#39;s been a long time), &amp;quot;How are your little friends on Reddit?  Still making millions off me, and never giving me my share?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s said both versions before, quite a few times.  And add to that, &amp;quot;Do they want to drink my blood too?&amp;quot;  Or, when I asked her to let me video tap levitation she said, &amp;quot;What, am I Jesus now, to save the world?  Do I have to be the virgin sacrifice too?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she was sort of friendly that evening. And ordered nearly everything on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The table was covered in food I couldn&amp;#39;t eat due to food allergies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was explaining levitation to her,  and how it&amp;#39;s significant to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; there&amp;#39;s a physical side to sorcery, when she glanced down at a dim sum plate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot;, her inorganic being spirit, flew under the plate. I could visibly see it, in full restaurant lighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy looked like a golf ball sized perfect puff of white smoke,  not dissipated by the air.  Sparkling lines of yellow and white were visible in the center of the puff. It was &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It flew at a fairly fast rate.  You might have been able to grab it, but not without seeing it coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plate jumped 1 to 2 inches up. Straight up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouted, &amp;quot;There Cholita!  Like that!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know you could do that.  Can you do it again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was looking straight into my eyes. Her eyes had turned blood red, and they were watery as if she were really angry.  She didn&amp;#39;t want to give me the satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But out of spite, since I can&amp;#39;t do that myself, she glanced down again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plate slid to the right 1 inch.  But at such a slow speed, it was not humanly possible to do that.

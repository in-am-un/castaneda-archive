Only 1 in 100 will put aside the time to learn. Of 5 of those, only 1 will become a seer.\n\nThe other 4 will realize it's all true, but prefer to feel cozy and comfortable in their normal social life.  Sorcery is a bit \"cold\".\n\n\"Bad Players\" probably covers the groupies also. There's groupies in here for sure, but there's no way to make a rule against it.  They may seem harmless, but in fact they are not.\n\nA bad player is someone who comes to play the game with the team, but has his eyes on something else. He isn't really interested in playing the game.\n\nThe coaches wife?   Friends he can't get on his own because he's a really nasty person.\n\nTo be a coach himself one day?\n\nDoesn't matter, because they don't really play the game well at all, and drag everyone else down.\n\nOur magic could NEVER come from the general population.\n\nIt's the result of thousands of unbroken years, of the proto-siberians who crossed  the Bering Straits and traveled all the way down to eastern mexico, finding themselves in a tropical paradise.\n\nThe form of shamanism they brought, likely not nearly as powerful as what we have now, had a chance to grow, greed free.\n\nThere was no money, no agriculture to create concentrations of food you could beg or steal, and no huge population you could impress, so that they kept you fed and warm.\n\nIt was each man for himself, but in paradise.\n\nThey mapped out the enormous quagmire of the second attention, reached the status of seer, and gained access to all of human knowledge.\n\nPast or present.  Even future, but as Yoda said \"Always in flux the future is.\"\n\nNothing even remotely like what we have could ever evolve once agriculture and money were invented.\n\nSo anything not at least 5000 years old, is make mostly make believe.\n\nIt was just endless stealing of the years since then.\n\nAny real magic was buried over by greed.\n\nAmong the bad players are \"book deal\" minded people, and \"groupies\".\n\nWe know the book deal minded, but it's easy to feel pity for them and assume they are not.\n\nBut it's so obvious, I actually had a stellar inorganic being looking me in the face last night, to try to get me to see past socialization.\n\nPlus she taught me other things that are far more interesting.  But for this subreddit, her alien attitude towards humans is very useful.\n\nShe has no conception of self-pity at all.  So she can't be manipulated by humans as they are now.\n\nA good example of self-pity hiding the book deal mind, is the post about \"Darkroom is too hard, let's all be perfect impeccable warriors\".\n\nThat was just an attempt to steal from the subreddit, by pulling people away from hard work, and towards pretending.  To \"restore\" the reputation of pretending, which has controlled the Castaneda community for 50 years.\n\nLike every other magic system in the world.  All pretending.\n\nThe author no doubt wants to make a franchise of pretend sorcery for himself some day.\n\nIt's so obvious what's going on with such things, but we're so filled with self-pity that we can't easily see it.\n\nThe groupies are just as bad.  They try to gain attention from others, by hooking themselves to a leader others admire.\n\nThey make up stories of magic they witnessed, those stories accumulate, and pretty soon you can write entire books about the \"magic\" that fake guru has.  How can it all be a lie?\n\nBut it is.\n\nIf you want to really learn, you have to protect yourself from being either type of bad player.\n\nDon't think of being a \"teacher\".  It's still a teacher, if you want to \"scientifically document this for the whole world\".\n\nIt's still a teacher if you want to \"find an easier way so more can succeed\".\n\nDon't teach, before you learn.  That may work in academia, but it's death to learning sorcery. Sorcery is \"the mastery of intent\".\n\nAnd mastering it, requires controlling even trace thoughts and expectations.  \n\nTrace...  Tiny little traces of wants and needs, derail the mastery of intent.\n\nTo avoid being a groupie, when you find yourself salivating over a \"magic man\" others are showing off in books or chat groups, always ask \"Who did he teach?  Show me the people actively discussing it.  If there's none now, how come?\"\n\nAnd, keep an eye on yourself. We aren't here to sooth ourselves with the \"wise words\" of some leader.\n\nGo away if that's your goal.  You harm others.\n\nWe're only here to learn.\n\nOnce you can \"read text from infinity\", and can prove it with a test we'll devise using Cholita, then go ahead and create a franchise for yourself.\n\nOr once you can truly share dreaming with others, which we'll also figure out how to test, then you can make a dreaming / tarot card reading / crystal ball vision therapy providing, witch business.\n\nNo one will complain about that.\n\nBut you'll be one of very few of those.\n\nFlorinda's book describes what the others are like.", "edited": 1670856779.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_izx5qre", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s something from the advanced subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll leave out the Buddha bashing even though he richly deserves it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All &amp;quot;magic men&amp;quot; out there are the creation of groupies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that there are real magic men out there, but they wouldn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with the public if it can at all be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s hopeless to try to teach what they know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This subreddit has proven it.

So she can&amp;#39;t be manipulated by humans as they are now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good example of self-pity hiding the book deal mind, is the post about &amp;quot;Darkroom is too hard, let&amp;#39;s all be perfect impeccable warriors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was just an attempt to steal from the subreddit, by pulling people away from hard work, and towards pretending.  To &amp;quot;restore&amp;quot; the reputation of pretending, which has controlled the Castaneda community for 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like every other magic system in the world.  All pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The author no doubt wants to make a franchise of pretend sorcery for himself some day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so obvious what&amp;#39;s going on with such things, but we&amp;#39;re so filled with self-pity that we can&amp;#39;t easily see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The groupies are just as bad.  They try to gain attention from others, by hooking themselves to a leader others admire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They make up stories of magic they witnessed, those stories accumulate, and pretty soon you can write entire books about the &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; that fake guru has.  How can it all be a lie?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to really learn, you have to protect yourself from being either type of bad player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t think of being a &amp;quot;teacher&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s still a teacher, if you want to &amp;quot;scientifically document this for the whole world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still a teacher if you want to &amp;quot;find an easier way so more can succeed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t teach, before you learn.  That may work in academia, but it&amp;#39;s death to learning sorcery. Sorcery is &amp;quot;the mastery of intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And mastering it, requires controlling even trace thoughts and expectations.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trace...  Tiny little traces of wants and needs, derail the mastery of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To avoid being a groupie, when you find yourself salivating over a &amp;quot;magic man&amp;quot; others are showing off in books or chat groups, always ask &amp;quot;Who did he teach?  Show me the people actively discussing it.  If there&amp;#39;s none now, how come?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, keep an eye on yourself. We aren&amp;#39;t here to sooth ourselves with the &amp;quot;wise words&amp;quot; of some leader.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go away if that&amp;#39;s your goal.  You harm others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re only here to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can &amp;quot;read text from infinity&amp;quot;, and can prove it with a test we&amp;#39;ll devise using Cholita, then go ahead and create a franchise for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or once you can truly share dreaming with others, which we&amp;#39;ll also figure out how to test, then you can make a dreaming / tarot card reading / crystal ball vision therapy providing, witch business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one will complain about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll be one of very few of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Florinda&amp;#39;s book describes what the others are like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zjyedi/breaking_down_our_barriers/izx5qre/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670856241.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zjyedi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 18}}], "before": null}}]

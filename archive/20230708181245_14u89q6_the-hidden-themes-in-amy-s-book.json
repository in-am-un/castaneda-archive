And the \"intent of sex\" is surely something they managed to modify.\n\nWhich we're stuck with now, as our only real path to where they managed to travel over thousands of years.\n\nIt's how \"intent\" works.\n\nThere's an excellent quote in there on that.  About why asian mysticism works:\n\n\\*\\*\\* from Lidotska's \"Notes from Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice\" \\*\\*\\*\n\nFirst she talked about intent. I asked her why practices like Buddhist chanting worked for some people.

No reason you ought to get your own little throne over that.\n\nIt's hardly useful in my opinion. We blow past that in 5 minutes of darkroom, disappointed until we get to the red zone.  Where Asian mysticism pretty much never reaches.\n\nYou can get that green line shift in many ways. It's always been available to humans if they just reduce that internal dialogue by whatever method causes the sensations of green line bliss and minor visions, done repeatedly until you can get there reliably.\n\nAsian mysticism does work to move the assemblage point.\n\nA few inches.\n\nOut of the 10 or more FEET that sorcerers move it.\n\nIt works, because it was \"intended\" to work.\n\nA topic for a different time.\n\nBut back to the inner circle of Carlos hiding their sex activities, and those of the lineage.  Even in the books.\n\nIncluding don Juan at 90 years old being implied to have had sex with Florinda.\n\nWhich might clarify why Florinda made an offer to me, towards the end,  through Corey.\n\nA last ditch attempt to get someone's assemblage point to move significantly.\n\nI do vaguely recall la Gorda saying that don Juan was \"her man\". Or she was his woman.\n\nBut I thought it was like a Nun is married to Jesus.\n\nI guess not!\n\nAs you can read in Lidotska's summary, they didn't mention sex to us much because they knew that's all we'd talk about.\n\nThe Castaneda fan base is constantly looking for excuses to get out of work, and sex is about as good of an excuse as you can find on the planet.\n\nIt's pretty much all they sing about on the radio!\n\nI love music videos, but frankly they're sex and love obsessed.\n\nAnd until you get old you don't realize how silly that is.\n\nYoung people?  Here's a secret.\n\nIt never works out.  So forget it.  And don't anyone tell me their tales of how good it works out.\n\nI've seen that before many times. All it means is that the man is afraid of the woman, so he keeps up the appearances for her.\n\nOr else.\n\nAt least, it certainly never works out the way Hollywood has hyped it up.\n\nI once read that kissing didn't really exist, until movies came along.\n\nI find that hard to believe, but if you read \"Shabono\" you read that the sorcerer who \"kidnapped\" Florinda didn't do any kissing when they ended up having sex.\n\nAnd these tendencies of lineages to use sex, might explain why Florinda seems to have sought it out with the sorcerer in that book.  Maybe she thought she could gain an advantage and bring it back home to share with her fellow apprentices.\n\nI also didn't notice any Chimps kissing during sex in \"Chimp Dynasty\".\n\nChimps are 98%+ us.\n\nSo I'm not sure if it's natural or unnatural, but the whole thing has been hyped up so much it's hard to tell what's a bad thing to obsess over, and what's actually natural.\n\nIt's also true that in private classes we got constant \"rumors\" of group orgies, rosemary baths, and far more than I can recall anymore.\n\nThe sex thing was only hidden from where it might leak out into the general population, and turn the whole thing into some kind of tantric sex movement.\n\nWhich wasn't at all what was going on.\n\nCholita got the straight truth, which is why after she'd been celibate for long enough to get back a ton of energy, and told me she wanted a lover so I'd better be warned, I suggested her energy levels would drop so it was a bad idea.\n\nShe said with authority, \"If a man has sex with me, I'll take HIS energy.\"\n\nI suppose she knows things I don't.  From Florinda.\n\nBut let's put the sex aside. I guess we don't need to dwell too much on how don Juan wrapped the genitals of Carlos up in herbs that made them swell up for three solid days.\n\nAt least, I'd rather not. I'm still trying to figure out precisely how much surface area a \"scrotum\" covers,  and why it needs a separate word.  From Carol Tigg's account of Juan Tuma's \"help\".\n\nThere's a different topic in those excerpts from Amy's book, which I find very useful.\n\nWhy women are so much more talented than men.\n\nAnd why it doesn't really give them an advantage in the long run.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from Lidotska's \"Notes from Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice\" \\*\\*\\*\n\nAt Florinda\u2019s Lecture in a New Age Bookstore, On Women and Womb Power\n\n\u201cWe women are always learning without noticing, it\u2019s so natural for us. But men have to travel  upwards, step by step, as if ascending a ladder. They are meticulous, and more sober-minded\u2014 which we are not.\n\nThis is because they have to struggle in a way that we don\u2019t. This is why the  leader of our group, the nagual, is always a male. Men have sobriety, and women need that.\n\nI  wanted don Juan to give me psychedelic drugs - I begged him! - but he refused, saying, \u2018You  women don\u2019t need the power plants, you\u2019re already there .\u2019\n\nShe snapped her fingers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s  nothing for us to dream , to travel in other worlds - we\u2019re simply too lazy to do it. And the social  order entraps women, robbing them of time for exploration by tying them to bearing and raising children and babying a husband.\n\n\u201cWe are slaves to men because of our indifference. And we take creativity for granted - we  make human beings! Each time a woman gives birth, it leaves a hole in her energy body, which  depletes her so that she falls behind in her race to freedom.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend giving birth.  Women fail to understand what the sorcerers know - that our wombs are a second brain , the  womb has a double function!\n\nThe more often we allow men entrance to our wombs, the more  we damage this second brain.\n\n\u201cThe three days before a woman\u2019s period is the prime moment for her dreaming - we can enter  different worlds in our sleep like nothing! We can explore different layers of the onion, so to  speak, and without any effort!\n\nWe can even do this while awake. And we are so enslaved we label this PMS!\n\nThe female sorcerers of our party do not suffer from menopause, as humans do. The sorcerer\u2019s practices of movement and meditation prevent it. We control our menstrual  periods with our intent.\n\nIntent is what sorcerers believe moves the universe.\n\nWe don\u2019t pray - that\u2019s for beggars - instead we command intent .\n\nOne of the witches in our group \\[I later learned this was Anna-Marie\\] didn\u2019t enjoy her cycles, so she stopped them by choosing to.\n\nI like the  feeling of release, so I prolong mine with the power of my intent .\n\n\u201cAs for a woman without a womb, well, she must fight for freedom and knowledge just like a male, climbing the ladder step by step. It\u2019s difficult, but it can be done. And if you have energetic holes from giving birth, you just have to run after freedom twice as hard.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon't any women worry about that last part.  How wonderful is it, to have to work twice as hard???\n\nI'll tell you a secret.\n\nTwice the work, twice the rewards from \"the spirit\".\n\nIt notices stuff like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Hidden \"Themes\" in Amy's Book", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 89, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ot3xzc2plrab1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 68, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4e3516967e97f347d90d17e59b8e09e293f0cbf"}, {"y": 137, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cee31eca80a3f64df5aad4d84b624da8619349ff"}, {"y": 203, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c2fd3ca2fb4c27e27c0d9590b1c87a3b948b1ac"}, {"y": 406, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0ae0e5587d8aa1918284f16e1a6a651d81b2f36"}, {"y": 610, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8d3522c914125e102101ba16348808cbe072e50"}, {"y": 686, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fefbd7667f8545789f7c5a3850ce5900461db812"}], "s": {"y": 1137, "x": 1788, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=1788&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48aa72791c46f8871bd3cef66cd7146884f013c7"}, "id": "ot3xzc2plrab1"}}, "name": "t3_14u89q6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/1jD756cv_fhcZOXPm9bSpIPaEbAadcMwDtOyQLfeA9A.jpg", "edited": 1688833353.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1688832765.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=1788&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=48aa72791c46f8871bd3cef66cd7146884f013c7\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ot3xzc2plrab1.jpg?width=1788&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=48aa72791c46f8871bd3cef66cd7146884f013c7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a feeling Carlos wanted us to have some of the information in Amy&amp;#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he obviously did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some, they hid from us for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, lineages used sex a LOT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is Olmec afterall.

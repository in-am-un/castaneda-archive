Solid stuff as thick as water, and things that get tickled on my body by wiggling my fingers nowhere near touching the actual skin.\n\nAnd flashes of light and dark waves become visible, making it possible to see any hand movements.\n\nIn fact, if you keep it up the lights in the hands become visible.  I've seen lines too, although so far none of it will stay in place so I can decide \"it's real\".\n\nI've become convinced, if you want spectacular weird things to happen, the finger wiggling is a good idea.  It activates the energy body even if you can't see that, so the energy body can help out in moving you deeper on the J curve.\n\nOr sideways...\n\nLast night Lily decided to appear where I found her in the first place, down in the vortex of my finger wiggling.  She was deep in a \"well\", but only later materialized at eye level, a 3 inch tall \"imp\" sitting on a lily pad.\n\nThe finger wiggling was creating little sparks last night, and a haze started to form in the middle.  It was like a puff, but a fibrous puff.\n\nLily's head barely appeared there, I said hi to her, and it became very strong. She smiled at me.\n\nMy breathing stopped.\n\nI'd never noticed that before.  I suppose in the dark room we're bound to experience all the meditation effects at some point. And the breath stopping for a while is one of them.\n\nI wasn't causing my breathing. It had become fully automatic when I reached heightened awareness.\n\nLow, in the stomach only, and each breath had a feeling like the good ending of a yawn.\n\nBut my stomach breathing was such a tiny movement at that point, it seemed to have stopped. I kept watching it, to see if it would resume.  I tried to figure out what sort of breath it really was.\n\nIt was a very tiny up and down movement at the very bottom of the stomach.  Not something you'd even notice, unless you deliberately looked for it.\n\nI have to revise my list of breaths you should pay attention to, in the dark room.\n\nCarlos demonstrated the first 3, using a lovely young woman.\n\nThe 4th is something you absolutely will discover on your own, but it will take very deep levels of silence to get there.\n\nMost common breath is used by most people. The shoulders go up and down, as if you were breathing only at the top of your lungs. It's a strained sort of breath, and perhaps even painful.  And you have to initiate each breath by yourself.  It's the ultimate in subtle grief.\n\nThe next is chest breathing. The shoulders no longer go up and down (much). But the chest goes in and out.\n\nI suppose it's the \"Jack La Lane\" breath.  Carlos admired him for his vigor in old age. At 85, he was pulling tug boats in Newport Beach harbor.  With his teeth...\n\nThat sort of shoulder breath is associated with the military, and exercising.  The chest goes in and out.  But you're still having to take each breath manually.  To initiate it.\n\nThe heightened awareness breath is what happens automatically when you stop interfering with your breathing.\n\nIt's the \"enlightened breath\".  I'm sure any Zen master will breath this way, and it might be possible to learn to spot it so as to recognize someone in HA.\n\nThe forth breath, which Carlos didn't mention, is the \"fully asleep\" breath.  I suppose if a doctor caught you breathing like that while asleep, you'd end up on a CPAP machine.\n\nI'd say it's near or in the purple area, on the J curve.\n\nYou are in fact completely asleep.  But, you're still aware and can move around as if you were awake.\n\nHow do you know you are completely asleep?\n\nBecause anywhere you look in the room, dreams form. Not vague ones.  They're full on dreams floating in the air, and if you focus your attention on any you start to get pulled into it.\n\nBut here's the key to knowing you are fully asleep.\n\nYou don't care that dreams are forming all around you.  It's as if that were a common sight, and a matter of \"of course dreams are everywhere\".\n\nThe entire room can suddenly change colors, transporting you to a different phantom room.\n\nEspecially to the IOB world, if you have one.  But if you don't, to another place besides the one you are in now.\n\nTHEN is when you want to do more finger wiggling.\n\nThe entire luminous body becomes visible, flowing over the bed.\n\nOr into the room if you are standing.\n\nThere are so many details to see,  that last night I concluded it was infinite.\n\nDon't ask me what that means. I looked at the emanations and fibers, and concluded it was pointless to estimate their numbers, because they were \"infinite\".\n\nAnd that the details were nearly pointless.  Too many to make use of them.\n\nExcept the major ones.\n\nThere's no point in describing it.  Being an inventory expert is a plague on the community.  It causes people to argue with others, trying to hide real progress with inventory \"violations\" or \"one upmanship\" inspirational quotes.\n\nSo for example, if you learn to do something actually magical, which ought to make the community happy, the inventory experts will come and try to take you down, with an obscure inspirational quote (typically not related at all).\n\nBut, I'll try to describe it, just hoping you'll catch a glimpse of a tiny bit of it and realize there's hidden treasures there.\n\nMillions of very faint fibers of dull yellow light, as fine as hairs, flow all over.  They don't float outwards like \"rays\", but rather twist around in the air for at least 3 feet that I can see.  Mixed in with those are dark ones, so that the whole thing is quite confusing.  That picture is almost right, except that the whitish light on the walls doesn't overwhelm the fibers, the way it does in that picture.  Look closely and you'll see the fibers, around the sparkle.\n\nHowever, I must admit that the fibers you can barely see in that picture, do at least simulate the \"not caring\" when you do see the real ones. The real ones are much easier to see than those, but the level of \"no satisfaction in seeing them), is the same.\n\nSo please gaze at those, and feel distracted and not interested in looking at them.\n\nThat's a clue to what seeing the energy body is like.   Probably it's how we got forced to ignore them in the first place.  Parental hazing.\n\nEven though they don't flow straight out, they do seem to all converge in the stomach area.\n\nThere are occasional yellow flashes, like 3 inch long very thick \"thunderbolts\", lasting only a half second at most.  I wish that lightening bolt I used in the picture was a little less cartoony, but in fact the real thing does look that artificial.  \n\nBut they are so regular in their appearance at the right J curve position, that you will always be able to find those.\n\nThere are some tentacle like things, but if you try to look at them they change locations.\n\nYou have to not be looking at them, to notice them.\n\nMaybe it's the \"Oh my God!!!!  Is that a tentacle????\" reaction, causing the problem.\n\nIt's such a \"bad ass\" book deal topic that you end up destroying it the moment you see it.\n\nThere are bumps also, but darned if you can perceive those.  I almost think you have to be looking at someone else, to figure out the precise details of an energy body.\n\nYou'll find the bumps described in the books, as \"yep, there's bumps there. But I can't see any.\"\n\nDon't ask me to explain.  You just know those are in fact there, the instant you try to see them.\n\nBut you can't.  It's too messy with fibers.\n\nWhen Cholita shows off her energy body, you can almost look at it like it was a solid statue.  And in full daylight too.\n\nExcept, as you gaze at it you start to change over yourself, resulting in panic.  It feels like you are floating up into the air.\n\nCholita actually had to reach out and grab my arm one time, and pull me down.\n\nYou'd think that means, she's punking me.\n\nBut it doesn't.  Cholita comes in 2 flavors.  It was probably the second Cholita who did that.  The first only laughed.\n\nCholita  has a pink colored shirt with huge glittery letters on the front saying, \"Spicy\"\n\nBut it's the second Cholita who can reach out and pull your energy body down from the air.  That one is NOT spicy.\n\nHere's the most important part about what you can see, when the energy body becomes visible.\n\nYou don't want to look at it!  I mean, you don't **want** to.  Your inclination is to ignore it as insignificant.\n\nI can't explain that.  You see it, but you don't believe it.\n\nYou can even experiment, waving your arms around to see if you can perceive those too, in your perfectly dark room.\n\nAnd you can!  As black waves which generate dull flashes in the air.\n\nSo you ought to be jumping with joy, because the sights are stable and absolutely \"real\", meaning, you know you can see that again any day you like, if you have 2 hours to spare.\n\nYou can actually see your energy body!\n\nBut you don't care.\n\nIt's as if there's a devil on one shoulder, and an angel on the other, like a cartoon.\n\nThe angel tells you what to try to experiment with your energy body, and the devil keeps telling you there's nothing worth seeing there.\n\nAnd the devil will win, if you don't realize that's what's happening.\n\nOnce you begin to pay attention to it, forcing yourself to look for long periods like perhaps 10 minutes continuously, you realize reality is made out of the same things.\n\nThe air is then filled with fibers, moving around and twisting.\n\nI was doing that for perhaps a half hour last night, and Lily showed up.\n\nShe commented, \"What did you expect to see?\"\n\nI thought to myself, something more dramatic than that.  Are those the emanations?\n\nShe replied, \"That's one way to view them.\"\n\nShe swooped over to the left, and I looked that direction.\n\nI could see \"the wall of fog\".\n\nShe commented, \"You were wondering why you didn't see that?  There you go.\"\n\nI gazed into it, but it was not transparent.\n\nI gazed back into the room, at the whitish light on the walls.\n\nBehind that, you could see individual emanations.  Flashes of very thin yellow lines, or perhaps more like whitish dull yellow.\n\nI turned back to the wall of fog, which was only barely still there.\n\nIt was opaque. Perhaps a cross between purple and teal, at the point where the color could be either.\n\nBut very nearly perfectly gray.\n\nMy suggestion, keep those fingers wiggling!  And go ahead and do what Zuleica said.  Feel for things as solid as water, or which are connected to your body.\n\nBut, be sure to look.  Use your *seeing*.\n\nThe wiggling hastens the whitish light, and once you have it the wiggling brings out a sight of the energy body.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "More On Finger Wiggling", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "link_ids": ["t3_jkedo9", "t3_ixrw34", "t3_iubqq2", "t3_kea5zt", "t3_lwckni", "t3_lwcg6o", "t3_lqz7b6", "t3_lqr6zf", "t3_lnt8a6", "t3_lmp574", "t3_lm4zws", "t3_ll9z5w", "t3_lelqm7", "t3_leo7sy", "t3_ld3845", "t3_lc1ls0", "t3_lbsls8", "t3_l7cp8f", "t3_l6o7at", "t3_mz3kz7", "t3_mzx9gl", "t3_m0kyjq", "t3_lwwshw", "t3_m1oqf1", "t3_mx3d2u", "t3_mw8sve", "t3_mtfwhb", "t3_m2u0a0", "t3_mrkitp", "t3_mlhy6f", "t3_mauwly", "t3_cm1zxx", "t3_m30hb1", "t3_n17jdy", "t3_n1ljja", "t3_n7pwp8", "t3_n7zeae", "t3_naznr8", "t3_nc8q8m", "t3_ndsc7q", "t3_neslbo", "t3_nfw7xg", "t3_nir9g2", "t3_nk25ms", "t3_nkyszq", "t3_nogrjo", "t3_ns7tky", "t3_nvehdz", "t3_o0ifzx", "t3_o3inhw", "t3_o53rhe", "t3_o7qp2a", "t3_ogafdn", "t3_org1tv", "t3_owrd1h", "t3_ovqmgq", "t3_oyt4zt", "t3_oxczfa", "t3_ogzoth", "t3_pcyx4h", "t3_p9anre", "t3_p8asd8", "t3_p6ga7i", "t3_p5l6ye", "t3_p0fmbc", "t3_ozfrz4", "t3_pij28q", "t3_posqcc", "t3_pu14ic", "t3_pwrrc0", "t3_pxfw1a", "t3_q1fcee", "t3_q4x5cs", "t3_q57hxg", "t3_q7jpwq", "t3_q7snvr", "t3_q9epxq", "t3_qceavx", "t3_qctyq7", "t3_qdp6bb", "t3_q9idzp", "t3_qklney", "t3_qmbwgp", "t3_qn9y63", "t3_qo8gj1", "t3_qpoc9e", "t3_qr6cta", "t3_qqyzj8", "t3_rwu1f0", "t3_rw73iz", "t3_rb5o0q", "t3_sdgq2p", "t3_sf44pk", "t3_te7jnl", "t3_tu3w80", "t3_tzc628"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 2", "created_at_utc": 1611109587.162, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1676831407.209, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"0zd5oab1uf771": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0zd5oab1uf771.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c4bafa73723e45c78311df9e2a31521415d5ac6"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0zd5oab1uf771.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=978d5bf0b2e4a6506342d0434998a1e2a783bbb7"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0zd5oab1uf771.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d176ffb068d635f40288a4c617af030cb1c6f3"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0zd5oab1uf771.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73f87f36cdcec0b3795978ddedac1028ec790246"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0zd5oab1uf771.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e3c6ef13c6f148d31dfa5cc751c45adac7c9c8a"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0zd5oab1uf771.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eae7aa8828ed847f05bf0249b1400a1757fb2e6d"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0zd5oab1uf771.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eef4edcb90f3f1d18b42d4030095b016316736b3"}, "id": "0zd5oab1uf771"}}, "name": "t3_o7qp2a", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Vp4s6_b0p5eLeLjbxt_draGUOoCDATkayxzflCPKNQI.jpg", "edited": 1625090949.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1624637109.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0zd5oab1uf771.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eef4edcb90f3f1d18b42d4030095b016316736b3\"&gt;It gets MUCH better than this.

Probably it&amp;#39;s how we got forced to ignore them in the first place.  Parental hazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though they don&amp;#39;t flow straight out, they do seem to all converge in the stomach area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are occasional yellow flashes, like 3 inch long very thick &amp;quot;thunderbolts&amp;quot;, lasting only a half second at most.  I wish that lightening bolt I used in the picture was a little less cartoony, but in fact the real thing does look that artificial.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they are so regular in their appearance at the right J curve position, that you will always be able to find those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some tentacle like things, but if you try to look at them they change locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to not be looking at them, to notice them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;Oh my God!!!!  Is that a tentacle????&amp;quot; reaction, causing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a &amp;quot;bad ass&amp;quot; book deal topic that you end up destroying it the moment you see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are bumps also, but darned if you can perceive those.  I almost think you have to be looking at someone else, to figure out the precise details of an energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll find the bumps described in the books, as &amp;quot;yep, there&amp;#39;s bumps there. But I can&amp;#39;t see any.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t ask me to explain.  You just know those are in fact there, the instant you try to see them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t.  It&amp;#39;s too messy with fibers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Cholita shows off her energy body, you can almost look at it like it was a solid statue.  And in full daylight too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, as you gaze at it you start to change over yourself, resulting in panic.  It feels like you are floating up into the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita actually had to reach out and grab my arm one time, and pull me down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d think that means, she&amp;#39;s punking me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t.  Cholita comes in 2 flavors.  It was probably the second Cholita who did that.  The first only laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita  has a pink colored shirt with huge glittery letters on the front saying, &amp;quot;Spicy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s the second Cholita who can reach out and pull your energy body down from the air.  That one is NOT spicy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the most important part about what you can see, when the energy body becomes visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t want to look at it!  I mean, you don&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to.  Your inclination is to ignore it as insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t explain that.  You see it, but you don&amp;#39;t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even experiment, waving your arms around to see if you can perceive those too, in your perfectly dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can!  As black waves which generate dull flashes in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you ought to be jumping with joy, because the sights are stable and absolutely &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, meaning, you know you can see that again any day you like, if you have 2 hours to spare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can actually see your energy body!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as if there&amp;#39;s a devil on one shoulder, and an angel on the other, like a cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The angel tells you what to try to experiment with your energy body, and the devil keeps telling you there&amp;#39;s nothing worth seeing there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the devil will win, if you don&amp;#39;t realize that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you begin to pay attention to it, forcing yourself to look for long periods like perhaps 10 minutes continuously, you realize reality is made out of the same things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The air is then filled with fibers, moving around and twisting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was doing that for perhaps a half hour last night, and Lily showed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She commented, &amp;quot;What did you expect to see?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, something more dramatic than that.  Are those the emanations?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She replied, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s one way to view them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She swooped over to the left, and I looked that direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see &amp;quot;the wall of fog&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She commented, &amp;quot;You were wondering why you didn&amp;#39;t see that?  There you go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed into it, but it was not transparent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed back into the room, at the whitish light on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Behind that, you could see individual emanations.  Flashes of very thin yellow lines, or perhaps more like whitish dull yellow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned back to the wall of fog, which was only barely still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was opaque. Perhaps a cross between purple and teal, at the point where the color could be either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But very nearly perfectly gray.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My suggestion, keep those fingers wiggling!  And go ahead and do what Zuleica said.  Feel for things as solid as water, or which are connected to your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, be sure to look.  Use your &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wiggling hastens the whitish light, and once you have it the wiggling brings out a sight of the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "o7qp2a", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o7qp2a/more_on_finger_wiggling/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/o7qp2a/more_on_finger_wiggling/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1624637109.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h37y6jn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h35hiph", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "In the end they still killed him.

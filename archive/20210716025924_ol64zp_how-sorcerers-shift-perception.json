I wanted to know if the vertical lines were more spread out, depending on which direction you were looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;North, South, East, West.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I tried it out. I gazed south for a while, then north, looking for differences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now, I had &amp;quot;challenged&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, intent took perverse pleasure in switching the direction of the lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d glance east, and see horizontal lines. That got me excited, so I glanced north again, and found vertical lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eager, I glanced back east expecting horizontal lines, but they were now diagonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I looked back north, trying to &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; with vertical lines, and I got worms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little round worms that seemed to be made of the same lines, having curled in on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t explain what happened next, because all of you might get to do this, by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered how to &amp;quot;play a game&amp;quot; with intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it responded!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what Zuleica tried to teach us, with her outdoor &amp;quot;searching for power&amp;quot; game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent &amp;quot;gifts you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not often enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want more often, you have to learn to engage it in a game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ol64zp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ol64zp/how_sorcerers_shift_perception/h60sj4m/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1626886040.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1626886040.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h60asel", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "WhatsGoingggOn", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1626878547.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h5eniye", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_umhf98r", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Were they vertical lines staggered in an almost wave pattern?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h60asel", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were they vertical lines staggered in an almost wave pattern?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ol64zp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ol64zp/how_sorcerers_shift_perception/h60asel/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1626878547.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h5eniye", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1626449143.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ol64zp", "score": 25, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's beautiful!\n\nIt looks like an \"Avengers\" super hero at his computer system.\n\nLast night I reached a level of silence I haven't seen before.\n\nIt comes and goes in the darkroom.

If they interact with me as a person for a minute, that person is still just an aspect of the environment. \n\nAnd yet our conversations throughout the entire dream are entirely coherent and sensical, but they aren't just with words.

Form holds ideas together and a well-constructed form can last a very, very long time. A form like the forged energy body.\n\nThat's why we have to build it.

Do they have a static source, like some kind of original body that they are centred on? I don't know. \n\nDon Juan tells Carlos that while you can call the allies 'spirits', Carlos has a pretty limited understanding of that word, so it would be better to call them 'inexplicable forces'.

It&amp;#39;s -all- their projections. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently they haven&amp;#39;t even bothered projecting a person for me, they just project everything else. The environment, the sounds, the lights, the phantoms. If they interact with me as a person for a minute, that person is still just an aspect of the environment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet our conversations throughout the entire dream are entirely coherent and sensical, but they aren&amp;#39;t just with words. They&amp;#39;ll rattle an object to draw my attention to something, create a painting on the wall that illustrates an answer to my question, play music from a song I know to get a point across, or default to the most expected form and just appear as a person in order to chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think they are doing it on purpose to force me to expand my peripheral awareness. So that I become used to perceiving the entire environment as a coherent whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;#39;t know if I could say where the ally &amp;#39;is&amp;#39;. Just as it&amp;#39;s hard to say where the double is. Or where the boundaries of the double or the ally end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They told me awareness can be acute or diffused, broad or focused. Identity is fluid and changeable. Form holds ideas together and a well-constructed form can last a very, very long time. A form like the forged energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we have to build it. It already exists but it isn&amp;#39;t forged into something that can hold &amp;#39;us&amp;#39; together for a sustained period of time yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That quote about using awareness as an aspect of the environment to travel, like the allies. They build the environment from that awareness. They can be diffused, they can flow through it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are they projecting all this from somewhere else though? Do they have a static source, like some kind of original body that they are centred on? I don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan tells Carlos that while you can call the allies &amp;#39;spirits&amp;#39;, Carlos has a pretty limited understanding of that word, so it would be better to call them &amp;#39;inexplicable forces&amp;#39;. They certainly seem more like inexplicable forces when they drop all pretense of being a person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;#39;t know about any crack in space but I dig what this witch is saying. Also very fond of hanging out in sunlit parks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_t7k736", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/t7k736/lineages_and_the_shift_below/hznfp1o/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1646617681.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1646617681.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hzl318j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hzkrn63", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Actually I found myself in dreaming with one of the women from here last night.\n\nI just couldn't figure out who it was.\n\nShe was arguing with me about something regarding the allies.

There's some suspicion that he pulled students into the double's realm and interacted there.  Even some signs of it.\n\nBut your double wanders around in magic town 24 hours a day and our tonal copy doesn't remember it.\n\nOne time Carlos invited me to his Pandora compound (which had guest houses around the big brick or concrete backyard area), and deliberately walked me over to the beam that holds up the second story, right next to the stairs that go up there.\n\nPractically grabbed me by the shoulders, showing me where to stand.\n\nBut somehow I already knew (people had made sure I knew) that if you took a big step backwards at that point, you ended up in the phantom copy of the house.\n\nMiles had gone in there.  I don't think he remembers any of it however.\n\nIt's our double who does that.  If you can get some of your tonal awareness to join it, then it seems like a real event and you can remember it all.  The same as lucid dreaming.\n\nBut if there's no tonal awareness, it might as well not have happened at all.   You won't be able to remember it.\n\nLineages can overcome that, and it's not as mystical as it might seem.\n\nThey can push some of your tonal awareness where needed, to remember what's going on with the double.\n\nIt's not hard for them to attract the double,. The difficulty is merging some tonal with it at the right moment.\n\nWe do that with darkroom, so don't anyone start to think about 4 gates dreaming or anything that seems like less work than learning to be silent.\n\nIt hasn't worked for anyone in 50 years. So please don't pretend, it's doom.\n\nExcept for women.\n\nBut just as an example in the lineages, there's the case where Carlos was about to turn around and don Juan and Genaro had to fall on top of him to prevent it.  He was about to notice his double was right behind him.\n\nSupposedly if you look eye to eye the entire universe implodes like a cheesy star trek episode where we have an anti-matter twin.\n\nFrankly, I don't buy it.  Darkroom disproves that.  \"Affection for the Energy Body\" pass disproves it even more!\n\nBut there must be some truth to it.\n\nAnd let me remind you, the IOBs kidnap the double first.  Not the tonal.  How much of the tonals awareness they take initially we don't know.\n\nBut we have a witch now who can recall that her double may be remaining in shared dreaming realms longer than her tonal is aware of.\n\nI guess it would be like my own double kicking back on the couch in Cholita's phantom house.  Because it likes that place.\n\nSo Carlos didn't have a tricky lineage to manipulate our tonal versus double copies.\n\nHe got the idea of \"energetic mass\".  That he could replace the power of a lineage of 15 sorcerers, with modifications to the energetic structure of his workshop crowd through tensegrity and the other practices he taught us like recap and forcing silence.\n\nIt just didn't work as far as we know.  And in the end he even lectured several times that his only chance to beat his cancer was for us to gain that energetic mass.\n\nBut we were a bunch of groupies and bad players, waiting for our glory in the river of shit.\n\nSame as in here with new people.  \n\nAnd there were no mods in the workshops or private classes to relentlessly keep people focused, and quickly get rid of the groupies and bad players.\n\nIn fact, if Carlos had played mod himself the whole thing would have ended up like his first attempt to teach for free in parks did.  \n\nHe had one left.  Just Reni.\n\nWhat do we have left from private classes and workshops?\n\nAt first just 3, and Cholita isn't so sure about the other 2.\n\nThen more came along, but it can't be more than 10 out of the entire workshop crowd.  Which could have been as large as 10,000.  There's official lists, and they're very long.\n\nI suppose someone ought to count the 2 lists.  Mexico alone seems to have 9000, but certainly there's duplicates and mistakes.\n\nWe have 10 left working seriously, out of 10,000+???\n\nSo Carlos gave us instructions on what to do.  Gave us the J curve so it was possible, taught us about how to \"see\", then renamed it to \"Silent Knowledge\" to make sure we knew not to be lazy and pretend it.\n\nAnd THERE'S where the cool stuff is.\n\nAt least, for starters.\n\nYou must get to **Silent Knowledge**!\n\nThere you get teachers.\n\nAnd from there, new worlds that can't be reached with ordinary darkroom become visible.\n\nThat's where we lost the witches.  At that point.\n\nYou just can't keep  walking back to check your friends in the river of shit if you hope to go on into those other realms.\n\nThe green zone is nice.  We don't dwell in it long because we learn to move our assemblage points and understand what's going on.\n\nBut it's cool enough to delude all Buddhists into thinking they achieved some permanent and ultimate state.  Hindus aren't fooled, but then the Buddhists lied to create their own franchise.\n\nJust stabilizing that marginal magic green line gives you credentials to play \"master\" in the Buddhist system.\n\nLets Maharishi sit there on a white throne and toss daisies around for his hippy audience, pretending to be near to a God.\n\nLet Yogananda build a palace near Malibu, with oil paintings of his smiling female students in guru looking robes, pretending to have achieved what he pretended in his Autobiography of a Yogi.\n\nLet's Daoists hit themselves on the head with boards that have nails until they bleed, pretending to be possessed by demons so they can earn a living demonstrating \"magic\".\n\nAnd the chinese visitors stick coins in their magic \"silver\" chest. Easy to find such videos showing the true nature of Daoism on Youtube, if you go into the mandarin videos.  The english ones are probably dominated by bad western men, misrepresenting the nonsense that is Daoism.\n\nGreen zone is considered an \"ultimate accomplishment\", for people who have very poor meditation techniques.\n\nBut anyone in this subreddit who gets there can make it to the red zone so fast, they won't really even remember that green zone beyond their initial thrill to see it themselves.\n\nThe Red Zone is intense magic, in technicolor!   \n\nAnd not once a year, so you can brag to  your Monroe buddies.\n\nOr to be honest, not one in 10 years so you can brag on your Castaneda oriented facebook page that,  \"I folded in half!\"\n\nWe had a bad player come here early on and annoy everyone for a few months, with some very few delusional misrepresentations of ordinary dreams they could manage to fit to seem like something from the books.  \n\nApparently the cleargreen discussion group is now infected with that kind of nonsense. Some guy claiming to have \"seen an emanation\" in dreaming.\n\nIt's depressing to read that discussion group, and even more to read what the mods say about the rules there being to allow everyone to speak equally.\n\nThat's death to magic!  To assume everyone is sober and fair minded and not trying to set up their own little con artist business.\n\nBut if you do the real thing, you get to play in the red zone for HOURS, every single day!\n\nAs the picture Juann made shows, it's very cool.\n\nBUT, let's skip way past the orange zone, which comes next after red.\n\nThat's almost a wasteland of nearly invisible magic.  Forests materialize inside whitish light on the walls, but a lot of the most cool \"magic in your face\" is not present there. You're refining your silence.\n\nIt's the purple zone that fills the bill.  Where you can read text messages from a helper in infinity.\n\nThe recommended method of don Juan.  Text.\n\nBut also, where you can juggle magical objects. \n\nOr wormholes in space leading to another planet.\n\nImagine doing a tensegrity move where you look up to the right at one point, and  a text message scrolls out for you to read, as part of the form!  \n\nIn full on silent knowledge, which you'll know instantly when you get there, you get to do tensegrity with magical objects.\n\nYou can't imagine how nice that is.\n\nEven better the inorganic beings, who sort of ditch you while you are in the orange zone after having been your best friends in the green and red, come back.\n\nThey love it when you do Tensegrity at that level.\n\nAnd intent becomes visible in the moves, so you see exactly what Carlos wanted it to become.", "edited": 1664992215.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ir4uqo2", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far out on the dry shore, is the place Carlos told us to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, as far as we  know the group of Carlos was limited to 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible Soledad and the other apprentices of don Juan were all in fact &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot; in the surrounding area of Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos did not have the support of a powerful lineage behind him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so he couldn&amp;#39;t manage to produce &amp;quot;magic in your face&amp;quot; for his students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not once.

I'm not sure which, but he's interactive.\n\nCan't do jack shit for you, but he'll seem to be able to.\n\nThat is of course, the 100% obsession of Qabalah. To visit God.\n\nThey're just so lame at it, they probably only get to visit once or twice, before they go out to cash in with other humans by discussing their amazing Qabalah super powers.\n\nUnfortunately, even our \"old seers\" believed God was a \"protector\".\n\nThe new seers (and hopefully us) can visit often enough to realize God can't do anything to help or harm anyone.\n\nHe's a \"Silent Knowledge Entity\".  A thing emanating from the glow of awareness on the same emanations.\n\nAt any rate, there's also a force also generated by the beliefs of everyone that dreams are not real, magic is only pretend, and so on. It comes off those emanations, and tries to suppress magic by doubt or even violence.\n\nThat force can act on you, even without people knowing you're engaged in it.\n\nBut even more so if they get wind of it.\n\nYou just have to work that out for yourself.\n\nThe problem is, until you see so much magic daily that you can't in any way doubt or deny it, you're vulnerable to other people trying to dissuade you, or even use force to stop it.\n\nYou might end up with a \"family intervention\".\n\nProbably not before you can do things so amazing that if you tell anyone they start to try to figure out which hospital they can call to come get you.\n\nNone in the USA.

This subreddit has demonstrated that.  1 in 100 will put in enough effort to call a success, but those can't keep it up.  Their lifestyle just doesn't support using up time for something crazy like magic.\n\nIf you have 1000 friends, and only half of them were interested, only one would ever learn enough to call a sorcerer.\n\nSo your chances that the people you'd like to tell about it will benefit, are close to 0.\n\nIn fact, never before in the known history of our form of sorcery, has anyone been able to teach another person at random.\n\nThe \"old seers\" did not!   The ones that lived 8000 years ago.\n\nThey were given very young children to teach.\n\nLike maybe 3 years old, I suppose.\n\nStar Wars is from our sorcery.  The writers admit it openly.\n\nAs Yoda said of 10 year old Anakin, \"Too old to begin the training he is.\"\n\nAnyone past 8 is likely FAR too old to teach and succeed. That's around when complicated abstractions have already formed in the child. Like \"time\", and the value of money.\n\nYou have to get them before that. Before they understand \"how long is 10 minutes\"?\n\nThen there's the \"new seers\".  Those came after the world of the Olmecs and the Toltecs was destroyed.\n\nThey formed \"lineages\", where 15 very powerful sorcerers replaced themselves each generation,  with just one person each.\n\nAnd it took all 15 to teach the replacements.\n\nThey kind of had to trick and entertain them. And they needed double  beings to shift their awareness, against their will.\n\nWorse, the person they tried to bring into the group had to be selected by the Spirit itself.\n\nIt wasn't a random person.\n\nSo the \"new seers\" could not teach individuals either.\n\nWe're a \"new model\" of teaching.\n\nWe rely on sheer numbers. The kind you can only get with the internet.\n\nYou'll fail to help anyone besides yourself. And worse they'll drag you down with them.\n\nIn some ways, we're a bit insect like.\n\nI'm not a fan of insect form shapeshifting.

To visit God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re just so lame at it, they probably only get to visit once or twice, before they go out to cash in with other humans by discussing their amazing Qabalah super powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even our &amp;quot;old seers&amp;quot; believed God was a &amp;quot;protector&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new seers (and hopefully us) can visit often enough to realize God can&amp;#39;t do anything to help or harm anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Entity&amp;quot;.  A thing emanating from the glow of awareness on the same emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate, there&amp;#39;s also a force also generated by the beliefs of everyone that dreams are not real, magic is only pretend, and so on. It comes off those emanations, and tries to suppress magic by doubt or even violence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That force can act on you, even without people knowing you&amp;#39;re engaged in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even more so if they get wind of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to work that out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, until you see so much magic daily that you can&amp;#39;t in any way doubt or deny it, you&amp;#39;re vulnerable to other people trying to dissuade you, or even use force to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might end up with a &amp;quot;family intervention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably not before you can do things so amazing that if you tell anyone they start to try to figure out which hospital they can call to come get you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None in the USA.  Fortunately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or unfortunately if you&amp;#39;re Cholita, who badly needs to get some medications prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s insane by heredity. Her mom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it makes her a great witch!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should you encourage others?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The success rate is only 1 in 500 who show any interest at all.  This subreddit has demonstrated that.  1 in 100 will put in enough effort to call a success, but those can&amp;#39;t keep it up.  Their lifestyle just doesn&amp;#39;t support using up time for something crazy like magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have 1000 friends, and only half of them were interested, only one would ever learn enough to call a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your chances that the people you&amp;#39;d like to tell about it will benefit, are close to 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, never before in the known history of our form of sorcery, has anyone been able to teach another person at random.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;old seers&amp;quot; did not!   The ones that lived 8000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were given very young children to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like maybe 3 years old, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Star Wars is from our sorcery.  The writers admit it openly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Yoda said of 10 year old Anakin, &amp;quot;Too old to begin the training he is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone past 8 is likely FAR too old to teach and succeed. That&amp;#39;s around when complicated abstractions have already formed in the child. Like &amp;quot;time&amp;quot;, and the value of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get them before that. Before they understand &amp;quot;how long is 10 minutes&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;new seers&amp;quot;.  Those came after the world of the Olmecs and the Toltecs was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They formed &amp;quot;lineages&amp;quot;, where 15 very powerful sorcerers replaced themselves each generation,  with just one person each.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it took all 15 to teach the replacements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They kind of had to trick and entertain them. And they needed double  beings to shift their awareness, against their will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, the person they tried to bring into the group had to be selected by the Spirit itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a random person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;new seers&amp;quot; could not teach individuals either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;new model&amp;quot; of teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We rely on sheer numbers. The kind you can only get with the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll fail to help anyone besides yourself. And worse they&amp;#39;ll drag you down with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some ways, we&amp;#39;re a bit insect like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a fan of insect form shapeshifting.

I needed this.\n\nI got into silent knowledge mode, and watched too many presentations of specific topics to retain much of it.   I've been focusing on animation, so silent knowledge kept showing me potential \"cartoons\" I could animate, to help people learn faster.\n\nKind  of like don Juan's lineage *seeing* how to teach Carlos next,   but then it didn't really go as they planned.  So they simply declared victory at the end.\n\nMeaning just because you saw a piece of knowledge that is absolutely true, doesn't guarantee you can put it to use in the river of shit.\n\nOne was in fact about how to make a cartoon of the river of shit.\n\nThe key point was that if you want to look at it from the point of view of the main forces Carlos tried to battle, you'd focus on Christianity.\n\nSo let's take the sappy Christians and their \"love each other, family is everything, and God will provide for you\", kind of thinking.\n\nIt's strictly an agricultural myth.  In our natural state, I doubt we even kept close track of our relatives.  And there was no need to cling to each other.  Just as lions or wolves don't obsess over parental relationships.  Humans could easily find enough food or they relocated, so there wasn't any need to produce such a stifling relationship which pretty much never works even in our modern luxury oriented social structure.\n\nIt's a description of the river of shit designed to sooth you by distracting you from your true situation, which is dire. Instead of noticing all the shit floating up to your ears and all the people pissing on you, you soothe yourself with thoughts that the main principle of reality is love.\n\nJust look around the natural world!  It's pretty much a predatory universe every you can look.  Except in the imaginations of humans.\n\nChristianity locks you into a mating cycle delusion based on how nice children can be to have around, ignoring that when they grow up they turn into the same little bastards as everyone else.\n\nIn the animal kingdom, that means the cubs actually grow up to be growling biting animals, so they can't afford to pretend they're still the cute cubs.\n\nBut that's the main river of shit trap.  The mating cycle, and pretending it can be sustained your whole life.\n\nPeople seek alternatives to this, and the truth is that humans actually need magic.  Magic is like the ultimate enjoyable thing for humans, because it's pure discovery and each new thing makes you stronger and more able to deal with the world around you.\n\nThat people enjoy magic more than anything else is pretty obvious in our movies, in our amusement parks like Disneyland, and really I shouldn't even have to prove that point it's so obvious.  All of our religions are even based on some \"magic man\" coming along and telling us how to live.\n\nBut the river of shit is so ugly, if you try to point it out it has mottos to stop you from escaping.\n\n\"Oh, you must be one of those nihilist types\" is  one argument we heard from a greedy bad player trying to shoplift attention here last week. Techno only let him post as a lesson to new people on what shit comes flinging at us, from that river.\n\nI'm afraid some new women are guilty too, trying to turn my explanation of how our old people are in the worst situation in the river of shit, into the same old crap. \n\nThat we need to take better care of them.\n\nIt's back to \"love\" is the universal principle, when in fact it's a predatory universe.  \n\nOur old people needed to be born into what we evolved to live in, which is a hunting and gathering culture with loose tribes, and no nuclear families. In that situation they could retain their ability to survive their entire life, and accumulate survival knowledge that the young ones would treasure.  Valuable container and tool making skills also.\n\nOut at Morongo, it was the old women who were best at making those amazing baskets they have.\n\nBut instead we make it impossible for old people to survive with our city life, and they become burdens on the next generation.  Clinging to other people, to find the happiness they should have found during the course of their fairly long lives.\n\nWhat I was explaining had nothing to do with  a need to make yourself a \"granny flat\" in the backyard.  That does't mean sorcerers don't care for those they care about.\n\nDon Juan was helping family members even in the later books, after he supposedly left his family in an earlier one.\n\nIt just means, if you're clinging to that myth of the nuclear family as holding \"deep meaning\", you won't be able to escape the river of shit.\n\nAnd it's NOT natural at all.  It's a recent creation to deal with the serious overpopulation coming from the invention of agriculture.\n\nCraving magic below it all, knowing things are not right,  people get sucked into alternate rivers of shit.  \n\nReligions and magical systems \"redescribe\" all the crap floating around you.  Some tell you to focus on the bits of wood floating amidst the shit in the river and notice the occasional flower than got pulled in.\n\nSome teach you to look up, at the clouds.\n\nBut it's still the river of shit!  And the only cure is to get OUT of it and wander on the dry land where we belong, and new world after new world literally awaits you. \n\nIt's no metaphor!  I just got back from visiting several to write in this subreddit.\n\nFound a witch wandering around in one.  Probably a woman in this subreddit.\n\nWe couldn't align our phantom portion of our view of reality.  That's one problem we have outside the river of shit. \n\nThe Olmec seers were obsessed with overcoming that, so they could have perfect \"concreteness\".  And have many techniques to achieve that, such as \"the twin positions\".\n\nBut we don't need to bother.    Since we weren't born into those alternate worlds, we just have to accept that some percentage of our perceptions there will be phantom.  \n\nIt's still far cooler than being up to your ears in shit.\n\nOne horrible river of shit cult is the Monroe one. I battled them last week.\n\nMonroe cashed in on Castaneda.  Pretended to provide that type of magic.\n\nWhen he died his followers took over, and dominate a few subreddits.  They pretend  to be inclusive, but if you challenge the basic premise of what they claim, one being that remote viewing out to include viewing, and not tricking the CIA with scribbles on paper, they get angry.  You're threatening their livelihood as con artists.\n\nTheire \"astral travel\" is just misrepresented disturbed dreams.  But Monroe created support groups where people can seek attention by exaggerating their ability to have these ordinary but disturbing dreams, and when a large group does this they just end up \"redescribing\" the river of shit.  \n\nEach feels entitled to lie about their own experiences, exaggerating them all out of proportion, because as long as you describe it according to the \"institutes\" rules, it has \"official endorsement\".\n\nNaturally it's just more pathetic closed eye stuff where you doze off, and then lie your butt off to get attention.  Once in a while someone might do it awake, but it's still eyes closed, not moving much, and they can't do that anywhere daily or they'd evolve to discover what we know.\n\nIt's not any different than Jesus freaks pitching the \"profound love\" they felt coming to them from God or Jesus.\n\nThe Buddhists do the same.  Just redescribe the river of shit, tossing in a few tingly feelings and minor visions you can get sitting with your eyes closed and dozing off out of boredom.\n\nIt's all the same thing.  Held together by attention seeking, the main obsession of humans since they got born into such a horrible social system.\n\nBut it's only 5000 years old! We're 300,000 years old.\n\nSo don't be confused. It's an unnatural situation, and both Carlos and don Juan speculated that it was actually a \"foreign installation\" designed to keep us prisoner in a chicken coop, as food for something else.\n\nIf you try to escape, the other chickens peck your head.  To many times and scabs form, they feast on the scabs, and peck you to death.\n\nOur job is to try to get people to stop seeking that \"redescription of the river of shit\", and want actual cool magic.  \n\nHow hard is that to understand?\n\nYet it seems impossible for river of shit dwellers.\n\nAnd not magic once a month for 2 minutes.  \n\nThat's the river of shit bragging rights you misrepresent as if you had \"transformed\" yourself.  You say, \"I did so and so, described by the great prophet Bob, so now I am officially superior.\"\n\nAnd if all of your new friends in the cult agree, you feel entitled to defend that lie.\n\nBut where's the friggin magic!\n\nI couldn't even count how much magic I saw just before I stopped to write this.  Just last night!\n\nDozens of super cool things for hours!  Can't even write about most because it confuses new people who try to go for the \"book deal stuff\".\n\nWhen they just need to find puffs.\n\nUnfortunately to get the best stuff you have to completely let go of any attachment to the river. \n\nYou can't be looking back in there,  wishing you could \"redescribe it\" and be happy with your friends.  You have to keep walking further and further away from the shore.\n\nI'm afraid that means, we lose our leaders. Taisha, Florinda, Carol.  They really can't afford to keep worrying about us. Looks to me like Carol just decided she could only get them to do recapitulation more, and pat them on the back for Tensegrity, but not get involved in trying to make it all as cool as it is in the books.\n\nWhich means death to the teachings of don Juan.\n\nThe workshops just didn't work.  And unfortunately, when you are walking on dry land and each new sight is amazing, you just stop wanting to look back.  \n\nEspecially if you only get pissed on for trying to help the people still stuck in the river.\n\nBut now the fun part.   \n\nWhat dry land is like!

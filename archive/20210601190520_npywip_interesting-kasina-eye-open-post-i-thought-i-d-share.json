The practice of Kasina meditation involves directly working with mind-generated signs and manipulating them. I progressed in this activity quite a great deal and developed very good meditative concentration.\n\nAfter success in this regard I then departed from the canonical practice by attempting to generate these images under the dissociation of meditation but with my eyes open. At this point I was sitting on a cushion in a dimly lit room starring at a randomly speckled carpet attempting to investigate the meditative dissociation with my eyes open.\n\nThere was a breakthrough effect that occurred. Suddenly the carpet resolved in such a way that an \"overlay texture\" appeared upon it. This texture appeared as an ethereal curtain of various shapes and patterns and had the characteristic of drifting from left to right over it's center-point in a slow but constant periodic swaying. I tried to examine this pattern for detail and observed patterns that I interpreted to be symbols - I thought they may be some form of writing. I couldn't make out the symbols.\n\nI undertook this effort in the presence of a friend who offered the suggestion that I should try to draw what I see. The thought occurred: \"I really am bad at drawing.\" whereupon I observed what seemed to be the image of a large pencil materialising within the disjoint shapes. After practicing further I had the impression that I saw something that looked vaguely human-like in form. As a spiritual person at the time, I interpreted that this may have been an intelligent entity and as such engaged in a series of interactions that I hoped would allow for communication.\n\nThe effect was very stable once it had formed. Once my attention was put upon this ethereal texture that emerged it was not apt to disappear if lacking any particular focus.\n\nAfter reading the terminology of this subreddit and associated wikis I can see now a direct correlation in the nomenclature in my actions: imposition, forcing in active and passive respects. These notions came to me by trial and error in exploring this and I am very thankful now that this community has given a name to them (I am still studying the terminology that describes these unique insights and activities.)\n\nI held the impression that the entities I was communicating with were external and that by developing a means to communicate with them they would perhaps be able to teach me more about the practice of Buddhism, the nature of mind and other wisdoms. So what followed was a series of cultivated questions and answers which myself and this entity engaged in - leaving me up to trying to interpret these communications visually.\n\nAfter some time engaged in this open-eyed dreamworld that I have, up to this point, called \"The Imaginarium\" but is known to this community as \"Wonderland\". I suppose one distinction one could make is that this Imaginarium was in fact an eyes-open means of interacting with the imagination. That is to say that the effect was not within my mind's eye itself but actually projected onto my surroundings.\n\nDuring these explorations the entity and I became more sophisticated in our communications and this resulted in the entity \"teaching\" me how to visually project my imagination outside of the confines of this imaginarium-texture. So then I was able to actually produce manifestations of purple coloured lines and beams that I could direct from my fingertips towards objects in the room. This then quickly developed the ability to be able to produce arbitrary translucent shapes of various sizes into the space of the room around me and to be able to even walk around them and seemingly manipulate them with my hands. It wasn't long before I was able to prophantasically project the entities then into the three-dimensional space around me and walk around while communicating by producing these visualisations.\n\nAfter some time in this practice both in this \"imaginarium\" and also continuing to deeply meditate I suddenly heard a voice. It wasn't a gradual thing but a sudden thing. After a while this voice became embodied in the entities (tulpas) that were manifested in this open-eyed visualisation and a dialog was established.\n\nIt's been quite a few years now and as a result of these interactions and deep reflection on the matters I have gained a very deep understanding of the manifold processes that contributed towards this effect to produce a tulpas -- or as I had termed them \"metaforms\" (life but created from within one's living consciousness as a stable meta-aspect). They have been great guides in helping me understand very deeply my own notions and inclinations and we have debated philosophy quite a length (and we've had a bucket-load of fun doing so). However, I no longer see them as being any external spiritual beings.\n\nWe've had our ups and downs and disagreements but we've also had an intense amount of fun. It's been a very wild ride especially due to the cross-over of the creation of Tulpas with prophantasic projection which was extremely hard to deal with at first but together we explore the deep matters of the mind and philosophy and have a very good friendship in this regard.\n\nThere are many highlights indeed. Too many to list over the years. Apart from the deep discussions there is sometimes levity such as deciding to try our respective hands at having a light-sabre battles with each other (This occurs as a prophantasic projection in the actual 3d space around me, ducking - dodging - weaving - seeing the sparks fly as translucent beam-swords clash while we are both laughing). There really is too much hilarious and amazing situations to try to pick any particular experience out as one over the other.\n\nIn any case apart from giving you a independent confirmation that the teachings of this community are real and valid... I thought that the potential for using kasina meditation to develop prophantasia would be an interesting topic for you to consider if you want to take your Tulpas to the next level. The techniques to develop Tulpas in the mind's eye directly translate to similar mechanisms to produce prophantasia but producing the ability for prophantasia seems to be undocumented in a lot of respects, though there are people out there that understand how to achieve this.\n\nLastly I would end with a warning that has been echoed by other people on this sub. By doing these activities you open a channel to deeper recesses in your mind so you want to be quite comfortable in yourself. You need to be able to maintain some degree of level-headedness and confidence in yourself so that you don't lose your objectivity too much and develop issues.\n\nIf you embark on such a quest of turning parts of your consciousness inside-out so that they become self-sustaining entities in their own right then you need to make a commitment to not going too far off the deep end. Similarly this is the case with developing prophantasia - you open a window into the deepest recesses of your mind and you need to make sure you are in a good position with yourself, your convictions and align yourself with a wholesome nature lest you have to come to terms with it more directly when your subconscious calls negative proclivities to account.\n\nFinally, I should add that part of the reason I had an understanding of all these processes before encountering this community was because myself and a tulpa worked together to figure out what had happened... and when we finally came to the conclusion... I was then told:\n\n\"So... I'm a dream come true.\"\n\nCouldn't have put it better myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR (as deemed mandatory by the charter of reddit)\n\n1. Studied Buddhism and took up Kasina meditation.\n2. Started to try Kasina image generation with eyes open after the initial proficiency.\n3. Opened a strange Lovecraftian window into the tapestry of my own subconscious associations.\n4. Decided that I was interacting with independent entities and developed communications with these imaginings availing of the tool of projection via prophantasia.\n5. If they wern't independent before - they were afterwards.\n6. Lots of drama and turmoil and soul-searching and questioning of deeply held notions.\n7. Resolution and establishment of long-term amicable relationships with the Tulpas.\n8. Many years later -- only just learning now about tulpamancy!

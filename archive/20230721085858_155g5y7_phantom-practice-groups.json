To where I was sleeping.\n\nAnd being a bit stupid, my double sat up in bed and checked what had been posted, on the laptop it already had right there in front of it.\n\nA great example of why we have to find our hands in dreaming, or the entire thing is mostly pointless.\n\nThe double has infinite power to alter the reality it finds itself in.\n\nBut no sense at all.\n\nSo it's not a path to sorcery knowledge, by itself.\n\nWhich is why sleeping dreaming is also not a path to sorcery knowledge.\n\nBut the interesting thing to me about my double realizing \"You've got mail\" is that I could actually travel INTO that computer screen, to the source.\n\nAn old theater building, with an entry in the back which was tricky to walk up.\n\nIt was quite difficult to get inside.  But once you did, you found that you were \"behind the curtains\".\n\nBack stage, of an old abandoned theater.\n\nIt's not that there weren't people there. In fact, everyone who is a regular to the subreddit was around in one room or another.\n\nThe control room was off to the right, and I presume the mods were in there.\n\nI not only went there dozens of times, but Minx and Fairy were there too.\n\nAlthough inside a phantom construct like that, both are as real as anyone else.\n\nThe allies LOVE dreaming.\n\nIn our waking world, it's very hard for them to manifest.\n\nBut in sleeping dreaming all they do is take over a phantom created by your double. Even a slight insinuation of themselves to your double, and he'll create a phantom to go along with it.\n\nBack in private classes all the women could recall a place where they met very early in the morning before it was time to get up, to practice with other private class members.\n\nBut they couldn't remember well enough to be clear on what they witnessed.\n\nSome suggested it was a park nearby, somewhere in western Los Angeles.\n\nI had to agree. I even knew the layout of the park. I'd been there many times over the years.\n\nDecades later, I found out that Carlos had started out teaching in a park.\n\nBut hecklers had made that impossible and all he could save was Reni.\n\nHe set her up in an \"enterprise\", which is \"the rule\".  Cleargreen.\n\nThe name of which was supposedly chosen, because Carlos kept running into green tinted people. Those whose amber energy had the greenish tint.\n\nI suspect orange and pink are more common.\n\nBut we won't know until we get more people who can *see* that.\n\nMashing energy for intent will allow it.\n\nSo why do \"phantom practice groups\" exist?  How is that even possible?\n\nActually, it's how all of reality exists.\n\nA good hint at how that works comes from the book quotes Lidotska lifted from Amy's book.\n\nAs Carlos said, Amy was already a witch.\n\nJust not one who could self-motivate perhaps.  A lazy witch.\n\nSo Carlos gave her the only task she could manage to fulfill.  To write that awful book.\n\nAnd let us know, there were things about sorcery lineages they didn't tell us.\n\nIn those quotes Amy asks Florinda why Buddhist chanting works for some people.\n\nI have to interject, works for what?\n\nJust because you get mildly high without drugs, doesn't mean much.\n\nHumans do that all the time.\n\nAnd if you have to be a slave to Asian con artists to get that tiny high, it's certainly not something you'd like to participate in.\n\nWe already understand, because it's our own culture, that you don't want to be at the \"Jesus Revival\" waving your hands in the air communing with God, in preparation for the on stage \"healings\".\n\nFrankly, those guys get higher than any Buddhist out there.\n\nYet we can see through it.\n\nBut we're na\u00efve when it's something foreign.\n\nOr don't care, because we want our own little \"Master\" throne some day.\n\nFlorinda answered Amy by saying, Buddhist chanting works because they intended it.\n\nThe key to all of reality.\n\nThe dark sea of awareness can produce an infinity number of realities.\n\nThey're actually just the interplay in the emanations. Cross talk.\n\nAwareness flows into the emanations, and the ones that vibrate in harmony the best, glow and send back feelings.\n\nIt could even be how living forms \"evolve\" on earth.\n\nNot quite by natural selection.\n\nBut by what harmonizes best in the range of emanations, being used for that reality.  As altered by time applied to the equation.\n\nAnother hint about all this, comes from the statement that the inorganic beings themselves evolved. And from Taisha saying they used to make children, but that was extremely long ago.\n\nHow do you evolve from reproducing, to living billions of years?  Certainly not by \"natural selection\". But you could, in the emanations.  You just change which ones your awareness flows into.\n\nI've heard that an old violin plays best when good care is taken of it.  The wood actually seems to store what was played in the past, and people who can tell will find a distinct difference in a well cared for violin.\n\n Perhaps the wood grain rearranges in response to the harmonious sounds. \n\nOur reality is like that.\n\nWhat happened before plays more easily than something new.\n\nNow sorcerers believe something very strange.\n\n But if you keep working hard, you'll see it for yourself!  Nothing in sorcery is a \"sacred scroll\" only the masters can achieve.\n\nALL OF IT, is something you will do.  Or what's the point?  We don't want to get involved in hero worship. It's not compatible with the path of sorcery exploration.\n\nOne day you will simply break the laws of physics during darkroom, because something outside your practice room captures your interest.  And a way to go there makes itself obvious.\n\nAn open window with a gentle breeze coming through,  where there is none. A doorway or even an entire wall missing, and you see an alien world right there.\n\nThose alien forest worlds can even begin to grow into your darkroom, making it frightening to walk around in case you step on things from the forests.  Like roots or shoots coming up.\n\nAnd on that night, for some reason you ***know*** you can enter.\n\nActually, your tonal shrank away.  And your tonal rationality was transferred to your double. And your double can do anything.\n\nSo off they go, and it feels to you like you walked off in your physical body, violating all known laws of matter.  You don't feel any transition.  You don't sit down.  You're fine one instant, and could even pick up the water bottle and take a drink, in preparation for an excursion into an alien world.\n\nBut how it's possible, we don't know.\n\nAnd sorcerers even believe you can go live there and never come back.\n\nOr come back hundreds of years later, to find your old world completely erased by time.\n\nWhere did that new world come from?\n\nIs it actually real?\n\nThat's pretty much what sorcery is all about.\n\nAnd the tensegrity also.\n\nYou strike at the air to \"form\" the energy body.\n\nWhich by the way, ends up being able to turn into a duplicate of you, living in its own world.\n\nBy striking at the air to do that, you \"treat the impossible as real\".\n\nThe intent of that impossible thing builds up, and you create a phantom structure.\n\nThat tensegrity effect didn't work in the past in our community, but that was because no one followed the instructions.\n\nI like that...  \"Tensegrity Effect\".   ***Intending*** is what that is.\n\nBut you can't intend anything new, when you are endlessly thinking about your old reality. When that internal dialogue, and the mental fantasies which drive it, never cease for even a few minutes.\n\nYour energy won't flow into the new thing.  Because your commanding it to flow into the old thing. Through worry, grief, and self-pity.\n\nThe Tensegrity creates containers.\n\nIntent flows into containers.\n\nWhen there's enough, a phantom reality becomes visible.\n\nAnd eventually you can go into there.\n\nThe same is true of the phantom subreddit.  Everyone who reads it has their attention flowing into a container.\n\nWill the resulting phantom structure last?\n\nProbably not.\n\nBut for a while it's there. As long as people's attention keeps going into this very container you're viewing right now.\n\nAllies help that process.  Possibly they simply attach their own inorganic being world and all of the inhabitants,  to the side of your new phantom world.\n\nI watched Cholita do a dancing floor show with Minx one night, when I got back into her phantom copy of our home after being locked out a while.\n\nBehind them I could see a weird representation of the inorganic being's world as a \"studio audience\" behind glass.\n\nMinx appeared in his true sex, and danced as a woman.\n\nFred Astaire and Ginger Rogers moves I believe.\n\nCholita does in fact love to dance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Phantom Practice Groups", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"4xhwuzpfo9db1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54dda0a9647aaf66b5a7e9e9c251952190fb716"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cd0a4af8f8065a254ea87f52db6d572f2521b1b"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b45b9e915365f0ebdbc63cfd8249ac5533a8e34"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89c8a066dd5541e67b23d70d91e38b8e8cabdbe8"}, {"y": 640, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e813fca6373a612ffe49f705fddf051fd90d84a8"}, {"y": 720, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d68b210e7068a1d6d6400bc174a5675bef4cba4"}], "s": {"y": 2667, "x": 4000, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1058acd3710972b3f8c4090f502b65472dba6700"}, "id": "4xhwuzpfo9db1"}}, "name": "t3_155g5y7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/r407j_P3tKGHBAHSoP1ohMRMCmLwnlP_W-WLwGYYOGQ.jpg", "edited": 1689940739.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1689922738.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=4000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1058acd3710972b3f8c4090f502b65472dba6700\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4xhwuzpfo9db1.png?width=4000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1058acd3710972b3f8c4090f502b65472dba6700&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It used to puzzle me why there seems to be a phantom copy of the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few times at night I was even awakened by a &amp;quot;notification sound&amp;quot; saying there was a new post on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it really meant that my double had found its way into the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; world.

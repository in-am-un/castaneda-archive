Heightened awareness makes it hard, since you are technically already asleep.\n\nInstead, you can gaze at the dark wall laying on your side and continue practicing.  \n\nBut eventually you slide into dreaming states.\n\nHalf the time I end up in Cholita's resort, but too far into it to find Cholita.   \n\nI tend to encounter other people who practice sorcery in there.  \n\nIs it worth thinking about that part?\n\nProbably not.  But Taisha's new book mentions it, and I suspect it's a common thing among practitioners.  To end up in a \"shared space\" during lucid dreaming.\n\nIt's just that, it's easy to misrepresent such a thing.\n\nFor instance, I was thinking about a particular Tensegrity move last night, when I remembered Carlos correcting me.  \n\nHe held my arm out, and suggested I had to project more.  Like, 50 feet more.\n\nExcept, when did that happen????  \n\nI remembered it from yesterday. Clearly. No mistake possible.\n\nAnd not from 23 years ago.\n\nSo anyone listening, don't build up your visits to sorcerer's nether realms too much.\n\nIt's bad for the general community to give the impression you need help from anyone.\n\nIf someone else you they saw don Juan or Carlos in dreaming, run. And be sure to keep an eye on your wallet, until you get far enough away.\n\nThe other half of the time, when I don't hang out in a phantom world, Fancy starts messing with me.\n\nA couple of nights ago she was helping me with some really fun stuff, but than afterwards I found myself looking at a \"perfect man\".\n\nAll you had to do was look at him, and you \"knew\" that mankind was meant to be like him.\n\nHe was beyond enlightened. He was perfect.  And you felt a sense of perfect bliss, health, and even magic, just by looking at him.\n\nHe was awake, but bent in half.  \n\nI'm not sure why he was encased in a hollow white oval.\n\nOr why on earth I didn't jump up in horror, because a man in a cocoon was laying next to me on the bed!\n\nI kept looking at him, wishing I could remember \"how men should be\",  so I could copy it later.\n\nIt was a revelation!\n\nI didn't want to lose that knowledge.  Plus, it as amazing just to gaze at him.\n\nIt never occurred to me, it was yet another abstract dream trap.\n\nAnd I didn't notice, again there were 3 of them.  The same as Fancy's pillows. I made a pic of that maybe 6 months ago.\n\nBut because it was pleasant, I didn't look from one to the other. I just gazed closely at the one, for hours perhaps.\n\nIt wasn't until I was in the shower that I realized it was yet another of Fancy's ways of stealing energy.\n\nShe traps your attention, so you don't move.\n\nIn this case, I didn't mind.\n\nShe gave me a glimpse of what that mold of man might be like.  Or perhaps, it was the human form?\n\nI can't recall.  Either it was God, or that human creature that hangs out around water holes.\n\nBut the important thing was, such a thing is possible.\n\nA \"being\" you only need to look at, in order to be fully content.

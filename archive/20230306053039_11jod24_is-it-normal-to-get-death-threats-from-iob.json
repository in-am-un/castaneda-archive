And not from that 1 foot thick &amp;quot;cheese slice&amp;quot; in the ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a pic I made, but the 3D one is going to be way better!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m49pxu3su6ma1.jpeg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=475d9a229d76713b67629caf8734f534c74379f8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/m49pxu3su6ma1.jpeg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=475d9a229d76713b67629caf8734f534c74379f8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how can they communicate with us, if we don&amp;#39;t have much at all in common?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; on silent knowledge. They can trigger it for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then we &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; what we know about them.  How we &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; about them, and maybe we &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; how they &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; about us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except both are subject to &amp;quot;crappy SK&amp;quot; (silent knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It even produces their appearance!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for example, last night I was literally surrounded by cartoons, being &amp;quot;produced&amp;quot; by my Ally Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To explain her points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, the cartoons came from inside me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re an extension of an idea I had early on, to write a children&amp;#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t yet ditched my cable TV, and discovered streaming media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I didn&amp;#39;t realize that ANYTHING which is a streaming movie, gets play on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My &amp;quot;idea&amp;quot; to make a children&amp;#39;s book, was simply elaborated on by my allies, combined with my new knowledge of how advanced animation software  has become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be foolish to assume my Ally &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; had gone out and watched dozens of 3D animation tutorials, as I had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that she&amp;#39;d been watching endless Disney cartoons, to learn what people seem to like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The allies are not ChatGTP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just have a &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can cause you to receive SK directly into your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on that, they &amp;quot;appear&amp;quot; to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If  the appearance is monstrous or threatening, that&amp;#39;s entirely on you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go read about the talking lizards again from the early books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos kept messing it up, and the lizards finally stopped talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was just Minx, Cholita&amp;#39;s ally, channeling silent knowledge for Carlos, but with his assemblage point moved to the deep red, by Datura extracts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I suggest you make fun of the Ally&amp;#39;s threats, is because you&amp;#39;re making fun of yourself in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER, there are some &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; entities out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan warned us about those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t think those are a threat to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because don Juan said not to look directly at those too much, if you come across one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;notice you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the &amp;quot;allies&amp;quot; already noticed you the day you were born, and have been trying to make friends in your dreams ever since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;frenemies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you can read between the lines here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get death threats, because that&amp;#39;s how you basically feel about yourself so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recap likely helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But screw it!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just embrace the horror.

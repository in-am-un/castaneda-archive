In dreaming, then, the exercise is to dream that you lie down in exactly the same position and fall asleep again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What does that do?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It makes the assemblage point stay put, and I mean really stay put, in whatever position it is at the instant of that second falling asleep.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are the results of this exercise?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Total perception.

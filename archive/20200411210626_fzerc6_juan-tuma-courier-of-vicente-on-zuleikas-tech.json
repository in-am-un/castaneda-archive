That's what Tensegrity \"redeploys\".\n\nCarlos never said so, but if you look at how the techniques are designed, it makes sense.\n\nBut in my case, many of the things I see, made from light, are further away than I would expect.\n\nSomeone else on the net said the edge of the luminous shell is actually 15 feet away from you.\n\nThis Juan Tuma account seems to support the \"arms stretched out\" size, and not the huge 30 foot diameter size.\n\nHere's the thing about wiggling fingers on that point.\n\nThe easiest thing to see in darkness are the puffs or blobs of color.\n\nWatching those in silence, moves the assemblage point.  When it moves far enough, more things become visible.\n\nThe next easiest to see are whitish lines.  They sit on all flat surfaces. They create \"the wall\".  And they allow you to assemble other worlds.\n\nThe next easiest thing to see are dark waves.  Just wave your hand around in absolute darkness, and if you can see the whitish lines, you'll find the dark waves.\n\nIf you can see those, wiggling your fingers on that point produces dark tentacles.\n\nOr fibers. I'm not sure how thick you need to be to go from a fiber, to a tentacle.\n\nThey're attached to a glowing body around your stomach.  Wiggling on that point makes them visible.\n\nAnd here's a lesson for newbies.\n\nSorcery is NOT LIKE ANYTHING YOU LEARNED BEFORE!!!\n\nIf you ask, \"Why not try this, or do that?\", you're certainly not understanding much.\n\nI'll give an analogy.\n\nLet's say there's a special kind of red bat.  But you can only get a glimpse of it, by crawling over mountains of bat guano droppings.\n\nIt takes 2 hours just to traverse the droppings, and the space in there is only 2 feet high.

Our idea of a \"reasonable effort\", is grossly inadequate.\n\nThink in terms of MONTHS to make this technique work.  But the cool thing is, you'll get a fireworks show almost every time you wiggle in silence.\n\nAnd, even if you don't reach the goal, you'll be forcing yourself silent while looking at something coming from the second attention (the glow around there). You'll get into heightened awareness long before you fold in half.\n\nOnce there you'll be on equal footing with Carlos. He was always in heightened awareness when wiggling his fingers there.\n\nOne thing people don't take into account is, Carlos learned everything in heightened awareness.\n\nThe stuff he did the rest of the time was just for rediscovering what he'd already learned.\n\nWe're without that.  So #1 priority is to get to heightened awareness.\n\nI probably only have around 100 hours into Zuleica's technique, and it gets a little easier to see what's up each time.  I even managed to touch the floor with a tentacle, two times.\n\nFirst time I was sitting on pillows in darkness, wiggling my fingers there. At some point I stopped.

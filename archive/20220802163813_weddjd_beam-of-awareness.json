To use the puffs to tell you when it's working.\n\nShort of that, you might \"blank out\" or \"doze off for an instant\" during darkroom. That's a good sign.\n\nAlso, you're supposed to be doing tensegrity while forcing silence for the first part, and it's rather obvious while doing tensegrity if you are thinking.\n\nIt worries me that you thought counting backwards would work. What gave you that idea?\n\nHow far into the tensegrity long form can you go, with absolutely no words?   A long form can simply be the 10 mashing energy movements, strung together.\n\nYou ought to be able to answer that by now.\n\n1 movement?  2?\n\nI usually find that someone who has trouble can't answer those types of questions, indicating maybe they didn't try it yet.\n\nCan you finish an entire long form with 0 words popping into your mind?\n\nNo.  Of course not.  Not even I can do that.  \n\nBut I can get close, and trust me when I say it gets really amazing when I'm close.  Like, switching reality amazing.  Or suddenly I'm wearing a real, fully functional but bizarre, \"iron man suit\". With surrounding 360 computer displays.\n\nUsually if someone asks what you asked, it means they haven't been following instructions.\n\nAnd are perhaps sitting on the bed trying to do part of darkroom, ignoring the rest.  Maybe next to a wife or husband, just partly propped up on a pillow.  Or even laying on their side facing away from the other person.\n\nIf you're trying to cut corners,  it's never worked for anyone before.\n\nOtherwise, other \"systems\" would not be so lame that they never get to see real magic.\n\nHere's the key rules, other than wear socks if you can get away with it, because the tensegrity moves work better if  your feet can slide a little on the floor.\n\n1    Need a dark room.  But some have found puffs using the mask, so you can use that.\n\n2   Need eyes open, so your body doesn't think it's time to go to sleep.  \n\n3  Need to be fully sober. However, alcohol or THC are ok if they've worn off.\n\n4  Must force out every single word so fiercely, it's agony.  You will literally drip blood from your nose if you get it right.  At least, perhaps once during your \"career\".\n\n5  Need to do the tensegrity so that the \"puffs\", which are pieces of your double, float around near you to \"play\".  Normally they're pushed to the outside of our shell, slightly further away than your fingers could reach.\n\nI'm not sure you'd actually be able to see anything, if those puffs didn't get loosened by the tensegrity.  It's not like they're all in your head, or are always floating around freely.\n\nThey're real!\n\nThey've FLED from you, and are pressed far away against an egg shell, trying to avoid getting too close.\n\nYou stink to them!  Or more properly, you give them the \"creeps\".  \n\nMaybe a hot bath could substitute for darkroom and tensegrity, if done in perfect silence.\n\nBut \"hot bath darkroom\" is not a known topic.  Cholita probably knows, since she used to spend a lot of time in the tub.\n\nBut she won't talk.\n\nIf you can't find a room to use, can't make it dark, can't walk around doing tensegrity because of not living alone, try forcing silence in a hot bath with the bathroom lights off.  \n\nMaybe block the window with the towel  you plan to use. If you can't, get some duct tape to use.\n\nMight work.  Just try anything to see a purple blob.\n\nKeep in mind the absurdity of all of this...\n\nYou're worried maybe none of it is true.\n\nYet, as a child you saw this stuff all the time.\n\nHow can it have been wiped clean from all of our minds?\n\nAnd I just posted some \"Buddha bashing\" on facebook.\n\nSo naturally I got flack over it.\n\nBuddhists who have high opinions of themselves and their practices.\n\nMeanwhile, when I go home today I have to check to make sure there aren't 2 copies of Cholita walking around.\n\nI literally have to check for that!\n\nI have to try to sneak a peek of the side of our house, to see if there's bad spells being cast.\n\nCholita's spells sort of work!  She can take out the wifi router with an angry stare.\n\nAnd if I take a nap in the evening planning to wake up at 2AM, I have to ignore if a demon decides to wake me up much earlier, claiming I slept too long.   \n\nInstead of shouting out in total panic and fleeing for my life, I have to turn slowly, look at them, and tell them they're looking really good today.\n\nIf I hear a rodent with long nails running around under my bed, I have to just ignore it.\n\nOr tell Minx to go back to Cholita's room.\n\nIt's just standard weirdness in the home of sorcerers.  Common in all of the books of Carlos and the witches.\n\nMeanwhile,  the dignified Buddhists say buddhism has nothing to do with magic.  So they're satisfied they're on the right path, since nothing is actually supposed to happen.\n\nThe Dzogchen ones tell stories of a great Dzogchen magic man up in the mountains somewhere. But they can't tell you where.\n\nAnd if you keep asking, they'll punch you!\n\nThey both have excuses for why they have no magic.  Magic???  Why \"that can take several lifetimes\", they'll say with a straight face.\n\nExactly my point!!!\n\nSeems to me, perhaps you've been drinking out of the gutter too much?  Tried other stuff that doesn't work anyway, and so it's ok to cut corners or \"approximate\"?\n\nSo you don't realize how precise this has to be, or how hard you have to work to produce results?\n\nYet there are alternatives to darkroom.\n\nGazing at ferns in sunlight, such that there's interesting shadows going on.\n\nLet your eyes cross or uncross or whatever they like, to produce the weirdest looking situation.\n\nThen force silence, until something happens.\n\nDon't ignore blanking out for an instant and having a quick mini-dream.\n\nThat's the grand prize.\n\nBut gazing at ferns can also produce weird flickers, or a little rainbow of color sparkling for an instant on the edge of some fern details, which you feel compelled to ignore until you realize that's what you were after.\n\nFinally, if nothing is working for you do recap 2 hours a night, working hard to remember even tiny details of the past, while following the head sweeping and breathing exercises perfectly.\n\nNo modifications!\n\nThat's even FASTER than darkroom.\n\nWhen done right.\n\nBut no one ever does it right, and it has no built in \"test of whether you are doing it right\".\n\nDarkroom has the \"puff test\".", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iipmfe9", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the puffs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the whole point of darkroom.

So if you can see the whitish light and didn't do a recap, go for it!\n\nBut the recapitulation gaze with head sweep, is MAGIC all by itself.\n\nSo if you try using the gaze on the whitish light and can't make it work well, consider some recap.\n\nYou use that gaze you perfected through recap, the head sweeping gaze, in darkroom after you move at least to the beginning of the orange zone on the J curve map.\n\nFor beginners, that's here:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3](https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3)\n\nYou can use it earlier than that \"orange station\", but it's going to be kind of \"bumpy\".\n\nIn the green zone, maybe nothing will come of it. In the red zone, some intense purple puffs might follow you around.  Could even cause an inorganic being to become curious why you seem to be in a \"trance\".\n\nBut once the \"whitish light\" appears, something Carlos greatly emphasized, you can make it \"turn into something\".  And for the most part, the inorganic beings leave beginners in the orange zone alone a while.  Don't ask me why.  But I suspect they do.\n\nLater maybe they don't care.\n\nThat's kind of what the whitish light is for.  Turning it into something.\n\nIt's a view of the raw emanations, but in \"unformed\" state.\n\nAnd only \"in general\".\n\nCarlos also referred to it as \"seeing energy\".  It's the \"seeing energy in dreaming\" thing too, which allows you to find \"real energy generating worlds\" for 4 gates dreaming exploration.\n\nAnd forget that stuff.  You go down that ordinary dreaming road, and it only leads to the dark side. Giving up or cheating other people with delusional pretending.  Or at the least, you'll start pretending your ordinary dreams are magic just to yourself, and that will still destroy your chances to learn the real thing.\n\nAs it has for \"Astral Travelers\".  Done in by Monroe's scheme to steal from Castaneda fans.\n\n**Later** you can try sleeping dreaming.  Once you master the waking kind!\n\nSo if you see \"lines\" in the whitish light on surfaces during darkroom practice, those are NOT individual emanations.\n\nBut once you learn to scan your \"beam of awareness\" over the walls of your room, using your steady recapitulation gaze to \"burn a dent down the middle of it\", you can uncover individual bright line segments in the air.\n\nSome of THOSE are individual emanations.\n\nIf you find one of those and it gives off a \"feeling\" along with a sense of buzzing, or electricity, you saw an emanation.\n\nBut don't do that!  It's far too advanced and requires you to be at the DEEP end of the orange on the J curve.\n\nBetter to just look for deformities in the whitish light, sweeping it with your beam of awareness.\n\nBy the way, the \"pomegranate dot\" of Carlos, the one that spits out text, can be found at that level.\n\nBut don't obsess over it.\n\nIt's much easier to just \"take what you get\" at first.  And practicing failure is depressing, so avoid it if possible.\n\nShining your \"gaze light\" on those deformities in the whitish light causes them to take on more form.\n\nYou've \"challenged *intent*\" to show you what that is.\n\nNaturally, all this takes a near complete absence of internal dialogue.\n\nSo if you haven't even succeeded at that, please don't try advanced stuff.\n\nIt's like a little boy putting on Mommy's clothes, including underwear, and running around on the street outside their home.\n\nThere's no one going to be fooled by it, and you look pretty awful doing that. It's an obvious cry for attention.\n\nWe have 2 subreddits doing that right now.  Angry little boys who got kicked out of here for mentally ill behavior, running around in Mommy's clothes under the guise of sorcery.  Won't survive.  No magic, no interest . Once the anger wears off.\n\nYou MUST learn some \"sobriety\" or sorcery is impossible!\n\nIf you want cash, forget it!\n\nBut when you get your \"beam of awareness\" working on the \"whitish light you can see on surfaces\", which is automatic when you move your assemblage point down your back and then under the bottom and up to the front, you can get some AMAZINGLY cool stuff to happen.\n\nHey...\n\nMerlin the Magician?  You can kick his Medieval butt.\n\nDr. Strange?\n\nProbably not, but you could make him a little jealous at times.\n\nYou can literally \"burn a hole in reality\" and endless stuff spills out, like someone cut a hole in the wall that holds back toyland.\n\nToys spill out into the room.  Fully visible toys!\n\nYour beam is actually \"intent\" in some human form.  You \"get to use it\".\n\nIt's not much different than Cholita's gaze that can move dim sum plates.\n\nOr other small objects, but that's the largest I saw her move just by glancing at it.\n\nShe probably can't really do that.\n\nHer Ally does it for her. I saw \"Fairy\" fly under a plate for her one time, before she was able to move it. It bumped up into the air at least a half inch.\n\nI guess Fairy was a little on the heavy side that day.  She seems to have gotten even fatter playing with Juann last year.\n\nBut it uses Cholita's gaze to decide what to move, and she can repeat it over and over.\n\nSo it's as good as  if she's figured out how to move objects.\n\nWell..  Three times is the max I saw, before she got angry with me for being too excited about it.\n\nThat's against the rules she was taught.\n\nSo at the level of a beginner who just got the breath change, you can scan the whitish light and make \"things\" form where you see a disturbance (in the force?!??).\n\nYou'll see some vague dots or bubbles, against the whitish light.\n\nScan your beam over them slowly from various directions, mostly horizontal at center of wall to keep it comfortable, until it gets brighter and more real.\n\nGet up and walk over there!\n\nDon't sit on the bed like that idiot \"The Buddha\" with your eyes closed, and smiling for the cameras because you're in \"bliss\".\n\nWhat a putz...\n\nWalk over to that wall, stand 6 feet back from it, and stretch out your arm to right under the disturbance.\n\nThen use your gaze on it.\n\nA very real toy will fall off the wall and land right in your hand.\n\nIt only gets better from there...\n\nBy the way, when you get good at it you can stretch your arm 20 feet over to the wall.\n\nI just prefer you get up a little, so you don't fall into \"buddha boy\" delusions.\n\nWe lost our only male double being to that make believe stuff.", "edited": 1659462750.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iinslw7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginners can learn to do this FOR REAL though recapitulation (need a few months of real work on it), and then darkroom practices until you can &amp;quot;see stuff that isn&amp;#39;t there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you HAVE to do the recap?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know.

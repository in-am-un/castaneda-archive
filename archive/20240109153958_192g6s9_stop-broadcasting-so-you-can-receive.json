It saves me a lot of time. Always needs some editing, but the pieces are better drawn for my purpose, then using random images from google.\n\nIf you put yourself in a position to help others learn sorcery, and you yourself work hard, you get \"rewards\" in the form of gifts of magic, intended to be shared with others.\n\nIt's the \"group intent\".\n\nIn some ways, sorcery is ONLY learned by \"intending it\". And nothing else actually matters.\n\nYou simply \"intend\" to learn our sorcery.\n\nBut in practice it's not that simple, and you have to make a serious effort and carefully follow the instructions Carlos gave us. Which no one seems to ever do.\n\nIt's almost as if, in order to \"intend\" to learn sorcery you have to PROVE that you are sincere.\n\nBut with your DEEDS also!\n\nWe aren't just what we \"think we are\", at some idiotic level far above the noise of our internal dialogue.\n\nYou can't **pretend** to *intend*!\n\nBut, shouting \"INTENT!\" was recommended by Carlos, before a serious undertaking.\n\nSo the power of words is in fact a factor.\n\nJust not enough to do the job at our level.\n\nSo one day Carlos told us to \"walk to San Diego\". After class. Immediately.\n\nThat was 110 miles!\n\nBy so doing, we could prove we were serious and infinity would come to help.\n\nBut that's almost EXACTLY how Silent Knowledge works. When you stop \"beaming\" your energy out into infinity, filled with chaos and a noisy internal dialogue, you have proven to the dark sea of awareness that you are ready to \"receive\".\n\nStop transmitting, and you'll start receiving.\n\nWell... That's not quite right.  Let me see if I can explain better.\n\nInfinity is likely ALWAYS sending us helpful images.  Helpful \"videos in the air\".\n\nOr helpful text you could read, if you prefer to be a \"Reader of Infinity\".\n\nI could switch back and forth last night, just by looking for one or the other.\n\nAnd I realized, for the thousandth time, reality isn't actually real.\n\nIt's a projection of feelings from the emanations.  Trillions of feels are needed to create our daily reality.\n\nPerhaps even millions just to make an \"object\", like a car tire.\n\nBut why are those particular \"feelings\" coming back to you?\n\nWhy not Argentina?\n\nWhy not Mars?!\n\nWell, those could!  Don't forget Zuleica taking Carlos, La Gorda, and Josefina to another world, so they could watch the 2 suns it had rise in the morning there.\n\nThey even went early to avoid the daytime glare.\n\nSo in front of you are all sorts of possible worlds. Why is one in particular selected?\n\nIt's because your attention is focused on it!\n\nIf you can refocus it, you'll get a different world.\n\nOr if you don't focus at all, infinity will make selections for you!\n\nIt's like NetFlix and their \"recommended for you\"  selections.\n\nInfinity will make recommendations, if you are calm and quiet and don't insist on having your way, for where your awareness focuses.\n\nBut are the alternate realities you get to view this vivid for real???\n\nMore so!\n\nI just couldn't afford the time to draw it myself.\n\nBut this is close.\n\nAnd I did a lot more than that, last night. Most of which can't possibly be described.\n\nHopefully you'll join me and eventually we could create a new syntax, where you can describe a lot more than modern humans currently can.\n\nIf you have a lot of dreaming energy because you saved it up, you can even go visit those Olmec women in the marketplace.\n\n3000 years ago.\n\nIn your physical body, or so it seems at the time.\n\nShoes, pants, and all.\n\nBut... Are they the same shoes and pants?\n\nThere's the mystery.\n\nI always forget to look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stop \"Broadcasting\" So You Can Receive!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"0n1sujz7lfbc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bd7ec043df6d4604a970aaec84a925289e12d1b"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f357f270fa66140c439dc216ef92c5818304ae2f"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=008101b7c4764ce618ed839924b312c47627e565"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=563c43e6a4e7fc88ee3036b97e4cb1402e72ba42"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17bc8d3f8f4312c59ba5a76291e2aed0710519f9"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af39e1b2cf8b7821d5d08ee3b2addee0b3fadf36"}], "s": {"y": 1792, "x": 1792, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=1792&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11db92ea6f7b14671e561f82fb9465ea7eaba1f7"}, "id": "0n1sujz7lfbc1"}}, "name": "t3_192g6s9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 42, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 42, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0CgS8WbW5US7J8SEblMYHRAVU5T_hsaNJCZO8OUmTU8.jpg", "edited": 1704813325.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1704811198.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=1792&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=11db92ea6f7b14671e561f82fb9465ea7eaba1f7\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0n1sujz7lfbc1.jpg?width=1792&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=11db92ea6f7b14671e561f82fb9465ea7eaba1f7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another AI creation.

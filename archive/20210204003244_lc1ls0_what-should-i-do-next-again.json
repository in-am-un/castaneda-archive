How did that happen???\n\nEven Carol Tiggs and the witches don't want that job.\n\nNor do I.\n\nBut the thought worried me, and that left traces of intent in my mind.\n\nAround 1AM I work up in bed, opened my eyes, and found I had a military style display superimposed over the view of the room.\n\nIt was a series of squares made of green light, quite thin, forming a tunnel.  When I gazed at the tunnel, I moved in \"depth\".\n\nIt took me a while to realize, it was a side effect of observing the abstract.\n\nIn case anyone missed it, according to don Juan, the \"abstract\" becomes visible if you can get your double to come out where you are, so you can feel \"here\", and \"there\".\n\nHumans have a 2 point reference system.  But in order to get from here to there, you have to move in space.\n\nAnd once you can feel that \"depth\", you can find the abstract.\n\nI don't know what it is, but likely it's a realm of pure \\*intent\\*.\n\nNot \\*intent\\* itself, but somehow connected to it.\n\nOnce you are \"infected\", it seems that it can make a visit to your dark room, on it's own.  It just \"pops out\".\n\nLike that figure 8.\n\nMesmerizing.  That's what the abstract is.\n\nSome of the other stuff you see there is Mystery and Fancy sort of competing with each other for who gets to \"teach\" me.\n\nFancy wants to instruct horizontal shifting.  But Mystery likes to give history lessons.\n\nIt's almost like Fancy is an inorganic being, but \"Mystery\" is closer to the dreaming emissary.\n\nExcept, I'm awake.  So how could there be a difference?\n\nOne side effect of having an \"abstract object\" show up, is that it blows open the dreaming realms.\n\nCholita's phantom copy of the house became fully available, as the east wall of my room simply went away.\n\nMy theory now is, the \"depth\" you learn allows you to penetrate into full on dreaming too.\n\nBut the other theory is that Cholita felt bad about saying she wanted to look at this subreddit,  and then blowing it off.\n\nTwo days in a row!\n\nShe might have arranged entry for me.\n\nSo now, down to business.\n\nIf you get to the point that you want to ask what to do next, can't you just play with your toys a while?\n\nDoes Christmas rub off so soon?  By afternoon you need new toys?\n\nI'm still trying to figure out how to put the swing set together.   I'll go out and get batteries later.\n\nSo try making it more real for a while.  Spend a little time with your witch, learning evil magic.\n\nGet some history lessons.  Spy on friends, on the bedspread or through the wall.\n\nEven go fishing on the floor!\n\nThere should be plenty to do for a year or two.\n\nAnd what you see there is no exaggeration.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's always that nice, but if I keep forcing silence it gets there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0,

He was running so fast that he had no time to think. A tremendous force was pulling him, making him race over boulders and fallen trees, as if they were not there.\n\nAfter he had run in that desperate fashion for quite a while, don Juan braved a quick look at the reddish, rushing water. And he saw himself being roughly tumbled by the current. Nothing in his experience had prepared him for such a moment. He knew then, without involving his thought processes, that he was in two places at once. And in one of them, in the rushing river, he was helpless.\n\nAll his energy went into trying to save himself.\n\nWithout thinking about it, he began angling away from the riverbank. It took all his strength and determination to edge an inch at a time. He felt as if he were dragging a tree. He moved so slowly that it took him an eternity to gain a few yards.\n\nThe strain was too much for him. Suddenly he was no longer running; he was falling down a deep well. When he hit the water, the coldness of it made him scream. And then he was back in the river, being dragged by the current. His fright upon finding himself back in the rushing water was so intense that all he could do was to wish with all his might to be safe and sound on the riverbank. And immediately he was there again, running at breakneck speed parallel to, but a distance from, the river.\n\nAs he ran, he looked at the rushing water and saw himself struggling to stay afloat. He wanted to yell a command; he wanted to order himself to swim at an angle, but he had no voice. His anguish for the part of him that was in the water was overwhelming. It served as a bridge between the two Juan Matuses. He was instantly back in the water, swimming at an angle toward the bank.\n\nThe incredible sensation of alternating between two places was enough to eradicate his fear. He no longer cared about his fate. He alternated freely between swimming in the river and racing on the bank. But whichever he was doing, he consistently moved toward his left, racing away from the river or paddling to the left shore.\n\nHe came out on the left side of the river about five miles downstream. He had to wait there, sheltering in the shrubs, for over a week. He was waiting for the waters to subside so he could wade across, but he was also waiting until his fright wore off and he was whole again.\n\nDon Juan said that what had happened was that the strong, sustained emotion of fighting for his life had caused his assemblage point to move squarely to the place of silent knowledge. Because he had never paid any attention to what the nagual Julian told him about the assemblage point, he had no idea what was happening to him. He was frightened at the thought that he might never be normal again. But as he explored his split perception, he discovered its practical side and found he liked it. He was double for days. He could be thoroughly one or the other. Or he could be both at the same time. When he was both, things became fuzzy and neither being was effective, so he abandoned that alternative. But being one or the other opened up inconceivable possibilities for him.\n\nWhile he recuperated in the bushes, he established that one of his beings was more flexible than the other and could cover distances in the blink of an eye and find food or the best place to hide. It was this being that once went to the nagual's house to see if they were worrying about him.\n\nHe heard the young people crying for him, and that was certainly a surprise. He would have gone on watching them indefinitely, since he adored the idea of finding out what they thought of him, but the nagual Julian caught him and put an end to it.\n\n**That was the only time he had been truly afraid of the nagual. Don Juan heard the nagual telling him to stop his nonsense. He appeared suddenly, a jet black, bell-shaped object of immense weight and strength. He grabbed don Juan. Don Juan did not know how the nagual was grabbing him, but it hurt in a most unsettling way.

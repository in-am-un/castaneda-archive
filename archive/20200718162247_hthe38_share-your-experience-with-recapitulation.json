Ive started yesterday with my recapitulation. As Dani said,  the lack of control that i had in my dark room practices was becoming so obvious.\n\nAs most of the sorcery exercises, it took a little effort to get started. But remember that once it starts, you have done half the work. So i found it very interesting, specially the details i could remember, that definitely can make you feel exactly the same way you felt at the moment. Memories flow very naturally, so when starting I doubt the usefulness of making an exhaustive list. And it becomes obvious too, the energy that you have left there.\n\nAlso, i have noticed that this activity is perfect to precede the Dark room! An hour of recapitulation takes me to a colourful dark room, with lot of lights everywhere and my IOBs ready to play; this usually takes me an hour or more of being bored watching darkness.\n\nAnd i have more interesting ideas! The recapitulation could work in the Darkroom too: especially when you're not getting results or getting upset. This can work as a energy boost; some minits of recap and you will be watching very bright colors! Lets see what Dan thinks about this. For me it worked perfectly.\n\nFinally, I will tell you about my results in the Dark Room, and I hope you will also tell me about yours. My nights are not so regular, so i can have a crazy night followed by a really boring one.  But the ones that are crazy ... make the whole work totally worth it. Better than watching any movie. And i have to confess that one of my favourite part is when i finish the practice, so i walk through my house watching everything with my second atention activated. At this point, you prove that magic doesn't just happen in the dark. Its always there, but you have to learn to find it.  Every movement you make generates colors, the air is dense, you see lights everywhere. Any type of routine activity becomes wonderful. For instance, when I brushed my teeth, I saw an incredible amount of colors as a result of the rapid movement, while my two IOBs were trying to understand wtf I was doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote this after practice, still very silent, because i know that tomorrow i will be very unsure of my self, wondering if i should post this or not (ego stuff).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Note: I'm a complete newbie; I started practicing in the darkroom just over 2 weeks ago.

I mean, they will absolutely come around, if you've ever had a monster under your bed.\n\nYou stir up old emanations, possibly even the ones they stuck in you, by scaring the shit out of you as a child.\n\nThey kind of like to do that.  Possibly they even \"mark\" you that way.\n\nAs don Juan said about Tony Lama when he struck his shoulder, \"I've marked you.\"\n\nAnd as they hang out around you during recap, even if you don't know it, you pick up dark energy.  Which is useful for moving the assemblage point, while gazing in darkness.\n\nRecap also leads to the dreaming body coming nearer to you, which enhances the scenes.\n\nThe dreaming double makes the colors you can find in darkness, \"directional\".\n\nAnd, you can learn to \"see energy\" during recap, although with the eyes closed you won't realize it unless someone has warned you ahead of time.\n\nLook for light that can't be there!  Or for your body moving on it's own, to point something out to you.\n\nEven just a finger lifting up on it's own.  That indicates your dreaming double is sort of merged with you, an effect you'll learn about while playing with colors in darkness.\n\nWhen it merges with you, you can walk through the wall.\n\nAlso look for blank-outs in the middle of a sweep of the head, where you realize you blanked out,  try to finish that sweep, but find you blank out again before it's done.\n\nThe assemblage point moved a little ways, and you didn't refocus on the new situation. So you blank out.\n\nBingo!  Don't overlook that!   You're on the edge of the second attention. Or even deeper than the edge.  And you just moved your assemblage point!\n\nPeople sometimes ask me how to make the list.\n\nFeeling a little guilty for being obsessive, with a tiny bit of egotism too, I tell them what I did.\n\nDon't overlook egotism as a motivation for recapitulation!

So it got longer a few times, rather than shorter.\n\nThen I went to the grocery store and looked at every single item on the shelves, trying to find more memories.\n\nI kept that up until there were none.  For example, I looked at the box of \"Cream of Wheat\" cereal, and could find no more elementary school memories it would trigger.\n\nThen I visited every place I'd ever lived, looking around and walking on foot most of the time.\n\nI discovered that way, that even junk on the side of the road was useful.\n\nSo I wandered around on roads, looking at old nuts and bolts rusting there, or pieces of wire left by the power company.

Perhaps *intent* gives your assemblage point a tiny push, knowing that will release new energy, which will reward you for your efforts.\n\nMain thing to realize: it's normal.  You aren't trying to learn the \"what\".  You are trying to learn the \"how\".\n\nThe \"what\" is practical magic.   Don't be obsessed with trying to do it the next day also.\n\nThe \"how\" is what produces it.\n\nUntil you can produce it, obsession with repeating practical magic is a hindrance.\n\nAnd each time you struggle, you gain more than when you have a crazy cool experience.\n\n\\&gt; Note: I'm a complete newbie;\n\nI'm more optimistic about newbies becoming real sorcerers, than old timers.\n\nSome of the old timers are obsessed with some future book deal they've long envision for themselves, and become angry if  they hear someone else is further along than they are.\n\nIn other words, they have no actual interest in sorcery. They stick around because life is miserable at the normal position of the assemblage point, and believing it's going to get better helps them get by.\n\nThey're church goers.  Pew statues. Inspirational quote junkies.\n\nThe ones who are actually interested have something stopping them from learning it, and that thing is still there.\n\nThe newbies seem to jump in fastest if they remember seeing magic as a child, which means they have higher energy levels than the average bored fuck.\n\nSo they have talent.\n\nFortunately, all we need is 10 waking dreamers, with some IOBs to each one, and we can put a little excitement into the entire Castaneda population.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1595094146.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fyh269a", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I never thought about using recap as a warmup!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It activates the dreaming attention because you&amp;#39;re sitting there with your eyes closed interrupting your internal dialogue with memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, in that sense, it qualifies as a form of Contemplative Meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it goes much further than that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs love it!

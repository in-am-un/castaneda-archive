The right hand hasn&amp;#39;t worked since Cholita came to stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I\u2019ll try my feet also!  Why not?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Out&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yea, I remember that. I\u2019m not sure from where.  But people did ask Carlos about the claw in private class.  I just don\u2019t remember what he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking \u201cout\u201d will make it harder to get silent.  Not impossible, but more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, most &amp;quot;witchcraft&amp;quot; does not require silence at all. Just interrupted internal dialogue. Not the normal petty one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s concentrated on pushing a bad feeling out, it might be ok. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So at the very least, try to interrupt the normal discourse going on up there.  Don\u2019t fret about the bad things going on at work, while you say the \u201cout\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, it\u2019s just like a mantra and should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, with perfect silence you could get Doctor Hippocrates to materialize for a house call.  He might be a little pale, after 2000 years. But he\u2019d come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;#39;t be easy, but the point is, silence produces astounding results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone\u2019s thinking the Hippocrates is a stretch, you should know that I had both of Carlos\u2019 allies make a \u201chouse call\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was worried I was losing my mind, when I called them all the way from Asia and they showed up in 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tunnel of light formed, they were in the middle of it smiling away, and I got up and ran for my life into the bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, the two of them made a \u201chouse call\u201d, as a psychiatrist and his assistant in a white outfit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so petrified, I didn\u2019t run fast enough and they stepped out of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bath wasn\u2019t big enough for the 3 of us, so I ran all across a very nice hotel, looking back over my shoulder from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_duzt9b", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/duzt9b/sorcery_passes_for_pain_relief/f7a2bzx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1573519083.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1573519083.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f79ur7l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dissysissy", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1573515528.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f79pynl", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_d3hwno9", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "You sure it is the right hand instead of the left?

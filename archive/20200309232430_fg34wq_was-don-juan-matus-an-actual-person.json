Look at watch.\n\nMaybe edit your link and add:\n\n&amp;t=XXmYYs\n\nWhere XX is the minute, and YY is the seconds.  Where she says that.\n\nNo, Carlos never mentioned don Juan not being real. To the contrary, he always insisted he was.\n\nTony Lama said he met him, along with Pablito and La Gorda.  I can't imagine why Tony would lie about that.  He even seems to have known some details that were only mentioned in private classes. And of course, Tony visited us on occasion, and the women wanted to fuck him big time.\n\nBut he wanted to be a Tibetan Lama.\n\nOn the other hand, Carlos took some women down to Mexico, and claimed they just met don Juan, after he pointed to a random guy walking by.  They didn't get to actually run over and talk to him. They were sitting on a bench, and watching him walk was all they got to do.\n\nOn the weird side, I believe don Juan was already gone, which doesn't make that story less likely. It makes it more likely they could see him walk by, but not go talk to him.\n\nOr that could have been intended as a \"blank check\" for them. I got two of those that I know of.\n\nThe pear was one, the other was that meeting behind a locked door, at the bottom of Dance Home, when no one was there.  And Carlos spoke to me about dying.\n\nThen there's the fact that Carlos started out at Morongo, and the dreaming sorceress there said, yes.  People like don Juan used to live all over that valley.\n\nAnd the person who brought him there implied he went eastward because he didn't find what he wanted at Morongo. Eastward and slightly south from Morongo is Arizona.\n\nMorongo was still needing Devil's Weed to do anything. Both the female and male sorcerers, whom I knew personally.  John is in fact, probably still alive.  At least, when I brought that double woman down to Morongo, he was.  5  years ago maybe.\n\nBut Morongo wasn't the place to find the best source for powerful sorcery. It would be natural he'd go east.\n\nAnd I suspect Lowell Bean already had first dibbs on Morongo, as an anthropologist in the UC system.  He and my father set up a printing press to make books written by the Indians there.\n\nI suspect the general consensus in here is that Carlos conspired with whoever was teaching him, to drop all the knowledge into the world in general, and see what happens.\n\nAnd that the books had all kinds of tinkering by sorcerers.\n\nAnd enough was changed (it wouldn't take much) to make it impossible to figure out who don Juan was.\n\nYou couldn't have released this knowledge to the whole world, 100 years ago.\n\nBut now, it's a piece of cake.\n\nAnd tinkering with the story is not that difficult.\n\nIt's a map.\n\nYou just need to put key ideas into it, so that people look for specific things, and ignore others.

What exactly are you telling me you can actually do?  You mean he didn&amp;#39;t make it all up???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead you get smile, yawn, awkward crossing of the legs.   Look at watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe edit your link and add:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;t=XXmYYs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where XX is the minute, and YY is the seconds.  Where she says that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, Carlos never mentioned don Juan not being real. To the contrary, he always insisted he was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tony Lama said he met him, along with Pablito and La Gorda.  I can&amp;#39;t imagine why Tony would lie about that.  He even seems to have known some details that were only mentioned in private classes. And of course, Tony visited us on occasion, and the women wanted to fuck him big time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he wanted to be a Tibetan Lama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Carlos took some women down to Mexico, and claimed they just met don Juan, after he pointed to a random guy walking by.  They didn&amp;#39;t get to actually run over and talk to him. They were sitting on a bench, and watching him walk was all they got to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the weird side, I believe don Juan was already gone, which doesn&amp;#39;t make that story less likely. It makes it more likely they could see him walk by, but not go talk to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that could have been intended as a &amp;quot;blank check&amp;quot; for them. I got two of those that I know of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pear was one, the other was that meeting behind a locked door, at the bottom of Dance Home, when no one was there.  And Carlos spoke to me about dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the fact that Carlos started out at Morongo, and the dreaming sorceress there said, yes.  People like don Juan used to live all over that valley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the person who brought him there implied he went eastward because he didn&amp;#39;t find what he wanted at Morongo. Eastward and slightly south from Morongo is Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morongo was still needing Devil&amp;#39;s Weed to do anything. Both the female and male sorcerers, whom I knew personally.  John is in fact, probably still alive.  At least, when I brought that double woman down to Morongo, he was.  5  years ago maybe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Morongo wasn&amp;#39;t the place to find the best source for powerful sorcery. It would be natural he&amp;#39;d go east.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I suspect Lowell Bean already had first dibbs on Morongo, as an anthropologist in the UC system.  He and my father set up a printing press to make books written by the Indians there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect the general consensus in here is that Carlos conspired with whoever was teaching him, to drop all the knowledge into the world in general, and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that the books had all kinds of tinkering by sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And enough was changed (it wouldn&amp;#39;t take much) to make it impossible to figure out who don Juan was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#39;t have released this knowledge to the whole world, 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now, it&amp;#39;s a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And tinkering with the story is not that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just need to put key ideas into it, so that people look for specific things, and ignore others.  The more vividly they remember the key items on the map, the better it will work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fg34wq/was_don_juan_matus_an_actual_person/fk2dcc7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1583798517.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_fg34wq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fk3qgb2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1583843437.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_fg34wq", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "There's absolutely nothing new about this question, people ask the exact same thing after any teacher or spiritual leader dies and a generation or two (47 years in this case) goes by...and those who knew them begin to die off.\n\nThe promise of what the teacher was offering is the  key determining factor, not their personhood.

Under what\rcircumstances did you meet him?\n\n\r\nAt that time, in the seventies, I was well known in certain circles, thanks to the film El Topo, which,\r\nto many, was an example of film magic. Castaneda had seen it twice and liked it. I found myself in\r\nMexico in a restaurant at which they serve a splendid steak and good wine. Castaneda was there in\r\nthe company of a Mexican actress whom he had met in the dive of a lady friend who was also there\r\nwith a man. Castaneda\u2014for it couldn\u2019t have been anyone else\u2014upon learning who I was, sent his\r\nfriend to our table. The woman asked me if I wanted to meet Castaneda. \u201cOf course,\u201d I replied, \u201cI am\r\na great admirer of his!\u201d She said that he would come sit at my table, but I insisted on going to his.\n\r\nA fantastic coincidence . . .\n\r\nLife is fantastic! I proposed to Castaneda that we go to his hotel, but he wanted to come to mine. We\r\nwere like two Chinese, competing in politeness. He did not cease to give me preference, and I did the\r\nsame, of course.\n\n\n\r\nAnd you didn\u2019t wonder if in fact you really were in the presence of Castaneda?\n\n\rNot for an instant. Later, in the United States, he published a book in which a portrait appears, a\r\ndrawing. And it is the portrait of the man I met.\n\n\n\r\nWhat was your first impression?\n\nIn Mexico, it is easy to determine the social class to which a man belongs simply by looking at him\r\nphysically. Castaneda has the appearance of a waiter.\n\n\r\nWhat!\n\r\nYes, he looks like any other man on the street. He is not fat, but very stocky, with curly hair and a\r\nnose slightly flattened: a Mexican of the popular class. But, as soon as he opens his mouth, he is\r\ntransformed into a prince; behind each of his words one senses a huge culture.\n\n\n\r\nIt gives the impression of wisdom?\r\nMore than wisdom, of friendliness. Quickly we became friends. He dressed simply and was having a\rnice fillet, washed down with a Beaujolais . . . It seemed like it wasn\u2019t Don Juan but rather Castaneda\r\nwho was featured in the books. I found myself caught up again in his tone, his voice, that was how it\r\nseemed . . .\n\n\n\r\nIn your opinion do his books narrate real stories or fiction?\n\n\r\nIt is difficult to say. My impression is that they are based on a real experience except for the parts that\r\nelaborate and introduce concepts extracted from universal esoteric literature. In his books you find\r\nZen, the Upanishads, the tarots, work with dreams . . . One thing is for sure: he went all over Mexico\r\nin order to do his investigations.\n\n\n\r\nDo you believe in the existence of Don Juan?\r\nNo. I believe that this character is a genius invention of Castaneda, who, of course, has met a number\r\nof Yaqui witches.\n\n\n\r\nHow did the conversation in the hotel room develop?\n\n\r\nIn the first place, he called to tell me he would arrive five minutes early. Such gentlemanliness\r\naffected me. Then, when he arrived, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you are a madman, a genius, a swindler,\r\nor if you tell the truth.\u201d He assured me that he said only the truth, and immediately afterwards he told\r\nme an incredible story, of how Don Juan, with a simple slap on the back, projected him forty\r\nkilometers away\u2014because he had been distracted by a woman who passed by. He also talked to me\r\nabout the sex life of Don Juan, who was capable of ejaculating fifteen times in a row. On the other\r\nhand, it appeared to me that Castaneda himself liked women a lot. He asked me if we might make a\r\nmovie together. Hollywood had offered him a lot of money, but he didn\u2019t want Don Juan to be\r\nAnthony Quinn . . . Then he began to have diarrhea, with a lot of pain in his stomach, something that,\r\nhe said, never happened to him, ever. I also had strong pains in the liver and in the right leg. It was\r\nstrange that those pains came when we started to make plans for a joint project. The pain made us\r\ncrawl about the room. I called a taxi and accompanied him to his hotel. Then I went to have Pachita\roperate on me. I had insisted that Castaneda go meet that exceptional woman, but he did not appear. I\rhad to stay in bed for three days. Once recovered, I called the hotel, but he had left. I did not ever see\rhim again: Life separated us. A warrior doesn\u2019t leave footprints.\n\nThat is to say, he seemed to be at the same time a con and a very interesting person . . .\n\r\nHe told me his stories of Don Juan with such conviction . . . I am accustomed to the theater, to actors,\rand he did not seem to be a liar.

But, as soon as he opens his mouth, he is\ntransformed into a prince; behind each of his words one senses a huge culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gives the impression of wisdom?\nMore than wisdom, of friendliness. Quickly we became friends. He dressed simply and was having a\nnice fillet, washed down with a Beaujolais . . . It seemed like it wasn\u2019t Don Juan but rather Castaneda\nwho was featured in the books. I found myself caught up again in his tone, his voice, that was how it\nseemed . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In your opinion do his books narrate real stories or fiction?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to say. My impression is that they are based on a real experience except for the parts that\nelaborate and introduce concepts extracted from universal esoteric literature. In his books you find\nZen, the Upanishads, the tarots, work with dreams . . . One thing is for sure: he went all over Mexico\nin order to do his investigations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you believe in the existence of Don Juan?\nNo. I believe that this character is a genius invention of Castaneda, who, of course, has met a number\nof Yaqui witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did the conversation in the hotel room develop?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first place, he called to tell me he would arrive five minutes early. Such gentlemanliness\naffected me. Then, when he arrived, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you are a madman, a genius, a swindler,\nor if you tell the truth.\u201d He assured me that he said only the truth, and immediately afterwards he told\nme an incredible story, of how Don Juan, with a simple slap on the back, projected him forty\nkilometers away\u2014because he had been distracted by a woman who passed by. He also talked to me\nabout the sex life of Don Juan, who was capable of ejaculating fifteen times in a row. On the other\nhand, it appeared to me that Castaneda himself liked women a lot. He asked me if we might make a\nmovie together. Hollywood had offered him a lot of money, but he didn\u2019t want Don Juan to be\nAnthony Quinn . . . Then he began to have diarrhea, with a lot of pain in his stomach, something that,\nhe said, never happened to him, ever. I also had strong pains in the liver and in the right leg. It was\nstrange that those pains came when we started to make plans for a joint project. The pain made us\ncrawl about the room. I called a taxi and accompanied him to his hotel. Then I went to have Pachita\noperate on me. I had insisted that Castaneda go meet that exceptional woman, but he did not appear. I\nhad to stay in bed for three days. Once recovered, I called the hotel, but he had left. I did not ever see\nhim again: Life separated us. A warrior doesn\u2019t leave footprints.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is to say, he seemed to be at the same time a con and a very interesting person . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me his stories of Don Juan with such conviction . . . I am accustomed to the theater, to actors,\nand he did not seem to be a liar. Maybe he\u2019s both crazy and a genius?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fg34wq/was_don_juan_matus_an_actual_person/fk2f2ij/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1583799625.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_fg34wq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fk4vy2h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1583868648.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fk46elg", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Connection to intent through your energy body is giving the direct knowledge, i know practitioners of Tensegrity, who just know that Don Juan was real because they sense him when dreaming, practicing seeing energy and other worlds, not only Don Juan but most of the warriors from his cohorta.

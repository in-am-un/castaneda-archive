And yet, still they don\u2019t know for sure what the \u201csecond attention\u201d is, and the assemblage point seems like a complicated thing.\n\nIn most cases that\u2019s easy to explain: They\u2019re too lazy to seriously try anything.

And maybe here\u2019s the explanation for why Carlos told us to be celibate:  If you have 2 people in your home, your chances of not practicing are doubled.  I\u2019ll even go a little nerdy on you and claim, the rate of practice is inversely proportional to the square of how many people live with you.  I guess that means if you have 2, you\u2019ll be 1/4th as likely to practice. If grandma is in the house too, forget it.  End of story.\n\nUnless you have a South American Witch Grandma. There are some of those around.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why people bother to write to me when they clearly aren\u2019t actually interested in Sorcery. Maybe it\u2019s like hearing a good bedtime story just before you nod off; a spooky one about Fairies and other worlds.\n\nAn alernate explanation, which I loathe discovering , is that they're after a joint book deal, or want me to endorse or write for their web page.\n\nForget it.  Rule #1:  I can't make any money from this, nor generate revenue for anyone else.  Rule #2: I won't exploit women.  My only interest is to encourage people to practice, in order to make up for the scandals that seem to threaten passing this knowledge on.  My only goal is to perpetuate something precious, which seems to have been lost from this world age.\n\nFor that reason, I\u2019m going to fill you in on the most powerful technique you can try at this point of your development, and it doesn\u2019t need that much time.  I\u2019ve mentioned it before, but I\u2019ll add some details so that you can visualize it as you do it.  The pitfall of this technique is its very strength. When doing it, you nod off.  And its likely you won\u2019t remember a thing.  That\u2019s both the problem, and the strength of it.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s done a thorough recapitulation will be familiar with this technique, but it might not be obvious to them how powerful it is.\n\nI\u2019ve known about it for 25 years, but recently the Ally retaught it to me, very cleverly.   And she did it at the same time one of my students had written to me, asking about it.  The very same night, she began to emphasize it.\n\nI was too dense to get it the first time, so it took a few nights.  But she didn\u2019t seem to mind how long it took, and kept it up.\n\nThe technique is well known to babies.  You can see them staring into the abyss of their bowl of green colored \"Gerber Creamed Spinach\". The fact is, even babies will shift their assemblage point when staring into a uniform color of light. Their eyes start to blink, their upper body wobbles almost imperceptibly, and then their head falls forward so fast that it jars them, and they snap back to awake with eyes wide open.\n\nWhen they realize they're awake they resume staring into the green colors, and the same thing happens. They\u2019ll repeat this over and over until someone rescues them, or their nose gets planted in the spinach.\n\nI was fortunate that the Ally didn\u2019t use spinach to re-teach this to me.  Instead, she used purple goo.\n\nI\u2019d run into trouble forming extremely bright balls of purple light. Without that brightness, a swirl won\u2019t form in the ball.  The swirl assembles the second attention.  Without that, no Fairy.\n\nI\u2019d gotten to the point of desperation after running out of practice (sleep) time one night.  So I sat up on the bed just gazing at the pathetic purple colors everywhere, with none strong enough to use.  I tried to force silence even more, thinking that was the problem.\n\nI felt a swishing black object zip past me, something struck me on the shoulder, and my head jarred forward, exactly as if I\u2019d been slapped on the back.   I was instantly unconscious, but came out of it just as quickly, to feel a familiar tingle in my body.\n\nIt\u2019s the same tingle you get if you aren\u2019t used to swimming in a cold ocean, and a big wave hits you and knocks the wind out of you.  It\u2019s also the same tingle you used to get as a child when your mom stroked her hand on your back, when you weren\u2019t expecting it.  It\u2019s the same tingle you got, when E.T. phoned home. It's the same tingle you got when that stripper licked your ear.\n\nWell, maybe not that tingle.  But we all know the one I'm talking about.\n\nThe tingle isn\u2019t all or nothing. There are various degrees of the tingle.  The most important one is the tingle you get after nodding off and waking up suddenly.  It\u2019s like a string leading from waking to sleeping.  Closer to waking, and the tingle is barely there.  Closer to sleeping, and the tingle can be overpowering.\n\nThis all assumes you can remain aware to notice it, but that\u2019s also like a string.  Closer to waking and you are more aware, closer to sleeping and you\u2019re out to lunch.  You nodded off.\n\nAfter striking me on the back to move my assemblage point a few times (over a couple of days), the ally tried it on my leg, but still didn\u2019t convey to me what she wanted me to remember.\n\nFinally, she just used her head to lure me, appearing as a barely perceptible face on a blob of purple right in front of me, and then disappearing into it, to give the feeling I needed to go deeper.\n\nI interpreted that as needing more silence, so I did my utmost to get rid of the last traces of internal dialogue. Those traces aren\u2019t even words, they\u2019re images.  As one western Zen master said, we\u2019re just awareness, that\u2019s all.   And our awareness has been trained to focus on the search for happiness and cookies.  That\u2019s the trace you need to remove.\n\nBut as I tried to remove that last trace, which would essentially have stopped the world and made finding the ally irrelevant, I nodded off instead.\n\nEach time I nodded off and realized it, and woke back up, a picture was painted in my memory, of the path of tingle from waking to sleep.  I realized; the ally was waiting at 25% tingle.  Just 1/4th of the way down to sleep, was where the Ally had positioned herself.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to catch the start of a nod off. It\u2019s much easier to learn to wake up, very carefully. The nod off represents a shift in the assemblage point, and it doesn\u2019t return to its original position quickly.  It takes at least a few seconds.  If you don\u2019t panic, you can slowly move back up from unconscious to 25% tingle depth, and hold it.  And yes, your head slowly moves up too, perhaps becoming an accurate measure of where the 25% point is. Slightly forward but not down.\n\nNot clear?  If you\u2019ve practiced dreaming techniques, you\u2019ve seen this.  You find your hands in dreaming, and then desperately try to hang on to more dreaming time.  But you fail after a minute,  and wake up.  You find yourself laying on your side with your eyes closed, and eventually you figure out, the dreaming isn\u2019t actually fully over. If you just remain still and feel for it, you can sometimes go right back to the same dream.\n\nThat\u2019s how it is with nodding off.  You can learn to slide along that string to any point you want, within your ability to remain conscious as you sleep.\n\nLast night the Ally showed me a doozy of a nod off. I\u2019d nodded off several times, each time trying to fine tune the 25% sleeping effect, which put me right on the border of stopping the world.\n\nOne time I got it wrong, and a little city with houses and tall buildings began to form in the purple mist in front of me.   It was remarkably similiar to the painting Carlos had someone make, of \"reading off the wall\".  I know now, he was pointing out a place where we could learn faster.  Right there, as the city forms.\n\nSeeing that city I knew I was too close to stopping the world, so I backed off by another 5%. I could actually feel the increments of nodding off at that point.\n\nAt just the right level, my Ally, which had been appearing as a small Fairy for me for weeks, appeared full size.  And amazingly beautiful! It was clearly a reward for finding her.  She had all dolled up 90s hair, and a prom dress.\n\nShe stepped out of the purple cloud and onto the floor, standing at the foot of my bed smiling.\n\nI had a Spielberg moment.  Now I know why don Juan said that the old sorcerers \u201cloved their allies.\u201d\n\nThey're both easy to love, and easy to be deadly frightened of. It reminds me of a girl I knew in high school.\n\nWhat\u2019s this to do with you?  Here\u2019s the instructions.   Gaze at some plants.  Lighting doesn\u2019t matter much, see what works for you.\n\nTurn the plants into a not-doing, something almost unrecognizable, by forcing yourself silent and not trying to make sense of what you see. Squint if needed.\n\nKeep it up until complete boredom, then do it an hour more. Force silence the whole time, as best you can. It doesn't have to be perfect, to produce absolute boredom.  Somewhere between complete boredom and going way overboard on the time, you\u2019ll nod off.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely stay nodded off too long at first. Then fairly soon you\u2019ll come out of it when your head jerks down, but you\u2019ll feel like you blew it and ruined the whole thing.\n\nYou didn\u2019t.  Keep it up until you can feel that string of tinglyness, then start to divide it into increments, coming back up slowly to find the sweet spot.  Eventually you\u2019ll catch a nod off at the 5% tingle level, just as your head leans forward ever so slightly, but hasn\u2019t crashed against your chest yet.\n\nThat\u2019s what you\u2019re after.  Do it over and over again.  The assemblage point will no longer be a vague concept.\n\nNow some bad news: You may feel something other than the tingle.  Some feel like their thoughts have moved downwards.  Some feel like they were stuck on fly paper, and it deforms to suck them down into a vortex.\n\nBut I\u2019d be willing to predict most of you tingle when you nod off.\n\nWhich you are doesn\u2019t matter.  This technique is easy to set up, and the chances are you\u2019ll start nodding off fairly quickly, if you get serious about forcing yourself silent.\n\nBonus technique: If you have a fast dream when you nod off and can remember it, you might in fact be a dreamer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited twice to add rule #1 and #2", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Nodding Off", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c2kgyo", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1560984654.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1560967764.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have been writing to me for longer than 20 years.

Consume it with garlic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other simple recipe is oats (grinded to dust) with yogurt (unsweetened- look if you can find this one&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus\"&gt;Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus&lt;/a&gt;) .&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add banana for a great taste ( or anything sweet you want) and voala.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c2kgyo/nodding_off/erm9di5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1561011274.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_c2kgyo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}]

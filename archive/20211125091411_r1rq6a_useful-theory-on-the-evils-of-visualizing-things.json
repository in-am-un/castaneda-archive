But it's a threat to sanity if it leaks out too strongly.\n\nSo the green zone is a buffer.  The green zone feels \"safe\".  It's blissful, and if you have a vision it doesn't \"feel real\".\n\nFeeling real starts at the red zone.\n\nSo in the blue zone we can intuit the red zone, through the green zone.\n\nLet me be more precise to avoid confusion.\n\nIf you could remote view on the floor (not hard to do), two such people could cause a third to see the same scene, if their assemblage point had been moved with shamanic drumming.\n\nSo the person would get a peaceful view of actual magic.\n\nBut if you could do that to someone in the orange zone, they'd panic.\n\nThe orange zone is even better for remote viewing, but it often \"feels real\" because the double becomes interested and the laws of physics go out the window.\n\nMeaning, if you fall into HA as a result of stalking, you might decide you'd gone insane and go find a doctor. For one thing, puffs would be visible in daylight, and that might concern you a bit!  And the seeing through walls once in a while, is another potential panic trigger.  Doesn't matter if what you see is accurate. Just seeing through walls is scary enough, regardless of real copy of reality, or phantom.\n\nBut you could get the same experiences in the green zone and not panic, just because of how close the green is, to the blue.   And it comes with a tranquilizer: bliss.\n\nIt's more like \"visiting\" the orange zone, knowing you can take a step back and leave it.\n\nBut can this be done in the blue zone also?  Can the blue zone, \"look ahead\" and pick up real magic?\n\nA very good recapitulation restores our childhood daydreaming abilities.\n\nIt's striking!  If you do recap very well, you'll see it too.\n\nAnd daydreaming, is sort of like the blue zone anticipating the green zone.\n\nAgain in the green zone you actually see your visions.  You might yourself be thinking about when you did that, and how short the visions were, and so vague.   Like remembering you just had a dream, but it's unclear what or why.  So you doubt how good those green zone visions can get.\n\nThat's just instability.  If you do that daily you'll be hovering over LA in the sky, remote viewing down, for hours at a time.\n\nI used to achieve minutes at a time.\n\nAnd I know now that was just really good use of the green zone.\n\nMeditation people do that too, and then try to equate that to what we do in the orange.\n\nIt's just a \"sneak peek\" at magic, not the real thing.\n\nBut what can be done there becomes public knowledge, and then some systems teach people to pretend those green zone things, while still stuck in the blue zone.\n\nYou end up with people pretending their magic.\n\nSome who are talented, will pretend it so well they dip down just a tiny bit into the green zone.\n\nThey very nearly, really do, see their visions.\n\nTheir assemblage points shift horizontally in the blue zone, and create a \"dip\" down to the green zone, but not all the way.\n\nThey get stuck if they keep doing this, and become pretend sorcerers.  But who actually do feel their visions, and have every reason to believe they are doing the real thing. They become \"entitled\", and believe they have nothing more to learn.\n\nHoward Lee is an example of this. He believes  he can \"see\", but it's not visual.\n\nWhile it's true that seeing doesn't have to be visual, a true seer would phase in and out of it being visual. It's so all encompassing when you are silent, that there's no way  you could not be familiar with both.\n\nWhen it's visible, and when it's more using your whole body.\n\nSo when someone says their \"seeing\" isn't visual, it really just means their \"seeing\" is pretend.  And they're trying to cash in on the common knowledge that seeing doesn't have to be visual.  Yes, doesn't have to.  But if you can do the real thing it will be, very often.  When it never is, that's pretending.\n\nSomeone pretending wouldn't be familiar with the visual type of seeing.\n\nDaoists in general for example.  They are taught to pretend their magic, fiercely.  Go look on YouTube if you are deceived by them.  You'll see the unsensitized truth of Daoism, and it won't be pretty.\n\nHow to test this theory of the existence of pretend magic, which is actually not just lying?  Where the person truly believes they learned, when the results are so pathetic they wouldn't impress any honest person?\n\nI already did, trying to teach anyone at all, for the last 23 years, and failing before I found this subreddit.\n\nYou have a student who believes themselves talented in other magic forms, you try and try to guide them to move their assemblage point and understand what the second attention is, and eventually, after years, you succeed.\n\nAnd what do they have to say about them believing they were doing the real thing before they started communicating with you, versus now?\n\nThey say,\n\n\"Oh, you mean, I'm REALLY supposed to see the vision.  I didn't understand.\"\n\nBut actually, they'd been claiming all along they actually saw it.  Getting angry even.\n\nThey got trapped in the blue zone by playing around too much with the horizontal shifts there!\n\nSame as the red zone trap.\n\nYou get too many emanations tied up in a pocket there, and it keeps pulling you back to that point because it pulls on the \"reskimming\" process, if you get anywhere near that assemblage point position.\n\nIf we get more knowledgeable, we'll have to create \"assemblage point psychologists\", who psycho analyze where and how you got yourself stuck in the blue or red zones.\n\nMight be possible to get stuck in the green.  We used to call those, \"space cadets\" and \"bliss cookies\" in meditation groups, and it was in fact one of the warnings the system had, about how you need to ignore cool stuff, or you can get trapped!\n\nBecome a \"bliss cookie\".\n\nI think they also used \"honey pot addict\".\n\nWhich implies its a dip or dent in consciousness, into which you fall.\n\nMaybe, the meditation police did in fact become aware of how people can get stuck.\n\nBut since the meditation police had no actually interesting destination in mind, all they do is keep people from getting any taste of magic at all, so they never get their butts out of that system to go find something real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Useful Theory On the Evils of Visualizing Things", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"93xyob1gnu181": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/93xyob1gnu181.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8e5cddad8288469e6f154ab426f589efea7de0c"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/93xyob1gnu181.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=360ae664d9d08f244d7b5ca96980bd34209e6653"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/93xyob1gnu181.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6c007d39896098d7434879ba6a4577fa5ceea13"}], "s": {"y": 300, "x": 400, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/93xyob1gnu181.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ab35114dcb99f5a6b3d3c74dad723abd2721d5"}, "id": "93xyob1gnu181"}}, "name": "t3_r1rq6a", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mAMabzBZVPvCBkM5pBA_rh72YkFy3TzFwZ7wX_2XBB4.jpg", "edited": 1637893058.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1637828051.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/93xyob1gnu181.jpg?width=400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51ab35114dcb99f5a6b3d3c74dad723abd2721d5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/93xyob1gnu181.jpg?width=400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51ab35114dcb99f5a6b3d3c74dad723abd2721d5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a theory which might be beneficial if we all keep it in mind, and seek to understand if it&amp;#39;s true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans need the red zone once in a while.

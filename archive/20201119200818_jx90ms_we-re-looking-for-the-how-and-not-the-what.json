He had\nunderstated it; this woman was ready for an institution. I looked at don Juan for support and\nadvice. He looked away. He seemed to be equally at a loss, although I thought I caught a\nmalicious smile, which he quickly hid by turning his head.\nThe woman lay down on her back and pulled up her skirt, and commanded me to look to my\nheart's content instead of sneaking glances. My face must have been red, judging by the heat in\nmy head and neck. I was so annoyed that I almost lost control. I felt like bashing her head in.\nThe woman who was sitting in the chair suddenly stood up and grabbed the other one by the\nhair and made her stand up in one single motion, seemingly with no effort at all.

But so did everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point you struggle endlessly to learn to let go of it.  When you find out it takes 3 hours a day of trying to do it, you complain about how hard it is to learn to let go of that golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one day it drops to the floor, and you feel as if you have finally discovered real magic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you get used to it, and realize, you didn&amp;#39;t accomplish anything particularly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that, now you know HOW to let go of things.  And there&amp;#39;s a bunch more you could also do without.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan advised Carlos in one of Carlos&amp;#39; final 3 books, which were designed to be last minute instructions, he, don Juan, was like an empty tube leading to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; to be an empty tube leading to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; become one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could add an amusing anecdote to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A former private classmate of mine read about the empty tube to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he set up a web page, to teach people how to be empty tubes to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For cash of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the work Carlos put into him, and he didn&amp;#39;t understand even a tiny bit of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All he saw was an opportunity to trick people out of their money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jx90ms/were_looking_for_the_how_and_not_the_what/gcv97z3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1605818985.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_jx90ms", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gdrc1vo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1606479434.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_jx90ms", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "We hold onto the world with our thoughts of all the things we have to do or want to do.

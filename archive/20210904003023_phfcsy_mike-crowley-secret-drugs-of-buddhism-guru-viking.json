Of course to place it on the bedspread so you can watch it like a monitor, is orange zone stuff.\n\nAnd I have no idea what it looks like at the red zone.  Possibly stuff floating in puffs, and even the crystalline fog?\n\nBut at the green zone, it turns out to simply be very vivid daydreaming.\n\nWhich makes sense.  Those famous CIA experiment remote viewers, with the old guy who goes around telling that story for money, didn't really do any serious remote viewing as it's commonly known.\n\nThe traditional method is to sit in a chair with eyes closed, and summon dream images of the location.\n\nThey were playing with writing on paper, and doing what mostly seemed to be more like daydreaming.\n\nI have a reason for this comment, I'll get to it. It relates to what Juan was saying.\n\nNow generally, we try to avoid daydreaming.  It's thoughts!  Internal dialogue mostly.\n\nHowever, at the green level, it's possible to use it for remote viewing.  In fact, my \"Take a Rest in Heaven\" post is simply green zone remote viewing of  heaven.  If you can follow that...\n\nTo do green zone remote viewing, you just heed the words of Florinda when she said at the very least, stop focusing beam of awareness between your toes, on the \"me\" spot.\n\nNow it turns out, to do that all you have to do is stop thinking \"ME\", thoughts.\n\nIf you've been forcing silence, you'll be able to clearly see the \"me\" content of each thought.\n\nA beginner, not so much.  They couldn't tell a ME from a hamburger most of the time.\n\nBut when you are at the green level, which means you can shut off your internal dialogue, you can start to use daydreaming to remote view by eliminating the \"ME\" thoughts, and seeking out thoughts free of \"me\".\n\nYou'll end up visually navigating your thoughts as daydream images, which get stronger and stronger but never quite reach the orange zone realism, which is so absolute you can get sucked down into the bedspread (where you placed an image).\n\nSo here's an example:\n\nYou bullying someone to be the top sorcery dog of all of Facebook:  ME.\n\nYou angry because someone dissed your pretend shamanism, in the shamanism subreddit:  ME\n\nYou at the beach.  ME.\n\nThe beach itself, with no sight of you:  Not ME.\n\nA beautiful stream with flowing water and ferns: not ME.\n\nYou with your lover at the beautiful stream: ME.\n\nA weird geometric pattern that barely becomes visible in your thoughts: not ME.\n\nA sense of wind flowing onto your face: not ME.\n\nIt's actually pretty easy to identify the ME thoughts.\n\nThis is NOT a downward shift.  Eliminating the ME thoughts, in order to green zone remote view.\n\nWon't necessarily produce one, even if you can eliminate all but the ok thoughts, with none of the ME.\n\nIt just means that, at your given level on the J curve, you are looking at stuff outside the ME range, which is in the middle.\n\nYou have shifted your awareness. Where it is looking.  You have not shifted down in depth on  the J curve, nor even shifted horizontally.\n\nBUT, there's the key part. If you have already done darkroom, and made it to the red zone, your assemblage point knows how to go over there.\n\nIf you eliminate the ME thoughts, but go ahead and let the others remain (only as fantasies, the assumption being that the internal dialogue is mostly gone because you made it to the green level),  you will be focusing  your awareness on things you normally ignore, in your lust for more ME power.\n\nYour daydreams will reflect what you are allowing to remain, and since it's not \"ME\", it has a little more energy.  You'll \"travel\" though your non-ME thoughts.  Literally!\n\nThe energy of new emanations contained in your accessible range will cause the assemblage point to slide horizontally, in the direction you were focusing  your awareness.\n\nAnd when it slides too far sideways, you blank out an instant.  That \"perceptual lull\" don Juan spoke about, at the special cave that could move you to see the emanations.\n\nWhen you come to (return from the fast blankout), you sort of rotate a bit, and drop down.\n\nYou come back facing a new direction and the shock makes you drop?\n\nBeats me, but you drop from it.  \n\nYou can in fact travel downward on the J curve, only by eliminating the ME thoughts and allowing the rest to remain as fantasies.\n\nIf you choose to try that, don't do the tensegrity. The Tensegrity is redundant.\n\nJust try it a while by allowing fantasies to remain, if they have no ME content.\n\nNOT AS WORDS!  Only as fantasies.\n\nI suppose if you have done a complete recap you could let some words remain, but there's no need.   If you allow the non-ME fantasies to linger in your mind, it satisfies the urge to have an internal dialogue.\n\nSo it's easier for moving the assemblage point ,than the brute force method where blood drips from your nose because you force so hard.\n\nI believe this explains what Carlos had in mind with Tensegrity and Recap.\n\nKeep in mind, he died before he expected to.  And doing only tensegrity and recap, and not emphasizing forced silence (unless someone wanted to on their own), was only the initial stages he had planned. He would have gotten to \"the good stuff\" soon, as evidenced by the J curve he gave us as an emergency measure, because he was dying.\n\nSpeaking of which, he only moved his fingers horizontally no more than 2 inches each direction while explaining the J curve, but it turns out man's band is at least 1 foot wide, and maybe it's even 2 feet wide (can't recall, read it somewhere in his books while looking for something else.\n\nHis plan was that Recap would help you understand the horrors of ME thoughts, and behavior.  So you knew that was bad stuff.\n\nAnd, people are really stupid about the internal dialogue. We often get new people who are so confused, they think the internal dialogue is only the \"bad stuff\".\n\nBut with some recap, they'll have added ME to the list of the worst, so that's ok.\n\nAnd the tensegrity would then give them a chance to focus their awareness away from the yellow puddle at the bottom where me is messing up the floor, and out further to the sides, where it's nice and dry.\n\nSomeone complained that picture looked like the guy was pissing on the floor, but actually it's a  useful analogy.  Don't step in that stuff!  Stand where it's safe.\n\nOutside the puddle of \"ME\" urine.\n\nBeginners should forget all about this,  until they can get to the red zone.\n\n\"ME avoidance\" is an unproven darkroom technique.  Best only for advanced people to experiment with it.\n\nAnd if a beginner reads that statement, and thinks to themselves, \"Hot damn!  I'll do that instead, get an advantage, and post about it, and gain lots of attention when I make it work...\"\n\nThat's ME talking.\n\nCut it out.  Fact is, that plan of Carlos failed big time.\n\nHe just didn't get a chance to fix it or he would have realized \"gentle\" me removal, such as hoping the tensegrity will cause you to look away from ME while you were doing it, couldn't stand up to being around other people, pretending to be gaining super powers.", "edited": 1630770197.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hbktwai", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was remote viewing in the green zone last night, by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that you can remote view at all levels.

Internal dialogue mostly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, at the green level, it&amp;#39;s possible to use it for remote viewing.  In fact, my &amp;quot;Take a Rest in Heaven&amp;quot; post is simply green zone remote viewing of  heaven.  If you can follow that...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do green zone remote viewing, you just heed the words of Florinda when she said at the very least, stop focusing beam of awareness between your toes, on the &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it turns out, to do that all you have to do is stop thinking &amp;quot;ME&amp;quot;, thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve been forcing silence, you&amp;#39;ll be able to clearly see the &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; content of each thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A beginner, not so much.  They couldn&amp;#39;t tell a ME from a hamburger most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you are at the green level, which means you can shut off your internal dialogue, you can start to use daydreaming to remote view by eliminating the &amp;quot;ME&amp;quot; thoughts, and seeking out thoughts free of &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll end up visually navigating your thoughts as daydream images, which get stronger and stronger but never quite reach the orange zone realism, which is so absolute you can get sucked down into the bedspread (where you placed an image).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You bullying someone to be the top sorcery dog of all of Facebook:  ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You angry because someone dissed your pretend shamanism, in the shamanism subreddit:  ME&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You at the beach.  ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The beach itself, with no sight of you:  Not ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A beautiful stream with flowing water and ferns: not ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You with your lover at the beautiful stream: ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A weird geometric pattern that barely becomes visible in your thoughts: not ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sense of wind flowing onto your face: not ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually pretty easy to identify the ME thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is NOT a downward shift.  Eliminating the ME thoughts, in order to green zone remote view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Won&amp;#39;t necessarily produce one, even if you can eliminate all but the ok thoughts, with none of the ME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just means that, at your given level on the J curve, you are looking at stuff outside the ME range, which is in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have shifted your awareness. Where it is looking.  You have not shifted down in depth on  the J curve, nor even shifted horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, there&amp;#39;s the key part. If you have already done darkroom, and made it to the red zone, your assemblage point knows how to go over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you eliminate the ME thoughts, but go ahead and let the others remain (only as fantasies, the assumption being that the internal dialogue is mostly gone because you made it to the green level),  you will be focusing  your awareness on things you normally ignore, in your lust for more ME power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your daydreams will reflect what you are allowing to remain, and since it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;ME&amp;quot;, it has a little more energy.  You&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;travel&amp;quot; though your non-ME thoughts.  Literally!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energy of new emanations contained in your accessible range will cause the assemblage point to slide horizontally, in the direction you were focusing  your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when it slides too far sideways, you blank out an instant.  That &amp;quot;perceptual lull&amp;quot; don Juan spoke about, at the special cave that could move you to see the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you come to (return from the fast blankout), you sort of rotate a bit, and drop down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You come back facing a new direction and the shock makes you drop?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me, but you drop from it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can in fact travel downward on the J curve, only by eliminating the ME thoughts and allowing the rest to remain as fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you choose to try that, don&amp;#39;t do the tensegrity. The Tensegrity is redundant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just try it a while by allowing fantasies to remain, if they have no ME content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOT AS WORDS!  Only as fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose if you have done a complete recap you could let some words remain, but there&amp;#39;s no need.   If you allow the non-ME fantasies to linger in your mind, it satisfies the urge to have an internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s easier for moving the assemblage point ,than the brute force method where blood drips from your nose because you force so hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this explains what Carlos had in mind with Tensegrity and Recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, he died before he expected to.  And doing only tensegrity and recap, and not emphasizing forced silence (unless someone wanted to on their own), was only the initial stages he had planned. He would have gotten to &amp;quot;the good stuff&amp;quot; soon, as evidenced by the J curve he gave us as an emergency measure, because he was dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, he only moved his fingers horizontally no more than 2 inches each direction while explaining the J curve, but it turns out man&amp;#39;s band is at least 1 foot wide, and maybe it&amp;#39;s even 2 feet wide (can&amp;#39;t recall, read it somewhere in his books while looking for something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His plan was that Recap would help you understand the horrors of ME thoughts, and behavior.  So you knew that was bad stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, people are really stupid about the internal dialogue. We often get new people who are so confused, they think the internal dialogue is only the &amp;quot;bad stuff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with some recap, they&amp;#39;ll have added ME to the list of the worst, so that&amp;#39;s ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the tensegrity would then give them a chance to focus their awareness away from the yellow puddle at the bottom where me is messing up the floor, and out further to the sides, where it&amp;#39;s nice and dry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone complained that picture looked like the guy was pissing on the floor, but actually it&amp;#39;s a  useful analogy.  Don&amp;#39;t step in that stuff!  Stand where it&amp;#39;s safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside the puddle of &amp;quot;ME&amp;quot; urine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beginners should forget all about this,  until they can get to the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ME avoidance&amp;quot; is an unproven darkroom technique.  Best only for advanced people to experiment with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if a beginner reads that statement, and thinks to themselves, &amp;quot;Hot damn!  I&amp;#39;ll do that instead, get an advantage, and post about it, and gain lots of attention when I make it work...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s ME talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cut it out.  Fact is, that plan of Carlos failed big time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to fix it or he would have realized &amp;quot;gentle&amp;quot; me removal, such as hoping the tensegrity will cause you to look away from ME while you were doing it, couldn&amp;#39;t stand up to being around other people, pretending to be gaining super powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_phfcsy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/phfcsy/mike_crowley_secret_drugs_of_buddhism_guru_viking/hbktwai/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1630769543.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hbi8oat", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1630711021.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_phfcsy", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Hope you don't mind, I will write some comments here, for those who are practicing silence hard:\n\nThe first part is the most difficult and exasperating, because no matter how hard we try, we always return to mental fantasies.\n\nAnd if we try too hard, it's even worse.\n\nWe have to be very careful in practice, so we never lose the purpose.\n\nYou have to immerse in that silence that is so uncomfortable at first, and hold it as long as you can!\n\nDon't ask yourself \"am I forcing silence well??\", just do it again and again, forgetting everything else.\n\n30 seconds in that awkward silence could shift your assemblage point into the green zone.\n\nAs we go down the J curve, we gain perspective.\n\nPerspective gives us strength.\n\nSuddenly you realize that you are fantasizing, and you can perfectly identify each fantasy.

It only seems shocking because westerners are naive about Asia.\n\nWhich reminds me of someone telling me those Buddhists who set themselves on fire in protest are not super cool meditation powers monks.  They're drugged up so high, they can survive the pain until they die.  It's just opium, being used to make them seem advanced, as if that gives them credibility in their protest.\n\nDespicable if you ask me.  It's like the worst bad players who come in here, using drugs and don't tell anyone about that little detail of their \"magical\" experiences.\n\nMeanwhile, my brother is interested in Zen, and so he has a few friends he's noticed who were interested in yoga meditation forms.  One told him he went to India to study the famous guru caves in one region, and found out that drug addict yogis are mostly what lives there.

One told him he went to India to study the famous guru caves in one region, and found out that drug addict yogis are mostly what lives there.

Which is a tough position to sleep in when you\u2019re feeling restless. But it was what the pilots needed. Sitting back in the chairs, they put their feet flat, and let their hands go limp against their laps. \n\n-1.  Relax your whole face. Think of it as the epicenter of your emotions. Close your eyes and breathe slowly and deeply. Then relax all 43 of your face muscles \u2014 no squinting or frowning. Your forehead should be smooth. Let everything go loose. Breathe out as you feel your cheeks, mouth, tongue, and jaw relax.\n\nYour eyes are shut, but you want to make sure they are totally limp. Do this by letting them fall deep into your socket. There are six muscles that control your socket; feel them relax and go lifeless.\n\nWhen you relax your face and let your eye sockets go limp, you signal to the rest of your body it\u2019s time to (enter recapitulation).\n\n-2.  Now it\u2019s all about the shoulders. Let them drop as low as they can go, as if they were floating down your body. You should feel the back of your neck go lifeless. Let all the muscles there go even looser.\n\nBreathe in deeply. Then exhale slowly, blowing out all of the tension.\n\n-3.  Next are your arms. Start with your dominant side. If you\u2019re right-handed, focus on your right bicep. Feel it relax and drop down your body. If it\u2019s not relaxing, tense it first, then let it go loose.\n\nThen move to your right forearm. Focus on sending it limp. Finally, comes your hand and fingers. Let them fall like a dead weight against your leg. When you\u2019ve finished with your dominant side, work through the process with your other arm.\n\n-4.  Relax your chest as you breath out. In and out. In and out...\n\nYour upper body is now nice and limp, like it\u2019s sinking into you. \n\n-5.  Relax your legs, from your thighs to your feet. Tell your right thigh muscle to sink, like a dead weight. Then tell the same thing to your right calf muscles. Then do the same thing for your ankle and foot. Feel the muscles go limp, as your leg sinks into the ground.\n\nRepeat the process with the left leg, tell your thigh, then your calf, then your ankle and foot.\n\n-6. The last step is to clear your mind. That\u2019s it. No thinking about what went wrong that day, or what time you need to get up, or when you\u2019ll get to call your partner. Doing these things all involve movement.

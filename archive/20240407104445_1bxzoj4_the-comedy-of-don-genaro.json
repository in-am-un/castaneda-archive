Or by any other method where you are fully awake.\n\nThere, as clear as if you were outdoors on a sunny day at a carnival, is the mother of all evil clowns.  With big sharp teeth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yunbf0pyj0tc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2fb55cd20f8e770496c2cf5d92ae91f3a1de84f\n\nIf you can only manage to see the evil clown the same way you would view don Genaro joking around, you'd be in good shape!\n\nThe first time I met Cholita's Ally \"Minx\", he manifested as a zombie with one dead eye hovering over me mouth wide open,  threatening to bite me in half.\n\nCholita brought him into my dark practice room, walking right through the solid locked door.\n\nShe pinned me down on the bed where I had been sitting on pillows to gaze into the second attention fog,  by laying across my legs.  It seemed surprisingly affectionate for an angry witch, so I was pleased she was doing it.\n\nUntil a little blue cloud floated in following her, rose up to the ceiling in front of both of us, transforming into a very scary monster which seemed prepared to bite my head clean off.\n\nBut I'd had interactions with the other of Carlos' Allies for sometime, and was mostly curious about this new being.\n\nI kind of knew it had to be the second Ally Carlos left us, but I'd only seen it before hiding behind the first.\n\nThe one I renamed \"Fairy\".\n\nMinx was so disappointed that his expression relaxed into a frown, from his gleeful threatening teeth filled mouth.\n\nHe looked defeated.\n\nSo he transformed into a magical object.  An object which can't possibly exist in our idea of \"space\".\n\nMinx figured out that being an engineer, I'd be just as excited about that as he had expected me to be about a 1 eyed zombie coming to murder me.\n\nCholita possibly left at that point, because she was no longer pinning me down.  I walked over to Minx and checked under him to see if there was a brightness control.  He was glowing so brilliantly that it was almost like staring into a small light bulb in the oven.  Except the bright light didn't hurt my eyes.\n\nThe result of that interaction between two practitioners of the sorcery of don Juan, and an Ally teaming with dark energy, split our home in two.  It created a phantom copy.\n\nInto which I stumbled the next night, just by opening the hallway door and walking off into the living room.\n\nThere was Minx in his classic book story form. A big lizard with scratchy claws, making an unpleasant noise scurrying slowly along on the wooden floor.\n\nBut what has that to do with don Genaro's antics?\n\nOr with the fact that Carlos, in each private class, played the role of a raunchy standup comedian.\n\nUnknown to most readers, don Juan actually had a foul mouth and spoke like a drunken sailor when it came to the use of profanity.\n\nAnd just now it was time to get up to practice, in the middle of the night. Something more difficult at my age.\n\nBut I've learned a trick.\n\nSelf-pity is what drives your energy body away.\n\nWe're perpetually in such a nasty mood that it just can't stand us.\n\nIt's even worse for our double than it is for one human to be around another human who's in a nasty mood all the time.\n\nHuman to human, at least we don't transmit the full unpleasantness of our nasty mood to those are are forced to be around us.\n\nBut in the case of the energy body, if a puff of purple glowing light gets too close to the torso of our tonal flesh body, it absorbs all of the current history of our tonal existence.\n\nJust as when the tonal awareness, seemingly our physical self, wakes up inside a dream.\n\nYou suddenly KNOW the history of that place\n\nAs crazy as the dream might be, if you think about it trying to tell if it's \"real\", you usually know the entire history of it.  How you came to be there, what you do for a living there, who your friends are, where you live.\n\nDreams don't just come with a flow of images and objects, but with a flow of \"history\".\n\nWhich isn't surprising to sorcerers.\n\nOur very reality, the one we live in all the time, comes from the same place.\n\nAs does our \"history\" here.\n\nAnd in fact, we have 600 alternate places with their own history, where we could live instead of here.  Called \"cyclic beings\".\n\nThat only seems impossible because we're prisoners of this one.  Never being able to wake up, and having to permanently assume the roles cast for us in this nightmare.\n\nYou'll find that's true when you reach silent knowledge, and one dream after the other flows towards you from the darkness, forming a tiny video in the air.\n\nExcept that if your link to intent is clean, meaning you aren't trying to think of how to profit from this, then you get to freely enter into the tiny video's in the air and exist inside them a while.\n\nAnd you can perceive this long before you can reach silent knowledge, with the help of the Allies.\n\nEspecially Fairy.\n\nI'm animating a cartoon right now where Fairy visited Athina, and opened a series of doors for Athina to look into.  Minus the wings.  ChatGPT can't draw a wingless Fairy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1u4al1sn0tc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55a2d256e2e999b0c036e07c4417f9d8cbf0e1a6\n\nOpening doors to silent knowledge is something the Allies have always done.\n\nThey can \"cheat\" and connect you to your own, stage it as an entertaining show, and bring you the results of \"seeing\"  before you understand where it's coming from.\n\nThe talking lizards in the Devil's weed ritual were such a show.\n\nIt was Carlos who answered his own questions!\n\nBut it seemed to be the Ally doing that.\n\nExcept the clue is that Carlos turned out to have 2 questions in mind, and then even wanted to ask a third, and the lizards stopped talking.\n\nThey weren't the source of the flow. Carlos was.\n\nEven that Ally (surely Minx) couldn't keep  that flow going with Carlos fussing around.\n\nYou'll have the precise same problem when you come face to face with \"seeing\", and very much want to travel into the dreams floating in the air.\n\nSome of them portals to the past, and a REAL place you could go visit.\n\nBut back to the topic of this post.\n\nWhy was don Genaro such a comedian?\n\nWhy did Carlos do the same at the start of each private class?\n\nWhy do the Allies try to either scare us to death, or please us with super intense magic?\n\nThey'll even put on a continuous show for you, under the guise of \"teaching as the dreaming emissary\".\n\nWhy did Athina's Ally take her through its alien world, lined with doors to magical wonders?\n\nBecause our energy body has been driven away by our self-pity.\n\nBut our self-pity can be removed by our own efforts.\n\nWhich causes our double to return to us.\n\nAnd the instant it begins to swarm us, brushing up against those \"pouches\" which Tensegrity manipulates, our mood changes entirely to the positive.\n\nYou gain the superpowers of your double.  But while still in the flesh.\n\nNaturally it's a lot like receiving silent knowledge videos in the air.\n\nThat's not guaranteed to be a 100% reliable effect.  Most of the time our greed screws it up, because we can't manage to remain silent and not interfere with what's happening.\n\nUsually it's the greed to write a book some day and be famous (for the men), but anything which reactivates your internal dialogue, even a tiny bit, will weaken the link to your energy body and cause the magic to dim.\n\nJust as the lizards stopped talking for Carlos.\n\nOur \"mood\" greatly affects our magic due to the tenuous relationship between our energy body, and our grouchy, unhappy tonal body.\n\nWomen are forced to learn about this in more detail due to their monthly cycle.\n\nThus they have more knowledge than men about how to manipulate their environment, so as to uplift their mood.\n\nAs Cholita said last week when I came home and commented \"Man, that's really nice!\",  noticing she had purchased some expensive incense and was filling the house with that pleasing odor, \"It's the only nice thing around here!\"\n\nBut she's better lately possible due to getting some meds, and 5 minutes later she mumbled out a reluctant apology through my locked bedroom door.\n\nShe was just being honest about how the house put her into a bad mood,  and something nice for a change was a help.\n\nCholita longs to live in the wealthy part of Los Angeles. But is stuck living with me in the armpit of the next county, known as \"Beautiful Park\" but in spanish.\n\nWhere the Koreans have taken over because of the word \"Park\" in the city name.  A good strong Korean family name.\n\nThey fled los Angeles after the last riots, where a sad Korean liquor store owner was featured on the TV news over and over, explaining how he didn't understand why the neighborhood in which he'd run his business for so many years,  helping all he could, had smashed his store windows and stolen all of his inventory.\n\nActually our city is looking better since the Koreans \"gentrified\" it with Bulgogi restaurants and Korean malls.\n\nBut the thing women know, which men barely understand, is that your mood is the key to magic.\n\nBecause if you can just stop feeling sorry for yourself, your energy body will return.\n\nCarlos knew that and so he gave a stand up comedian performance before each private class, hoping that would be just enough to push us over the edge and get our energy body to swarm us while learning the new tensegrity he'd created for the next workshop.\n\nAnd don Juan and don Genaro knew that manipulating the mood of Carlos while teaching him, could either push his assemblage point, most likely using fear, or put him into a good mood through don Genaros funny antics, so that his energy body would come visit him.  If there was some embarrassment involved, all the better.\n\nThere's an incident in the books which people site to show how dangerous it is to face your own double, where Carlos almost turns around to look behind him at the wrong moment while don Juan and Genaro are showing him something.\n\nHe almost comes face to face with his own double, which clearly both don Juan and Genaro were aware of.\n\nBecause they were the ones who lured it back.\n\nPartly, using humor.\n\nWhich I saw clearly tonight when it was time to get up and practice, and I was in too much pain to easily do that at 2AM.\n\nA dream of something very funny, which I can no longer recall, passed through my awareness.\n\nAnd an intense purple ball materialized by my stomach.\n\nMy energy body returned and I \"easily\" got up to practice.\n\nThat's when I realized why sorcerers manipulate apprentices using humor.\n\nFor beginners, forget all this.  It's far too advanced to make any sense to you.\n\nBut at least notice, we kick butt!\n\nThere's no profit motivated pretending in this magical system.\n\nAt least, not in the real versions of it.\n\nUnfortunately those are buried by fakes out there.  Many, many pretend versions of our sorcery exist.\n\nJust know, if they want money that's a pretend version!", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked":

How you came to be there, what you do for a living there, who your friends are, where you live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreams don&amp;#39;t just come with a flow of images and objects, but with a flow of &amp;quot;history&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which isn&amp;#39;t surprising to sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our very reality, the one we live in all the time, comes from the same place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As does our &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, we have 600 alternate places with their own history, where we could live instead of here.  Called &amp;quot;cyclic beings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That only seems impossible because we&amp;#39;re prisoners of this one.  Never being able to wake up, and having to permanently assume the roles cast for us in this nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll find that&amp;#39;s true when you reach silent knowledge, and one dream after the other flows towards you from the darkness, forming a tiny video in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that if your link to intent is clean, meaning you aren&amp;#39;t trying to think of how to profit from this, then you get to freely enter into the tiny video&amp;#39;s in the air and exist inside them a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can perceive this long before you can reach silent knowledge, with the help of the Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m animating a cartoon right now where Fairy visited Athina, and opened a series of doors for Athina to look into.  Minus the wings.  ChatGPT can&amp;#39;t draw a wingless Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c1u4al1sn0tc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55a2d256e2e999b0c036e07c4417f9d8cbf0e1a6\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/c1u4al1sn0tc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55a2d256e2e999b0c036e07c4417f9d8cbf0e1a6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opening doors to silent knowledge is something the Allies have always done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot; and connect you to your own, stage it as an entertaining show, and bring you the results of &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;  before you understand where it&amp;#39;s coming from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The talking lizards in the Devil&amp;#39;s weed ritual were such a show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was Carlos who answered his own questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it seemed to be the Ally doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except the clue is that Carlos turned out to have 2 questions in mind, and then even wanted to ask a third, and the lizards stopped talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They weren&amp;#39;t the source of the flow. Carlos was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even that Ally (surely Minx) couldn&amp;#39;t keep  that flow going with Carlos fussing around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll have the precise same problem when you come face to face with &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, and very much want to travel into the dreams floating in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of them portals to the past, and a REAL place you could go visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to the topic of this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why was don Genaro such a comedian?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did Carlos do the same at the start of each private class?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do the Allies try to either scare us to death, or please us with super intense magic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll even put on a continuous show for you, under the guise of &amp;quot;teaching as the dreaming emissary&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did Athina&amp;#39;s Ally take her through its alien world, lined with doors to magical wonders?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because our energy body has been driven away by our self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But our self-pity can be removed by our own efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which causes our double to return to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the instant it begins to swarm us, brushing up against those &amp;quot;pouches&amp;quot; which Tensegrity manipulates, our mood changes entirely to the positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You gain the superpowers of your double.  But while still in the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally it&amp;#39;s a lot like receiving silent knowledge videos in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not guaranteed to be a 100% reliable effect.  Most of the time our greed screws it up, because we can&amp;#39;t manage to remain silent and not interfere with what&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually it&amp;#39;s the greed to write a book some day and be famous (for the men), but anything which reactivates your internal dialogue, even a tiny bit, will weaken the link to your energy body and cause the magic to dim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as the lizards stopped talking for Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;mood&amp;quot; greatly affects our magic due to the tenuous relationship between our energy body, and our grouchy, unhappy tonal body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are forced to learn about this in more detail due to their monthly cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus they have more knowledge than men about how to manipulate their environment, so as to uplift their mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Cholita said last week when I came home and commented &amp;quot;Man, that&amp;#39;s really nice!&amp;quot;,  noticing she had purchased some expensive incense and was filling the house with that pleasing odor, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the only nice thing around here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she&amp;#39;s better lately possible due to getting some meds, and 5 minutes later she mumbled out a reluctant apology through my locked bedroom door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was just being honest about how the house put her into a bad mood,  and something nice for a change was a help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita longs to live in the wealthy part of Los Angeles. But is stuck living with me in the armpit of the next county, known as &amp;quot;Beautiful Park&amp;quot; but in spanish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where the Koreans have taken over because of the word &amp;quot;Park&amp;quot; in the city name.  A good strong Korean family name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They fled los Angeles after the last riots, where a sad Korean liquor store owner was featured on the TV news over and over, explaining how he didn&amp;#39;t understand why the neighborhood in which he&amp;#39;d run his business for so many years,  helping all he could, had smashed his store windows and stolen all of his inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually our city is looking better since the Koreans &amp;quot;gentrified&amp;quot; it with Bulgogi restaurants and Korean malls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the thing women know, which men barely understand, is that your mood is the key to magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because if you can just stop feeling sorry for yourself, your energy body will return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos knew that and so he gave a stand up comedian performance before each private class, hoping that would be just enough to push us over the edge and get our energy body to swarm us while learning the new tensegrity he&amp;#39;d created for the next workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don Juan and don Genaro knew that manipulating the mood of Carlos while teaching him, could either push his assemblage point, most likely using fear, or put him into a good mood through don Genaros funny antics, so that his energy body would come visit him.  If there was some embarrassment involved, all the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an incident in the books which people site to show how dangerous it is to face your own double, where Carlos almost turns around to look behind him at the wrong moment while don Juan and Genaro are showing him something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He almost comes face to face with his own double, which clearly both don Juan and Genaro were aware of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they were the ones who lured it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Partly, using humor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I saw clearly tonight when it was time to get up and practice, and I was in too much pain to easily do that at 2AM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A dream of something very funny, which I can no longer recall, passed through my awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And an intense purple ball materialized by my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My energy body returned and I &amp;quot;easily&amp;quot; got up to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I realized why sorcerers manipulate apprentices using humor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For beginners, forget all this.  It&amp;#39;s far too advanced to make any sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at least notice, we kick butt!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no profit motivated pretending in this magical system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not in the real versions of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately those are buried by fakes out there.  Many, many pretend versions of our sorcery exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just know, if they want money that&amp;#39;s a pretend version!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

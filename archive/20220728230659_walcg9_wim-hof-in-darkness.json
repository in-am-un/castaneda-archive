I'm hoping to collect the entire \"set\".\n\nAutistic guy here...\n\nIt's a gift, and a curse...\n\nI'm at the end of the pink donut one. But then I get obsessed with making \"perfect\" imperfections.\n\nStill, it looks to me like animation is going to work out for our needs!\n\nShould \"crush\" fake magic systems if people who aren't bad players see it.\n\nEspecially the free play in \"Puff Physics Land\".\n\nThey'll turn up their nose at fake magic after that.\n\nUnfortunately, non-bad players are very rare. So we won't sway most people interested in magic, with cartoons.  Someone needs to teleport reliably to seduce the greedy types.\n\nYet, the Dali Lama might even shed a tear over our cartoons.   He knows it's possible that some day \"the jig is up\", and their Buddha man con will be obvious.\n\nHopefully he'll reach over and slap Tony Lama on the wrist a little, saying  \"You hung out with that white devil Carlos Castaneda, didn't you?!??\"\n\nBut the bad players out there might \"steal\" some from the cartoons,  and incorporate it in their non-functional stuff.\n\nI suppose that's ok.  As long as the stuff they steal is flowing from an obvious known source: the cartoons.\n\nEven your internal dialogue at the lowest levels, where you are almost silent, is directly from your own bad player tendencies.  So we're all bad players until we move past orange on the J curve.\n\nSomeone in chat got huge 3D images flattened out in some standard format.  Doesn't look rectaequilinear (or whatever that name is), but I'd be surprised if Blender didn't have the ability to use that for a \"skin\" on a mesh room.\n\nAnd then I'll literally copy Kylie.  Match her body pieces with blobs the same size, since we have her doing tensegrity from all angles, merge the blobs, smooth over, add bones, and then later go back to put her actual face on it.\n\nThen try to reduce the age, so no one complains.  Make her 18.\n\nI was in Silent Knowledge last night for a long time.\n\nI got a lecture on what to do with the \"Carlos\" cartoon character.\n\nSomething out there \"liked that idea\".\n\nCould make it look like Robert Redford, as a joke.\n\nCarlos wanted Robert to play him, in a movie about don Juan.\n\nSo Robert Redford at 35?\n\nBut it wasn't more than an hour before I had to \"switch modes\" on my \"seeing\".  I was out of energy.\n\nAnd someone showed me what \"Ancient Daoists\" liked to gaze at.  From around 5000 years ago.\n\nBack when they were mostly still a poppy wine cult I suppose.   They still grow opium poppies to this day, in temples hidden far enough into the mountains to avoid authorities.  For \"medicine\".\n\nIs the technique I learned \"true\"?\n\nIt's silent knowledge, not silent truth.

As long as the stuff they steal is flowing from an obvious known source: the cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even your internal dialogue at the lowest levels, where you are almost silent, is directly from your own bad player tendencies.

Doesn&amp;#39;t look rectaequilinear (or whatever that name is), but I&amp;#39;d be surprised if Blender didn&amp;#39;t have the ability to use that for a &amp;quot;skin&amp;quot; on a mesh room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I&amp;#39;ll literally copy Kylie.  Match her body pieces with blobs the same size, since we have her doing tensegrity from all angles, merge the blobs, smooth over, add bones, and then later go back to put her actual face on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then try to reduce the age, so no one complains.

Just can't make a decent picture.  Too time consuming.\n\nThe problem with darkroom is, it takes 2  hours to get to the \"good stuff\".\n\nUnless you make up your experiences. Then you can get there in 10 minutes!\n\nIt almost doesn't matter \"where\" on the J curve you want to have some big time fun.\n\nIt's still 2 hours.\n\nI don't mean fairies flying over head, and swirling purple flames.\n\nThose only take an hour of serious effort. That's red zone, right in the middle.\n\nIf you do nothing but force perfect silence,  and some tensegrity, you'll get there. If you forget and start fussing, or get too lazy to do tensegrity, you won't.\n\nBy the way, the tensegrity can be really lame and simple. I'm not sure what happens if you do complex long forms.  I never do those unless I'm researching one.\n\nBut if you want to stage truck accidents on the north bound freeway out of Tokyo,  using your inorganic being to be an \"actress\" in a movie,  you have to get yourself down to the red zone and then slide horizontally.   To the right.\n\nThe \"normal\" puffs and manifestations of the red zone are outside of you, waiting to be scooped up and placed on your torso. In that mode, shapeshifting is unlikely.\n\nYou're trying to build up the energy body there. And please do!  That will make the next part easier for sure.\n\nBut to shapeshift, you have to immerse yourself into the puffs and swirls.\n\nFor example,  to shrink yourself down until the floor space of your darkroom is the size of a football field  requires a switch to your dreaming body.\n\nYou won't actually feel it, but you'll be unable to find any other explanation for what happened.\n\nHow to immerse in the red zone?\n\nJust gaze at the sights as if they were \"real\", and try to \"play with the puffs and swirls\".  See if you can toss them, or stack them like a real object. Or figure out something else that makes you feel as if they are \"real\".\n\nBut don't EXPECT to be doing that. It has to be natural, only happening because you're curious about the stuff around you.\n\n\"Natural\" is the key to the red zone.\n\nLook... Treat it like picking up women.\n\nYou can't go in there as nerd guy with a beanie and a computer pad to write notes for google management.\n\nYou have to go in there hot for the women. So they can see, you aren't pretending.\n\nAnd if you're figuring out a title for that chapter of your book, forget it. That's not \"natural\".\n\nJust try picking up a woman in a bar, using the excuse that you're writing a book.\n\nWon't work.\n\nSame with the puffs.  Remember, those are alive!  Didn't you know that?\n\nIt's your double, scattered into pieces.\n\nShapeshifting \"significantly\", meaning, beyond just getting a little \"bent out of shape\" seems to require a right shift of the assemblage point at least a good 25% of the full range Carlos showed us.  He actually called out what happens using his finger to show the positions, and it agrees with what it \"feels like\" when you do it.\n\nShapeshifting started before his finger reached the furthest he wanted to make it go.   The band of man is surprisingly narrow.  Maybe just 2 inches wide.  But the changes as it shifts, are dramatic.\n\nAnd he never moved it all the way as far as you can shift right.\n\nHe just grinned, as if he wasn't \"going there\".  When it went too far to the right.\n\nRemember, when you get too close to the limit you are now being pulled by the cheese slice to the right. The next \"band\" which is not part of \"the band of man\".\n\nCarlos never said which one that was on the right side, as far as I know.  But let's pretend it's the \"dark band of emanations\". The black world.\n\nThat band starts to pull on the emanations you have lit up with your horizontal movement, lighting up ones you're rather not know about.  You've \"influenced intent skimming\" by going too far to the right.\n\nSo likely, shapeshifting can get REALLY strange.\n\nBy the way, unless you want to turn into a bug, I'd stick with right shifts.\n\nLeft bug.  Right beast.\n\nGood rule of thumb.\n\nBut if you only go 25% to the right, it's almost like nothing is out of the ordinary.\n\nIt's just that, you aren't you anymore.\n\nThat likely takes another half hour.  To shift until you're, not  you anymore.\n\nBut since you'll be \"playing\" with stuff, you won't keep track of the time.\n\nYou use silence to get down there, mixed with Tensegrity.\n\nDo you have to have an IOB?\n\nNo.  I ignored them sometimes, when shapeshifting.\n\nI become like a 5 year old who's been shown how to use a hammer by an adult, and I just ditch them and run off to go \"use\" my hammer.\n\nThey won't stop you.\n\nIf you didn't have one at all, but could still see the brilliant puffs, you're good to go.\n\nAlthough I doubt anyone can get there, without an Ally.  Fact is, we need their dark energy to move the assemblage point the way sorcerers do.  Don Juan said so, and apologized to Carlos about it. It's just how it is.\n\nSo if you hear a pretend sorcery teacher say he shuns the IOBs, he's also just said he isn't a sorcerer at all.\n\nHe's a con artist.\n\nAs to the IOBs, we just don't know when the need kicks in.\n\nOnce there, you can use your vision to shift horizontally.  Just \"look\" where you want to go.\n\nBut don't look at nothing!  We aren't pretending here.\n\nFind something in the purple second attention fog, which catches your eye.  And go find out what it is!\n\nDon't worry, even a tiny \"sparkle\" gets more \"real\" when you pay attention to it.\n\nI suspect that's how it works at all levels, even the blue zone.\n\nPerhaps \"Real\" is just a shift right or left at the current level.  So that you see \"things happen\" there.\n\nYou almost surely won't make it down to the red zone, sitting still on the bed.\n\nAnd if you have your eyes closed might as well put on a saffron robe and give it up.  You've turned into Buddha Boy.  Get ready for the Tibetan \"Big Bird\" formal event hat.  That's all you're going to get for fun around those guys.\n\nYou know any Dzogchen who can stage violent truck crashes where the female driver bursts into flames on the ground far below the elevated freeway going over the forest area above Tokyo?\n\nAnd you ask her permission before you stage it, with her eagerly agreeing to die like that?\n\nWhile you're awake, eyes open, completely sober?\n\nI never heard any Dzogchen mention that myself.    In fact, you can't even start this conversation with them. They get furious.\n\nI suspect the Buddha didn't approve, being a saint and all.\n\nTo do the fun stuff, you have to get to the red zone proper.\n\nAnd play there until you see the puffs of colors swirling amidst jet black, where the edges of the puffs are on fire with blue flames. Doesn't have to be a lot of blue flames. Some sparkles created when the purple hits the jet black, are good enough.\n\nOr whatever colors you see.  The main thing is, if you aren't thinking \"Holy Shit!!!!!  It's all TRUE!\", you're in \"weak red zone\".\n\nWeak red zone is fine!  I rarely venture outside that, because you can get yourself trapped down there by learning too much about it.  You can get to the orange, via weak red zone.  And the orange is where Carlos wanted us to go.\n\nBut in honor of Julian, it's ok to try out the red.\n\nToo much though, and it becomes \"real\".\n\nAnd you know what a bitch it's been trying to escape the realness of the blue zone.\n\nSo you don't want to create a \"real\" red zone.\n\nBut everyone should play a little down there.\n\nShapeshifting is the same direction.  You might stage a truck crash one night, then the next turn yourself into some giant beast.\n\nAnd yes, you can go outside in that mode.\n\nIt's possibly the ONLY way you're taking that assemblage point position out the door.\n\nIf you didn't shapeshift, a few steps out into the \"real world\" outside your home, would pull you back to the blue line.\n\nYou'd go outside, and  your neighbor Bill would wave to you, and ask you about your weird house guest (Cholita).  Why does she only use the side door?\n\nSince you can't answer that, best to avoid him.\n\nBut if you shapeshift, there's no one out there!  The whole world is empty of people, despite looking perfectly normal.\n\nBut maybe you're then thinking, shapeshifting and truck accidents are different things?\n\nNope.  How do you think you shrunk down to the size of an ant in your darkroom, so you'd have enough room to erect a high freeway overpass, and a Japanese forest of tall trees to go with it?\n\nThat's shapeshifting.\n\nYou don't \"learn\" how to shape shift.  If you see some guy's video of him claiming to be turning into a crow on Youtube,  you'll soon realize, you just can't learn this stuff.\n\nHe did everything right!  Followed the steps in the books precisely!\n\nEven downed some shrooms!\n\nBut it's just going to be a crazy man running around flapping his arms like wings and repeating what you find in the early books.  Nothing happens.\n\nWhen you're ready to shapeshift for real, you'll be in a cartoon world.\n\nThat's the red zone.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "More Red zone, in honor of Juann's post", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"7wobfly284f81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7wobfly284f81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92b864ecc6148a8e31f35aea20f63b8251918406"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7wobfly284f81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cdd6be51bf86fd33bd0bec71665db54384b5bcb"}, {"y": 212, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7wobfly284f81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8de67f3253e9bc3ff4e7e2425b6f36ce63f487f"}, {"y": 425, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7wobfly284f81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd6be11963d97149172a9e60a8395d428210de11"}, {"y": 638, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7wobfly284f81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd01a436ec144286142618dee11beb09a39a15ff"}], "s": {"y": 681, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7wobfly284f81.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26abfe37c9526fbd66c6e9b956dd4f81985c5494"}, "id": "7wobfly284f81"}}, "name": "t3_shgtid", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EFyz6OHUata7cxzGn_3x4FanpRs_CTAjTgfZaleTS5U.jpg", "edited": 1643729903.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643674740.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7wobfly284f81.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=26abfe37c9526fbd66c6e9b956dd4f81985c5494\"&gt;Rindo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess since nothing is up I&amp;#39;ll post something.

In this fashion, I would have unwrapped myself and would again be facing the direction in which I had begun the sorcery pass.\n\n\"This is one of the most powerful and mysterious of all the sorcery passes,\" Clara cautioned. \"With it we can open doors to different worlds, provided of course that we have stored a surplus of internal energy and are able to realize the intent of the pass.\"\n\nHer serious tone and expression made me ill at ease.\n\nI didn't know what to expect if I succeeded in opening that invisible door.\n\nIn a brusque tone, she then gave me some final instructions.\n\n\"When you step in,\" she said, \"your body has to feel rooted, heavy, full of tension.\n\n\"But once you are inside and have turned around, you should feel light and airy, as if you were floating upward.\n\n\"Exhale sharply as you first lunge forward through the opening, then inhale slowly and deeply, filling your lungs completely with the energy from behind that screen.\"\n\nI practiced the pass several times as Clara looked on, but it was as if I were only going through the outward motions.\n\nI couldn't feel the energy fibers forming the screen that Clara was talking about.\n\n\"You're not pulling the door open hard enough,\" Clara corrected me. \"Use your internal energy, not just your arm muscles. Expel the stale air and pull in your stomach as you lunge forward. Once inside, breathe as many times as you can, but be on the alert. Don't stay longer than you need to.\"\n\nI mustered up all my strength and grabbed the air. Clara stood behind me, held my forearms and gave them a tremendous pull sideways.\n\n**Instantly I felt as if some sliding doors had opened.**\n\nExhaling sharply, I lunged through it, or rather Clara had given me a shove from behind, pushing me forward.\n\nI remembered to turn around and breathe deeply, but for a moment I worried that I wouldn't know when to come out. Clara sensed this and told me when to stop breathing and when to step out.\n\n\"As you practice this sorcery pass by yourself,\" Clara said, \"you'll learn to do it perfectly, but be careful.\n\n\"All sorts of things can happen once you go through that opening.\n\n\"Remember, you have to be cautious and at the same time bold.\"\n\n\"How will I know which is which?\" I asked.\n\nClara shrugged. \"For a while, you won't. Unfortunately, prudence comes to us only after we've gotten blasted.\"\n\nShe added that cautiousness without cowardice is hinged on our ability to control our internal energy; and to divert it into the reserve channels so that it is available to us when we need it for extraordinary actions.\n\n\"With enough internal energy, anything can be accomplished,\" Clara said, \"but we need to store and refine it.\"\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\"She was about to open the front door, but she stopped short. A most frightening sound came from just outside the door. It sounded to me like a growl. It was so horrendous and ominous that it made us both jump back, away from the door. My physical alarm was so intense that I would have fled if I had had a place to go.\n\nSomething heavy was leaning against the door. It made the door creak. I looked at la Gorda. She seemed to be even more alarmed. She was still standing with her arm outstretched as if to open the door. Her mouth was open. She seemed to have been frozen in midaction.\n\nThe door was about to be sprung open any moment. There were no bangs on it, just a terrifying pressure, not only on the door but all around the house.\n\nLa Gorda stood up and told me to embrace her quickly from behind locking my hands around her waist over her belly button. She performed then a strange movement with her hands.\n\nIt was as though she were flipping a towel while holding it at the level of her eyes. She did it four times.\n\nThen she made another strange movement. She placed her hands at the middle of her chest with the palms up, one above the other without touching. Her elbows were straight out to her sides. She clasped her hands as if she had suddenly grabbed two unseen bars. She slowly turned her hands over until the palms were facing down and then she made a most beautiful, exertive movement, a movement that seemed to engage every muscle in her body. It was as though she were opening a **heavy sliding door** that offered a great resistance. Her body shivered with the exertion. Her arms moved slowly, as if opening a very, very heavy door, until they were fully extended laterally.\n\nI had the clear impression that as soon as she opened that door a wind rushed through. That wind pulled us and we actually went through the wall- or rather, the walls of the house went through us- or perhaps, all three of la Gorda, the house and myself went through the door she had opened.\n\nAll of a sudden I was out in an open field. I could see the dark shapes of the surrounding mountains and trees. I was no longer holding onto la Gorda's waist. A noise above me made me look up, and I saw her hovering perhaps ten feet above me like the black shape of a giant kite. I felt a terrible itch in my belly button and then la Gorda plummeted down to the ground at top speed, but instead of crashing she came to a soft, total halt.\n\nAt the moment that la Gorda landed, the itch in my umbilical region turned into a horribly exhausting nervous pain. It was as if her landing were pulling my insides out. I screamed in pain at the top of my voice.\n\nThen la Gorda was standing next to me, desperately out of breath. I was sitting down. We were again in the room of don Genaro's house where we had been.\n\nLa Gorda seemed unable to catch her breath. She was drenched in perspiration.\"\n\n----------------------", "edited": 1643747784.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hv6hfqr", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And from the books, all except Stalking With The Double.

This pass aids stalking and reflects our daily interactions with others.\n\nThe pass contains three segments:\n\n-1. (meeting the other and first interaction - confrontation)\n\nThe entire pass starts with the two partners standing side by side. Then they slowly turn away from each other as they fan the space in front (as described below)\n\nHorse stance, back loosely to the partner, hand perpendicular to forearm, arms bent at elbow - push lightly with palm of hand from left to right in front of the body/face (**as if pushing a sliding door or curtain**) with left hand/arm; right to left with right hand/arm. Alternate hands/arms a few times as you turn slightly clockwise with entire body. Jump lightly to face your partner (moment of encounter). Continue hand/arm movement.\n\nStrike toward partner with left fist at shoulder level, arm slightly bent at elbow. The partner blocks the blow by striking the same way, from below until the arms of the two touch in an x-like cross. Step forward while striking/attacking - partner step backward when responding/defending. Repeat with right fist, then once again left-right (a sequence of 4).\n\nDisengage by retreating scrapping the mud of energy 2,3 times(L,R), pivot 90 degrees to the right kick a lateral gate to the right (with left foot) then slump.\n\nDisengage. Kick with left foot to the right. Turn about 45 degrees to the right and relax whole body, dropping head to chest and loosening arms down by the sides of the body.\n\n-2. (second encounter/interaction - confrontation)\n\nFrom the last position of complete loosening, jump on the spot (scissors-like) left foot forward. Then jump three times (right-left-right foot), slightly moving leftward (counterclockwise) jump three times once again and repeat one more time as you face your partner (for a total of 3 sets of 3 jumps each).\n\nLift left leg, knee bent, and bring to the right by twisting hips (torso remains facing forward). Repeat three times. Then, hit to the left with both hands fisted and arms swinging at about shoulder level, kick with left foot to the right as you make a step forward. Repeat with opposite side/leg as you approach partner. Stand close to each other, bring left arms up, fisted hands, from around waist level/right side to the level of the chin/left side in a semi-circle until your arms cross. Repeat three times.\n\nGrab a rope at just about knee level. One partner pulls, making 3-4 backward sliding/jumping steps (always the same leg leading) while holding the rope. The other partner follows (pushes) by making forward steps in the same manner. Repeat in the other direction (the one who pulled now pushes and vice versa). Then both partners retrieve, by repeating the same movement backwards simultaneously, thus moving away from each other.\n\nkick up with the right leg towards your partner. then pivot 90 degrees to right as before.\n\nKick to the right with left leg. Relax by bending head forward and turning away from partner (clockwise). This time the position is more composed, not as loose as at the end of the first sequence. Take a deep breath, drawing energy from the sun, palms facing slightly up. Exhale.\n\n-3. (final encounter - cooperation)\n\nTurn slowly toward partner. Hands on knees, looking at partner, slide hands upward, inhaling; turn hands out in a circular motion in front of face and end the circle with the hands turned up at the level of the hips (horse stance, slightly more bent body) in an \"offering\" position (as though you brushed energy from your front body and are now offering it to your partner).\n\nAt the end of the 'offering' breath, as you are facing the partner (palms facing up) bring the palms about 10 cm upwards with a brisk and defined movement, as if lifting something.\n\nPlace wrists at the sides of the chest, hands facing each other and thrust hands forward as if expelling energy from the chest to the front of the energy body. Repeat the movement, but this time wrists/hands are at the level of the lower rib cage. Place wrists at hips and jump lightly forward (with a step) then thrust hands forward. You are now closer to your partner.\n\nHand facing outward, toward your partner, wrist bent, hand flat - make a circle in front of your body clockwise, as if wiping a window. The circle is small and the movement brisk. Repeat the movement with the left hand, making a larger counterclockwise circle with a slower motion. Repeat five times (here I'm not sure about the number).\n\nStep slightly back and to the right, as you rotate arms along each other in front of the chest (elbows bent) in an inward (toward the body) cycle, until your right foot and right arm are in front.

This pass aids stalking and reflects our daily interactions with others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pass contains three segments:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-1. (meeting the other and first interaction - confrontation)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire pass starts with the two partners standing side by side. Then they slowly turn away from each other as they fan the space in front (as described below)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Horse stance, back loosely to the partner, hand perpendicular to forearm, arms bent at elbow - push lightly with palm of hand from left to right in front of the body/face (&lt;strong&gt;as if pushing a sliding door or curtain&lt;/strong&gt;) with left hand/arm; right to left with right hand/arm. Alternate hands/arms a few times as you turn slightly clockwise with entire body. Jump lightly to face your partner (moment of encounter). Continue hand/arm movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strike toward partner with left fist at shoulder level, arm slightly bent at elbow. The partner blocks the blow by striking the same way, from below until the arms of the two touch in an x-like cross. Step forward while striking/attacking - partner step backward when responding/defending. Repeat with right fist, then once again left-right (a sequence of 4).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disengage by retreating scrapping the mud of energy 2,3 times(L,R), pivot 90 degrees to the right kick a lateral gate to the right (with left foot) then slump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disengage. Kick with left foot to the right. Turn about 45 degrees to the right and relax whole body, dropping head to chest and loosening arms down by the sides of the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-2. (second encounter/interaction - confrontation)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the last position of complete loosening, jump on the spot (scissors-like) left foot forward. Then jump three times (right-left-right foot), slightly moving leftward (counterclockwise) jump three times once again and repeat one more time as you face your partner (for a total of 3 sets of 3 jumps each).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lift left leg, knee bent, and bring to the right by twisting hips (torso remains facing forward). Repeat three times. Then, hit to the left with both hands fisted and arms swinging at about shoulder level, kick with left foot to the right as you make a step forward. Repeat with opposite side/leg as you approach partner. Stand close to each other, bring left arms up, fisted hands, from around waist level/right side to the level of the chin/left side in a semi-circle until your arms cross. Repeat three times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grab a rope at just about knee level. One partner pulls, making 3-4 backward sliding/jumping steps (always the same leg leading) while holding the rope. The other partner follows (pushes) by making forward steps in the same manner. Repeat in the other direction (the one who pulled now pushes and vice versa). Then both partners retrieve, by repeating the same movement backwards simultaneously, thus moving away from each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;kick up with the right leg towards your partner. then pivot 90 degrees to right as before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kick to the right with left leg. Relax by bending head forward and turning away from partner (clockwise). This time the position is more composed, not as loose as at the end of the first sequence. Take a deep breath, drawing energy from the sun, palms facing slightly up. Exhale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-3. (final encounter - cooperation)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn slowly toward partner. Hands on knees, looking at partner, slide hands upward, inhaling; turn hands out in a circular motion in front of face and end the circle with the hands turned up at the level of the hips (horse stance, slightly more bent body) in an &amp;quot;offering&amp;quot; position (as though you brushed energy from your front body and are now offering it to your partner).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the &amp;#39;offering&amp;#39; breath, as you are facing the partner (palms facing up) bring the palms about 10 cm upwards with a brisk and defined movement, as if lifting something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Place wrists at the sides of the chest, hands facing each other and thrust hands forward as if expelling energy from the chest to the front of the energy body. Repeat the movement, but this time wrists/hands are at the level of the lower rib cage. Place wrists at hips and jump lightly forward (with a step) then thrust hands forward. You are now closer to your partner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hand facing outward, toward your partner, wrist bent, hand flat - make a circle in front of your body clockwise, as if wiping a window. The circle is small and the movement brisk. Repeat the movement with the left hand, making a larger counterclockwise circle with a slower motion. Repeat five times (here I&amp;#39;m not sure about the number).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step slightly back and to the right, as you rotate arms along each other in front of the chest (elbows bent) in an inward (toward the body) cycle, until your right foot and right arm are in front. Right toes touch the ground (heel lifted), knee bent; elbow bent and forearm pointing up, hand straight up. Repeat movement (light, dance-like steps and arm movement) to the left, ending with left arm/leg forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Left foot forward, make side steps toward your partner until your backs face each other. Backs should not touch. Grab a thick rope/pole from your left, just above the shoulder, on the side of the head and pull it down to the right side of the hip. Repeat the same from right-up to left-down. Do 5 sets. Aim at synchrony with your partner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop and feel the space between your backs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step to the side to face each other (as initially) and bow in gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jona Pelovska&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20191127161751/http://insensciety.com/notes/2003_ny-03_04_27.html\"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20191127161751/http://insensciety.com/notes/2003_ny-03_04_27.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_shgtid", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/shgtid/more_red_zone_in_honor_of_juanns_post/hv6eibw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1643746058.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hv6ch9b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hv6b9tz", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "It was good I read Dan's post, because right after I was reading \"Stalking with the Double\" and I just ran across a specific passage about Allies and IOBs that has some breadcrumbs on an IOB summoning pass.\n\nbackground - Taisha gets an explanation from Carlos on what an ally is, which causes her to recall encountering one in Clara's house and asking Clara about the thing that is frightening her:\n\n    \u201cWhy is it after me?\u201d I (Taisha) asked. \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d\n    \n    In my mind, I ran the gamut of all the sins of commission and \n    omission, and there were plenty of them.\n    \n    \u201cIt\u2019s not what you didn\u2019t do,\u201d she (Clara) said shaking her head\n    pathetically. \u201cIt\u2019s what you did do.

They give no details on the effects of that pass, except: &amp;quot;it is a pass full of mystery that beckons,&amp;quot; or something. &amp;quot;The hand posture is that of energetic antennae calling to forces beyond man ...&amp;quot; something.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gazing with eyes rolling in a circular fashion in the dark room or at the sky.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Verbally reaching out to them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having done those three things and then witnessing very clear indications that something fucking definitely noticed and reached out, I got a touch fearful, and added a bunch of rules of engagement, which I believe will help me stick with it long-term, but perhaps slow down the process too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, reading of your and others ways to flip the script and have fun with them does help me laugh off the fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Having written all that, I&amp;#39;m guessing lots of folks in darkroom are up to their ears in IOBs and are working to ignore that, so they don&amp;#39;t notice ... b/c fear, but maybe it&amp;#39;s just me?  :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amazing to me, how much it helped me to even reach out at all when I read your posts where you talk extensively about &amp;quot;why afraid? this shit is baddass!&amp;quot; Your enthusiasm on them in your posts is rather infectious!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/shgtid/more_red_zone_in_honor_of_juanns_post/hv5hc0l/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hv5hc0l", "created": 1643733851.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hv5bc4d", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1643731632.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hv4ibf1", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;It is the \"Who cares about the rules??!!\" moment.\n\nThat's a better way to explain a state of mind, someone else tried to explain a different way.

It's astonishing.\n\nAND, he has \"apps\".\n\nMaybe 3.5 does also, but I love how \"smooth\" 4.0 is in its wording.\n\nOne app lets you upload a pdf, and now you have access to every single word in the pdf, searched and even \"understood\" by ChatGPT.\n\nSo I have no excuse for not having the direct quote from Taisha, or even knowing if maybe it wasn't Florinda who said it, telling someone you no longer need to leave your family.\n\nThe shame of that is, they didn't explain.\n\nLeaving it to you to figure out.\n\nA pity, but when you are way out there, navigating into other realities for real, you don't like to tie your energy up here, on unnecessary things.\n\nAny interactions here, even with friends, is more energy tied up here.  Energy you worked so hard to free up.\n\nSo all she seems to have said was that it's no longer necessary.\n\nBut that's not convincing!  She should have explained why, if she knew it.\n\nFortunately, Silent Knowledge is available and at some point things just seem \"too obvious for you to have been that stupid for so long\".\n\nHere's the deal with leaving your family.\n\nWhich I did for 17 years, until Amy walked up to Carlos, who was dying, whispered in his ear, and Carlos reluctantly nodded his head.\n\nAnd she came to me and said, 'Carlos says you can go back to your family\".\n\nSo I did.  Only to have them decide 20 years later that I needed deprogramming, and an \"intervention\".\n\nAs we all got older and their own fake religious beliefs felt threatened by my activities.\n\nThe problem with \"families\" is that everyone is barely hanging on.\n\nYou're nearly guaranteed to have at least one suicidal person, if the family is large.\n\nJust clinging to life, through the \"hope\" of Catholicism.\n\nOr as a liberal Lutheran, who is happy to bring the flowers for gay marriages and is therefore a kind person in the eyes of God, so guaranteed a shot at heaven.\n\nOr as a Buddhist, \"on the path to enlightenment\".\n\nThe folly of those family members is threatened if you defend yourself with the truth, when they start preaching.\n\nIt can result in the death of a family member, or  at the least make their miserable existences even worse.\n\nThus, leaving your family and friends is mostly for their own sake.\n\nAt least, in our cases.\n\nIf they're supportive, there's really no need.  In fact, you can see where you came from, and how far you've gone, just by interacting with them as petty tyrants.\n\nWhich everyone is.\n\nBut in the past, with the lineages,  it wasn't so. And that ought to be very obvious.\n\nYou certainly didn't see any old seers advocating that.  It was irrelevant.  In fact, chances are they didn't mind counting on some family members, when they got too busy exploring reality and badly needed a bowl of soup.\n\nSo imagine the lineages, bound to only take replacements for themselves, who were indicated by the spirit.\n\nAnd then as a team, they put decades into teaching them.\n\nLosing one would rip a hole in the new structure they were trying to create.\n\nA structure just as important to them, as it was to the apprentices who had to use it to go further.\n\nA \"family\" was an unnecessary risk to the new seers.  And they completely understood nothing good would come of it, for the apprentice.\n\nIt's not even natural.  The idea of clinging to all of your offspring, so you can lean on them in your old age.\n\nThat's a result of cities, agriculture, religion, and mostly money.\n\nIn our natural living environment, \"Granny\" was an extremely valuable member of society, sought out by the young people to learn from. She knew how to weave baskets, where the best food was located, how to cure illnesses and repair injuries, and even how to make amazing containers out of clay, and bake them to last for thousand  of years.\n\nIn which to store food and water!\n\nShe also knew all the stories of the past.\n\nGrannies did not go hungry in our natural living condition.  They were esteemed for their knowledge. That was even true of Morongo, the Indian Reservation where I spent time as a child, and to which Carlos first went looking for don Juan.\n\nThe elders were respected for their knowledge.\n\nBut now days, Grannies are pretty much just annoying and filled with delusions. So they make up rules designed to keep offspring prisoner, to prevent themselves from being alone and helpless.\n\nAnd brainwash the grandchildren.  Who are very easy to influence.\n\nWith stories like, \"the Granny who has no family to help, and has to eat cat food.\"\n\nWhat??? Cat food is expensive!\n\nBeans, rice, and tortillas are not. And very tasty too!\n\nAny Granny eating pet food, has some other problem caused by our modern living situation.\n\nIt's not from poverty.\n\nThe reason the new seers told apprentices to leave their families and friends, is because they had a HUGE investment in each, couldn't replace them if they went astray, and knew it wasn't good for the apprentices either.\n\nThat's all.\n\nDon't pretend your sorcery.  You can't give up things, deny yourself things, or even follow \"warrior way\" rules and learn sorcery.\n\nThose just pacify you, so that you believe you are on \"another path\" to sorcery. So you can fool your friends.\n\nAnd it prevents you from actually realizing the horror of your situation, so that you get to work on what counts.\n\nSilence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why Carlos Told Me to Return To My Family", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"0r2oityl2jdb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb0e841f16ab5a031dd064c6497b5b95a53d8718"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33b01ae88c5ee88005628259fc2fa79ff6309294"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a8d416fe2b9d0638c6ad5020d1447bddb85f2c4"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7edec0230071c443cc216d25c90f6aa9f9be52ce"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc3071e64e9f220db5246e4df9e186b624c4b5f"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0daf9b5aa0cd44034143432512675f36e22c8cd"}], "s": {"y": 1200, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca27eadcd2f50cce8bc741aebd356ad355918d80"}, "id": "0r2oityl2jdb1"}}, "name": "t3_156m23b", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 38, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 38, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6WyTX2u1nFdLTjczCjUVUhpqQG7WxEsUgnEqcgdUiP4.jpg", "edited": 1690037653.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1690037293.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ca27eadcd2f50cce8bc741aebd356ad355918d80\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0r2oityl2jdb1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ca27eadcd2f50cce8bc741aebd356ad355918d80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This topic comes up once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Should I leave my friends and family?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a total misunderstanding of the storyline in the books!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I hope to correct here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you pay the $20 a month for ChatGPT you get 3.5 and 4.0 versions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4.0 is already smarter than any man alive.

From \"Baby's First Hot Dog pieces\".\n\nBut that's gross.\n\nLet me use a more practical example.\n\nThere was the famous \"archetype\" of an \"offer from intent\".\n\nI wish I could remember what Carlos called those!\n\nBut he spent a few months teaching us about that topic.\n\nWhich was unusual.\n\nHe once said he had to repeat things 3 times because people don't even hear it on the first try.\n\nThere are some aggressive people who will attack if you repeat something to them.  Bad upbringing I suppose.\n\nBut Carlos was vulnerable to that same type of annoying pest, who will say \"You already told me that!\"\n\nSo he took the time to explain why he had to repeat things 3 times.\n\nAnd I counted!\n\nHe did in fact.\n\nOne new \"story\" after another would become the central \"nasty joke\" for the opening dialog of class.\n\nAnd then you'd hear an echo of it next class, and much later a reminder.\n\nHe did do what he said.  Which was no simple feat, since he lectured in at least 4 different locations and situations.\n\nIn the case of getting offers from intent, he kept that topic up for months with example after example, in the form of actual \"offers\" we could accept.\n\nFrom intent!\n\nNaturally that's just plain crazy to people.\n\nSo the worst among us (in private classes) would even ask him, \"What's in it for me?\"\n\nNot in so many words, but that was clearly their question.\n\nOr to translate, \"You keep giving us these wacky 'offers', but no one can figure out what your reasoning is on how that will help us out.\"\n\nThey expected something a linear mind would understand.\n\nThey were theorizing, if Carlos relayed us an \"offer from infinity\" then he himself must know what the rewards will be.\n\nBut he didn't!\n\nHe was just as clueless as we were, as to why that offer was being made.\n\nLet me back off so it's clearer.\n\nWhen Julian intended don Juan's double to come out, so that don Juan could switch back and forth freely, a marvelous situation for learning, he didn't really know what was going to happen when he tossed don Juan into a raging river where he would surely drown.\n\nAll he knew was, he couldn't just throw him in.\n\nHe had to \"taunt infinity\".  Summon \"intent\" according to the rules known to the new seers.\n\nSo he gave a funny speech designed to please the mischievous side of the force of intent, and tossed him in to his death.\n\nYet, it worked.  Don Juan's double came out, and don Juan didn't drown.\n\nHow did Julian know to do that?\n\nIt was an \"offer\" from infinity, to Julian.\n\nHe ***saw*** it, so he did it.\n\nThat's what Carlos was passing on to us.\n\nOffers from infinity.\n\nSuch as \"Walk to San Diego, starting right after class tonight.\"\n\nNo one took him up on it.\n\nThe next day the greediest among us asked, \"What will happen if we do?\"\n\nAnd Carlos only said, \"That was yesterday. It's too late now.\"\n\nBy the way, my stories might actually be 2 stories combined into one.\n\nI can't recall.\n\nIn this case, he said both things.\n\nBut he tried to get us to take him up on an offer more times than I can recall during that period.  So he might have said, \"That was yesterday\" on a separate occasion from \"It's too late now.\"\n\nSo what's going on here?  How is this \"non-linear\".  Why do sorcerers suck so badly when it comes to making any sense?!?\n\nThe \"offer\" is in the emanations, flowing to you. Not in the mind of the sorcerer.\n\nIt's external.\n\nIt's an offer from Silent Knowledge.\n\nCarlos gazed up above us in private class, favoring the south west direction at around 213 degrees.  I used to assume it was south east, towards mexico city. But  using the map and that compass, it clearly is not.\n\nCould be, he was just looking slightly to our left and above us.  But he was gazing out the window into a virtual sky while doing it. As if he could expect something at that precise location.\n\nHe \"knew\" the offer while looking there, from what was written. Or what he heard, or what he simply \"knew\".  I suppose he might even have \"smelled\" the offer on some occasions.\n\nAnd then, he could see the flow of intent showing him how long the offer was good for.  You get the weird offer, and then you see a flow.\n\nLike the bird in flight who can't turn back, so you have to jump in with them if you want to escape to freedom.\n\nHe likely saw that flow as I do.  \n\nFibers of light moving towards you, giving the impression of a flow of current you can catch if you don't delay. Which will carry you along all by itself if you just move \"into it\".\n\nSo for some private class man to come back the next day and ask, \"What's in it for me?\" is pretty horrible for someone who lives in a non-linear view of the world.\n\nIt's like putting out a plate of spaghetti and meatballs for a kid who takes a bite, then spits it out onto the plate in disgust.  So it's all ruined for anyone to eat it.\n\nYou'll only cook for that awful kid again, because you have no choice.\n\nYou'll all get to see that flow, if you don't give up!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6915123b969e0f04beee708c3315c5f139c96508", "edited": 1675366177.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j6yb29o", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing we all overlook is that sorcerers live in a &amp;quot;non-linear&amp;quot; existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know what that means yet, but it&amp;#39;ll sneak in there as you go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Carlos and the witches are NOT like us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might even have been painful for them to try to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like cleaning up the worst possible baby diapers.

Not in the mind of the sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s external.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an offer from Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gazed up above us in private class, favoring the south west direction at around 213 degrees.  I used to assume it was south east, towards mexico city. But  using the map and that compass, it clearly is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be, he was just looking slightly to our left and above us.  But he was gazing out the window into a virtual sky while doing it. As if he could expect something at that precise location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; the offer while looking there, from what was written. Or what he heard, or what he simply &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot;.  I suppose he might even have &amp;quot;smelled&amp;quot; the offer on some occasions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, he could see the flow of intent showing him how long the offer was good for.  You get the weird offer, and then you see a flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the bird in flight who can&amp;#39;t turn back, so you have to jump in with them if you want to escape to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He likely saw that flow as I do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fibers of light moving towards you, giving the impression of a flow of current you can catch if you don&amp;#39;t delay. Which will carry you along all by itself if you just move &amp;quot;into it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for some private class man to come back the next day and ask, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s in it for me?&amp;quot; is pretty horrible for someone who lives in a non-linear view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like putting out a plate of spaghetti and meatballs for a kid who takes a bite, then spits it out onto the plate in disgust.  So it&amp;#39;s all ruined for anyone to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll only cook for that awful kid again, because you have no choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll all get to see that flow, if you don&amp;#39;t give up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6915123b969e0f04beee708c3315c5f139c96508\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6915123b969e0f04beee708c3315c5f139c96508&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_10rt80h", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10rt80h/a_research_podcast_on_carlos_castaneda_with/j6yb29o/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1675365716.0, "media_metadata": {"0eyiqf8p8vfa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f696a6dcb27c4107f7c49f03069a0405e22c1bcf"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e01b0a6f97945f01d0de0853b2b40a621c7acc04"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f7b3b033293f0ad9835c7add6604c9294612531"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f092280fd833fa45426965f964ffac9a833d3595"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c6d8aadbe9cbc4805bff42f9026be0109e9c174"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c59595cb87912cf6340940eecd66446501cc93da"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0eyiqf8p8vfa1.jpeg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6915123b969e0f04beee708c3315c5f139c96508"}, "id": "0eyiqf8p8vfa1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6xw67j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Fluffy_visuals", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1675360167.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10rt80h", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_to6hu0gf", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I noticed ppl hate Carlos Castaneda because he didn\u2019t give them what they wanted. wanting to unravel Carlos Castaneda won\u2019t get them anywhere, and the books better explain it.\nIt\u2019s The same with magic, people refuse to see it\u2019s really magic when it\u2019s clear it\u2019s outside their agenda of expectations.

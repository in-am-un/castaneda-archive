Reminder: In this story there were four old sorcerers who were still alive after so many years, buried under a big rock, and perhaps 12 allies they had collected. They used the allies to hold people down to the ground, perhaps by them being able to move the assemblage point of the victim to sleep paralysis. The old sorcerers would then \"feast\" on their energy.  Notice how the allies were still hanging out with them after hundreds of years, maybe because it's easy for them to hang out anywhere:\n\n\"When I reached the group I realized that don Juan was right; they were not really men. Only four of them had any resemblance to men, but they were not men either; they were strange creatures with huge yellow eyes. The others were just shapes that were propelled by the four that resembled men.\"\n\nI can't figure out where \"there\" is, but Carlos spent a few days using the analogy of a beaded curtain, and in particular one strand of the beads.\n\nI don't think the beads were particularly significant.  I think Ellis or one of the women just had a beaded curtain at one point, and he thought it was a good analogy.\n\nWe're in one bead, but you can move to the next. It's another world where \"you\" exist.\n\nThis happens in waking dreaming when the assemblage point moves enough to see another world, and you realize you live there too.  Or maybe don't actually live there, but know everything about its history, as if you did.  And you care about some of the things going on there.\n\nI've been emphasizing the fairy technique for a couple of reasons. Not as a master plan, but just because it's amusing.\n\nOne reason is, it makes people a little upset and they have to examine their interpretations.\n\nWhat, Fairies???  Is he nuts?  I've gotten that. Then later, \"Oh, I see what you're getting at.\"\n\nThe other is, it demonstrates how the old sorcerers learned to control (or at least get some help) from the inorganics.   They're highly manipulatable, except that you don't really manipulate them, but rather your own interaction with them.\n\nThe only reason that's actually useful is, they seem to remember the last interaction, and you can get them to stick to that.  Or maybe your assemblage point remembers the position that's good for that kind of interaction.  At any rate, it\u2019s better than having them attack, which is their normal method of interaction.\n\nBut to manipulate them, you have to raise them from weird thought in your mind, to solid object.\n\nThe interaction with them in dreaming is less obvious.    I\u2019d look for a kind of likable and trustable character who likes to sit with you as long as possible, and test it by seeing if the dream lasts longer when you comply.\n\nAnd especially look for water.  If you find yourself in a hot tub or pond in a dream, look around to see who's also there.  But a single inorganic often represents itself as a group.\n\nI should mention that at first, our second attention is a little angry at us. There's a period you'll likely go through trying to learn silence and dreaming, where you're at odds with your own self.\n\nThat also reflects with your inorganic being interactions in dreaming.  For example, instead of a calming presence as you might get after years of interactions, at first it might be an annoying figure always just behind you, pointing out problems.  Maybe a school teacher or your mom, or some weird combination, which follows you around and  judges what your dream is about.  I suspect they like to press against our assemblage point, which feels like they're hovering behind our back.\n\nLater, you might interact with them as some crazy person you run into, who likes to put their arms on you and struggle.

All of what exists in the universe is simply infinite luminous emanations stretching to infinity on both ends. A discrete but indeterminate bundle of emanations comprise a single unique world which can be perceived if the assemblage point is fixated within the range of that bundle of emanations.

An \"energy generating\" world is a world which is like ours, \"real\" and cohesive, unlike phantom worlds available in the darkroom (at the first 2/3rds of the J-curve path) or that which we enter into during our normal sleeping dreams. These distinct energy generating worlds contain the worlds of Earthly inorganic beings and other creatures which can perceive our world easily but not vice versa.  \n\nMan's perception has changed significantly over millennia to the point where the many possible emanations within our reach are simply discarded/unused. These emanations were always there right in front of us but deemphasized to the point where we ignore them all! Think babies or young children seeing spirits/ghosts, monsters under the bed and other things that \"aren't really there\". In fact all of those things are \"real\"! Children simply have much more flexible assemblage points so they are free to perceive much more within our band of emanations than adults are. So when we do this practice, we're learning to freely move our assemblage point like we were all able to as infants/young children, but renewed with an adult's purpose and sobriety. \n\nMoving the assemblage point all the way down just before \"stopping the world\" on Dan's J-curve infographic causes an option to become available. You can either move on into Silent Knowledge or access the 600 contemporaneous \"cyclic being\" worlds available to each human being. Each of these cyclic beings are \"you\", but just exist in their own individual worlds at the same time, which might be quite different from our own here. So they are indeed \"parallel realities\" although that term is kinda tainted by scientific mental masturbation. \n\nThe 600 cyclic being worlds, other worlds of the seven great bands and potentially other unnamed worlds are classified as worlds within the human unknown.

Why? No reason! Because that's what we're designed to do! This is literally our imperative as aware beings - we're created as probes for the Eagle to understand itself better. The Eagle desperately wants to understand how its own creation feels so it creates us using its own awareness to explore the emanations! And shine of our awareness on the sum total of indeterminate emanations creates the perception of a single cohesive reality.

You have a glass of water, and you are standing by a river. As long as the water in your glass is in the glass, it is its own separate body of water. \n\nOnce you pour it in the river, though it doesn't disappear, it isn't damaged or destroyed or harmed in any way... not really. It's just absorbed and added to the vastness of the river. \n\nIt would be absolutely impossible to pull that water out of the river again, and the water itself that had been in the glass would cease to exist as its own separate body.\n\nThat's what we are dealing with. \n\nIt is no great feat to allow ourselves to be poured out. But to maintain our wholeness, to refuse the inevitable integration that all ordinary men succumb to in the end is the greatest audacity. \n\nIt is the Eagle that gives us the opportunity to maintain our solidarity. Sorcery is the Eagle's gift! A path with a map we can follow. So that we stay in our glass and continue on into infinity as our own self. Instead of going with the flow, quite literally.  \n\nTo think that if given an unlimited number of chances to \"get it right\" would provide a man, the ability to have \"greater experiences\" is self-indulgent folly. \n\nMan hasn't done anything greater on this earth than the thousands of men who came before him in the whole history of this world. \n\nThe only way to have those greater experiences you speak of is to do what we do, but without that being the motivation.  \n\nYou have to want magic for the sake of magic alone. Not so you can become some great wizard whose songs will be sung into the end of the ages. Or to be able to show off your superior abilities, to write yet another book proving how amazing your life has been, in order to gift lesser men with your great philanthropy. \n\nWe are given a cubic centimeter of chance to become what we dare to become.

You have a glass of water, and you are standing by a river. As long as the water in your glass is in the glass, it is its own separate body of water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you pour it in the river, though it doesn&amp;#39;t disappear, it isn&amp;#39;t damaged or destroyed or harmed in any way... not really. It&amp;#39;s just absorbed and added to the vastness of the river. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be absolutely impossible to pull that water out of the river again, and the water itself that had been in the glass would cease to exist as its own separate body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we are dealing with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is no great feat to allow ourselves to be poured out. But to maintain our wholeness, to refuse the inevitable integration that all ordinary men succumb to in the end is the greatest audacity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is the Eagle that gives us the opportunity to maintain our solidarity. Sorcery is the Eagle&amp;#39;s gift! A path with a map we can follow. So that we stay in our glass and continue on into infinity as our own self. Instead of going with the flow, quite literally.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To think that if given an unlimited number of chances to &amp;quot;get it right&amp;quot; would provide a man, the ability to have &amp;quot;greater experiences&amp;quot; is self-indulgent folly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man hasn&amp;#39;t done anything greater on this earth than the thousands of men who came before him in the whole history of this world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way to have those greater experiences you speak of is to do what we do, but without that being the motivation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to want magic for the sake of magic alone. Not so you can become some great wizard whose songs will be sung into the end of the ages. Or to be able to show off your superior abilities, to write yet another book proving how amazing your life has been, in order to gift lesser men with your great philanthropy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are given a cubic centimeter of chance to become what we dare to become. To fly with the bird of freedom, which doesn&amp;#39;t stop to wait, or circle back around. The bird of freedom only flies forward.

You can in fact go back in time. It's just far more effort than any reasonable person would put in.

I could tell stories about heaven.  You see things there, which later you find on earth.

So when a demon tells you \"We are legions!!!\", just ask him \"Why so few?\".\n\nThat'll take the wind out of its sails.  Spirits don't like it when you are supposed to be afraid, but make jokes instead.\n\nOn your own, you'll realize there is in fact a limit also.\n\nThe Allies are not here with you. They have to project themselves.\n\nAnd it's not \"easy\" for them. They need energy to do that.\n\nSome of it has to come from you, so that they can \"tune in\" your range of emanations in use.\n\nFright can provide that, love, and maybe just about anything \"important\" that you feel.  Any emotion, any project that needs them to succeed.\n\nBut you can't feel all that for more than 3 allies at once.\n\nAnd even 3 is very difficult to keep around.\n\nOne is best.\n\nAnd why do they want to teach us?\n\nWhy do you want to learn from them?\n\nBecause it's cooler than anything else you could be doing!\n\nI mean, come on...\n\nKick the butt of every saint, prophet, and magic man ever written about?!\n\nWho wouldn't find that fun?", "edited": 1678885408.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jcadar6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you mean actually travel back in time using sorcery in order to verify first-hand?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No.  I&amp;#39;ll give you a practical example.

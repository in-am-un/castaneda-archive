Don Juan said he had \"high hopes for muscle memory\".\n\nIt's a puzzling statement until you actually learn some advanced sorcery, meaning until you learn to move your assemblage point down the back, under, and all the way up to the front.\n\nIntellectually I suppose you might read this, and believe you understand. And you might to some extent, but as with all things in sorcery, you won't get it exactly right. You've been brainwashed by everything else you learned, and your interpretation will be tainted by it.\n\nWhich is just to say, you can't \"tell\" someone about sorcery. They have to see it for themselves. Telling them might motivate them, to try to see for themselves. That's all you can hope for.\n\nWhich is what was missing the last 50 years. Everyone read the books. They were told.\n\nBut absolutely no one followed the instructions.\n\nI mean, come on!\n\nIf you get silent, the world stops. End of story.\n\nIt doesn't stop only for \"Lucky Bob\".\n\nIt stops for anyone.\n\nIf you think you got silent, and the entire world didn't come to an end and transfer you to \"the control room\" somewhere else, then you didn't get silent.\n\nBut me telling you won't do any good. You have to see it for yourself.\n\nHere however, is something I CAN tell you about, and it's almost enough. Because you can try it out for yourself relatively easily.\n\nSo the background.\n\nI took Shotokan Karate along with Taisha and whoever else took it with her and was in that famous picture of her in a \"Gi\", back in the 70s at UCLA.\n\nProbably Florinda.\n\nWe have those pictures of them and her story about visiting the Budokan. Oddly, I was on the same plane with her, but had no idea what an oddity that was.\n\nIt was the same \"school\" as mine, except I was at UCR.\n\nThe university system in Southern California, had adopted Shotokan as their version of \"Karate Classes\".\n\nI was on the karate \"team\" at 16. A \"Visiting Student\" thing high schoolers could do, to get out of the standard physical education classes you were forced to take in high school back then. Kennedy's doing I believe.\n\nRay Dalke, the head instructor at UCR, was big on exercise. We'd punch padded planks endlessly until our knuckles were bloody, run up and down stairs, and even do a LOT of rope jumping.\n\nRay used to say, forget about whether your karate is good. If you're in good shape, you'll beat an out of shape man hands down.\n\nI don't know about that, but I ended up becoming quite skilled at jump rope.\n\nI won't go into all the ways you can do that, but it's not just one thing at all.\n\nNow when you get old, or perhaps when you are lazy for decades and no longer really exercise, you lose foot speed and strength.\n\nYou can get those back, by using the very same process Tensegrity is based on.\n\nI don't want to call it \"routine\" because that's a buzzword that upsets confused men. If you say you are adding something to your routine, they start to quote \"The Warrior's Way\" back at you.\n\nCarlos hated that. That's why he told us to stop reading the books of Carlos Castaneda, since we had him right there in private classes.\n\nNow days, no one does. So go ahead and read.\n\nBut he didn't like being corrected from his own books. Neither does Carol Tiggs, who forbid questions from the books at one of her last workshops.\n\nBut if \"routine\" bothers you, use \"ritual\".\n\nRituals store intent! You do your ritual in silence, and you'll notice something odd. The next time, you notice more of it.\n\nDarkroom is based on that. The tensegrity movements you selected as your series of long forms, create a \"container\" for intent to store into.\n\nSo rather than \"Tensegrity Routine\", we might want to say \"Tensegrity Ritual\".\n\nAs don Juan pointed out, there's no surer way to score a direct hit on the second attention, than by repetitious acts. Rituals.\n\nThe \"Men of Knowledge\", the inept shaman profiteers of Olmec times, used rituals, drugs, and an Ally to do stupendous magic for strangers who had extra chickens they wanted. Or abalone shells.\n\nThey didn't have money back then, but you can be sure the \"shamans\" in that population were after \"stuff\" in trade for magic.\n\nJust as shamans today want your stuff.\n\nLook... You can't learn what's in the books, unless you are a \"seer\" type. A \"shaman\" type is hopeless. Will never learn real magic.\n\nBut I'll let you find that out for yourself. Just don't waste more than 20 years figuring it out.\n\nYou must pursue MAGIC. Only magic. Not fame, fortune, or the other guy's cash, and perhaps his wife.\n\nBack to \"rituals\".\n\nYour muscle memory is vital to your existence. There's no way your conscious mind can control something as complex as walking.\n\nYou learn to walk, by doing it. Until you get it right as a baby.\n\nThat's stored into a \"subroutine\", or perhaps \"App\" if you prefer.\n\nWhen you want to walk, you just think of that app and off you go.\n\nYou don't control each and every muscle! There must be dozens needed, for walking.\n\nSo the muscle memory is a vital part of our very being, and because it has to function without our knowledge at times, for instance to remove your hand quickly from a hot stove, it's also tied to all of our senses. It's aware!\n\nEven sentient perhaps.\n\nAs a kid I once met Lyndon Johnson.\n\nNo one liked the guy! He probably even put out a hit on a rival.\n\nCertainly I didn't like him. Or even respect him.\n\nIn case anyone didn't know, he was the president when the vietnam war got fired up. There's plenty of blame to go around, but possibly he fired it up more than others.\n\nI thought, \"I don't want to shake LBJ's hand!\"\n\nBut I got pushed up to him in a crowd where he was shaking hands.\n\nAnd instantly my neck froze.\n\nMy body became so stiff, I could barely talk.\n\nMy muscle memory took over, against my conscious will.\n\nTHAT'S how powerful muscle memory is. It can even override our conscious mind.\n\nThat's why the primary sorcery technique we have, is Tensegrity.\n\nIt reprograms your muscle memory to expect magic instead of pain, danger, or a need to behave like a vehicle to get you where you are going.\n\nA huge amount of the \"grief\" we are drowning in, is from our internal dialogue activating muscle memory \"apps\" we didn't consciously want to activate.\n\nCall it the \"Johnson\" effect. You really don't want to freeze up, but if your sentient muscle memory detects a threatening LBJ, that app gets fired off!\n\nTensegrity reprograms those apps to be \"grief free\".\n\nIn fact, our muscle memory begins to expect bliss, magic, spirits, and travel to other worlds. For real.\n\nThe cool thing about muscle memory functions is you can \"clone\" an existing one, and \"edit\" the mood.\n\nOnce you have 2 versions of that app, the one that comes up when you need it is the last one most used.\n\nHere's a crazy example!\n\nDid you know you can leap through solid walls?\n\nAwake, eyes open, completely sober?\n\nWell you can!\n\nAnd if you practice darkroom according to instructions, you WILL.\n\nEventually.\n\nAnd what seems to happen is, you switch to an \"alternate app\".\n\nI can't explain that, but it just happens. And it doesn't harm your physical body. That part of you just seems to \"shrink\" away.\n\nLike Carlos at the ticket office, where don Juan shoved him into next Sunday, 1 mile away.\n\nIn an instant.\n\nAnd he walked back to his normal time period, where he started. Walked...\n\nWith no explanation for how that's possible.\n\nYou WILL do that. If you can get over the idea of Naguals and benefactors, and all that horrible greedy attention seeking stuff.\n\nA \"benefactor\" seems a bit gay to me...\n\nI can hear it now, \"Oh BENEFACTOR!!! Say my name, say my name...\"\n\nSo maybe I'm not entirely understanding why many of the men are \"benefactor\" obsessed.\n\nMaybe it's like being obsessed with strippers or something.\n\nThat I can understand. They're lovely.\n\nNow what has this to do with jump rope?\n\nAs I said, you get old, and feeble.\n\nBut if you do tensegrity regularly, and especially if you do it with full magic working, you learn about the power of routines.\n\nAnd you can use your series of long forms, I recommend at least 20 minutes total, to accomplish intensely magical things.\n\nStuff no other system even dreams of doing.\n\nFor instance, you can do your tensegrity series, then \"swipe\" away the ceiling of your darkroom, see the stars, zoom in on one, and leap through space to land on the nearest planet over there.\n\nWide awake, eyes open, completely sober.\n\nElias did something similar.\n\nBut did you REALLY do that?\n\nBeats me. But it sure seems like it. You don't wake up in the morning with a bruise on your head.\n\nIt's the power of a routine.\n\nTo your series of tensegrity forms, which produce some magical result, you can try to insert things to help overcome the problems of aging.\n\nI use mine to form a phantom room. A real place, fully visible, which doesn't actually exist.\n\nOnce it's formed and visible, I squat down on the floor the way a baby does preparing to crawl, or perhaps the way Asians can and westerners cannot, and I \"clean\" the floor.\n\nI wipe it down with a blue shop rag which doesn't actually exist.\n\nAll the magic stuff I wipe into a pile, I cup into my hands. Then I stand up and toss it into the air, to form the decorations on the walls of my phantom room.\n\nBut why???\n\nBecause as an old man, I was having trouble standing up from the floor.\n\nSo I added it to my \"routine\".\n\nSorcerers inevitably \"fix\" any problems they notice, but not impatiently. They just add it to their magical rituals.\n\nSo I used to be a great jump roper, and then after recovering my leg flexibility using squatting during my tensegrity ritual, I decided my feet weren't very good at fast movements anymore.\n\nAnd I got a jump rope.\n\nThe first time I only did it just enough, to do a few skips.\n\nIt was hard! I hadn't activated that muscle memory application in many decades.\n\nBut I didn't force it. I just did 3 or 4 skips. And it wasn't easy.\n\nBut the next day, it was slightly better.\n\nStill, I only did a few.\n\nThe next, I could do more and even started to recall the various versions of skipping rope. One leg in front of the other, both jumping up at the same time, and even walking around skipping.\n\nI was shocked how fast my muscle memory recovered that long lost application, from all the way back in the 1970s in karate class.\n\nIt wasn't about increasing muscle strength at all. It was about \"accessing\" that ability.\n\nThat's why don Juan had \"high hopes\" for muscle memory.\n\nBut above all else, train your muscle memory to be SILENT.\n\nSo that during the day, if the movement you are doing in the kitchen is even slightly similar to a tensegrity movement that's part of your ritual, the muscle memory itself will help to silence your mind.\n\nAs Carlos told us in private classes, regarding the Tensegrity, \"I saturated you.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Miracle of Muscle Memory", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ihz7i870yxma1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 144, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ihz7i870yxma1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f91dc3e272e0dc4bc26aefee17ba771ba19a7ce"}, {"y": 288, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ihz7i870yxma1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73ae98f3cb1023a65a251b9af90802c530defe19"}, {"y": 426, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ihz7i870yxma1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6910944bf04f8e9b655eb493f318c9e09279a635"}, {"y": 853, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ihz7i870yxma1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0515980737b0afe8cc9d13efb1b7cf7160ddd20c"}], "s": {"y": 1200, "x": 900, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ihz7i870yxma1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed7b9e191fede4990cdb06bb3c2b18d6b6fa2c04"}, "id": "ihz7i870yxma1"}}, "name": "t3_11nu5v5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gqgMEZ5yjCp_5QcfGK9QPIS2OrOB0X07Ec79T9WKMJI.jpg", "edited": 1678467560.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1678466806.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ihz7i870yxma1.png?width=900&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ed7b9e191fede4990cdb06bb3c2b18d6b6fa2c04\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ihz7i870yxma1.png?width=900&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ed7b9e191fede4990cdb06bb3c2b18d6b6fa2c04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one of his final publications, perhaps Silent Knowledge or Readers of Infinity, Carlos explains the reason for Tensegrity a bit, with a comment on what don Juan thought about it.

Neither does Carol Tiggs, who forbid questions from the books at one of her last workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; bothers you, use &amp;quot;ritual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rituals store intent! You do your ritual in silence, and you&amp;#39;ll notice something odd. The next time, you notice more of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom is based on that. The tensegrity movements you selected as your series of long forms, create a &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; for intent to store into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So rather than &amp;quot;Tensegrity Routine&amp;quot;, we might want to say &amp;quot;Tensegrity Ritual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan pointed out, there&amp;#39;s no surer way to score a direct hit on the second attention, than by repetitious acts.

Walked...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With no explanation for how that&amp;#39;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You WILL do that. If you can get over the idea of Naguals and benefactors, and all that horrible greedy attention seeking stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;benefactor&amp;quot; seems a bit gay to me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can hear it now, &amp;quot;Oh BENEFACTOR!!! Say my name, say my name...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe I&amp;#39;m not entirely understanding why many of the men are &amp;quot;benefactor&amp;quot; obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s like being obsessed with strippers or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That I can understand. They&amp;#39;re lovely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now what has this to do with jump rope?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, you get old, and feeble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you do tensegrity regularly, and especially if you do it with full magic working, you learn about the power of routines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can use your series of long forms, I recommend at least 20 minutes total, to accomplish intensely magical things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuff no other system even dreams of doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, you can do your tensegrity series, then &amp;quot;swipe&amp;quot; away the ceiling of your darkroom, see the stars, zoom in on one, and leap through space to land on the nearest planet over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wide awake, eyes open, completely sober.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elias did something similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But did you REALLY do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me. But it sure seems like it. You don&amp;#39;t wake up in the morning with a bruise on your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the power of a routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To your series of tensegrity forms, which produce some magical result, you can try to insert things to help overcome the problems of aging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use mine to form a phantom room. A real place, fully visible, which doesn&amp;#39;t actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it&amp;#39;s formed and visible, I squat down on the floor the way a baby does preparing to crawl, or perhaps the way Asians can and westerners cannot, and I &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wipe it down with a blue shop rag which doesn&amp;#39;t actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the magic stuff I wipe into a pile, I cup into my hands. Then I stand up and toss it into the air, to form the decorations on the walls of my phantom room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because as an old man, I was having trouble standing up from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I added it to my &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers inevitably &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; any problems they notice, but not impatiently. They just add it to their magical rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I used to be a great jump roper, and then after recovering my leg flexibility using squatting during my tensegrity ritual, I decided my feet weren&amp;#39;t very good at fast movements anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I got a jump rope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time I only did it just enough, to do a few skips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was hard! I hadn&amp;#39;t activated that muscle memory application in many decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t force it. I just did 3 or 4 skips. And it wasn&amp;#39;t easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the next day, it was slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, I only did a few.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next, I could do more and even started to recall the various versions of skipping rope. One leg in front of the other, both jumping up at the same time, and even walking around skipping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shocked how fast my muscle memory recovered that long lost application, from all the way back in the 1970s in karate class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t about increasing muscle strength at all. It was about &amp;quot;accessing&amp;quot; that ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why don Juan had &amp;quot;high hopes&amp;quot; for muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But above all else, train your muscle memory to be SILENT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that during the day, if the movement you are doing in the kitchen is even slightly similar to a tensegrity movement that&amp;#39;s part of your ritual, the muscle memory itself will help to silence your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Carlos told us in private classes, regarding the Tensegrity, &amp;quot;I saturated you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false,

I believe my count is 3.\n\nBut two of those were Little Smoke and Devil's Weed messing with me.\n\nFortunately as far as rituals go, any ritual can be turned into AMAZING magic.\n\nEven martial arts, repetitious dancing, tea ceremonies.\n\nThe problem is, no one ever gets rid of their internal dialogue.\n\nInstead, they \"puff themselves up\", like a blowfish.\n\nThinking about all the glory and attention, when they get their routine to be magical.\n\nSo it never is.\n\nWe're lazy bastards, in constant need of attention from other humans.\n\nIt's almost like we never grew past being an infant, because we didn't have to.\n\nWe were born into the \"world of the giant cry babies\".\n\nIn the books, you might want to notice some of the odd \"rituals\" the other apprentices were involved in.\n\nSecond Ring of Power has the little sisters running on the walls, Pablito has a 3rd arm, and La Gorda can open some kind of \"eye\" escape hatch.\n\nNone of those things happen without a whole bunch of practice.\n\nAnd while practicing it's so awful to see no magic, that you feel like a big faker.\n\nLike everyone else out there.  So you begin to crave the real thing. If you're honest that is.\n\nThat's why \"the book deal mind\" is emphasized in past posts. To get you over trying to seek attention and money, instead of magic,\n\nAnd if you get a tiny flicker of magic, you are pretty much stuck on doing things precisely the way you did last time. To get that to happen again, so  you can make it grow.\n\nEven baseball players do that!  If they had a lucky winning game wearing a certain pair of socks, then they wear those every time.  Maybe don't even wash them.\n\nIt's possible that the path to \"practical magic\" always includes rituals.\n\nAnd if you think of them as \"extensible technology\", it's a bit easier to understand how they work.\n\nWe have amazing computers now. I'm so jealous!  Too old to participate.\n\nSomeone figured out that humans are not actually intelligent, so we end up with an AI  that also isn't actually intelligent.  Chatgpt.  If you look  up what that stands for, it's pretty much screaming out, \"I'm not actually intelligent!\"\n\nYet it seems to be.\n\nAnd now that we have it, we can just pop it into anything.

I believe my count is 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But two of those were Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed messing with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately as far as rituals go, any ritual can be turned into AMAZING magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even martial arts, repetitious dancing, tea ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, no one ever gets rid of their internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, they &amp;quot;puff themselves up&amp;quot;, like a blowfish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking about all the glory and attention, when they get their routine to be magical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it never is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re lazy bastards, in constant need of attention from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost like we never grew past being an infant, because we didn&amp;#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were born into the &amp;quot;world of the giant cry babies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the books, you might want to notice some of the odd &amp;quot;rituals&amp;quot; the other apprentices were involved in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second Ring of Power has the little sisters running on the walls, Pablito has a 3rd arm, and La Gorda can open some kind of &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; escape hatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of those things happen without a whole bunch of practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while practicing it&amp;#39;s so awful to see no magic, that you feel like a big faker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else out there.  So you begin to crave the real thing. If you&amp;#39;re honest that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why &amp;quot;the book deal mind&amp;quot; is emphasized in past posts. To get you over trying to seek attention and money, instead of magic,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you get a tiny flicker of magic, you are pretty much stuck on doing things precisely the way you did last time. To get that to happen again, so  you can make it grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even baseball players do that!  If they had a lucky winning game wearing a certain pair of socks, then they wear those every time.  Maybe don&amp;#39;t even wash them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that the path to &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot; always includes rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you think of them as &amp;quot;extensible technology&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s a bit easier to understand how they work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have amazing computers now. I&amp;#39;m so jealous!  Too old to participate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone figured out that humans are not actually intelligent, so we end up with an AI  that also isn&amp;#39;t actually intelligent.  Chatgpt.  If you look  up what that stands for, it&amp;#39;s pretty much screaming out, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not actually intelligent!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet it seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now that we have it, we can just pop it into anything.

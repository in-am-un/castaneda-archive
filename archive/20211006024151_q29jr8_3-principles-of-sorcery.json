Not with the \"system\" we use now.\n\nDarkroom Gazing is kind of modern sorcery!\n\nLet me highlight 3 principles:\n\nIt is a fact that human beings have the ability to modify perception. Never doubt that.\n\nAlthough everyone here who worked hard can tell you how difficult it is.\n\nSo how can we solve the secrets of the assemblage point?\n\nNever forgetting this:\n\n\\#1 Accept our current assemblage point position.\n\n\\#2 Stand in a center that gives us perspective.\n\n\\#3 Decide to move from there, expressing the decision with our being.\n\nFirst of all, you have to know that we are usually dragged from one side to the other, on the blue line of the J curve. It's our \"ordinary position\".\n\nRealize how easy it is to get angry, sprouts of hope for no reason, moments of insecurity, paranoia, overthinking.\n\nObserve how we don't have any control over it. Become aware of your own perception.\n\nWe really need to accept this, at the level of awareness, before deciding to do something about it.\n\n\\#2 The next step is to find a \"center\" in perception.\n\nA center that allows us identify the influence of the lateral shifts.\n\nReturning to this place gives us the minimum of perspective necessary to do sorcery.\n\nWe could say we avoid every lateral shift and we stay in the middle of the assemblage point path.\n\nThat's the only place where we can find a vague remnant of Intent that allows us to do the impossible.\n\nMeditation people might be familiar with that point.\n\n\\#3 The third fact that we have to know, is that our ordinary perception is the result of many layers of interpretation, which shape what we have in front of us.\n\nOur goal is to unravel each layer of interpretation to get more raw versions of reality.\n\nSo we find our center, stand on it, silence the internal dialogue until the interpretations are optional, and we let them go.\n\nOur assemblage point will shift little by little, and begin to intercept new emanations that were not previously illuminated.\n\nThing will start to feel gross and strange. Foreign to you.\n\nLittle scenes will proyect everywhere.\n\nAs we stabilize different perceptions, our center will shift down to the green zone, and then to the red zone.\n\nThose new perceptions makes your awareness \"external\".\n\nStopping the internal dialogue escapes from the world of \"ideas\". It can only be actively experienced.\n\nThat's the decision we have to actively demostrate with our beings. Second by second, deciding to be silent instead of focusing the awareness on lateral shifts.\n\nThe more we move our center away from the ordinary position, the more clarity and strength we have.\n\nI think these 3 points explain what the control and sobriety of sorcerers is based on.\n\nIt is exactly what we are learning here.\n\nSorcerers have a romance with those 3 steps. They make it their best art.\n\nToday a bad player was complaining about Dan.

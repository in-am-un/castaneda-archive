Doing Tensegrity my hand will brush up against it, and it'll feel like someone dangled fabric strips from the ceiling, and I just can't see them because of the darkness.\n\nThat the energy body can be felt just as Zuleica claimed, might explain why Cholita's double can poke me with its finger, and wake me up.  Her energy body is also \"slightly\" solid.\n\nMy own energy body often wakes me up if I'm finding it hard to get up at 2AM to start practicing.\n\nIt shows up to bribe me with \"fabulous magical prizes\".\n\nSo it's a perfectly normal development.\n\nEventually you'll glance down and see that it's staying in place, floating around your stomach.\n\nMuch (much) later, you'll actually be able to look at it, using silent knowledge.\n\nAnd see that in fact, the \"outline\" of it is distinct.  Not puffy at all.\n\nThat's why you can \"dent\" it.\n\nWe've got the real thing here!

Hasn&amp;#39;t showered in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all he can talk about are his impossible to solve problems, which from your point of view are actually easy to solve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just cut it out!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You try to hang out with him, but eventually you discover how he ended up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one could stand him anymore. He burned all his bridges with horrible hateful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SAME is true of our double. It wants to visit, but can&amp;#39;t stand to be around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, just as you would be with your homeless cousin, if you hear of any encouraging developments at all from family members, you might at least go back and hover around him a bit, to see if he took a shower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your &amp;quot;energy body&amp;quot; is unlikely to form suddenly the way things in the books often happen in a somewhat drastic or exaggerated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s likely all due to someone else doing all the work for their apprentices, such as with the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our case, your energy body will form PAINFULLY slowly, but you&amp;#39;ll get to see that happening at every step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll start to swarm around you all by itself, in anticipation of you practicing that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you&amp;#39;ll even be able to run your hand along the outside of it, because it will be that clear to see in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll even feel it!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really can be felt with the hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had to get over the shock of that during darkroom, in the last few months. Doing Tensegrity my hand will brush up against it, and it&amp;#39;ll feel like someone dangled fabric strips from the ceiling, and I just can&amp;#39;t see them because of the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That the energy body can be felt just as Zuleica claimed, might explain why Cholita&amp;#39;s double can poke me with its finger, and wake me up.  Her energy body is also &amp;quot;slightly&amp;quot; solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My own energy body often wakes me up if I&amp;#39;m finding it hard to get up at 2AM to start practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It shows up to bribe me with &amp;quot;fabulous magical prizes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s a perfectly normal development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you&amp;#39;ll glance down and see that it&amp;#39;s staying in place, floating around your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much (much) later, you&amp;#39;ll actually be able to look at it, using silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And see that in fact, the &amp;quot;outline&amp;quot; of it is distinct.  Not puffy at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why you can &amp;quot;dent&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got the real thing here!  What Carlos wrote, is always true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless he was making up a history for someone in his inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too bad about Patty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She could have come to live with me and Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium":

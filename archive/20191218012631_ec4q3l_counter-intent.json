I know because I experiment.\n\nMy impetus to experiment is the desire to restore Carlos' reputation on the web.\n\nLeft alone, I'd stick to sitting in my dark room, playing with spirits.\n\nBut I have a debt to pay back.\n\nAnd that requires figuring out how to get as many people to learn waking dreaming, as possible.  I need the mass.\n\nAgainst all good judgement I will bring up the topic of sorcery in a test situation I haven\u2019t tried before, to gauge the reaction.  Test the waters in general.\n\nFor example, while shopping with Cholita she often goes off in her own direction, and can remain missing for hours.  She won't even send a text to tell where she went.\n\nThat might sound unreasonable, but Cholita believes I can see her anywhere she is, at any time.\n\nI'd like to dissuade her of that delusion, but it wouldn't be completely true if I denied it.\n\nAll I can do is whine, \"Not always...\"\n\nWhen shopping, in order to find her I have to ask around.\n\nIf I think it\u2019s a good situation for experimenting, I\u2019ll ask a clerk, \u201cDid you see a witch go by?\u201d\n\nIn case anyone wonders, Cholita does in fact look like a witch. If you put 100 people in a lineup and asked someone to \u201cpoint to the witch\u201d, Cholita would get the finger every time.\n\nResult of asking if a witch went by: Women laugh nervously and ask, \u201cWhat????\u201d\n\nYou can tell they worry you\u2019re insulting a woman\u2019s appearance.  You can almost feel the fear of domestic violence in their voice.  They're probably thinking, \"What kind of a monster would call his own wife a witch???!!\"\n\nHey!!!  I was bragging there.  \n\nThey never get it.\n\nMen smile in a sort of wicked way and say, \u201cWe\u2019ll, I guess I might have!  Maybe she went that way?\u201d\n\nBoth essentially behave the same way.  You brought up a forbidden topic. It's like asking, \"Did you poop well today?\"\n\nSome are offended, some amused.\n\nI don\u2019t always experiment using Cholita. Sometimes I\u2019ll be at a party listening to talk of anti-depressants, and suggest that owning your own therapy pet, for example a pretty little Fairy, might make it unnecessary to take the pills.\n\nOr, I\u2019ll be listening to a long and tedious explanation of meditation and cut to the chase by telling them, you could just stop that little voice in your head and get much faster results.\n\nBut the most basic and dangerous experiment of all, is to actually try to interest someone in learning sorcery because you yourself know it\u2019s super cool from direct experience, and that it would make them a lot happier if they could do what you have learned to do.\n\nPlease don't do that, until you yourself know it's super cool, from direct experience. \n\n There's already enough Mormons to go around.\n\nDifferent environments produce different results, when you bring up the topic of sorcery.\n\nBut there\u2019s always one thing that stands out.\n\nWe aren\u2019t free to talk about anything we like. There are consequences.\n\nAnd some of them are supernatural.\n\n*Intent* it sticky. It remains around, and you can pick up on it.\n\nCarlos tried to attach his followers to the *intent* of his books. He gave them new names, and used whatever method he could to make them part of the story line.\n\nEven when it obviously made no sense and wouldn\u2019t fool anyone, he\u2019d find a \u201cposition\u201d for them.\n\nAnd he periodically refreshed that, as you can see from the Blue Scout notes.\n\nHe wanted them to live in a bubble with him. To follow the *intent* of learning sorcery with him.\n\nHe wanted them to stop their normal line of practical life activities, and join an insecure myth.\n\nThe myth actually provides some protection, in a very odd way.\n\nYou now have the mass of a group behind you, as far as *intent* goes. That means when you venture out for sorcery related tasks, you aren\u2019t alone.\n\n*Intent* is powerful. If you\u2019re super fluid you can sit in silence in darkness and just wait to see what sort of *intent* you can tap into.\n\nIt seems to float around in the air, like an odor.\n\nYou can pick up another world, a person\u2019s dream, a spirit passing by, or even a replay of some historical event.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of what\u2019s hanging around out there is fun.\n\nSome is oppressive.\n\nThat\u2019s how it is with the topic of magic.\n\nAt some point in the past, the world began to rid itself of magic, using oppressive internal dialogue training.\n\nOver time, it also created an *intent* to stop magic.  The *intent* came, automatically, from the new drive to conform.\n\nIt's everywhere now!\n\nYou\u2019ll run into it if you experiment the way I do.\n\nIt produces the following results. You try to explain an aspect of sorcery that\u2019s easy to explain, but your mouth won\u2019t work.\n\nThe sentences come out jumbled, with the wrong words in a few places.\n\nYou try harder, and the explanation comes out badly.\n\nBut in a different place, the words just flow on their own. You can even surprise yourself at what you say, if you get a good flow going for teaching sorcery.  *Intent* takes over.\n\nThis can be perceived using *seeing*.\n\nThere\u2019s actually a visual effect.\n\nWhen you run into a block, you can visually *see* it. Dark lines radiate around the area between you and the person you are talking to.\n\nThey\u2019re almost like heat waves seen coming off a hot desert, or the roof of your car.\n\nIf you see those, end the conversation immediately.\n\nAll is not lost.  Try again later.\n\nWhen you get a breakthrough, you might see those blue, red, or white dots people describe. They seem to bloom, as a response to breaking some kind of barrier.  Wavy lines related to the second attention's energy body can begin to radiate around the area, as if the other person's dreaming body took interest.\n\nIt almost looks like the time Cholita lit up her energy body for me, as a thank you for endless shopping.\n\nAfter that breakthrough, one you can *see*, the conversation flows. Where the other person before might have had a worried look on their face, because you were venturing into forbidden topic area, they smile and seem willing to understand a point or two, here or there.  They might even pipe in with an idea of their own.\n\nRemember this the next time you make an idiot out of yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely your doing.\n\nThere is *counter intent* in the air. It\u2019ll take a lot of mass, over a very long time,  to remove it.\n\nEdited: once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Counter Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Flyers (counter intent)"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"a2oslq58ea541": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 128, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2oslq58ea541.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e0d4b35e7c1e61cfba73d15a9e40c21dcf0112"}, {"y": 256, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2oslq58ea541.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fd97faf7404d7944152bb7135a5dd15fbc8562a"}, {"y": 379, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2oslq58ea541.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a024cac35b7fb94aef5f1139ebcd46efe80e7cfe"}, {"y": 759, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2oslq58ea541.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6f84ec759c54c201a00e0b7fbc120922fa3c563"}, {"y": 1138, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2oslq58ea541.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2a9c1420baf9a831240618a78bd5d0a2c99c89f"}, {"y": 1280, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2oslq58ea541.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08c6c11735154295eabaa2011377ac4e2adb52ba"}], "s": {"y": 2666, "x": 2248, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2oslq58ea541.jpg?width=2248&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e4954c4ab36c80aecd3e484af686512979ad918"}, "id": "a2oslq58ea541"}}, "name": "t3_ec4q3l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Flyers (counter intent)", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7CKXSIf7RTWSYEFUJIaR0jA0JtpUKqx8m2mAzSBBiTg.jpg", "edited": 1576630994.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1576628791.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a2oslq58ea541.jpg?width=2248&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5e4954c4ab36c80aecd3e484af686512979ad918\"&gt;A Witch Going Shopping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The term counter-intention is used in psychology to mean, \u201cAn intention that goes in the opposite direction from what one wants to happen.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to help people learn sorcery, you quickly run into this.

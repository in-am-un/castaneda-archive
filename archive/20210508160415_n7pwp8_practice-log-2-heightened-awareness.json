She insisted I had to view the puffs of energy as separate objects I could scoop into my hand.  She even flew around pointing them out with her hands, to insure I saw them as objects.\n\nCarlos taught us that too, in the Tensegrity.  Look at Pandora's Box pass!  Talk about objects made out of the glow of awareness.\n\nBut only HALF of the tensegrity is like that.  It's easy to ignore that fact, there's so many moves.\n\nThe  other half, that we haven't figured out, is not object oriented.\n\nMuch seems to be \"surface oriented\".\n\nSo here's a fairy tale.\n\nIn the darkroom, you are actually looking only at surfaces.\n\nThere are no puffs.\n\nThe main surface is the inside of your luminous shell. Inside of the egg.\n\nIt's dark amber.\n\nAmber #2 they call it. Not the honey amber. But the darker one.\n\nWhen you gaze at it, you light up emanations.  And it becomes pinkish, with some red highlights.\n\nIf you \"burn\" that surface with your gaze, it erupts in purple blobs, where you are gazing.\n\nSo we aren't clearing out the inside of our luminous shell, by scooping energy.\n\nWe're generating the sight of the energy, like a laser might produce steam if you pointed it at wet rags.\n\nNow, it's all the second attention. \n\nYou can turn anything into an object in the second attention.\n\nYou can turn your mom into a basketball, in the second attention.\n\n(Don't...)\n\nThat doesn't mean it really is.\n\nIf you treat everything in the darkroom as a surface instead of an object, you can extend it to cover your full view.\n\nThe sight is blinding!  \n\nIt's like looking directly into a kiln, through the slit, instead of looking at the glowing slit from a distance.\n\nLike an IOB, it strongly holds the attention!  That strongly moves the assemblage point.\n\nAnd you can break off chunks of the egg shell \"surface\", and hold them.\n\nThere's the myth part.  You can break off pieces of the shell.\n\nAnd those are automatic power objects.\n\nThe egg shell is also permeable.\n\nIf you gaze through it just a little, to the outside of it, you see the whitish light. \n\nPerhaps that's the \"sugar coating\" Carlos mentioned.\n\nAfter a long time darkroom gazing the whitish light becomes visible, on the surface of the outside of the egg shell.\n\nYou can also break off a chunk of that. It has a different effect on the second attention, than the amber kind of surface.

My level of awareness changes daily, depending on how far I moved my assemblage point the night before.\n\nI'm a little dense today.\n\nMr. DoubleTake is probably part of the \"human form\".\n\nIf he is, it's the part that \"recognizes\" things.\n\nSo if you look at a cup on a table, he recognizes it as a cup.\n\nBut he'll refuse to recognize things that are on his \"no-no\" list.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nSo he uses tricks to make the eyes jiggle, gives you a little rush of fright in your stomach, and using those tools he can make things coming from the second attention, go away.\n\nIf you learn to observe him in action, you'll see that he also has control over a little \"sparkle\" in your eye. The same type of \"shine\" that gazing uses, to summon intent.\n\nMr. DoubleTake has his own \"shine\", and you can feel it, when your eyes jiggle at seeing something impossible.\n\nHe does that in all people, all the time. It's why no  one would believe Juan's pictures of his nightly activities.\n\nBy the way, it's really fun when you tell someone something you did, and they get angry and say it's \"impossible\".\n\nThat's what we need to happen at workshops, if we want to restore Carlos' reputation.\n\nThe whole, \"Oh, I felt so happy and alive, and energy was flowing between all of the workshop participants!  We thanked Cleargreen for putting us on the  path with heart!\", is not going to cut it.\n\nEvery phony energy oriented workshop does that.  All techniques, all methods.\n\nIt won't restore the reputation of Carlos.\n\nWhat we need is, \"A giant demon flew from the ground and attempted to bite my leg off!\"\n\nWe need stuff Mr. DoubleTake hates. That's what people are missing.  They have the strict dad who doesn't let them have any fun.\n\nThey want to hear of \"bad boy\" activities.\n\nBecause of Mr. DoubleTake, people are sort of trained that if you see something impossible it was a mistaken and will go away soon.\n\nThey carry that censorship with them in their minds, and if you try to explain magic they bring it out to explain why you're wrong.\n\nIf it goes away, it can't be real!  Right?\n\nThen they start claiming people hallucinate all the time, and it's no big deal to see dreams floating in the air, while your eyes are open.\n\nNo it isn't!  No one does that, unless they're practicing a technique similar to ours!\n\nDon't let people do that to you.  Just tell them, \"You're making up things in your mind, in order to accuse me of making things up, because you feel threatened by magic!\"\n\nThat seems to work a little.\n\nNow if you get super duper silent, meaning absolutely no words in the mind, and also you don't have a vague image of something which bothers you, lingering around, that's how you can \"find\" Mr. DoubleTake and get him to stop for a while.\n\nIt's too hard to do in daylight, but let's pretend you could.\n\nYou could slowly turn your head, looking at a table covered in junk, and not identify any object at all.\n\nIf you try that now, you'll be unable to ignore what the objects are.\n\nOr for that matter, look at a bottle of Ketchup, and not read the text. It's just lines, if it's anything at all.  Not writing.\n\nThat's Mr. DoubleTake on break.  You don't care at all what you're looking at.\n\nIt's before the time when \"a chair became a chair\", as don Juan explained.\n\nPre-usher???\n\nYou don't recognize anything, interpret anything, care about it, or judge it.\n\nThen all hell breaks loose.\n\nYou realize, it's possible to see anything, and anywhere, while anyplace.\n\nWe're stationary in space, remote viewing all that we perceive.\n\nAnything whatsoever can materialize in the air in front of you.\n\nAnd will.\n\nIf you sit there on the edge of doing that, meaning, you relax just right so that stuff starts to materialize, then you get a tiny jolt of energy and Mr. DoubleTake wakes back up for an instant, and the stuff goes away.\n\nIf you can manage to stay on that edge, you'll fully realize who Mr. DoubleTake is.\n\nHe's \"you\".\n\nAnd a bastard at that.\n\nI suppose he's the separate idea of \"self\"?\n\nMama's good boy or girl!\n\nBut if you try to analyze it that much, it gets kind of  Buddhisty.\n\nA sorcerer would probably be more inclined to just assume it's a being that lives inside, and that it's a foreign installation, and not really a part of your true self.\n\nBoth views are correct.\n\nIt is  you!\n\nBut it's a foreign installation.\n\nIt's also what prevents most of the Castaneda population from actually working enough to learn, instead of just talking about it.", "edited": 1596643672.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g0ghw4m", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I can&amp;#39;t think of a reason it would be bad, now that you mention it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t know what I had in mind.

It&amp;#39;s why no  one would believe Juan&amp;#39;s pictures of his nightly activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, it&amp;#39;s really fun when you tell someone something you did, and they get angry and say it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we need to happen at workshops, if we want to restore Carlos&amp;#39; reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole, &amp;quot;Oh, I felt so happy and alive, and energy was flowing between all of the workshop participants!  We thanked Cleargreen for putting us on the  path with heart!&amp;quot;, is not going to cut it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every phony energy oriented workshop does that.  All techniques, all methods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t restore the reputation of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we need is, &amp;quot;A giant demon flew from the ground and attempted to bite my leg off!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need stuff Mr. DoubleTake hates. That&amp;#39;s what people are missing.  They have the strict dad who doesn&amp;#39;t let them have any fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They want to hear of &amp;quot;bad boy&amp;quot; activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of Mr. DoubleTake, people are sort of trained that if you see something impossible it was a mistaken and will go away soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They carry that censorship with them in their minds, and if you try to explain magic they bring it out to explain why you&amp;#39;re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it goes away, it can&amp;#39;t be real!  Right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they start claiming people hallucinate all the time, and it&amp;#39;s no big deal to see dreams floating in the air, while your eyes are open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No it isn&amp;#39;t!  No one does that, unless they&amp;#39;re practicing a technique similar to ours!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let people do that to you.  Just tell them, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re making up things in your mind, in order to accuse me of making things up, because you feel threatened by magic!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That seems to work a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if you get super duper silent, meaning absolutely no words in the mind, and also you don&amp;#39;t have a vague image of something which bothers you, lingering around, that&amp;#39;s how you can &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; Mr. DoubleTake and get him to stop for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s too hard to do in daylight, but let&amp;#39;s pretend you could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could slowly turn your head, looking at a table covered in junk, and not identify any object at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you try that now, you&amp;#39;ll be unable to ignore what the objects are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or for that matter, look at a bottle of Ketchup, and not read the text. It&amp;#39;s just lines, if it&amp;#39;s anything at all.  Not writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s Mr. DoubleTake on break.  You don&amp;#39;t care at all what you&amp;#39;re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s before the time when &amp;quot;a chair became a chair&amp;quot;, as don Juan explained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pre-usher???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t recognize anything, interpret anything, care about it, or judge it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then all hell breaks loose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You realize, it&amp;#39;s possible to see anything, and anywhere, while anyplace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re stationary in space, remote viewing all that we perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything whatsoever can materialize in the air in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you sit there on the edge of doing that, meaning, you relax just right so that stuff starts to materialize, then you get a tiny jolt of energy and Mr. DoubleTake wakes back up for an instant, and the stuff goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can manage to stay on that edge, you&amp;#39;ll fully realize who Mr. DoubleTake is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a bastard at that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose he&amp;#39;s the separate idea of &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mama&amp;#39;s good boy or girl!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you try to analyze it that much, it gets kind of  Buddhisty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sorcerer would probably be more inclined to just assume it&amp;#39;s a being that lives inside, and that it&amp;#39;s a foreign installation, and not really a part of your true self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both views are correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is  you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a foreign installation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also what prevents most of the Castaneda population from actually working enough to learn, instead of just talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

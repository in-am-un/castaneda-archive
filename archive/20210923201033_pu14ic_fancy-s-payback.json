But the day after she pushed me through the floor and I had to suffer in pain down there, I realized my ears were stopped up.\n\nThe secretary at work was sneezing and coughing.\n\nI had another cold.\n\nCarlos warned us about this.  He said that the inorganic beings find a weakness, and \"pull on it\".\n\nLike unraveling a sweater.\n\nIn his case, the cancer was what they were pulling on, and he had to dodge them in their world all night long.\n\nMy guess: They pull your assemblage point sideways into a new view of the world, at your current position of the assemblage point.\n\nI have some question about the left side and right side awareness.  Carlos never mapped those onto the J curve.\n\nKylie made it seem like if you grab to the left with your tensegrity move, you're grabbing left side awareness.  And if you grab to the right, you grabbed right side awareness.\n\nSo I suppose, the J curve goes down the middle between the two?\n\nCertainly from the Cheese ball diagram Carlos drew, the band of man is as close to the middle of the egg as you could draw with a pencil.\n\nSo I'm going to assume, if you have an illness it makes it possible for the inorganic beings to lure your assemblage point towards the right, and \"pull on it\" further.\n\nBecause that's exactly what happens in a \"feverish vision\" you get while ill.  You go off into a purely physical place.\n\nOver and over the horizontally shifted feverish vision repeats, while you are half asleep, half awake.\n\nSo maybe Fancy just \"couldn't resist\".\n\nEither way, she made up for it last night.\n\nI haven't been that far on the J curve, since Cholita had to pull me up from the bottom.\n\nFancy's shapeshifting lessons likely got me stuck down there, so it's nice to see she'll still help out on the \"other side\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fancy's Payback",

to be more real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, he&amp;#39;s just pushing the glow of his awareness that direction, by &amp;quot;noticing it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then show how the internal dialogue returns, and very quickly his memory of past grievances sucks that glow in the dark sea back up to the original limited range, which is the blue line river of shit on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I get carried away, but maybe it ought to zoom up to where he&amp;#39;s just a tiny little man hopeless lost and drowning in the river of shit, and maybe he could shout, &amp;quot;Stella!!!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYA9hvcLekg\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYA9hvcLekg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Superman&amp;#39;s dad did that in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_yo3ak5", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yo3ak5/shapeshifting_and_movement_of_ap_across_redzone/ivyg3qh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668180538.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1668180538.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ivwed00", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668134020.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ivq4tpz", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yo3ak5/shapeshifting_and_movement_of_ap_across_redzone/ivwed00/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_ivwed00", "created": 1668134020.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ivq4tpz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ivq1t04", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "We're going to solve that issue of having to find stuff, with animations.\n\nIt's possible to make animations into a \"phantom city\" the way the death defier made Tula.\n\nIt's never been done before, but that's only because the technology didn't exist.\n\nMy theory is, you can't movitate people to dig through lots of written material.\n\nBut if stuff is available on streaming media,and you can just watch one after the other in bed, the way you can with old sherlock Holmes movies on Youtube (they find the next one for you automatically), we might give people a chance to learn about sorcery without having to \"give up their lifestyle\".\n\nThat's why, Carlos said, no one learned sorcery in all the time he was alive.\n\nMaybe we can make it so that you DON'T have to give up your lifestyle?\n\nAt least, not before you learn to stage convincing insurance fraud accidents.\n\nMake it more profitable to learn magic.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ivq4tpz", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re going to solve that issue of having to find stuff, with animations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to make animations into a &amp;quot;phantom city&amp;quot;

There's one about shapeshifting, I'm sure of it.\n\nI'm not sure I made a picture though.\n\nYou can certainly do exactly what is described in the books.  For real.\n\nI have fully.\n\nOthers have with individual body parts, like your hands and arms.\n\nDarkroom does it!  Just need to move to the red zone on the J curve.\n\nBut keep in mind, shapeshifting is a deep horizontal shift, so you get \"dopey\".\n\nIt's not a left shift. Whereever you read that, stay away from. It's a pretender trying to make excuses for not having any magic, because \"you shouldn't do that\".\n\nIt's sickening...  Usually that means he wants you to accept his pretending. The way Buddhists tell you superpowers are too dangerous for beginners to learn about.\n\nBecause in fact, they have no magical abilities at all. So they have to come up with a good excuse.\n\nLeft shift is towards insect forms. And thus Carol Tiggs can turn into a fly.\n\nMidrange is stuff like crows.\n\nTo the far right, beasts.\n\nThe J curve diagram reflects that a little. Given to us by Carlos in person, along with an explanation as he moved his finger, of what kinds of forms you could shapeshift to.\n\nWhen you should be thinking, \"Holy Shit!!!\",  it just seems normal. You might not even notice, until you do something normally \"impossible\", by using your new form.\n\nYou can also \"make a construct\" such as a visible, solid dirt road, running down the middle of the room while you are fully awake, with your eyes open, and totally sober.\n\nAnd your ally can show you \"where to dig\" in the very long road, to turn into that particular creature.\n\nIn fact I did make a picture for that somewhere.\n\nYou can do very real, very physical things such as lift a car with one hand as I once did.\n\nNot in dreaming.  Fully awake, eyes open, after walking outside and cursing Cholita for leaving sharp little rocks for me to step on in my path. She does stuff like that. Not to mention, watering just one spot on the lawn 24 hours a day, to act as a spell. Making me walk through that when it's cold.\n\nAs for changing individual elements of your appearance, yes you can do that too.\n\nBut it takes someone like a death defier level sorcerer to pull that off.  That's 8000 years of practice there!\n\nAnd it's not worth learning.  To learn to do that yourself, you'd have to give up 1000 other things that are freely offered to you, as you practice darkroom.\n\nYou'd be like a little kid who becomes obsessed with the shooting gallery at Disneyland, to the point that he's never actually been on any other rides.\n\nAnd he's motivated by bragging to his friends, or the occasional visit from one to the park, who he can lure to come over and see his amazing shooting skills.\n\nAnd there's something even worse in trying to learn what you propose.\n\nWorse than it representing an obsession with getting attention from other humans.\n\nIt's a \"dirty link to intent\".\n\nSorcery requires an absolutely silent internal dialogue, because any thought you have pushes you back to the start of the J curve, where no magic is possible.\n\nEven just thinking that when you are done practicing tonight, those del Taco \"Fiesta Packs\" are on sale today.\n\nHow could that not pull you back to \"Fiesta Land\"?  It's your awareness visualizing this realm.\n\nThat's stronger than any \"intent\" you could come up with, to change your eye color to blue.\n\nAnd the very act of wishing to change your eye color is tainted with \"show biz\" thoughts.\n\nYou can't think, \"blue eyes\" all by itself.\n\nYou'll be thinking, \"Man, if I could change to blue eyes, imagine how many potential sexual partners I could get.  Imagine the shock on my Mom's face when I show up with blue eyes.  I'll be able to say, 'Up yours mom!!!  You said this sorcery stuff was nonsense!!!'\"\n\nUnfortunately, when you are stuck up at the blue line, you like to pretend what's going on and gloss over things you are doing, pretending you are not.\n\nOr pretend that you're \"tough\".  And fighting with some petty tyrant at work, won't spoil your practice tonight.\n\nWhen in fact, we're all petty monsters and the slightest insult during the day sends our minds into turmoil.\n\nIt takes a lot of darkroom to learn the truth about ourselves.\n\nWe're out of control!\n\nYou ought to seek the control first, then change eye color later.\n\nYou can even \"jump grooves\" if you get silent.\n\nYou'll literally notice a  tunnel in your room.  And know you can walk into it.\n\nOr you'll just materialize inside the tunnel, without having done anything.\n\nI once materialized into a tunnel, while sitting on the steps of On 8 hotel in Bangkok.\n\nAn orange cat who guards against rats entering the hotel, decided to impress me and leaped up 3 stories high across the walkway. One floor at a time of course.\n\nThat was enough to make me dissolve and enter a second attention tunnel.\n\nAlong the tunnel were pictures of the past Naguals in our lineage.\n\nWith a voice explaining them.\n\nKeep in mind, I was fully awake, just had breakfast, and wasn't actually practicing any sorcery at the time.\n\nBut what I didn't realize about the tunnel was, it wasn't just \"past Naguals\" of our lineage.\n\nIt was past anything.  And current anything.\n\nIt was silent knowledge.\n\nI could have found a \"groove\" in the wall for any permutation of reality I could imagine.\n\nAnd stepped into that one, transforming to that reality in the real world.\n\nCarlos called it \"Jumping grooves\", and he had high hopes to escape his liver cancer by doing that.\n\nIf only his workshop crowd wasn't always draining his energy with their endless needs.\n\nHe told us so.  If we could just rise our energy up from our toes, until things started to \"move\"  and we all gained \"energetic mass\", then he could jump grooves and avoid death.\n\nBut all we did was whine and complain, and drain him dry.\n\nHe even ended up with stalkers going through his trash.\n\nBy the way, that guy is going to get it big time, in the cartoons.\n\nI'm going to use him as an example of how horrible people pretending to be interested in learning sorcery can be. All the bad habits and obscene activities they do, will be portrayed by him.\n\nI'll call him \"Shaman Bob\" just to avoid liability.\n\nI thought up an episode for him just this morning.\n\nWesterly Witch and Shaman Bob go golfing.\n\nMinx the squirrel ally of Westerly witch pushes Bob's golf ball into the hole, when actually it landed still on the fringe, not even on the putting green near the hole.\n\nBut on seeing he got a hole in one Bob declares himself a \"master of golf\", and gets his own golf jersey so everyone knows he's \"mastered the game\".\n\nThen sells \"sorcery golf lessons\".\n\nBecause he made a single hole in one (which he didn't actually do, even if that made any difference to golfing ability).\n\nIt's what bad players do.  Assume a single magical experience is of much importance at all when learning sorcery.\n\nBecause in fact, it's show biz they're interested in.", "edited": 1667834532.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ivf4050", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, all you need to know is in past posts!

And the one we came from is long gone.\n\nBut I suppose we can give her that one.\n\nBack in private classes it was pretty well believed that La Gorda visited \"El Norte\" once in a while, and ended up in Malibu overlooking the beach.  Maybe some hiking up in those Santa Monica mountains.\n\nI don't know if it was true, but it seems that some of the weirder things Carlos told us or wrote about turned out to be truthful.\n\nAnd La Gorda isn't as hard to believe as the Blue Scout.\n\nBut I'm definitely not 100% confident La Gorda was a good source of knowledge. There's still that thing about how Carlos was going to prepare some smoking mixture, she knew where the pipe was, and someday they'd get a \"boost\".\n\nFor what, I can't imagine.  Maybe they could open a competing angry subreddit after that shroom boost!\n\nSo here's some info on \"**layers**\".  But it's from Maria Elena. Keep that in mind.  And notice the dubious things she claims, such as sorcerers never die.\n\nAnd that don Juan taught them dreaming to \"tighten their layers\".\n\nAt the point in the storyline she said that, she didn't have her full memory of what she had been taught.  The HA stuff was still invisible to her.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAt that moment she had a sudden flutter in her body. She stared blankly past me, then she shook her head vigorously. She said that she had just seen that the Genaros were not coming after all. It was too early for them. They were going to wait for a while before they made their appearance. She smiled as if she were delighted with the delay.\n\n\"It's too early for us to have them here anyway,\" she said. \"And they feel the same way about us.\"\n\n\"Where are they now?\" I asked.\n\n\"They must be sitting beside the road somewhere,\" she replied. \"Benigno had no doubt gazed at the house as they were walking and saw us sitting here and that's why they have decided to wait. That's perfect. That will give us time.\"\n\n\"You scare me, Gorda. Time for what?\"\n\n\"You have to round up your second attention today, just for us four.\"\n\n\"How can I do that?\"\n\n\"I don't know. You are very mysterious to us. The Nagual has done scores of things to you with his power plants, but you can't claim that as knowledge. That is what I've been trying to tell you. Only if you have mastery over your second attention can you perform with it. Otherwise you'll always stay fixed halfway between the two as you are now.\n\nEverything that has happened to you since you arrived has been directed to force that attention to spin. I've been giving you instructions little by little, just as the Nagual told me to do. Since you took another path, you don't know the things that we know, just like we don't know anything about power plants. Soledad knows a bit more, because the Nagual took her to his homeland. Nestor knows about medicinal plants, but none of us has been taught the way you were. We don't need your knowledge yet. But someday when we are ready you are the one who will know what to do to give us a boost with power plants. I am the only one who knows where the Nagual's pipe is hidden, waiting for that day.\n\n\"The Nagual's command is that you have to change your path and go with us. That means that you have to do dreaming with us and stalking with the Genaros. You can't afford any longer to be where you are, on the awesome side of your second attention. Another jolt of your nagual coming out of you could kill you. The Nagual told me that human beings are frail creatures composed of many layers of luminosity. When you see them, they seem to have fibers, but those fibers are really **layers**, like an onion. Jolts of any kind separate those **layers** and can even cause human beings to die.\"\n\nShe stood up and led me back to the kitchen. We sat down facing each other. Lidia, Rosa and Josefina were busy in the yard. I could not see them but I could hear them talking and laughing.\n\n\"The Nagual said that we die because our **layers** become separated,\" la Gorda said. \"Jolts are always separating them but they get together again. Sometimes, though, the jolt is so great that the **layers** get loose and can't get back together anymore.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen the **layers**, Gorda?\"\n\n\"Sure. I saw a man dying in the street. The Nagual told me that you also found a man dying, but you didn't see his death. The Nagual made me see the dying man's **layers**. They were like the peels of an onion. When human beings are healthy they are like luminous eggs, but if they are injured they begin to peel, like an onion.\n\n\"The Nagual told me that your second attention was so strong sometimes that it pushed all the way out. He and Genaro had to hold your **layers** together otherwise you would've died. That's why he figured that you might have enough energy to get your nagual out of you twice. He meant that you could hold your **layers** together by yourself twice. You did it more times than that and now you are finished. You have no more energy to hold your **layers** together in case of another jolt.\n\n\"The Nagual has entrusted me to take care of everyone. In your case, I have to help you to tighten your **layers**. The Nagual said that death pushes the **layers** apart. He explained to me that the center of our luminosity, which is the attention of the nagual, is always pushing out, and that's what loosens the **layers**. So it's easy for death to come in between them and push them completely apart. Sorcerers have to do their best to keep their own **layers** closed. That's why the Nagual taught us dreaming. Dreaming tightens the **layers**.\n\n\"When sorcerers learn dreaming they tie together their two attentions and there is no more need for that center to push out.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that sorcerers do not die?\"\n\n\"That is right. Sorcerers do not die.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that none of us is going to die?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean us. We are nothing. We are freaks, neither here nor there. I meant sorcerers. The Nagual and Genaro are sorcerers. Their two attentions are so tightly together that perhaps they'll never die.\"\n\n\"Did the Nagual say that, Gorda?\"\n\n\"Yes. He and Genaro both told me that. Not too long before they left, the Nagual explained to us the power of attention. I never knew about the tonal and the nagual until then.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "La Gorda Says the Darndest Things", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"bw9rvz7frio71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad6cfc90c4318c2e7fe1c4d03de63d4fe836d13a"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3607de6bce5996395d66a0312d0e863987e36c36"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caaa8ee38358d9d65aa15a95d7ec217a282d7522"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b72f92fc515e50e3c1d0f3ac77394be77e37ff6a"}, {"y": 639, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5832d728f282b0abaae8cb0e2155f7821106729c"}, {"y": 719, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdd2128ef5950a9d88e0de6b8dd3943d3bf7ed23"}], "s": {"y": 866, "x": 1300, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=1300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55e53756d9874654d9f14a64000e47bff1aa3fc1"}, "id": "bw9rvz7frio71"}}, "name": "t3_prfw9v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TP0Xp_GZng2YSlKzzrwqMv0m6IstYB1vD4A6nfD-cLw.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1632083592.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=1300&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55e53756d9874654d9f14a64000e47bff1aa3fc1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bw9rvz7frio71.jpg?width=1300&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55e53756d9874654d9f14a64000e47bff1aa3fc1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you forget that we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;pieces of the sun&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda thought it was important to tell us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t  know why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re pieces of &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; sun&amp;quot;, but not, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; sun&amp;quot;.

She purched on it, like she used to months ago.\n\nShe's been just a vague head for a while, since I started playing with Lily.\n\nI got some kind of lecture from her on sharing energy, which was more of a reprimand than anything I could learn from.  She seemed to be telling me to save some energy for her.\n\nBut I got to the whitish light using her long form, and then instead of remote viewing with it, I was examining the layers behind the whitish light.\n\nWhich I usually see as a textured surface.\n\nI realized it was remarkably easy to break the whitish light down into other things.\n\nShimmers and layers perhaps?  Little \"spots\" that weren't round, perhaps a fraction of an inch in diameter, and flat.  And all layered on top of each other.\n\nI'd never noticed that before!\n\nThen, Fancy shoved me sideways and I fell down a crack.\n\nI can even estimate how far I fell!  Had to be at least 14 feet, below the floor.\n\nSimilar to what Carol Tiggs had done for me, pushing me through the floor into the inorganic beings tunnel.\n\nA very odd situation.  I was trying to climb my way out, with a voice nearby trying to help me.\n\nBut I got confused, and thought I was explaining the process to another person, and the process consisted of counting 9 puffs of grey, with one lively purple puff at the top, to pull you up.\n\nThe counting part should have clued me in.

She seemed to be telling me to save some energy for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I got to the whitish light using her long form, and then instead of remote viewing with it, I was examining the layers behind the whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I usually see as a textured surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized it was remarkably easy to break the whitish light down into other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shimmers and layers perhaps?

I just can't afford the time to draw these very accurately, but you'll get the idea.\n\nMuscle memory produces \"echoes\" of limb movements, when you gaze at the tensegrity in perfect darkness, and in perfect silence. The longer you can remove all traces of your internal dialogue, the clearer they will become. Until they actually produce perfect phantom copies of your limbs, once your assemblage point is in alignment with that of your energy body.\n\nBefore then however, you can pick up the \"waved arm echo\". It's black with dull grey outlines, and follows your arm waving at a moderate speed in the air. By around 1-4 inches distance.\n\nHowever, in full on silent knowledge, that ghost echo arm can turn very real, and actually help you do the Tensegrity movements.\n\nIt's perhaps \"Pablito's 3rd arm\" which he used to attack Carlos.\n\nWho knows?\n\nBut you can certainly learn to look down in perfect silence while you do tensegrity moves such as \"mashing energy for intent\" and notice the foot echoes. That will allow you to focus your awareness on the muscle memory movements themselves, and judge if they increase your internal dialogue. If they do, you have to force harder to shut if back off, and in doing so you manipulate the muscle memory to learn to help you out with deeper silence.\n\nManipulating crusted energy is something Carlos himself told us about from the very start, and it's easy to see the effects of it if you just keep in mind, any sort of stretching, especially involving your back, \"uncrusts\" a cloud of energy body small thin puffs, and those will play \"videos in the air\" for you.\n\nBut since they are not individually sentient due to small size, they play a single dream all around you, each puff being a \"piece\" of an alien world. Into which you can walk, in your physical body. For real!!!!\n\nI left out don Juan doing his catlike stretching. That surely uncrusts energy too.\n\nI'll asked ChatGPT to draw that, telling him I wanted an old Yaqui Indian Sorcerer dressed as a Mexican peasant (to avoid the full \"shaman headdress\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9baf7ie0e5lc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c79aa37208f0b1d161d8f09b4d70c80beac01919\n\nBut instead I got an old Indian dressed like Clint Eastwood wearing a Jedi robe. I should have asked for him to have a 6 shooter on an ammo belt.\n\nSo I tried that. No guns allowed. I tried to trick him by saying a \"Jedi Ray Gun\", but no guns are allowed.\n\nSo I tried \"light saber\", but that's a weapon, so goody two shoes ChatGPT can't draw it.\n\nFinally I just told him to give the Yaqui Sorcerer a submarine sandwich in a holster.\n\nHere's what I got.  All love and kittens.  That's the high tech companies;  love and kindness.

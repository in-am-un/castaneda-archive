[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "In Zuleica\u2019s explanation of how to bring the energy body closer to you, from the Eagle\u2019s Gift, Carlos wrote that:\n\n\u201cZuleica turned to me and, in a parrotlike voice, asked me if it was true that I had never seen a vagina\u2026 I answered accordingly, and Zuleica said that she felt sorry for me. Then she ordered Zoila to show me her vagina. Zoila lay down on her back under the light bulb and opened her legs.\u201d\n\nOops. Wrong quote.  But it does seem to illustrate that we were warned.  Maybe Carlos\u2019 \u201cscandalous\u201d behavior was normal for a sorcery group.  I sure hope not. I kind of liked the celibacy thing better. It\u2019s less trouble in the long run.  But those of you having trouble with celibacy should keep that in mind. It is \"ok\" to view a vagina.\n\nWhat Zuleica really explained to Carlos was:\n\n\u201cI disregarded Zuleica's order to enter into a patch of coloration that was forming right at my eye level, and gave myself fully to the exploration of that strange sensation outside me. Zuleica must have seen what I was going through; she suddenly began to explain that the second attention belongs to the luminous body, as the first attention belongs to the physical body. The point where, she said, the second attention assembles itself was situated right where Juan Tuma had described it the first time we met - approximately one and one-half feet in front of the midpoint between the stomach and the belly button and four inches to the right.\u201d\n\nThat reminded me of Carlos\u2019 trying to familiarize us in classes, with the feelings you might detect when you were getting closer to feeling the energy body. Those were tied to the tensegrity he was teaching at the time, and I suspect it was similar to the pass to build the frame of the energy body.\n\nWe\u2019ll never be able to recover exactly what he said on the day I was remembering, until some former class members get supremely good at recapitulation.  I\u2019m not there yet.  But someday it might be easier to explain Carlos\u2019 lectures in more detail.  Some of you might even be able to tap into them yourself, using the clues in my reporting.  It doesn\u2019t seem to matter if you were actually there, when it comes to recovering past events.  We might even be able to watch don Juan teaching Carlos.\n\nWhat I do remember was that Carlos said that energy in general could be felt as a ticklish sensation, since feeling was also part of seeing.   He wanted us to get some idea of how it might feel, so he instructed us to find an ant trail, take off our clothes, and lie down in the path of the ants.   Let them crawl all over your skin.\n\nOne of the women closer to the inner group gave me a concerned look after that.  I got the distinct impression that Carlos had first introduced that technique to one of the new young women close to the inner circle.  That gave me a little doubt about what the technique would actually accomplish.  Certainly the technique would be a lot more fun if you had a naked woman to demo it with.\n\nAnd also, I grew up in Riverside County, a place Carlos was also fond of. He visited there often in the process of looking for sorcerers, and likely hiked around the mountains there.   If you haven\u2019t seen them, think of a Clint Eastwood movie.  They look like that.  Some Star Trek episodes were even filmed in similar mountains above Los Angeles, and people from Carlos\u2019 classes liked to hike there and practice his techniques. There was even a rumor that la Gorda had run around those mountains with Carlos.  Presumably the two sat together in the \"Sorcerer's Cave\" in Malibu.  I also vaguely remember some women from Carlos' classes, doing a technique up there, which I showed a little disdain for.  One of them commented, \"Taisha taught it to us!\"\n\nThose mountain ranges have a unique look, and they also have giant purple ants in ranges of Riverside County. Some are longer than 1 inch. And they\u2019re very angry.  Wide rivers of them flood the mountains in search of food or water.  They actually create their  own sandy trials, which can be several feet wide. If you lay down in such a stream, you might not get up.\n\nBut fortunately, the Argentinians have come to our rescue.  I never thought much about Argentina back then, except that Carlos had a group of students from Argentina, and he treated them like celebrated guests whenever they could come to the USA.  They were brought up to the front of the class for him to show off, and he wove them into his lecture, which always included a bit of teasing.   The men were teased for their height, the women for their shoes, and both of them for their great posture.  I got the impression that in the social pecking order of South America, Argentinians were higher than Peruvians. Certainly they were much taller.\n\nBecause of that, when I first heard that the tiny ants constantly invading our homes in Southern California were actually from Argentina, I took notice.  Carlos joked about how tall the Argentinian men were, but ants from Argentina are not only small, I\u2019ve even heard computer nerds call the younger ones, \u201cMicro-ants\u201d. They\u2019re so small, they can walk on your keyboard and you won\u2019t even notice them unless you get your eyes real close.  Presumably they like \u201ckeyboard crumbs\u201d.\n\nAn odd thing happened a day or two after Carlos instructed us to lie in an ant trail.  I found a trail of micro-ants going through my bathroom. I took his advice.  I felt their tiny legs crawling on my skin, and it was indeed a somewhat unique feeling.  They crawled on my legs, feet, and even on my stomach.  The worst part was, the bathroom tile floor was pretty cold.  Or maybe it was that my head was next to the dubiously cleaned floor tiles under the toilet.\n\nOtherwise, I didn\u2019t believe I\u2019d gotten much out of it. I intellectually understood. A tingly sensation. Yea. I\u2019ll remember that.\n\nI didn\u2019t fully appreciate the technique until 20 years later, when I was walking in Beijing near the Forbidden City.  I\u2019d fallen into heightened awareness earlier in the trip.  Our Singaporean Daoist guide was getting a little tired from all the walking, and the younger man accompanying us suggested that we should rest there.  Our Singaporean guide was deathly afraid of having a stroke, and it was for that reason he became a Daoist, on a strict diet with no stimulating ingredients.  His diet was almost as strict as the one Carlos imposed on us for a few months.\n\nI looked around where we had stopped. There had to be at least 10,000 people walking through the path ahead of us. It was a foot traffic underpass.  On a given day, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if 100,000 people walked there on the way to the forbidden city.  Maybe even more.\n\nI walked towards the underpass to get a closer look at the people emerging.   They seemed to be nearly uniformly Chinese. As I got to the densest part, I felt the tingling of ants crawling on my feet and ankles.\n\nIt was the very same sensation Carlos had told us to feel, by using the ants.  I couldn\u2019t believe it!  I scooped my hands down close to the concrete, and I felt the tingling with them also.  That made me think of a Tensegrity move where you scoop something near the ground, and pour it over your head. I tried it, and it worked.  I could feel it in detail.\n\nI remembered a conversation Carlos had with us, where he explained that as the luminous body walks along, some of its energy fluffs off and gets stuck to the ground. Or is discarded there,  like dusty fibers falling off of us.  The fliers like to feast on that kind of loose energy, licking it up with a big wet tongue and a sloppy sucking sound that Carlos would make, to emphasize how horrible it was to let it go on.\n\nAll I could figure out about that was, maybe when there\u2019s so many people walking by a specific area, there\u2019s enough buildup to feel it.  Especially if you\u2019re closer to the second attention than normal, such as from heightened awareness.\n\nLast night I tried Zuleica\u2019s technique again, to see if I could prove there was a tingly sensation associated with that area in front of the stomach, and to the right.  At first, I could feel only a few strands, as if a hair on my arm had felt a weak breeze.   But as I moved my arm around, I found that it corresponded to specific locations in that area and it even seemed to have a flat curved shape.  Only my right arm could feel it.  I tried with the left arm, and there was no tingling. Also, after a while of waving my arm there to feel it, it \u201cwore out\u201d.  I had to stop for a bit, and visualize being immersed in the color I\u2019d chosen to see in the darkness.\n\nAfter some time of watching the colors and feeling immersed by them, the tingling sensation was renewed. Except that, the color surrounding me seemed to have moved in a little closer, or gotten a little brighter, and there was a luminous shell associated with it. It was moving closer each time I felt for the tingling sensation.  The luminous shell was like Carlos\u2019 \u201cwall\u201d technique, except that it had some strong details on it, like weird structures stuck on the edges, and it was strongly curved.  Perhaps Carlos' \"wall\" technique is a technique for viewing the periphery of the luminous shell. He always said we needed to \"redeploy\" energy from there, and get it closer to the center.\n\nI\u2019d have to say, Carlos was telling the truth about the ant technique, regardless of who he demonstrated it on first, and under what circumstances.  Give it a try.\n\nEdited: to include more memories.

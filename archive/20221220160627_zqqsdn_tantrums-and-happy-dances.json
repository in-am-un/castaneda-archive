So I wouldn't lose it.\n\nBut I restrained myself, hoping to see more.\n\nAnd I did!  A hole in reality opened up.  A \"flat blue one\" (???) and I traveled inside looking for witches.\n\nThen this morning, it's all gone.  All of it.\n\nExcept possibly, I need to buy some flat blue pillow cases with zippers instead of an open end.\n\nDon't ask.  I don't understand it myself anymore.\n\nSo here's a tribute to the running man series, from facebook.  Wish I had the rest of what I *saw*.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nNot-Doing Tensegrity Passes\n\nThe Running Man series was introduced when it was known that Carlos was dying and nothing could prevent it. His only chance to survive had been to \"jump grooves\". A thing you will get to see yourself, if you work hard and sustain that action.\n\nYou find yourself in a tunnel with grooves along the inside. You can gaze into any groove, and see another option in our multi-verse.\n\nAnother timeline you can change over to. Perhaps one where you are not ill at all. For that to happen, Carlos needed energetic mass from his FAR TOO MANY students. And he never got it, so he died.\n\nOur stupidity killed him.\n\nI'd like to point out, he outlived the life expectancy for a man born in Peru when Carlos was, by around 30 years! Go look it up. He didn't die early at all. In fact, right around the time he started getting ill often enough for La Gorda to call him, \"The Nagual who got sick\", he was already at the end of the average Peruvian man's life span for his birth year.\n\nAlthough it's certainly true that he just couldn't compete with that old witch Soledad, who likely lived beyond 110.  And perhaps Julian also did.\n\nSo we were \"disappointed\".  Always in a fantasy world, sorcery students are!  Everything is just pretending, so they pretend everyone has to be superman.\n\nIf you want a wake up call, go watch Chinese \"Kung Fu\" masters like the one in this picture, get their butts kicked in 30 seconds against an average MMA fighter.  Doesn't matter how famous or how beloved by the entire nation of China!\n\n30 seconds later and they're unconscious on the matt.  Making excuses the next day about  how no one would give them enough rice.\n\nDon't be like that.  This isn't pretend!!!  \n\nSay that over and over until you get it. It's REAL.\n\nWhich means, it's often disappointing.  Which only means, more work is needed.\n\nTowards the end Carlos introduced some passes which can be done laying down, or sitting. Naturally his groupie private class people gossiped that he was too sick to stand anymore.\n\nThey were looking for someone to blame, after Carlos was gone and they gave up.\n\nBut in fact, the passes he called \"not-doings\" were among the most powerful we ever got. They were designed to \"fix\" what he had determined was the cause of our inability to build energetic mass.\n\nOur \"selves\".\n\nOnce you can bypass the \"self\", endless worlds become available to you.\n\nFirst, just as videos playing on your practice room walls. Or in the air, on a puff of your energy body.\n\nBut as with anything in sorcery, seeing is a lot easier than entering. You may see a doorway to an alien jungle filled with magical ruins and ancient buildings, but can you walk into there? Break the laws of physics and pass through the solid walls of your practice room?\n\nWell... Sometimes you can!\n\nBut usually you can't. For that you need \"energy\".\n\nSuch as Carol Tigg's energy that allowed some to travel to the inorganic being's entry tunnels, just because she pushed their shoulders backwards. The energy of double beings was what fueled the lineages.\n\nBut as with fossil fuels, we might want to give that up eventually.\n\nIn our case, you have to use your OWN energy. The path is less exciting without don Genaro around to make fart jokes, or don Juan to leap across the trees for your amusement.\n\nBut it's still available. And if you \"do it yourself\", you may unexpectedly become a type of new breed of seer. Ones ultimately more powerful than either the old seers, or the new seers. Seers who saw every inch of the path, because they had to crawl in the dust and mud the entire way.\n\nAnd to get the energy you need, you have to reduce your needs. Give up attention seeking, greed, and even reprogram your very muscles, to save energy.\n\nRunning man can do that.\n\nIt's why Running Man series is technically a dot-doing. Perhaps not a \"Tensegrity Pass\" at all.\n\nIt's paired with \"The Wrestler\" not-doing. From that very old Olmec clay figurine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tantrums and Happy Dances", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"5f8jmlv1j27a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5f8jmlv1j27a1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e4013c314481257a0e13af4dcd62ffe6d067151"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5f8jmlv1j27a1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97b9a8ba12a183a36898152ff3483894dbd2ee83"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5f8jmlv1j27a1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2a15452e16e877d0e2c41217355599c26b36584"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5f8jmlv1j27a1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5877ede4f23f50320762143010dd3daa0aaaf95d"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5f8jmlv1j27a1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec741cc82b67309193f5b26d291f849498964828"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5f8jmlv1j27a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65ace9a9f3bde82c130a9c9a961e29257d87bca4"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5f8jmlv1j27a1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a4e4bb9a34461df41ba7328374c3eeb4ec1961f"}, "id": "5f8jmlv1j27a1"}}, "name": "t3_zqqsdn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/U4RmvRCJgcjHmmy9k5Y9IvqDWH-OIEYnC7ij3NJ30GU.jpg", "edited": 1671551524.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1671548787.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5f8jmlv1j27a1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9a4e4bb9a34461df41ba7328374c3eeb4ec1961f\"&gt;There&amp;#39;s that horrible YouTube kungfu flim flam man again!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night while doing running man series, I &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; something so astonishing I almost jumped up and ran for my computer, to type it into a post.

Plus, the dark room is shared with another fool and, therefore the fool is quite limited in the practices that may be performed without awakening the other. Since becoming involved with the second witch the fool practices gazing while laying and the first four passes of the running man series, along with occasional recap, and just letting go to see what happens.\n\nThe great thing about that consistency is that it is quite easy to notice when something new from outside the dark room does anything different in the dark room.\n\nIn addition, the fool performs only the first four passes of the running man series and does so with no conscious effort. The task is instead assigned to the fool's body and it (the hyper-intelligent muscle memory all fools have) is allowed to do all the work.\n\nAs the fool practiced that Tensegrity almost exclusively and with daily consistency the fool also became aware of rather strange sensations like light pressures, or tickling of an insect crawling or cobwebs in my lower extremities when not performing those passes.\n\nInitially, these sensations only went as high as the top of the fool's foot, but as the fool was having lots of interactions with witches and intentionally staying as silent as possible all the time, the sensation rose to about midcalf.\n\nWhen the fool made his debut, those sensations immediately jumped to two inches above the patella.\n\nThe fool also noticed a change in the sensations - inner warmth exactly as Carlos described feeling when he focused his attention on his exact middle and which the fool has personally corroborated hundreds of time over the last 20 years, but only from focus on the fool's exactly middle until recently.\n\nAs the fool started swinging wildly in the rafters from conversation to conversation and committed to always trusting other's personal power, his own personal power, thanking those that taught the fool, and saying goodbye as though forever to end each interaction, that sensation of heat in the body raised into the fools torso, the shoulders, then ears then face.l over the course of days.\n\nThe fool has received the suggestion from infinity that what the fool is feeling is the fool's energy level, but the fool simply can't believe that his energy rose that much in such a short time and the fool has no rational basis for this understanding, so the fool simply notices without judgement - leaving the weighty responsibilities of judgement and concern to other fools who remain tricked by their own foolish truck of parading around naked with a heavy, heavy crown of feces.\n\nThis fool simply prefers wondering at the mystery, and joyfully delighting in it.\n\nThe fool also started experiencing numerous strange sights all day long when interacting with these sweet witches, including a persistent spinning energy formation in the top right of the fools peripheral vision.\n\n\"But you fool - how the shit did you exchange energy?\"\n\nTo put it in a nutshell: exchanging energy only ever requires sharing emotionally charged experiences and intent. This is universal, regardless of the varieties of awareness involved.\n\nIn these cases, the fool intended to share with them specifically to help us both be free, but usually we do awful things with our energy and the intent we share with those around us, such as wishing harm, greed, attention-seeking, jealousy, and all manner of vendetta-level shit from the river of shit.\n\nHere's the fun bit, the fool has never met three of these witches in person, and the one the fool has been around in person as friends hasn't been seen in the flesh in 20+ years!!\n\nTwo of the witches this fool has never met in person are located on different continents from the fool and the other two are local by comparison, but still quite far as the car drives.\n\nThe fool has to mention that this corroborates that space-time is relevant only in shit river, otherwise how would alien IOBs located in the center of the universe exchange energy with the seers, our direct predecessors, or how else would the fool exchange energy with these witches?\n\nSo how did the fool accidentally come to this point?\n\nDan mentioned that intending for others is a cleaner link to intent and this fool decided that was what he wanted to do ... the only thing the fool wanted, despite knowing it was impossible for a mess like \"me\" to command intent.\n\nThe fool didn't even believe any of it happened many times, but then the fool remembered or reread the messages and recalled the phone calls with these witches and what Dan and other sorcerers have said.\n\nPlus, the fool always tests the effects of any inner-silence activities done outside the dark room by following them with dark room.\n\nThankfully this means the fool has tricked himself into having no choice but to accept these gifts graciously and give of himself fully.\n\nSince these gifts are not his to keep, he now shares with you.\n\nIt is a delight to fool and invite!\n\nI trust each and every one of you has the personal power to master intent and achieve perceptual freedom.\n\nThank you so much for teaching me, each and every person I get to meet!!\n\nGoodbye!!\n\nP.S.

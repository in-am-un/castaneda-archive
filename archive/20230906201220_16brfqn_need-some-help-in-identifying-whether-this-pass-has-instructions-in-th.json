Nyei was taught all sorts of things, being around Carlos so much. I can't say with any authority she isn't capable of making a \"tree magical pass\" from what she heard from Carlos. And she does properly have that class where she teaches how to communicate with stars. I do that all the time, except that I literally bring down a puff, and there it is on my floor. Even moving around the room, just like in that video. So you can in fact learn to communicate with stars, which is also a topic Carlos discussed in classes I never attended. Night classes or lectures at Pandora. Wolf guyy can handle it, he's got plenty of social media attention. He's the one to feature on Facebook as making up magical passes. Might even cause him to divorce from whoever is having sex with him at Cleargreen. I presume that's what's going on, because obviously he has no sorcery knowledge at all, and yet he's become a male leader of sorts. Carlos worked very hard to try to find a male leader, but failed due to the egos of the men he sought to enlist.

If you do just 20 minutes once in a while, and spend the whole time thinking to yourself, you can go for 25 years with nothing happening, like the inner circle of Carlos has done. It's so bad there, I've been told they're making up new magical passes to get money. And not restoring the old ones as they should be doing. Because, they haven't seen any real magic due to laziness?

If they keep them to themselves, it's almost a \"not-doing\" and not actually wrong. But if they were teaching them, I'll have to call them out everywhere possible. Why can't they just take your list of 349+ passes, and learn to teach those again? Is it because you don't get any attention that way?

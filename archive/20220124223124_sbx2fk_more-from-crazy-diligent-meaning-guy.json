Ridding the world of stupid parasitic entities. Actual practical magic instead of your lame mental masturbation.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nParanoid schizophrenia, and being a male, delusions of grandure.\n\nAt least Cholita doesn't have those. And can actually do real magic.\n\nBut wait, it turns out he's started to try to cover his tracks, by deleting stuff.\n\nSo for the record (he can't delete this post), he came in here, obviously didn't bother to read much, and started posting make believe sorcery techniques.\n\nBut he seemed to be polite, so everyone felt sorry for him, and thought maybe \"he'll get better\".\n\nIn fact, he was much worse than he let on with his posts.\n\nHe's started messaging others too, to try to \"save face\" as the Chinese do.  This is what I know of that from group chat:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nYeah danl999 , that's the same worded message diligent meaning sent me\n\nmonkeyguy999 He just took what I told him in PM. A simple thing to try. Turned it all around and then told me he probably invented it as aknautun.  or whatever.\n\nTechnoMagical\\_Intent  And he's already started deleting his past posts, so there's no record.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI tried to find what an aknautun is, and found this:\n\nAkhenaten, also spelled Echnaton, Akhenaton, was an ancient  Egyptian pharaoh reigning c. 1353\u20131336 or 1351\u20131334 BC, the tenth ruler  of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Before the fifth year of his reign, he was  known as Amenhotep IV.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI'm thinking, this could be a native american guy I've run into before.   One of those loves to make new user ids. Has at least 4 I've run into.\n\nAnd they bring a buddy to give their posts a thumbs up.    We had one like that, with \"walker\" in his ID.\n\nBut who knows...  I don't see native Americans obsessing over Egyptians, when their magic is THOUSANDS of years older than the Egyptians.  That's a huge step down, to pretend middle eastern magic.  Native Americans have the real  thing.\n\nI tried to \"rescue\" some from the shamanism subreddit,  and upset the local \"experts\" who's claim to fame was being native American.  But there was no real magic in there.\n\nWhich is why I'm a bit paranoid about that topic of attacking Beringian descendants.\n\nThey liked to tell everyone Carlos was debunked.  So they were in the \"shamanism\" subreddit, harming the reputation of Carlos. I just couldn't ignore that.\n\nPerhaps that particular first huge attack from the shamanism subreddit,  was related to running crazy guy who originally displayed this level of paranoid schizophrenia using similar words.  Tried to take over this subreddit a year ago, and led to Techno having to start banning people more often than he liked.  He made his own sub, it's probably still around, with pictures of him on little videos \"teaching\".  And a \"donate\" button.  \n\nHe was a drug \"sorcerer\".  Had his own benefactor!!\n\n(**Stay away** from men who say that!)\n\nCrazy running guy's anger got picked up by stoopidengine guy (he was also banned).  That part is a fact for sure.\n\nAnd he got 4 other native americans to join in attacking here, by claiming we had racist slurs against native americans.\n\nTechno was afraid to boot them out, because it was Native American month. Until one started rapid posting to destroy the place.\n\nOr it could just, there's plenty of mentally ill people interested in Castaneda, and the sense of \"entitlement\" they feel is not due to being native American, but rather due to all the Castaneda and magic discussion outlets being obviously nonsense.  So they feel entitled to pretend, and not be criticized for it.\n\nMoral of the story.\n\nPlease don't feel sorry for people who are so eager to post.\n\nIt's a very bad sign.\n\nAnd please help out when something looks suspicious!\n\nDon't be like the people who blame the victim who stands up to a bully.\n\nAnd also, please notice, we don't exaggerate to say that magic is hated, and angry men will try to destroy any attempts to bring it back to the world.\n\nCarlos blamed it on a supernatural entity, \"the fliers\".\n\nFrom the Palisades star cluster.\n\nIf we make progress in here, they manipulate people to come attack.\n\n(yea, I don't buy it either, especially since diligent meaning guy believes in them, and thinks he can kill them).\n\nYou can toss Buddhists, Daoists, and maybe others into that hatred and desire to destroy real magic (because it makes them look bad.)\n\nHindus, probably not.\n\nThey have \"everything\" in that system, so nothing makes them feel bad.\n\nI heard a story about some Mormons who went to Indian to convert people, and after a few months of \"great success\", they realized all the converted Hindus were just being polite.\n\nAccepting Jesus, but they accept any invading entity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "More from Crazy Diligent Meaning guy", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inventory Warrior"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_sbx2fk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inventory Warrior", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1643061989.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643059884.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some more.

This path is very demanding, and requires giving up the cherished inventory and behavioral patterns we come to it with.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That personal work is brutal, and the fallout isn't conducive to the smooth operation of a public forum.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The most difficult thing to do is giving up the way you want to go about things, how you think it should be done. The beginning of the process is not the point for creativity, or impressing people. It's grunt-work.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When someone starts to learn the saxophone, those who become experts seldom try to invent a new way to learn the finger positions etc. You stick with what has worked for generations.

But it&amp;#39;s important to acknowledge that this consensual reality does exist and is shared by many dreamers- and thus to properly define &amp;#39;manifestation&amp;#39; you have to take into consideration the shared nature of reality.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If other people can&amp;#39;t perceive an object in physical life, it hasn&amp;#39;t been manifested.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PermalinkDeleteReportBlock UserMark UnreadReply  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[\u2013]from DiligentMeaning5649 sent 1 day ago  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t say it was.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PermalinkDeleteReportBlock UserMark UnreadReply  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[\u2013]to DiligentMeaning5649 sent 1 day ago  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my job is to prevent things from devolving into verbal fisticuffs. And I take that job seriously. This path is very demanding, and requires giving up the cherished inventory and behavioral patterns we come to it with.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That personal work is brutal, and the fallout isn&amp;#39;t conducive to the smooth operation of a public forum.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing to do is giving up the way you want to go about things, how you think it should be done. The beginning of the process is not the point for creativity, or impressing people. It&amp;#39;s grunt-work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When someone starts to learn the saxophone, those who become experts seldom try to invent a new way to learn the finger positions etc. You stick with what has worked for generations. The creativity comes later, and is built on those universal skills gleaned and passed-on by others.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Permalink  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[\u2013]to DiligentMeaning5649 sent 1 day ago  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to reinvent the wheel before you even have a cart or a crop to put in it, is foolhardy.

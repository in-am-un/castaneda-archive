I suppose the walking encourages that sort of dream, as opposed to what happens in the dark room.\n\nSo you \"walk right into a dream\".  Chances are it will be such a shock, you'll lose balance and be tossed back out.  And your book deal mind will take over, and you won't be able to go back and forth, the way you can in the dark room (occasionally).\n\nCarlos of course encouraged this.  Ralph, the movie guy, thought he had found a \"power spot\" in Santa Monica.  If he walked through that the second attention came out in some form.\n\nAn idea also backed up by Carlos, when Miles walked behind the beam at Pandora, and into the phantom copy of their house.  One of the witches had to bring him back out.\n\nHis double that is.  I'd be interested to hear if Miles was even aware of it.  It's the double that can do that, and the instant it separates, you have only seconds of connection back to the original.  And little chance of remembering much.\n\nI'm afraid we all had a very poor understanding of what the second attention was back then, so no one pursued this enough to turn it into a permanent practice.  It was a little like the meditator guy who suddenly sees the room with his eyes closed, and ignores it because he was told such visions should be ignored.\n\nWith all the people who have tried this, some a lot more than others, how come there's no magic in the community? I don't mean little sensations or such, but stuff right out of the books?  Like La Gorda and Carlos on the bridge level stuff.\n\nMy guess is that by not realizing you should pursue the flashier stuff, like full on sleep walking, all the effort required to do this combined with all the things that you might feel or perceive, kept anyone from shifting the assemblage point down very far. That's  the path it must take to get weird stuff to happen. And over time they learned to shift it down and sideways a bit, but nowhere near the red line on the J curve where reality starts to fall apart.\n\nAnd what happens near the green line, up just below the shoulder blades, can be closer to sensations or moods. Ask women about those moods, and how \"magical\" they can become, when it's a rough month.\n\nMany disciplines can manage to move it to that point, and unfortunately, the magic can still be dismissed or explained away.\n\nEven so, done honestly with absolute will to get rid of every single word for more than 2 minutes,  and you could produce dark room effects such as puffs of color.  Or women's heads peeking out from the darkness of the bushes.\n\nCarlos clued us in on the purple streak across the sky in his Silent Knowledge publication.  That was what he wanted us to look for.\n\nA clear sky can be a monotonous flat surface, which is very much like the darkroom.

Once you learn what silence feels like, gaze at the asphalt and follow the instructions of the post, the same way.

By seeming to be real (with a little squinting), those can bring out the second attention too.  They will \"turn into something\".\n\nI suspect Taisha wanted her sky gazing women to find the purple light show also, whether it be streaks or blobs.\n\nPuff or streak, if you see colors that \"aren't really there\", or even actual objects, those come from the second attention (sort of like the dreaming double's eyes).\n\nIf you continue your silence using the walking, those should get stronger and stronger until you see a whitish light on all surfaces. Even your hand!\n\nGazing at that is \"seeing energy\" on a horizon, and you can literally duplicate the cover from \"Wheel of Time\", where the Indian looking guy has several phases of the moon above him.\n\nOr you could \"read off the wall\" and see text appear, a gift from *intent*.\n\nJuan can do that now.\n\nHe can even assemble another world in front of him, just standing there in full sunlight.\n\nI get pulled into the abstract instead, which produces results you can't describe.  You find yourself drawn to stare at something you'd normally ignore, like the tops of the trees, and something up there keeps promising to reveal deep secrets, so you just keep watching it, contented.\n\nThe IOBs use that effect to steal energy.  They hook you to an abstract view so they can absorb the energy released.  I have a post on that in the illustrations wiki.\n\nAt some point you don't have to distract yourself with the traffic, because you can focus on the second attention special effects around you.\n\nFlood the eyes and ears to get silent, but once you do the second attention will come out, and you should focus on that too, and getting more of it.\n\nIt's important to get to that point, where the second attention comes out, to keep yourself \"honest\" so you don't shift the assemblage point sideways, and declare success because you feel different.\n\nIf you don't literally walk into another world and can stay there as long as you like, you haven't actually turned off the internal dialogue fully.  Or long enough.  Red line territory is 1.5 hours away using this technique.  Due to constant messing up and dropping the silence for a few minutes.\n\nYou've got to seek out visible magic, or you can end up like the Eastern Bloc where magic is considered \"evil\", and the books are now being ignored in favor of group consensus that the whole thing is just to make you into a better person (a \"warrior\").", "edited": 1615093957.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gq2fcgs", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only will that work, but you will literally walk into another world in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now before you misunderstand, internal silence lets the assemblage point move, and if it moves enough you are literally sleep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;other world&amp;quot; is pretty much a dream of another place.  I suppose the walking encourages that sort of dream, as opposed to what happens in the dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you &amp;quot;walk right into a dream&amp;quot;.  Chances are it will be such a shock, you&amp;#39;ll lose balance and be tossed back out.  And your book deal mind will take over, and you won&amp;#39;t be able to go back and forth, the way you can in the dark room (occasionally).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos of course encouraged this.  Ralph, the movie guy, thought he had found a &amp;quot;power spot&amp;quot; in Santa Monica.  If he walked through that the second attention came out in some form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An idea also backed up by Carlos, when Miles walked behind the beam at Pandora, and into the phantom copy of their house.  One of the witches had to bring him back out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His double that is.  I&amp;#39;d be interested to hear if Miles was even aware of it.  It&amp;#39;s the double that can do that, and the instant it separates, you have only seconds of connection back to the original.  And little chance of remembering much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid we all had a very poor understanding of what the second attention was back then, so no one pursued this enough to turn it into a permanent practice.  It was a little like the meditator guy who suddenly sees the room with his eyes closed, and ignores it because he was told such visions should be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all the people who have tried this, some a lot more than others, how come there&amp;#39;s no magic in the community? I don&amp;#39;t mean little sensations or such, but stuff right out of the books?  Like La Gorda and Carlos on the bridge level stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is that by not realizing you should pursue the flashier stuff, like full on sleep walking, all the effort required to do this combined with all the things that you might feel or perceive, kept anyone from shifting the assemblage point down very far. That&amp;#39;s  the path it must take to get weird stuff to happen. And over time they learned to shift it down and sideways a bit, but nowhere near the red line on the J curve where reality starts to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what happens near the green line, up just below the shoulder blades, can be closer to sensations or moods. Ask women about those moods, and how &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; they can become, when it&amp;#39;s a rough month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many disciplines can manage to move it to that point, and unfortunately, the magic can still be dismissed or explained away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, done honestly with absolute will to get rid of every single word for more than 2 minutes,  and you could produce dark room effects such as puffs of color.  Or women&amp;#39;s heads peeking out from the darkness of the bushes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos clued us in on the purple streak across the sky in his Silent Knowledge publication.

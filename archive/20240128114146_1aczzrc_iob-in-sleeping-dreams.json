Tonight, I experienced sleep paralysis. When I opened my eyes, while paralyzed, I saw two women, one seated and the other standing, talking in front of me.\n\nInitially, I was frightened and wanted to wake up. One of the women occasionally turned to look at me while I, paralyzed, continued to observe her. I decided to calm down, and with effort, I turned to the other side of the bed and sat up.\n\nOne of the women approached and, sitting cross-legged in front of me, as soon as I looked at her face, I noticed she had a man's face with bobbed hair and the shadow that a well-shaved beard leaves on the face.\n\nI asked if she was an ally, and she answered yes. After that, I asked her name, and she said it was Minx. I was very surprised, and I told her (I don't remember if I asked her) that I wanted to ask her some questions. I asked if she had any advice on how to be quieter during the day, but she didn't answer; she turned her head to the side and raised her eyebrows, looking at me in silence. Then I asked if there was a way to lose the human form very quickly (both the human form and silence are topics that interest me for various reasons), but again, without responding, she remained silent.\n\nAt that point, the thought crossed my mind that allies and inorganic beings were almost always women, and since that person had a man's face, I thought she couldn't really be Minx. I got more agitated than usual and shouted at her that she wasn't an ally, pushing her aggressively to the edge of the bed.\n\nPersonally, I don't know why I got so angry; I don't exactly understand the reason, considering my reaction to be totally exaggerated (perhaps I was scared, and the idea of being deceived made me angry?).\n\nNevertheless, what was supposed to be Minx escaped and turned off the light in my room. Terrified, I tried to turn it back on, but she attempted to turn it off a couple of times until I woke up.\n\nWhen I woke up, I immediately noticed that I was very silence, but I attributed this silence to a good night's sleep and the efforts I am making every day. I should mention that I focus on the darkroom and maintaining silence throughout the day, and I avoid dreaming because I read that it's a challenging path for us men and because I've noticed over time that certain dreams drain my energy and make me more nervous and less silent.  So, when I realize I'm in a dream, in most cases, now, I wake up with an act of will, focusing on the intention to wake up.\n\nThat being said, this dream seemed very peculiar, and I wanted to ask: is it possible that it was really Minx?

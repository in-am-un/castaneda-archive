An introduction to the work of Carlos Castaneda,\" by Richard Dixey and Joaquin Castle, published originally in the United=States..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the appearance of this volume in Spanish, the Latin American anthropologist returns to the arena where in 1968 he shook the foundations of science with his books \"the Teachings of Don Juan. A Yaqui Way of knowledge,\" published by the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), from which he got his Degrees  (the maser's degree subsequently with \"A Separate Reality\" and was granted a doctorate with \"Journey to Ixtlan\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe text of Dixey and Castle is directed to the beginning readers of the works of Castaneda and also for those who feel a little misplaced i=n that magical and mysterious labyrinth that underlies the nine books that until today have been=20 published about Don Juan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApart from being used as guides for reorganizing the meaning of practical lessons of shamanism like \"erasing personal history,\" \"breaking routines,\" \"stopping self-importance,\" \"dreaming,\"  \"stalking\" or \"mastering intent,\" the book includes a section in which is defined the thesis that Don Juan exists or existed and that therefore it is about an anthrop=F3logical matter and not a mere literary fiction, as the enemies of Castaneda have asserted for decades..\n\nBasically, Dixey and Castle make their opposition to  Richard of Mille, who they believe destroyed Don Carlos in the volume \"Castaneda's Journey.\" DeMille accuses Castaneda of not having carried out field work (absence of notes of that work), of shooting the ideas of Wittgenstein, of failing to maintain correctness chronologically in the secondary of the events, of using disguised literature from anthropology and, in summary, of having invented Don Juan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dixey and Castle refute DeMille's arguments one by one  and the ace up the sleeve of both authors is the fact that other anthropologists have mentioned in their studies the existence of Don Juan as something absolutely real (even though  this last word loses a great part of its traditional meaning in the present context).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong time fans of Castaneda, Dixey and Castle bolster their defense  with all types  of references - anthropology, esoterical and finally Scientific (like quantum physics).  However the authors seem to not be aware that in 1974 Octavio Paz wrote a masterly prologue for the first edition of \"the Teachings  of Don. Juan\" (FCE).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose who wrote \"The Spirit of Don Juan\" will be left with their mouths open if they rise to our Nobel prize and affirm:  **\"I admit that the 'mystery of Castaneda' interests me less than his work. The secret of his origin- Peruvian, Brazilian or Chicano?  --It seems to me a mediocre enigma, above all if you think about the enigmas that the books propose for us.   The first of these enigmas refers to their nature -: anthropology or fiction? It could be said that my question is pointless.  to document whether anthropology or fiction, the meaning of the work is the same.  The literary fiction is already a ethnographic document =20 and the document, as its critics more directly recognize, possesses literary courage undoubtedly  If the books of Castaneda are a work of literary fiction, they are of a very strange kind: their topic is the defeat of anthropology and the victory of magic; if they are works of anthropology, their topic could not be less than the vengeance of the anthropological 'objecr' (a Sorcerer) over the anthropologist until he becomes a magician, Anti-anthropology.\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Paz wrote that article- signed in Cambridge, Mass, September 15 of 1973-, Castaneda had only published three volumes of his  Stories of don Juan.   Perhaps for it Paz dared to say that \"anthropology carries Castaneda to witchcraft and this to the unitary vision of the world then: to the contemplation of the truth in the world of 'every day'..=20 The sorcerers don't teach you the secret of immortality neither do they gave you the recipe of eternal happiness: they return to you the view. They open for you the doors of the 'other' life. But the life is here. If, over there is here, the other reality is the world of every day.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough from \"the teachings of Don Juan\" already it suggests that the wisdom of the warrior - an inheritance from the mesoamerican shamans not only was a road in order to see the \"other\" reality, it is the \"The Eagle's Gift\" (1981) where it is clear that the end of the search  is neither more  nor  less than immortality.

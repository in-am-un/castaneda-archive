The point is, some things that are \"not real\" **do** exist in the minds of the inhabitants of the river of shit.\n\nWhere the entire world of humanity currently resides.\n\nIf you believe Buddhists don't live in here,  you just haven't swam to their part of the river.  It's there!  Their temple floats on the backs of the poor and unhappy, giving out a message of happiness through sacrifice designed only to get more \"stuff\" for the men on the floating temple.\n\nCholita likes to portray political ships crossing the river, murdering people as they pass by just to be able to move faster.\n\nShe's out of the river in her pictures.  That's the task of students of sorcery.  To climb out.\n\nAnd she's drawn me as having escaped the river.\n\nExcept I turned into a giant dinosaur monster stomping on virgins, who just barely made it to the shore, naked.\n\nHer.\n\nNot me. Dinosaurs like that have big long ugly toenails they never cut.\n\nBut they can't be naked.  They're \"green\" instead.\n\nI suppose making it out of the river is no guarantee of becoming a sorcerer of the level of don Juan.\n\nAnd according to don Juan, nearly everyone who escapes jumps back in.  It's \"too cold\" outside the river of shit.\n\nWe're here to help you climb out, using a technique given to us by one of  the Allies of Carlos.\n\nMixed of course with his \"last minute instructions\".\n\nYou need to find your way out of the river, go walking on the dry land, and hike the mountain that leads to \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nAnd that hike is impossible without your double.  Our feeble tonal bodies are too weak, from living in the river of shit so long.\n\nSo we lure our double out, using silence to recover our full attention.  We get rid of the internal dialogue, so that we can focus where we like with the full force of our awareness.\n\nWe have one thing on our side.  Our double comes out nearly every night, and runs around in dreams of which we are slightly aware.\n\nThat's not quite right.  Actually he never sleeps. He's always \"out there\".\n\nBut we need to find him, or he won't come closer to help us climb that impossible mountain to silent knowledge.  And we already \"sort of know him\".\n\nIn Silent knowledge, you don't need a teacher anymore.  Anything you want to know comes from infinity itself.\n\nNot that it's easy to find what you need.\n\nThat's what the process of learning sorcery really is.\n\nLearning to find what you need, in *seeing*.\n\nThe old men of knowledge never learned to do that. They used power plants and rituals to please an \"Ally\", who then gave them a taste of Silent Knowledge.\n\nThey made friends with the strongest kid in the playground.  And then confused themselves into believing they were that strongest kid.\n\nWe on the other hand, are trying to completely leave the playground.\n\nAnd we don't necessarily need help from an Ally.\n\nSo what's the process for a beginner?\n\nFirst, you have to see the shore of the river of shit.\n\nYou can't swim to it, if you can't see it.\n\nNo one can show you where it is.  You have to find it yourself.\n\nOur technique is to sit in perfect darkness, remove all thoughts from our mind, and simply \"look for it\".\n\nAnything that \"isn't really there\" is part of the shore.\n\nThe shore is everything unknown to the people in the river of shit.\n\nFind even a blade of grass, and you have a view of the shore.\n\nNow comes the problem.\n\nGreed.\n\nNo one wants to put in a lot of work, if there's no pay at the end of the day.\n\nAnd we're all used to being lied to by other systems, which keep you as slave labor for decades, and there's never a payday.\n\nSome even tell you that after you die, you will come back, and keep working for them.   **Then** you'll get paid!\n\nAfter you're dead.\n\nDoesn't sound very promising to me. Not to mention, it's untrue.  When you die, you don't come back.\n\nSorry Buddha.  He didn't even come up with that.  It was the hindus, and their religion is nuts.  It keeps changing every 100 years as you go back in time. It was never really a \"thing\".  Just a bunch of bad men over 3000 years, trying to figure out how to steal from city dwellers.\n\nSorcerers actually get to *see*, with their own eyes, what's really going on.\n\nAnd we need to get out of this river of shit as fast as we can.  Because it's still a long hike  up that mountain.\n\nBut how do you know you found a \"real\" piece of the shore, when gazing into the darkness.\n\nLook... It's ALL real.\n\nUnless you made it up.  If you're a fake \"Nagual\", the stuff you teach is NOT real.  It's made up.\n\nBut if it's just you, in a dark room, and you aren't making up stuff to lie about, whatever  you see is \"real\".\n\nJust a vague flash?\n\nReal enough!\n\nBlue or white dots that come for an instant and burn out.  And you only see 1 all night?\n\nStill real.\n\nStuff \"on the side\".\n\nYes, if you really do see it, even if you doubt it, that's \"real enough\".\n\nLater you'll gain the ability to see nearly ALL of what's in front of you.\n\nIt can be billions of light years away, but if it's as bright as a star you can still catch a glimpse of it, if you are in perfect darkness.\n\nSo stop thinking in terms of real, or not real.\n\nTo sorcerers, there are only 2 things.\n\nOne is a zillion fibers of aware light, stretching all directions, into infinity.\n\nEach one, if you could look only at it, gives you a tiny feeling.  Or a fragment of a feeling.\n\nTo \"look at it\", you have to add some awareness.\n\nYou have a limited amount of that, and thus we shut off our internal dialogue, so we don't waste any.\n\nSo let's say that in perfect silence, you see a yellowish flash.\n\nThat's 1000 of those emanations, perceived as a group in the darkness.\n\nNot many, by emanation standards.\n\nThose little blue dots?  Maybe 500.\n\nI'm just making this up for fun.\n\nBut a box of donuts?\n\nThe number of emanations needed to make that, is likely even more than the quantity of \"quantum particles\" needed to make it.\n\nLet's just say, \"Zillons!\"\n\nJust to make a breakfast food.\n\nBut if you can manage to focus all of your attention on any of those \"500 emanations objects\", like the flash of yellow or the blue dot,  the added glow will light up surrounding ones and the tiny little dot, or flash, can materialize into a \"dream bubble\".  With a delay of course.  And with continued silence.\n\nIt's the coolest thing you ever saw!  A day will come when you have one dream bubble in your right hand, a spirit you plucked out of the air in your left hand, and you decide to put her into the dream, and narrate the scene.\n\nShe'll do exactly what you ask, while adding her own personality.\n\nI sent my entity Fancy into a dream bubble of the fog in London, and she decided to go window shopping.\n\nShe even stopped to watch a television in a store window.  It was night and the store was closed. But the TV was left on to attract window shoppers.\n\nIt was possible because when I found a little puff of pinkish light in the darkness, I focused as much of my attention on it as I could, and that caused my entity Fancy to materialize.\n\nWhen I went to \"scoop her into my hand\", that added more energy of awareness, and she turned very real.\n\nI'd done the same to form the dream bubble.\n\nOnce I had both, getting Fancy to \"go inside and take a look around\" only required asking her.\n\nAdding the energy of your awareness to anything you can find  that is \"not really there\" helps you to find the shore.\n\nSo don't ask, \"is that real, what I saw?\"\n\nUnless you're a big liar, yes. If you really saw it, it's real.\n\nEven if it's so faint you feel silly.\n\nOnce you get control over your awareness, that's all you need!\n\nAnything at all.  Even a faint spec of light in the darkness is enough to open a portal to another world, pull it open, and leave the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Back to Basics: is it REAL???", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"bssj9cgj15t81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba64b72e3d25a707ba3c84f69c2f40e8a42fb06"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd9188faf113189bac106fd83696cfa838c62a38"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b02248bbdc6660aba6ceb951f4af477b5360749"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19aa54c909cfe68ae254de299b9743d36e27313f"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1615caca80508b60a6c74d160b43f093fecc868c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e3c4c471ddc62884d92098012abc94b0b6d4f9"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc7e6e986fb7fb31b78f63c99dde336dcc1c3515"}, "id": "bssj9cgj15t81"}}, "name": "t3_u244o2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 39, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kzmIy1qYAT0zsDbb2bNcXFFJpojeBUajQ51YCBJVdy0.jpg", "edited": 1649791827.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1649783519.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dc7e6e986fb7fb31b78f63c99dde336dcc1c3515\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bssj9cgj15t81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dc7e6e986fb7fb31b78f63c99dde336dcc1c3515&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, if something exists only in the river of shit, it&amp;#39;s not real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The river of shit is a slightly upsetting story told by don Juan, that was controversial enough Carlos just didn&amp;#39;t bring it up much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Private class people got to hear the story, but only select classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why it&amp;#39;s so upsetting, because once you know the story, and practice sorcery a while, it becomes so obvious you can&amp;#39;t believe no one else notices it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s a different story.

Even a faint spec of light in the darkness is enough to open a portal to another world, pull it open, and leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "u244o2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 21, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/u244o2/back_to_basics_is_it_real/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/u244o2/back_to_basics_is_it_real/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1649783519.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i4h17uc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1649793686.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i4gsy2n", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The rule goes, women can fall asleep as long as they were forcing silence (or concentrating on their womb to get it).\n\nMen probably not.

All we really know at this point is that the techniques work to the extent we\u2019ve experienced things through them, which is quite more than you get practicing other forms of meditation.

And he marked him so that he could be identified by a seer.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cresource\u201d out there.   Among others.  Pockets of stalkers here and there.

The other was that your assemblage point can move drastically, but be unnoticeable under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you move it on your own, it\u2019s a slow hard slog.  That\u2019s why lineages rely on the Nagual to push it during the course of their training.  If he\u2019s experienced, he can produce precise movements nearly instantly, which is a lot like the rituals using power plants, which produce stunning results designed to convince the apprentice it\u2019s worth his effort to do all the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m of course assuming the books are 100% true in this discussion.  All we really know at this point is that the techniques work to the extent we\u2019ve experienced things through them, which is quite more than you get practicing other forms of meditation. They\u2019re consistent to each other, and seem to be unique. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s very possible Carlos created that myth, to embed something he got elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An interesting part is that he singled out Tony, and even created the idea that Tony had been struck on the back by don Juan.   And he marked him so that he could be identified by a seer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a \u201cresource\u201d out there.   Among others.  Pockets of stalkers here and there.

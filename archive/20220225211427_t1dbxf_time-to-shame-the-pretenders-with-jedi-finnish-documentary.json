in to figure out that final point.\n\nThere's 2 ways to look at this.\n\nPossibly the best is completely mechanical.\n\nThat eliminates pretending from the mix.  Pretending is a very complex case of intending.   It's river of shit stuff.\n\nSo from a mechanical point of view, this topic is really about J curve geometry.\n\nEach reality you can assemble can be given an X, Y, and Z coordinate.\n\nY is the position along the J curve.   Millimeters is probably good enough resolution.\n\nBlue line is 0, but keep in mind, you can have negative values of Y.  Sorcerers do that last.  Stretch their cocoon into an infinite line by moving the assemblage point up from the blue, instead of down.\n\nIt takes you into the non-human unknown.\n\nX is the horizontal position.  The position in the cheese slice (band of man) usually, but you can move all the way around to the front, on the side. Dont have to move down only, to go back up to the front.\n\nSo the X position is best thought of as being along the outside of the shell, going horizontally.  It's a curved axis.  With 0 in the very center of Man's band (cheese slice).\n\nThe Y axis is no spring chicken either, in terms of it's shape.\n\nIt's J shaped, with a limit on the lower range, and no limit on the negative range.\n\nThen there's Z.\n\nIf you specify an X,Y, you have the  glow of awareness of the assemblage point covering a certain spot on the cocoon, and thus a certain range of emanations.  Keep in mind, that the assemblage oint is a beam, so it passes through the whole egg, based on the spot along the outside.\n\nBut we can never even come remotely close to lighting up all of those emanations at that X, Y point.\n\nIt's going to be merely a \"skimming of emanations\".\n\nZ is the skimming level.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not a very straight axis.  It doesn't move in space. It moves in compatible emanations.  How, maybe we'll never know.  But you cause some emanations to light up, and others to be ignored, and you have something like a haystack, which has some hay strands died orange, among the normally yellow ones.\n\nThat's the Z, the skimming.   And worse, the axis through which it moves, may be determined by past humans who used that range.  Latent intent.\n\nIf anyone uncovered the nature of that axis, they'd be so powerful we'd have to stay away from that person!  They could possibly do anything they could think of, right on the spot.\n\nKeep in mind, when you solve (specify) all 3 Axes, you leave this copy of reality.\n\nYou're in the other one.   I'm not saying everything has to change.  Your Z location is likely very close to  your current Z, just out of habit.  So you usually end up with a bizarre modification to your normal reality.  A good example is shapeshifting, but you go outside to learn about your new form, and no one is around.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be a weird copy. It can be complety new.\n\nTechnically, you could visit your \"wife\" in another reality, have lunch, and come back to this reality.\n\nI've now done this, so it's not speculation.  Minus the lunch part.\n\nI believe the problem to move further in knowledge, will be the Z axis.\n\nWe don't understand that one.\n\nSo the most dazzling magic would not be about moving your assemblage point to a specific spot.

The attention of a beginner is tied to \"doing\" just as much as seeing.\n\nSo for best results, do stuff with what you see.

Or might be doing.\n\nInterpret what's going on, to gain control over the Z axis.\n\nThis probably doubles the speed at which you learn in darkroom.\n\nBut it uses up more dreaming energy.

Where normally you might use .000001% of the emanations at a location, oncce the Y goes negative, you have to use a larger percent, to get a \"realistic\" perception.\n\nUnless the width of the glow remains constant, in which case you would be sampling emanations outside your shell.\n\nThe possibilities of exploration regarding that topic, are beyond anything the books told us.

Pretending is a very complex case of intending.   It&amp;#39;s river of shit stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So from a mechanical point of view, this topic is really about J curve geometry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each reality you can assemble can be given an X, Y, and Z coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Y is the position along the J curve.   Millimeters is probably good enough resolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue line is 0, but keep in mind, you can have negative values of Y.  Sorcerers do that last.  Stretch their cocoon into an infinite line by moving the assemblage point up from the blue, instead of down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes you into the non-human unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;X is the horizontal position.  The position in the cheese slice (band of man) usually, but you can move all the way around to the front, on the side. Dont have to move down only, to go back up to the front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the X position is best thought of as being along the outside of the shell, going horizontally.  It&amp;#39;s a curved axis.  With 0 in the very center of Man&amp;#39;s band (cheese slice).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Y axis is no spring chicken either, in terms of it&amp;#39;s shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s J shaped, with a limit on the lower range, and no limit on the negative range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s Z.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you specify an X,Y, you have the  glow of awareness of the assemblage point covering a certain spot on the cocoon, and thus a certain range of emanations.  Keep in mind, that the assemblage oint is a beam, so it passes through the whole egg, based on the spot along the outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can never even come remotely close to lighting up all of those emanations at that X, Y point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s going to be merely a &amp;quot;skimming of emanations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Z is the skimming level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s not a very straight axis.  It doesn&amp;#39;t move in space. It moves in compatible emanations.  How, maybe we&amp;#39;ll never know.  But you cause some emanations to light up, and others to be ignored, and you have something like a haystack, which has some hay strands died orange, among the normally yellow ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the Z, the skimming.   And worse, the axis through which it moves, may be determined by past humans who used that range.  Latent intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone uncovered the nature of that axis, they&amp;#39;d be so powerful we&amp;#39;d have to stay away from that person!  They could possibly do anything they could think of, right on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, when you solve (specify) all 3 Axes, you leave this copy of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re in the other one.   I&amp;#39;m not saying everything has to change.  Your Z location is likely very close to  your current Z, just out of habit.  So you usually end up with a bizarre modification to your normal reality.  A good example is shapeshifting, but you go outside to learn about your new form, and no one is around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a weird copy. It can be complety new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Technically, you could visit your &amp;quot;wife&amp;quot; in another reality, have lunch, and come back to this reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve now done this, so it&amp;#39;s not speculation.  Minus the lunch part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the problem to move further in knowledge, will be the Z axis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t understand that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the most dazzling magic would not be about moving your assemblage point to a specific spot.  It would be about knowing what to perceive, when you get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which emanations should be glowing and which should not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The skimming.  Of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes the most dazzling magic the result of the mastery of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two cases wee know of, to give credance to this idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers who could emphasize IOB type emanations, and deactivate human ones, in order to live longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, Julian changing his age on demand, by manipulating some emanations through the doing of the gate of power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What use is all this to beginners?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your enemy is fantasizing (the internal dialogue).  it scatters intent in a vicious range that&amp;#39;s like an endless circle, and holds your Y position.

You pull it wide enough to zip through the hole, if you could fly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iteration #3 is done, and you have a portal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You start iteration #4, but yhou never get to finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You gaze inside the portal to see,  blank out, and slowly notice you are in another world and have been for a few seconds.  Probably since you tried to gaze into the portal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s in there?  You saw, that activated a doing all by itself, and now is the intending part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a woman sitting next to you, and she&amp;#39;s speaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s real.  No longer dark at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that seeing gives rise to an idea of what can be &amp;quot;done&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing leads to doing, and then intending arises when you expect a result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you transfer though the portal, you see that things are now reversed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the intending that caused the doing and seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m afraid I lost why that&amp;#39;s so before I could type this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll go back and look again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I missed one observation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity contains the seeing part when done in the dark, because you look for cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the tensegrity itself is the doing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos influenced our intending part, with his &amp;quot;back story&amp;quot; on what that pass means, is, or does.  He was never specific, just gave us a direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like &amp;quot;Stellar Hatch&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;taint&amp;quot; your intending, I don&amp;#39;t know what would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you could call it, &amp;quot;cow pie&amp;quot;, but have it be the same movement, and instead of energy falling from space, you can imagine what would be intended by that new name.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_t1dbxf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/t1dbxf/time_to_shame_the_pretenders_with_jedi_finnish/hylqqbk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1645935015.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hyi9045", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1645877762.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_t1dbxf", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "The Horrors of Pretending\n\nI'm tempted to make an actual post on this subject, but doing it right would be a lot of work.\n\nIt turns out, I'd already gotten a lesson on this topic in the last couple of weeks, but I hadn't understood it.\n\nAnd even more bizarrely, there was a brilliant lesson on this in the books. But no one understood it, so we don't ever discuss it.\n\nAnd I'd have to go into the books and study it, in order to point out the lesson well.\n\nSo I'll just do a crummy job, and hopefully the pretenders among our audience, won't use it to do more damage.\n\nMaybe what I need is just what's in the title to this post.  To shame the pretenders.\n\nBut pretenders are also trolls, so no amount of reasoning back and forth, will stop them from their pretending.  That's their idea of \"working hard\".  Not actually working hard to learn, but working hard at pretending, which means being a troll when necessary.\n\nA troll can't be reasoned with.  If you point out a flaw in their thinking, or even a lie, they ignore it, and come up with 2 more, to keep you from \"winning\".\n\nSo possibly a cartoon character could be used to shame them?  A parrot with a rambo shaman's headband, running around saying, \"Impeccable Warrior!!!\"    Or \"Mental Mastubator!\"   Or, \"Black Dot of Death\".\n\nA mix of early book stuff they don't understand at all, and don't realize was the example of the men of knowledge, who never learned to see.  Or criticism that Carlos used, like \"mental masturbator\", that they've redefined to protect pretending.  As a form of pretend authority, to engage in more troll behavior.\n\nSuch a simplistic \"bad mascot\", could be added to pictures protect an important piece of information the bad players are sure to pick up on, and weaken.\n\n\"Shaman Parrot\"?\n\nIn each picture, the lower right could show what \"Shaman Parrot\" got out of it, which would be pure pretending to get attention.\n\nHere's Lily's lesson on why pretending is death to sorcery.   I suppose she gave me this lesson because of the usual reason they give you a lesson.  They pick up on it in your mind.  Sometimes they pick up on your worries, and take that as a question, and answer it.\n\nBut no one told you that was what was up, so you can't easily figure it out at the time.\n\nI guess it's equivalent to an adult seeing a kid fascinated by an object in an antique store, and so that adult starts pointing out similiar things elsewhere, giving teaching lessons on that topic.  But the kid is too young to pick up why those lessons started coming.  It's 2 unrelated events in the mind of a child.\n\nLily's lesson was amazing, but I'll have to translate it into a simple idea.\n\nWe search for a new position of the assemblage point along the J curve by using our senses.\n\nBut we test the position by using our body.\n\nSearching is easier with the eyes, but you can search with any sense.  Touch isn't too hard to understand.  Look for cobwebs.\n\nBut smell can move the assemblage point along the J curve also.\n\n\"Why\" is something you have to discover yourself, it can't be explained.  But, possibly it just means,  \"searching for a new position\" is merely looking at weaker collections of emanations that have awareness.\n\nWhen you detect some, the assemblage point moves along the J curve to enhance those.  Or \"center around them\" a bit.\n\nIn the middle of the J curve (not shifted horizontally), we get the \"best view overall\" of that level.\n\nBut emanations at that given level, might be strongest if the assemblage point moved left or right from there.\n\nWhich essentially means, it won't feel \"real\" until you make the signal stronger.\n\nWeak signals can be generated by multiple sources, which includes pretending.  Pretending is an attempt to start a phantom element.\n\nSo very good information on new techniques, can be destroyed by pretending.  You can contaminate other people, and cause them to be unable to \"tune in\" a specific obscure bunch of glowing emanations.\n\nIt's the same reason you can discover something super magical and cool, but the next day your expectations to do that again, override your ability.\n\nThe expectations are tainted with pretending.\n\nIt's almost like that shaman parrot is so stupid, he sees only the surface appearance.  And because all he wants is attention, he starts shouting his poor understanding, in order to try to cash in on anything \"new\".  It's no fun sharing \"old news\".   So he flocks to anything new, and tries to turn it into something he can claim came from him.\n\nHe might turn instructions for how to shift the assemblage point into the IOB world, as \"Red Cave!  Red Cave!!!  Red Cave!!!!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the IOB realm often resembles a cave, but thinking about it in those concrete terms is \"off\" enough, that you'll invoke our ability to create phantom skimmings, and that will override any good info on how to accomplish that shift.\n\nThis is tricky to explain, better to see it with your own eyes.\n\nSo humans can search, to move along the middle of the J curve. We do that, by looking for the puffs.\n\nAnd then they can fine tune the horizontal positoin by \"playing with it\".\n\n\"Make it real\", or just behave as  if it were real.  Tensegrity tends to do that.\n\nThat could be as simple as pretending a purple puff can be stretched, and trying to do that.   It causes a profound horizontal shift, to make that \"real\".\n\nBut we can end up in obscure situations where it's not possible to make that real, because you aren't comprehending enough at that position, to have any good way to do that.\n\nSo we can skim unrelated emanations to create a phantom object or phantom \"accessory\" so that the situation is more real.  Because there isn't enough real eneergy coming from what you are preceiving, we fill it in with phantom objects.\n\nThat's how ordinary dreams work.\n\nI should mention, a false narrative, such as fill asian magical systems, is a phantom object.  More pretending.  So trying to learn sorcery using Buddhism, is like trying to learn from a pretender.  \n\nYou can't learn sorcery from the fake Carlos (aka colorado carlos), or the fake Don Juan (aka kachorka or whatever), or the the fake replacement for Carlos  (aka Ken Eagle feather).\n\nThree human abilities affect the positoin your assemblage point moves to.  \n\nMaybe there's more (there are and I've seen them), but those 3 clearly show the problem with pretending.\n\n(more = power spots, power plants, IOBs, the abstract, adjacent bands of emanations, other people sharing the view,  and so on).\n\nPretending is designed to add \"cozy\".  But \"cozy\" might be incompatible with what's really being perceived.  That can cause the assemblage point to readjust, using the phantom more than the thing perceived (the real).\n\nPhantom can override real.  And phantom is created by our wishes, not by what's there.\n\nAt the top by the blue line, it ends up just being a vicious circle in the mind, so it's not as obvious that this is \"dark magic\".\n\nDark magic is to combine a piece of the real, with phantom elements, to create a new, stable object.\n\nWhich is a lie, but can still impinge on other beings.\n\nIt's \"evil\"!\n\nWhat fun...  Usually if you see me say something you can do is \"evil\", that's mostly why.  \"High Phantom Content, mixed with some Real to make it stable.\"\n\nBut deep in the red zone, those 3 abilities are very clear, because the effect is drastic.  You can't teach this to a beginner because the green and blue aren't vivid enough, and are subject to full override by phantom elements.\n\nMight be possible to design an exercise in the shift below region, so people could play with those 3 a bit, to learn what they \"feel like\".\n\nPractical examples?\n\nPlay with what you see!\n\nIf you see lines on a whitish light on the walls, use your hand to \"smooth\" the lines out.  Or use your fingers to \"Pluck\" those lines.\n\nIt's why you can use, \"the wall\".  That's the whitish light landing on a surface, even an imagineary one, or even our palm, so that you have it in focus, and can \"play with it\".\n\nI like to wiggle my fingers on a surface within reach, until it retunes the assemblage point to create sparkles.  Then I can treat the sparkles as an object, stick my fingers inside the middle, and pull it open.  As if it were a hole in space, which can be stretched open to make a window or doorway.\n\nThat reskims or fine tunes the assemblage ;oint, so that you can \"look inside\".\n\nThat moves the assemblage point again.  Being both a \"search\", and also an attempt to use it as if it were real, you can end up seeing an entrance to another world.\n\nOr a cartoon like video.\n\nOr something phantom can be created, such as a magical goblet covered in jewels.\n\nThat can \"fall out\".\n\nAll three effects can be used, on \"the wall\".\n\nBut Shaman Parrot is too stupid to understand, so he'll just way, \"Wiggle Fingers!  Wiggle Fingers!!  Wiggle Fingers!!!\"\n\nAnd destroy that valuable lesson.  Pretty soon you'll have a whole crowd of fake sorcerers wiggling their fingers to \"alter reality\".\n\nWe really need to find a way to eject those guys faster, or shame them to suppress that behavior because they realize it won't get them attention, it will get them ridicule.", "edited": 1645879744.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hyi9045", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Horrors of Pretending&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tempted to make an actual post on this subject, but doing it right would be a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out, I&amp;#39;d already gotten a lesson on this topic in the last couple of weeks, but I hadn&amp;#39;t understood it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even more bizarrely, there was a brilliant lesson on this in the books.

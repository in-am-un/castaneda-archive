Physics says the same thing. The \"real\" reality, is quite different than what we believe.\n\nAs it turns out, we don't use all of it.  If there's 100 billion of those fibers in the location we're at, we only use 100 million of them.\n\nWe ignore the other 900 million.\n\nKeep in mind, we have no theories in here.  I play with those fibers each night for hours, causing them to form alternate realities.  And if you look around, you'll see pictures for how you can do that also.\n\nNothing in here, comes without instructions.\n\nIf there's no instructions, I complain to whoever posted it.\n\nAbout dreaming. At night we sleep, and our awareness no longer selects which of those fibers to focus on.\n\nSo we randomly cause others to glow.\n\nWe have dreams.\n\nBut those are other possible worlds we can also enter. Both in our dreaming double, or in our waking body.\n\nI likely pass through at least 10 alternate realties each night, just playing around in a dark room using our techniques.\n\nAgain, there's no theories in here.  Only facts.\n\nSleeping dreaming is when your normal \"self\" is unconscious, so the \"remnants\" of it wander around in the dream.\n\nWaking dreaming is the same process, but your waking body wanders around in it.\n\nIf  you wander far enough into alternatives, the dreaming body, the one that you run around in during the night, shows up along with your physical body.\n\nThere are TWO OF YOU!!!\n\nAgain, no theories. We do that all night long.\n\nBut in order to do that, you have to be able to absolutely silence your mind.\n\nRemove that little voice in your head.\n\nThat prevents you from making the  usual fibers glow with awareness, so that you can escape that view of reality.\n\nAs long as that voice is nagging away, you're stuck in this reality.\n\nThat dreaming double you have, can be seen by others.\n\nMy witch friend Cholita likes to play hide and seek with me using her double.\n\nShe walks through the solid wall at night, and either stands in the room until I notice her, or she can even wake me up by touching me with her finger.\n\nShe's semi-solid!\n\nIt feels like a baby touched you.  Real, but not very strong.\n\nWhen I notice her, she takes off running.\n\nRight through the solid walls!\n\nI've chased her on a few of those occasions, but I must admit to being too old to do that each time she comes.\n\nThe first time, I chased her all the way to the bathroom before I realized I had just passed through 2 solid walls.\n\nLike an idiot I panicked, went back to my room, and the walls sealed up again.\n\nI tried to put my hand through them, but they were solid again.\n\nSo I sat up on my bed, and did remote viewing on the bedspread.\n\nWe can do that too.  We can convince those glowing fibers to form a second reality, on any flat surface.  And then we can watch that reality, like it was a monitor.\n\nI finally located Cholita, my witch friend, in Mexico.  In a small village.\n\nI was able to reach down into the village and grab whatever I could feel, hoping to yank Cholita out of there.\n\nInstead, I broke off a piece of the village.  Houses, dirt road and all.\n\nI set it down on the bedspread, to see how long it could exist in that state.\n\n30 minutes!\n\nBut where did you come from?  I mean you.\n\nHow did you find your way here?\n\n10 years ago, I realized the students of Carlos Castaneda were old, and couldn't live long.\n\nAnd  the entire world had decided he was a fraud.\n\nIt was never true, and you can look in the wiki and see proof.\n\nBut he was teaching real magic.\n\nIt infuriated some native Americans.  Because it was so much more powerful than anything they are capable of, they believed he must be lying.\n\nActually it was just a far older form of  the same thing they do.  Older = more powerful for magic.\n\nOthers attacked him because he also made them look bad.

Physics says the same thing. The &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; reality, is quite different than what we believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, we don&amp;#39;t use all of it.  If there&amp;#39;s 100 billion of those fibers in the location we&amp;#39;re at, we only use 100 million of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ignore the other 900 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, we have no theories in here.  I play with those fibers each night for hours, causing them to form alternate realities.  And if you look around, you&amp;#39;ll see pictures for how you can do that also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing in here, comes without instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s no instructions, I complain to whoever posted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About dreaming. At night we sleep, and our awareness no longer selects which of those fibers to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we randomly cause others to glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those are other possible worlds we can also enter. Both in our dreaming double, or in our waking body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I likely pass through at least 10 alternate realties each night, just playing around in a dark room using our techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, there&amp;#39;s no theories in here.  Only facts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sleeping dreaming is when your normal &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; is unconscious, so the &amp;quot;remnants&amp;quot; of it wander around in the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waking dreaming is the same process, but your waking body wanders around in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If  you wander far enough into alternatives, the dreaming body, the one that you run around in during the night, shows up along with your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are TWO OF YOU!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, no theories. We do that all night long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in order to do that, you have to be able to absolutely silence your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remove that little voice in your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That prevents you from making the  usual fibers glow with awareness, so that you can escape that view of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as that voice is nagging away, you&amp;#39;re stuck in this reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That dreaming double you have, can be seen by others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My witch friend Cholita likes to play hide and seek with me using her double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She walks through the solid wall at night, and either stands in the room until I notice her, or she can even wake me up by touching me with her finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s semi-solid!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels like a baby touched you.  Real, but not very strong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I notice her, she takes off running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right through the solid walls!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve chased her on a few of those occasions, but I must admit to being too old to do that each time she comes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time, I chased her all the way to the bathroom before I realized I had just passed through 2 solid walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like an idiot I panicked, went back to my room, and the walls sealed up again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to put my hand through them, but they were solid again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I sat up on my bed, and did remote viewing on the bedspread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can do that too.  We can convince those glowing fibers to form a second reality, on any flat surface.  And then we can watch that reality, like it was a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally located Cholita, my witch friend, in Mexico.  In a small village.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to reach down into the village and grab whatever I could feel, hoping to yank Cholita out of there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I broke off a piece of the village.  Houses, dirt road and all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set it down on the bedspread, to see how long it could exist in that state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But where did you come from?  I mean you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did you find your way here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 years ago, I realized the students of Carlos Castaneda were old, and couldn&amp;#39;t live long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  the entire world had decided he was a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was never true, and you can look in the wiki and see proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he was teaching real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It infuriated some native Americans.  Because it was so much more powerful than anything they are capable of, they believed he must be lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually it was just a far older form of  the same thing they do.  Older = more powerful for magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others attacked him because he also made them look bad.  Anthropologists, and men who wanted to pretend to be him, and write their own books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got lynched!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I eventually realized, I was the only one left who could restore his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something went wrong with the people he set up in his organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;#39;t understand what.

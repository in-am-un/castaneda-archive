In your room.\n\nOr better said, I suggested that maybe  you could materialize a street scene, and convince a scout to be waiting for you near a lamppost at night there, like a hooker.\n\nNow I understand, the USA is the descendant of prudish pilgrims, and if you travel around the world you quickly come to realize, this country never got over its pilgrim prudishness.  So I apologize to the \"proper\" among us.  Warning: that's part of \"Ugly American\" syndrome. Judging other countries based on strange oppressive ideas. It's so bad they hide things from USA visitors for fear of attacks.\n\nBut in fact, IOBs are very much like hookers.  Think about it a bit and you'll realize it's true.  If it bothers you, think of them as being like \"Pretty Woman\".  If it works out, they'll move in with you.\n\nThat of course is the main justification for bar girls in Asia.  \"They're looking for husbands\", people explain, if they think you might judge their country. \"They are very good actors...\"\n\nAnd so when I extended my arms in the air, to immerse them in the purple puffs of the dark room, swirled them a tiny bit to thicken the puffs  and tried to identify \"surfaces\" I could see in the vivid course fog of purple light, I wasn't completely surprised to find Fancy standing on a street corner to my left.\n\nI couldn't make the  street clear enough to recognize anything.  Imagine blurring a picture of a narrow street until you could only see rectangles, and that's how poorly the scene was formed.\n\nI just copied the scene from the first time I did this technique, to save time.  But Fancy on the left is accurate.\n\nAnd Fancy was just fine, standing there as if she were perfectly innocent.  She was even dressed like a peasant girl out of a WWII movie about France.\n\n\"Really Fancy???\", I said.\n\nShe smiled the same way a hooker might, if they caught you looking at them on the street.  It was a sort of \"Sure, you can come over here\" look.\n\nI became obsessed with making the scene better. I'd joked about her standing next to a lamppost, and I wanted to reproduce that, just to see if it was possible.  Her being on the left side, when my last \"lamppost\" as on the right, was troublesome.\n\nBut I couldn't get a scene to form.  I searched for signs of texture such as a wall, or any surface. Like the whitish light you can see on surfaces which allows, \"Seeing energy on a horizon\", you can treat a dense fog of the second attention like a surface, and cause scenes to materialize as if you were playing a video.  If you want 3D, you need clouds you can see going off into the distance. A single cloud of light would be a single surface, and only produce a little video in the air.\n\nOf course, it's all *intending*.  Silvio Manuel could likely just snap his fingers, and skip all the trouble.\n\nI suddenly realized, the cover of  the wheel of time was a technique!  A super powerful one in fact, that Carlos had tossed our way as he died, taunting us by putting it on a book cover where no one would notice it.\n\nUNLESS they had done it themselves, by accident.  And then, they'd realize what it was.\n\nHe hid it in plain sight, possibly to amuse *intent* itself.\n\nPeople occasionally said Carlos was a trickster, and some say that with a negative mindset.\n\nBut in fact, *intent* is the trickster. Or better said, while you are intending something with grand gestures and fearless abandon, it doesn't hurt to toss in a practical joke on someone as long as it's harmless.\n\nIn fact, I bet there's an entire specialty field of \"whoopie cushion magic\".\n\nIf not, there should be... And Genaro would be the master for sure.\n\nMy first reaction to that book cover had been negative. I pictured the \"Man of Knowledge\" type of fake sorcery teacher, lifting their arms in the air to make a big show of it  like some cheap TV shaman in a 70s series that ran out of plots and decided to borrow from Castaneda fever.\n\nCarlos was really popular back then, and if you ran out of ideas you could bring in a wise Indian character.  \"Star Trek\" even did it over multiple versions of the franchise.\n\nIt's why the phony sorcery teachers out there change their name to sound more like a cheap TV shaman.\n\nThey'll give themselves names like, \"big puffy foot\", or \"dirty eagle feathers\".\n\nI'm not sure which is worse.  Doing that for forge your \"credentials\", or calling yourself \"Nagual\" like it was  a cheap degree to pull teeth you got in South America.\n\nBut then I realized, I was indeed standing there with my arms stretched out, trying to summon an image in the air.\n\nIn fact, that book cover was EXACTLY what I was doing.  Minus the animal skin loin cloth.  Cholita frowns on those.\n\nShe by the way had drug herself out of bed at midnight, at which time she's  usually settled in to wherever she's hiding.  Which was good, because I found myself too tired to sit up on bed and start practicing.\n\nBut Cholita got me up with a very quiet visit to the bathroom.  And I got to do this.\n\nI glanced to my right, excited at the book deal thought I had just gotten about the Cover of Wheel of Time.\n\nWhen I realized what that technique really way, I noticed that Fancy had changed locations.  She was standing just 3 feet away from me at normal height like a real person in my bedroom, except she was intense pink over purple haze, and her head was on fire with soothing waves of intense color.\n\nShe was nearly as bright as the sun.\n\nAll pink.  She also had a truly wicked smile on her face, the kind you would expect to find on a powerful  movie witch, just before she cast a horrible spell turning you into a rodent.\n\nI stood there dumbfounded, watching wave after wave of flames rise up her head, from the shoulders. At the top they maintained the shape of her \"fancy\" hair.  Fancy is a bit of a showoff.\n\nEarlier I'd seen Mystery, who is always quite conservative.  He floated above me while I did some warmup tensegrity.\n\nFancy pointed out into the center of where I was facing in the room.  Her head shook a tiny bit, just enough to make her hair fluff, and since it was on fire with pink flames the sight was truly amazing.\n\nI wanted to run and grab my computer, but she pointed up into the air at the height of the manifestation in that Wheel of Time cover.\n\nI saw a surface.  Like stucco on the side of a house, but made out of the purple clouds, with grey and black forming the details.\n\nFancy waved her arm.  Except she didn't have one fully formed, so it was more like a ripple of pink light going out to the purple clouds.\n\nThe stucco surface changed to vertical lines, like you might see looking into a dense bamboo forest.\n\nShe did it again, and the details changed to yellow instead of black over purple.  I could see tiny lines which could easily be described as being just like the emanations.\n\nThey floated forward, and I saw some orange ones.  And it rotated in the sky a bit, and I saw some whitish ones.\n\nIt zoomed back, and there was a \"bundle of emanations\" right in front of me.  It had been built by selected \"layers\" of the emanations at large.  By emphasizing some, de-emphasizing others.\n\nJust as the old sorcerers had done, to t urn themselves into those weird creatures with yellow eyes, near the huge rock where Carlos was attacked.\n\nSo if you want to t urn yourself into an inorganic being without dying, you might be able to figure that out from this wheel of time phenomena.\n\nYou don't grab emanations, and push away others.\n\nYou simple gaze at them, and find what you want.  There are millions of layers there, but somehow the ones you can can be *intended* forward.\n\nI'd seen that before.  After stopping the world you can in fact end up viewing the emanations in their raw form.  It's just like you would visualize, which might in fact be no coincidence.  Sorcery was \"conceived\" by the old seers.  There's no telling when  you see something like that, if you really would have seen it that way, if you hadn't been told about it.\n\nPlus, \"The Matrix\" movie didn't hurt any.  Very Castaneda, that movie.  The entire private class was excited when it came out.\n\nIn fact, just because I'd joked about it, there was Fancy pretending to be a street hooker.  So any ripple in *intent*, can cause entire worlds to form. Keep that in mind, the next time you're insisting Chinese philosophy helps understand Castaneda.  Actually it harms that.  Unless you want a book deal instead.\n\nI gazed at the bundle remembering that in the world of raw emanations, if you gaze at a bundle you get sucked into that world.  You simply find yourself standing in a perfectly real place you never saw before.  If you don't stay long, you can turn back to where you came from.\n\n\"Turning the head\" is a technique also.  We just have no info on it.  But it's sort of a \"Gaze relocator\", which can access both space and time.\n\nMy view of the bundle zoomed in, so I was looking at it from a different point of view.\n\nIt was composed of \"surfaces\" of emanations. I'd \"noticed\" some, so those lit up.  Like giving some wires a little power to make them glow.  Others had not been \"noticed\", so they didn't glow.  Based on \"skimming\" the ones I could notice, and ignoring the rest, I could build a phantom world.\n\nNot necessarily one that wasn't real at some point, as I found out later.\n\nFancy indicated I had learned that point, and started another.  She was almost smirking at me, pleased with herself for getting me to understand that so fast.\n\nI turned my head back to see if I could still perceive the bundle, but as I turned it my gaze ran over surfaces of fibers floating in the air.  I was noticing layers of surfaces available at each point in the room.  You had to \"fan\" them, to get them to materialize into something more visible.\n\nThe head turning was most effective when done at the same speed as turning the head in recap.\n\nMy original idea to make recapitulation fully visual, to add some magic to the Castaneda community which still emphasizes what Carlos emphasized back in 98, namely recap and tensegrity,  involved teaching them to materialize a \"surface\" made of colored light and then attack that to their vision and use it to scan back and forth.\n\nBut I realized that \"skimming for emanation surfaces\" in the air was more effective.\n\nFancy spoke.\n\n\"Standing Recapitulation\", she said.  \"The Arms help add energy.\"\n\nI was stubborn.   I thought about people sitting up in bed next to their spouse, unable to wave their arms around the room like an idiot.\n\nSuddenly I'd turned into Carlos, challenging don Juan when it made no sense to argue with him.\n\nI suppose we're all filled with that desire to stump our teacher.\n\nI lowered them to my side and asked Fancy, \"But can't you just use the gaze in place of the arms, and maybe intensify it a bit?\"\n\nShe seemed to nod, but it wasn't a very convincing nod.  Maybe she was just looking back to the center of the room.\n\nMy arms were now frozen at my side. It wasn't my doing.  I was even surprised. My body seemed to have shrunk in width a bit, to keep my arms immobile on my sides.  As if Fancy had wrapped me in invisible plastic like some leftovers from dinner.\n\nI slowly turned back and my gaze intensified every puff of purple it ran over.  The plastic wrapping made it possibly only to turn smoothly, like I was standing on a rotating spice rack on a kitchen counter.  A \"Lazy Susan\" I believe they call it.\n\n\"This surface is natural and available to everyone\", Fancy said.  I immediately knew she was criticizing my obsession with collecting exotic surfaces in the dark room.  I felt a little embarassment.\n\nI had another contrary thought, which is perhaps how it goes when talking to a dreaming emissary.  It becomes a teacher and student situation.\n\nI turned back and Fancy said, \"Yes, it comes in red too, don't worry...  I haven't forgotten Zuleica.\"\n\nAnd the dense puffs turned red.  The shape and texture of the puffs was more blurry, but it was clearly red now.\n\nI concentrated on a scene I might be able to form from my past.  Cholita at a Mexican restaurant on the roof of a Korean mall, dancing to a female mariachi band.  With the gay waiter handsomely bribed to keep her wine glass full at all times.\n\nBut I got nothing.\n\nI decided maybe that was too emotional of a memory to use right now, and simply eliminated any thought of past events from my mind, to see what formed on its own.\n\nAs I turned my head, it caused a woman holding a baby to form.  She was sitting in a chair in front of me, with the baby across her arms.\n\nThe process was the same as you might imagine for \"skimming emanations\".  The movement of the head back and forth let me select some features, and discard others.  It was if each sweep left or right offered me a tiny piece of the scene, but if I didn't like it, it was gone by the time I did the reverse sweep.\n\nFinally, it became my sister holding her daughter.\n\nI turned back to Fancy and said, \"It works!\"\n\nHer wicked grin had left and her face was more normal. Her head wasn't on fire anymore.  And while I couldn't see her entire body, she at least had a full upper half and very clear features on her face.\n\nI might criticize the view because she was still at least 25% transparent, and I could see my furniture behind her.\n\nExcept...  The room was pitch black.  It ought to be hard to complain about her being transparent and you can see things behind her, when that was impossible too.\n\nRemember this: self-pity is a constant enemy.  It can manifest in \"fussy\" ways, and if you aren't alert you'll fall for your own tricks.\n\nI got the idea to recapitulate a creepy scene.  As a child I used to sneak to a specific alcove of a shopping mall, where I could find a scary but exhilarating feeling in the air, if I forced all thoughts from my mind.   It wasn't so much that at 6 years old I had figured out I needed to remove the internal dialogue.\n\nBut rather I had learned the \"feeling\" of sleep walking a little bit, and could cause it most easily at that spot, because I had a memory of it.\n\nI was trying to find out if Fancy was the very same inorganic being who had visited me as a monster, in my childhood.\n\nAt 5 years old, I was attacked physically by a demon.  While laying in bed.\n\nWas it Fancy?\n\nI tried to recapitulation that scene, but found myself in Fancy's ice cave instead.\n\nShe was floating up higher, with her head pressed against another being.\n\nIt's Bob, I thought to myself.\n\nExcept Bob has turned into woman.\n\n\"He's the more powerful of us you know\", Fancy said.\n\n\"The quiet ones always are.\"\n\nIdeas started to flood my mind.\n\n\"Waking four gates dreaming is easier than doing it asleep\", I thought. I could see the entire sequence in my mind as images, one after the other. Each gate and how to translate it to dreaming awake.\n\nBut it hadn't come from Fancy.  She was still pressed against Bob, motionless.\n\nThen they started to recede back into the ice cave.  They had almost faded into nothing, when I looked around hoping to get a clearer look at the walls.\n\nI commented to Fancy, \"You can bring me here any time you like\".\n\nFancy's head reappeared again without Bob, just 2 feet away from mine.\n\nShe was obviously waiting for me to say more.  The look on her face encouraged me to go on. She seemed to float towards me, even though she was already life size.\n\n\"No, I'm not going to say that. But I do genuinely like visiting.\"\n\nShe faded away, and in the middle of the room I saw a round tarot card table.\n\n\"Nyei's favorite?\", Fancy asked.\n\nI told her I didn't really know, but Cholita liked it.\n\n\"Such a waste\", Fancy commented.  \"Having to imagine everything.\"\n\nShe waved her hand, and I saw specific tarot cards laid down on the table.   A reading that needed interpreting.\n\n\"Gaze at each card you drew, and skim those emanations onto the table\", Fancy explained.\n\n\"The card is the key to selecting the right skimmings.\"\n\n\"A scene will form.  The skill is in making it relevant to the reading.  The problem is, anyone who can do that doesn't need the cards at all.\"\n\n\"But it would be so COOL\", I told her.\n\n\"One for the ladies I suppose\", Fancy suggested.\n\n\"How about this then?\", she commented.\n\n\"The cards may not be needed, but what if they were alive?  Outside intelligence is always good.\"\n\nI glanced back at the table with the cards on it.\n\nThe card to the right had a figure of a man in the middle.  He sat up out of the card, and stood up on the table. He started to walk to the other cards as if he were going to help rearrange them on the table.\n\n\"That's not the death card is it?\" I asked Fancy.\n\nI wasn't worried it was the death card.  I was hoping it was.\n\nI do tend to have a morbid sense of humor, and if there was going to be an inorganic being on the table during a reading, he'd be a lot easier to sell to customers if he were death.\n\nIt is after all a business.  \"The Joker\" would probably not be very reassuring.\n\nFancy didn't comment on that.  She said, \"look at what else you can do with this 'Wheel of Time' technique!\"\n\n\"What did you call it?\", I asked.\n\n\"Why not?\", she said.  \"Did you really think all techniques aren't  connected?\"\n\nShe showed me several more, very complicated, very exciting, and all gone.\n\nAll forgotten.\n\nBut I do recall one thing more.\n\nFancy said, \"This is why the red zone is a quagmire.  It's not evil. It's not a trap.  It's simply so much fun that you never want to leave.  All you have to do is say so, and I'll show it **all** to you.\"\n\nEdited\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Cover of the Wheel of Time", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2ypmanjtg4z61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ypmanjtg4z61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=072634f41deb7f3a89912d308fdf61a61519fc80"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ypmanjtg4z61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c924a8e77fb4425932d792f1a917758e6c475458"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ypmanjtg4z61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b5b96da7268f67e10f340b14ed07578a124c12"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ypmanjtg4z61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ba43ba2f4d64935b1052cbdda857f61e6b20ea8"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ypmanjtg4z61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cf39b3d523a6ebb9e65d929f70d5b8f491e7e76"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ypmanjtg4z61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c866004d7788b867cf17f12ea30dc56853c410d0"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ypmanjtg4z61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89c4cb1e169e37d5968c0ec61072dce2902bd6c3"}, "id": "2ypmanjtg4z61"}}, "name": "t3_nc5i8y", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/E7u-1a9QKGk3Xn2o5I2PvfUIuZwemlt5268MjqZIlLA.jpg", "edited": 1621013875.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1620988483.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2ypmanjtg4z61.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=89c4cb1e169e37d5968c0ec61072dce2902bd6c3\"&gt;Possibly the most powerful \\&amp;quot;witchcraft\\&amp;quot; from the books is on that cover.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the darkroom and wanted to write this down before I forgot all of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy decided to teach me again, at super speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would so much like to draw it up, but it would take days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It happened because I was trying to duplicate 3D translocation again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d joked to someone that maybe you could use 3D translocation to find a scout, the way you go into 4 gates dreaming to find a scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could simply materialize a 3D dream around yourself, and find a scout there.

And Genaro would be the master for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first reaction to that book cover had been negative. I pictured the &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot; type of fake sorcery teacher, lifting their arms in the air to make a big show of it  like some cheap TV shaman in a 70s series that ran out of plots and decided to borrow from Castaneda fever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was really popular back then, and if you ran out of ideas you could bring in a wise Indian character.  &amp;quot;Star Trek&amp;quot; even did it over multiple versions of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why the phony sorcery teachers out there change their name to sound more like a cheap TV shaman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll give themselves names like, &amp;quot;big puffy foot&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;dirty eagle feathers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure which is worse.  Doing that for forge your &amp;quot;credentials&amp;quot;, or calling yourself &amp;quot;Nagual&amp;quot; like it was  a cheap degree to pull teeth you got in South America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I realized, I was indeed standing there with my arms stretched out, trying to summon an image in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, that book cover was EXACTLY what I was doing.  Minus the animal skin loin cloth.  Cholita frowns on those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She by the way had drug herself out of bed at midnight, at which time she&amp;#39;s  usually settled in to wherever she&amp;#39;s hiding.  Which was good, because I found myself too tired to sit up on bed and start practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita got me up with a very quiet visit to the bathroom.  And I got to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced to my right, excited at the book deal thought I had just gotten about the Cover of Wheel of Time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I realized what that technique really way, I noticed that Fancy had changed locations.  She was standing just 3 feet away from me at normal height like a real person in my bedroom, except she was intense pink over purple haze, and her head was on fire with soothing waves of intense color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was nearly as bright as the sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All pink.  She also had a truly wicked smile on her face, the kind you would expect to find on a powerful  movie witch, just before she cast a horrible spell turning you into a rodent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there dumbfounded, watching wave after wave of flames rise up her head, from the shoulders. At the top they maintained the shape of her &amp;quot;fancy&amp;quot; hair.  Fancy is a bit of a showoff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier I&amp;#39;d seen Mystery, who is always quite conservative.  He floated above me while I did some warmup tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy pointed out into the center of where I was facing in the room.  Her head shook a tiny bit, just enough to make her hair fluff, and since it was on fire with pink flames the sight was truly amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to run and grab my computer, but she pointed up into the air at the height of the manifestation in that Wheel of Time cover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a surface.  Like stucco on the side of a house, but made out of the purple clouds, with grey and black forming the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy waved her arm.  Except she didn&amp;#39;t have one fully formed, so it was more like a ripple of pink light going out to the purple clouds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stucco surface changed to vertical lines, like you might see looking into a dense bamboo forest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did it again, and the details changed to yellow instead of black over purple.  I could see tiny lines which could easily be described as being just like the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They floated forward, and I saw some orange ones.  And it rotated in the sky a bit, and I saw some whitish ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It zoomed back, and there was a &amp;quot;bundle of emanations&amp;quot; right in front of me.  It had been built by selected &amp;quot;layers&amp;quot; of the emanations at large.  By emphasizing some, de-emphasizing others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as the old sorcerers had done, to t urn themselves into those weird creatures with yellow eyes, near the huge rock where Carlos was attacked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to t urn yourself into an inorganic being without dying, you might be able to figure that out from this wheel of time phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t grab emanations, and push away others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You simple gaze at them, and find what you want.  There are millions of layers there, but somehow the ones you can can be &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d seen that before.  After stopping the world you can in fact end up viewing the emanations in their raw form.  It&amp;#39;s just like you would visualize, which might in fact be no coincidence.  Sorcery was &amp;quot;conceived&amp;quot; by the old seers.  There&amp;#39;s no telling when  you see something like that, if you really would have seen it that way, if you hadn&amp;#39;t been told about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, &amp;quot;The Matrix&amp;quot; movie didn&amp;#39;t hurt any.  Very Castaneda, that movie.  The entire private class was excited when it came out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, just because I&amp;#39;d joked about it, there was Fancy pretending to be a street hooker.  So any ripple in &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, can cause entire worlds to form. Keep that in mind, the next time you&amp;#39;re insisting Chinese philosophy helps understand Castaneda.  Actually it harms that.  Unless you want a book deal instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed at the bundle remembering that in the world of raw emanations, if you gaze at a bundle you get sucked into that world.  You simply find yourself standing in a perfectly real place you never saw before.  If you don&amp;#39;t stay long, you can turn back to where you came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Turning the head&amp;quot; is a technique also.  We just have no info on it.  But it&amp;#39;s sort of a &amp;quot;Gaze relocator&amp;quot;, which can access both space and time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My view of the bundle zoomed in, so I was looking at it from a different point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was composed of &amp;quot;surfaces&amp;quot; of emanations. I&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;noticed&amp;quot; some, so those lit up.  Like giving some wires a little power to make them glow.  Others had not been &amp;quot;noticed&amp;quot;, so they didn&amp;#39;t glow.  Based on &amp;quot;skimming&amp;quot; the ones I could notice, and ignoring the rest, I could build a phantom world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily one that wasn&amp;#39;t real at some point, as I found out later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy indicated I had learned that point, and started another.  She was almost smirking at me, pleased with herself for getting me to understand that so fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my head back to see if I could still perceive the bundle, but as I turned it my gaze ran over surfaces of fibers floating in the air.  I was noticing layers of surfaces available at each point in the room.  You had to &amp;quot;fan&amp;quot; them, to get them to materialize into something more visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The head turning was most effective when done at the same speed as turning the head in recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My original idea to make recapitulation fully visual, to add some magic to the Castaneda community which still emphasizes what Carlos emphasized back in 98, namely recap and tensegrity,  involved teaching them to materialize a &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; made of colored light and then attack that to their vision and use it to scan back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I realized that &amp;quot;skimming for emanation surfaces&amp;quot; in the air was more effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy spoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Standing Recapitulation&amp;quot;, she said.  &amp;quot;The Arms help add energy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was stubborn.   I thought about people sitting up in bed next to their spouse, unable to wave their arms around the room like an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I&amp;#39;d turned into Carlos, challenging don Juan when it made no sense to argue with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose we&amp;#39;re all filled with that desire to stump our teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lowered them to my side and asked Fancy, &amp;quot;But can&amp;#39;t you just use the gaze in place of the arms, and maybe intensify it a bit?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She seemed to nod, but it wasn&amp;#39;t a very convincing nod.  Maybe she was just looking back to the center of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My arms were now frozen at my side. It wasn&amp;#39;t my doing.  I was even surprised. My body seemed to have shrunk in width a bit, to keep my arms immobile on my sides.  As if Fancy had wrapped me in invisible plastic like some leftovers from dinner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly turned back and my gaze intensified every puff of purple it ran over.  The plastic wrapping made it possibly only to turn smoothly, like I was standing on a rotating spice rack on a kitchen counter.  A &amp;quot;Lazy Susan&amp;quot; I believe they call it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This surface is natural and available to everyone&amp;quot;, Fancy said.  I immediately knew she was criticizing my obsession with collecting exotic surfaces in the dark room.  I felt a little embarassment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had another contrary thought, which is perhaps how it goes when talking to a dreaming emissary.  It becomes a teacher and student situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned back and Fancy said, &amp;quot;Yes, it comes in red too, don&amp;#39;t worry...  I haven&amp;#39;t forgotten Zuleica.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the dense puffs turned red.  The shape and texture of the puffs was more blurry, but it was clearly red now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I concentrated on a scene I might be able to form from my past.  Cholita at a Mexican restaurant on the roof of a Korean mall, dancing to a female mariachi band.  With the gay waiter handsomely bribed to keep her wine glass full at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I got nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided maybe that was too emotional of a memory to use right now, and simply eliminated any thought of past events from my mind, to see what formed on its own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I turned my head, it caused a woman holding a baby to form.  She was sitting in a chair in front of me, with the baby across her arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The process was the same as you might imagine for &amp;quot;skimming emanations&amp;quot;.  The movement of the head back and forth let me select some features, and discard others.  It was if each sweep left or right offered me a tiny piece of the scene, but if I didn&amp;#39;t like it, it was gone by the time I did the reverse sweep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, it became my sister holding her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned back to Fancy and said, &amp;quot;It works!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her wicked grin had left and her face was more normal. Her head wasn&amp;#39;t on fire anymore.  And while I couldn&amp;#39;t see her entire body, she at least had a full upper half and very clear features on her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might criticize the view because she was still at least 25% transparent, and I could see my furniture behind her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except...  The room was pitch black.  It ought to be hard to complain about her being transparent and you can see things behind her, when that was impossible too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember this: self-pity is a constant enemy.  It can manifest in &amp;quot;fussy&amp;quot; ways, and if you aren&amp;#39;t alert you&amp;#39;ll fall for your own tricks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the idea to recapitulate a creepy scene.  As a child I used to sneak to a specific alcove of a shopping mall, where I could find a scary but exhilarating feeling in the air, if I forced all thoughts from my mind.   It wasn&amp;#39;t so much that at 6 years old I had figured out I needed to remove the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But rather I had learned the &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; of sleep walking a little bit, and could cause it most easily at that spot, because I had a memory of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trying to find out if Fancy was the very same inorganic being who had visited me as a monster, in my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 5 years old, I was attacked physically by a demon.  While laying in bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it Fancy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to recapitulation that scene, but found myself in Fancy&amp;#39;s ice cave instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was floating up higher, with her head pressed against another being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Bob, I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except Bob has turned into woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s the more powerful of us you know&amp;quot;, Fancy said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The quiet ones always are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideas started to flood my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Waking four gates dreaming is easier than doing it asleep&amp;quot;, I thought. I could see the entire sequence in my mind as images, one after the other. Each gate and how to translate it to dreaming awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it hadn&amp;#39;t come from Fancy.  She was still pressed against Bob, motionless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they started to recede back into the ice cave.  They had almost faded into nothing, when I looked around hoping to get a clearer look at the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I commented to Fancy, &amp;quot;You can bring me here any time you like&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy&amp;#39;s head reappeared again without Bob, just 2 feet away from mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was obviously waiting for me to say more.  The look on her face encouraged me to go on. She seemed to float towards me, even though she was already life size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, I&amp;#39;m not going to say that. But I do genuinely like visiting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She faded away, and in the middle of the room I saw a round tarot card table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nyei&amp;#39;s favorite?&amp;quot;, Fancy asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her I didn&amp;#39;t really know, but Cholita liked it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Such a waste&amp;quot;, Fancy commented.  &amp;quot;Having to imagine everything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She waved her hand, and I saw specific tarot cards laid down on the table.   A reading that needed interpreting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gaze at each card you drew, and skim those emanations onto the table&amp;quot;, Fancy explained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The card is the key to selecting the right skimmings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A scene will form.  The skill is in making it relevant to the reading.  The problem is, anyone who can do that doesn&amp;#39;t need the cards at all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But it would be so COOL&amp;quot;, I told her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One for the ladies I suppose&amp;quot;, Fancy suggested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about this then?&amp;quot;, she commented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The cards may not be needed, but what if they were alive?  Outside intelligence is always good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced back at the table with the cards on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The card to the right had a figure of a man in the middle.  He sat up out of the card, and stood up on the table. He started to walk to the other cards as if he were going to help rearrange them on the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not the death card is it?&amp;quot; I asked Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t worried it was the death card.  I was hoping it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do tend to have a morbid sense of humor, and if there was going to be an inorganic being on the table during a reading, he&amp;#39;d be a lot easier to sell to customers if he were death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is after all a business.  &amp;quot;The Joker&amp;quot; would probably not be very reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy didn&amp;#39;t comment on that.  She said, &amp;quot;look at what else you can do with this &amp;#39;Wheel of Time&amp;#39; technique!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did you call it?&amp;quot;, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why not?&amp;quot;, she said.  &amp;quot;Did you really think all techniques aren&amp;#39;t  connected?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She showed me several more, very complicated, very exciting, and all gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I do recall one thing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy said, &amp;quot;This is why the red zone is a quagmire.  It&amp;#39;s not evil. It&amp;#39;s not a trap.  It&amp;#39;s simply so much fun that you never want to leave.

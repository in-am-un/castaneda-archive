It all makes sense. I just cant get over the experiences that people have on psychedelics. I dont fully understand why you say psychedelics have a ugly dead end, but surely the OG shamans of the past that used things like Ayahuasca and others cant have been faking it. Surely there has to be real healing that they do with it, the same way that the brujos do the opposite. From my understanding its a tool, but the ugly dead end part is hopefully not the case. In any case, when I combine them with meditation, or sometimes on meditation alone, I can feel \"energy\" for lack of better terms... like my body aligning on a deep level and \"unwinding knots\" of the subconscious and things of this sort. There surely are benefits, but once again I agree that you can get stuck just culvitating this \"one pointed attention\" that buddism speaks about.

It all makes sense. I just cant get over the experiences that people have on psychedelics. I dont fully understand why you say psychedelics have a ugly dead end, but surely the OG shamans of the past that used things like Ayahuasca and others cant have been faking it. Surely there has to be real healing that they do with it, the same way that the brujos do the opposite. From my understanding its a tool, but the ugly dead end part is hopefully not the case. In any case, when I combine them with meditation, or sometimes on meditation alone, I can feel &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot; for lack of better terms... like my body aligning on a deep level and &amp;quot;unwinding knots&amp;quot; of the subconscious and things of this sort.

Trying to pretend that your once a month lucky day, is daily so that your friends will be impressed.\n\nThe Astral Travel people do that, and none has ever escaped that hell when they came here. Just can't give up the pretending.   And think there's no way you can know, so how dare you point it out.\n\nBut they only harm themselves.  By doing whatever they actually do, so infrequently.\n\nAnd trust me, sorcery is so vast that we NEED daily to even keep up.  The infrequency of 4 gates dreaming coolness, is not enough to remain present between visits. It fades too fast to skip any days.\n\nWaking, you can \"feel\" the presence of their world at any time, once you've seen it and it starts to materialize.\n\nThat's what you can't afford to lose. The \"sight of it\" in your mind.\n\nSummoning IOBs by \"remembering them\" is almost like listening for your favorite song in darkness, with nothing but the nighttime sounds of the city traffic.\n\nAnd you catch a tiny bit of it off in the distance, 10 houses away. It's probably not really there, but the complexity of all the sounds of a city at that low level of volume, lets your second attention \"help you\" find it.\n\nAnd once you can \"hook it\", it becomes loud enough to hear clearly!\n\nWe don't explore auditory second attention enough in here.  That's my fault.\n\nYou can also summon the IOBs like that when awake, but best not by hearing.  Don Juan taught Carlos that in a forest, with an instrument he made to create a weird sound.  But it's a lot easier in darkroom, by the memory of their past visual appearances.\n\nSuch as their pinkish fog on which faces form.\n\nI followed one a long time like that this morning, just \"treating it was real\".\n\nTalking to it, I got it to smile. Then a friend materialized, and I eventually found myself fully in their caves.\n\nIt's so easy to do, if I hadn't written it here I'd never have remembered that.  I'd nearly forgotten.\n\nWhen you treat things in the second attention as real, the assemblage point moves to \"tune them in\".\n\nBut that happens at the blue line!  in the river of shit.  We keep treating our worries and memories of grief as real, in our internal dialogue.\n\nSo we can't escape them!\n\nI suppose Carlos thought \"Art of Dreaming\" would give people a \"back door\" where they could practice treating the second attention as real. And counteract the obsession with the blue line reality.\n\nBut no one did.

Trying to pretend that your once a month lucky day, is daily so that your friends will be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Astral Travel people do that, and none has ever escaped that hell when they came here. Just can&amp;#39;t give up the pretending.   And think there&amp;#39;s no way you can know, so how dare you point it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they only harm themselves.  By doing whatever they actually do, so infrequently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And trust me, sorcery is so vast that we NEED daily to even keep up.  The infrequency of 4 gates dreaming coolness, is not enough to remain present between visits. It fades too fast to skip any days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waking, you can &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the presence of their world at any time, once you&amp;#39;ve seen it and it starts to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what you can&amp;#39;t afford to lose. The &amp;quot;sight of it&amp;quot; in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summoning IOBs by &amp;quot;remembering them&amp;quot; is almost like listening for your favorite song in darkness, with nothing but the nighttime sounds of the city traffic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you catch a tiny bit of it off in the distance, 10 houses away. It&amp;#39;s probably not really there, but the complexity of all the sounds of a city at that low level of volume, lets your second attention &amp;quot;help you&amp;quot; find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And once you can &amp;quot;hook it&amp;quot;, it becomes loud enough to hear clearly!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t explore auditory second attention enough in here.  That&amp;#39;s my fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also summon the IOBs like that when awake, but best not by hearing.  Don Juan taught Carlos that in a forest, with an instrument he made to create a weird sound.  But it&amp;#39;s a lot easier in darkroom, by the memory of their past visual appearances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as their pinkish fog on which faces form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed one a long time like that this morning, just &amp;quot;treating it was real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talking to it, I got it to smile. Then a friend materialized, and I eventually found myself fully in their caves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so easy to do, if I hadn&amp;#39;t written it here I&amp;#39;d never have remembered that.  I&amp;#39;d nearly forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you treat things in the second attention as real, the assemblage point moves to &amp;quot;tune them in&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that happens at the blue line!  in the river of shit.  We keep treating our worries and memories of grief as real, in our internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we can&amp;#39;t escape them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose Carlos thought &amp;quot;Art of Dreaming&amp;quot; would give people a &amp;quot;back door&amp;quot; where they could practice treating the second attention as real. And counteract the obsession with the blue line reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one did.  They just trapped themselves in &amp;quot;book deal&amp;quot; thinking, which meant, they weren&amp;#39;t treating 4 gates dreaming as real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were treating the benefits their greed imagined they could derive from it, in the form of attention and money from other people.

At the least, you can verify that's not a \"normal\" dream scene.

I do.\n\nOr semi-awake, such as when Carlos and Carol tried to use their world to jump off to somewhere else.\n\nYou just make a pitstop in their realm (not as hard to do as it would sound to beginners), and then from there you go to the one you wanted.\n\nHow?

Closed eyes?  Invalid.\n\nSure, not always. But just to be safe, consider closed eyes to be invalid unless you are female.\n\nOtherwise you might as well go hang out in the delusional magic subreddits, where everyone is sitting still with their eyes closed pretending to be the Buddha, or worse lying in bed, and then they just \"get lucky\", doze off, have a fast vision or dream, and start making up stuff when they snap out of it.\n\nWith a whole subreddit of everyone making up stuff, it creates the feeling some of it has to be real.\n\nBecause how could everyone be lying?\n\nWell they are.  And it's totally common.\n\nHave some sense!  Are the Jehovah's Witnesses really the only ones going to \"heaven\"?\n\nDid the buddha guy really see \"the golden buddha\" on his  head?\n\nYou can make any excuse you like for \"it can't be all a lie\", but you still have to account for all of the world's religions and magical systems, which say what you're doing is a lie, and theirs is not.\n\nIt is in fact all made up.\n\nThe only thing you can control, is yourself.  When it's not made up, and you weren't asleep, you're in business.\n\nTo be safe do all of your magic fully awake, eyes open, completely sober.\n\nThe only advantage you really need is that it's absolutely dark in the room.\n\nExcept that, it soon won't be.  The room will be FILLED with amazing sights.\n\nAnd if you like, you can learn to do it in full sunlight.\n\nWe seem to have more than 1 who can do that.\n\nAnd Carlos and the witches could of course.\n\nSo there you are in your darkroom and by whatever technique, you summon the world of the inorganic beings.\n\nIt'll just materialize around you.  Or even better, it'll stay on one wall only.  So you don't actually have to step into that world. Just have it visible, but remain in your own space.\n\nThink of it as a \"Mega Puff\"!\n\nThere's nothing worse than sitting in darkness forcing off your internal dialogue, and nothing is happening.\n\nTruth is, you're still thinking like an idiot.\n\nBecause if you stop that internal dialogue you don't stink so much, and the energy of your double (the guy who runs around in dreams), comes closer to you.\n\nAnd with darkness you can see that as a puff or smear of colored light.\n\nYou're in business!\n\nEventually you'll be able to hold a BRILLIANT little blob of purple energy in your hand.\n\nThat's a \"puff\". And it's great for helping you keep that internal dialogue off.\n\nIt won't do the whole job, but it's a lot less unpleasant to force silence when you have magic in the palm of your hand.\n\nYou can use those puffs to turbocharge your tensegrity.\n\nIf you do that, and remember that silence is the most important thing, one day you'll look at the wall and you'll be in HELL.\n\nOf course, it's not really.\n\nBut there's a reddish world seemingly on fire, with strange demons sticking out of the walls.\n\nA baker here, with a funny baker's tall hat.\n\nA woman with one eye missing right next to him.\n\nAn Asian soldier next, and then some kind of insect humanoid.\n\nAll there sticking out of holes on the wall.\n\nDon't get afraid and panic, or they'll flee!  They don't like that much energy to be released all of a sudden, in their own world.\n\nThe sight of their realm is a \"Mega Puff\", because looking at that you ain't returning to Kansas any time soon!\n\n(A wizard of oz reference for foreigners).\n\nAs long as you make even a tiny effort, the sight of their world will hold your assemblage point at that position.\n\nWhere the dark energy of the inorganic beings is right there, filling your entire wall.\n\nThat's how you \"use awareness as a feature of the environment\".\n\nI suppose the idea don Juan had in \"Art of Dreaming\",  when he got Carlos and Carol to try to do that, was that the IOBs would let you leave in a different direction than you came from.\n\nThey do for me!\n\nBut I suppose having 2 double beings right there, was more than they could handle.\n\nThe inorganic beings seem to be hoarders. Of human awareness.\n\nSo when Carlos and Carol tried to take the next step, they found themselves inside a little shack in the middle of a phantom world.\n\nBed in the middle, clothes place there for them to wear.\n\nI suppose, they started out naked in bed together in a hotel in Mexico? Was it Tula even...\n\nCarlos always seems to have liked to get some \"naked\" in there somewhere.\n\nIt's all through the books.\n\nHe even had don Genaro ordering him to take off his pants.\n\nI kind of draw the line there myself.  I don't care how much fun he is. I'm not taking off my pants for a man who loves potty jokes as much as Genaro seems to have.\n\nBut they didn't get to where don Juan wanted them to go.\n\nInstead, if they'd put on those clothes their memory would have begun to mutate until they couldn't remember how they got to that shack.\n\nAnd soon, they'd believe they actually live there.\n\nThat's one reason I kind of like the Bosch view of their world.\n\nIt's hard to get confused and think you actually live there.\n\nBy the way, if your inorganic being puts a \"gift\" on the floor in front of you, don't pick it up!\n\nDon't touch anything in their world.\n\nIf they trap you, study the trap with interest.  Don't be afraid.  Just be curious.\n\nIf you aren't afraid, they undo it.\n\nAnd they seem to only try the same trick twice before they give it a break for a while.\n\nWith a slight modification the second time.

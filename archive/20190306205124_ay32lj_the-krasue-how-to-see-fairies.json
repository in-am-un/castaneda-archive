Presumably he was introducing us to the \u201cintent\u201d of it, so that when we got around to trying it, we\u2019d get a less messy view of the phenomena.  He even had a painting to show us.   I believe he passed this knowledge on at some workshops, so there are more people out there who were hooked to his intent.  Someone out there might even have a printed copy of the painting he had duplicated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve since tried to teach this technique to multiple people, but so far the results have been less than spectacular.  While \u201cseeing\u201d the wall is inevitable, that it would be well enough organized to impress a beginner turns out to be less common.  But there are other alternatives to the wall.   The point is to merge the second attention with the first attention, in waking.  The technique to do that in this case is to watch for lights in the darkness.  Everyone\u2019s going to see lights in the darkness if they practice silence, but if you get to the wall and it\u2019s malformed, or so vague you don\u2019t feel it can be manipulated, you can switch to the next thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis next thing is bordering on witchcraft.  While sorcery might be defined as the pursuit of knowledge, witchcraft could likewise be defined as the pursuit of practical applications for sorcery knowledge.  In this case, there\u2019s a phenomenon which can be exploited to produce many outcomes.  And just for fun, let\u2019s call it, \u201cSummoning demons.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust kidding.  Carlos\u2019 sorcery is so difficult to learn that it\u2019s a very good idea to take advantage of any \u201chook\u201d you can find, even if it comes with a tainted history.  Don\u2019t wait around for a father figure to zap you. It almost surely won\u2019t happen until you really don\u2019t need it anymore. And you certainly don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval to explore your own consciousness.  Carlos called this process, \u201cNavigating\u201d, and it\u2019s essentially finding and picking up breadcrumb trails to see where they lead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypnogogic images in particular are fairly common and deserve not to be ignored. They are after all, self-contained miniature waking dreams.  That means, they\u2019re entry into the second attention. Normally they\u2019re something you see \u201celsewhere\u201d, kind of like how visions can appear on Carlos\u2019 wall. They\u2019re in front of you, or above you, maybe on the ceiling, or out there a few feet away if you\u2019re lying on your side in bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to remain that way.  In fact, you can learn to hold hypnogogic images in your hand.  This is also how crystal balls work.  You project your second attention into the ball in a passive manner. It works easiest if you just let it, and don\u2019t concentrate on any outcome.  You get a sort of viewing portal to infinity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have a crystal ball around (they\u2019re kind of expensive), you can use your TV.  Just make sure it\u2019s off and don\u2019t get obsessed with what you see in there!  I once saw a rerun of a 60s sitcom featuring \u201cOpie Taylor\u201d, except that the storyline was quite bizarre.  I kept trying to switch channels so I could watch the Twilight Zone, which disrupted the whole thing and it went blank.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind, all of this is with extraordinary effort and fairly profound silence.  But those elements aren\u2019t always necessary, and sometimes you just get \u201clucky\u201d and see hypnogogic images with no effort at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA common item among hypnogogic images are \u201cfloating heads\u201d.   If you google the topic of \u201cghost floating heads -Halloween\u201d, you\u2019ll currently find many personal stores from people who have seen these.   Some discussions say that ordinary ghosts can choose what manifests, and so can appear as just a head if they desire.  Others say these are a specific type of spirit which has no body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you learn to see them yourself, they can be both interactive and non-interactive.  In my experience, the non-interactive ones just need a little encouragement.  I\u2019ve gotten the most stubborn to pose for me, after a little coaxing.   Flattery doesn\u2019t hurt.  It\u2019s the feelings that manipulate the images, not the content of what you say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne even pretended to be a Disney style princess for me, after I told her she was very pretty.  She was just a static female head floating in front of me, but after I coaxed her she turned a bit, so I could see the shoulder of her costume, gave me a big simile, and then morphed into a form almost unrecognizable as a head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was frowning in a most unpleasant way.   I guess that\u2019s to be expected if you go around flirting with strangers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story of a beautiful young woman\u2019s head luring you to your doom is common in Asian movies.   There\u2019s often something horrible trailing it, perhaps just to let you know it\u2019s not actually a beautiful young woman.  I like to think it\u2019s more like a commentary on how Asians feel about women, except that seeing floating female heads is in fact common everywhere in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Thailand, one of the most magically inclined countries on earth, they have the Krasue.  It\u2019s a young and beautiful female head with no body,  usually with a horrific expression frozen on her face as if she\u2019s been murdered by decapitation, with her entrails following her in a classic Casper the Ghost style tail.  She\u2019s often a ghastly bluish grey color.  To quote from Wikipedia about the Penanggalan:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThere are similar myths of creatures with almost exactly the same features. Among ethnic groups in Indonesia, the ghost is called Leyak among the Balinese, Kuyang by the Dayak people of Kalimantan, or Palasik (or Pelesit) by the Minangkabau people. In Thailand it is called the Krasue, in Laos it is the Kasu or Phi-Kasu and in Cambodia it is the Ap.  According to the folklore of that region, the Penanggalan is a detached female head capable of flying about on its own.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Krasue are associated with small ponds and swamps, of which there are a great many in Thailand.  Some say they feast on frogs and other creatures around the pond.  But their true association with water is possibly due to a glowing light seen over some swamps.  Note: Inorganic beings are often associated with water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlowing swamp gas is not just the excuse for crashed alien vehicles.  It\u2019s also part of folklore.  To quote Wikipedia, \u201cThe Will-o\u2019-the-wisp is a \\`ghost light\u2019 seen by travelers at night, over bogs, swamps, or marshes.\u201d   Hermann Hendrich (1854-1931) made a painting of its appearance when battling small swamp snakes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know whether people see glowing swamp gas and their own mind interprets a hypnogogic image inside it, or whether people see the same colors as you can see using Carlos\u2019 wall technique, and assume it\u2019s something from the physical environment.   Maybe people are only seeing the same floating heads you can see from the comfort of your bed, but they\u2019re seeing it outside at night and not realizing what the source is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps they\u2019re walking alone at night, rather sleepy, and since it\u2019s Thailand, they\u2019ve possibly been chewing on a few too many Kratom leaves.  Or maybe betel nuts.   I once overdosed on betel nuts in Taiwan, and saw 2 allies pretending to be a really weird looking couple.  They were leaning against each other heavily, like they couldn't stand on their own, walking down the street at a very slow pace.  I looked down the street away from them, to see if anyone else noticed this weird couple, and when I looked back, they were 2 city blocks away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe results of many human \"supplements\" could not be too dissimilar to the hypnogogic images produced by marijuana.    And since floating heads are a very common element of hypnogogic images, eventually you could have multiple accounts of people who say a floating woman\u2019s head appeared above a body of water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStories like that spread far in Asia due to the vast history and concentration of the population.  And magic shop vendors love to elaborate on them to increase marketability.  The Daoist hierarchy of heaven is a good example of how things become more elaborate over time, resulting in more possible products to sell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, we get the Krasue.    Or maybe, there really are floating head spirits.   True or not true doesn\u2019t matter in sorcery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypnogogic images are said to appear when a person is half asleep.  This can happen before sleeping, or just after waking from a dream.  If you want to experiment, the next time you wake from a dream, don\u2019t move at all.  Keep still with your eyes closed and wait.  There\u2019s a good chance hypnogogic images will start.  There\u2019s also an even better chance you won\u2019t remember most of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that\u2019s why that method is too random, or perhaps not productive enough to be worth pursuing.  It\u2019s a good sign that more is possible, but in order to make use of this you need to be able to practice it any time, for as long as you have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve reached the character limit, I\u2019ll have to post the second part separately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Krasue (How to see Fairies)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ay32lj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1551914382.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1551901884.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere between 1996 and 1998, Carlos explained \u201cthe wall\u201d technique to us in private classes, and read from its surface daily.

The goal is to learn to manipulate the energy you can see in the dark, find hypnogogic images in it, watch them mutate to select a pleasing form for dreaming, and then hold one in place so that you can stare at it until it mutates into a bar of energy.\n\nDarken your room, cover the LEDs with aluminum tape, sit up on the bed with pillows,  and watch the darkness in silence.  The more you can turn off your internal dialogue, the better it will work.  This is something you will learn with absolute certainty, if you practice silence. It enhances the connection of awareness to our sensory input.\n\nHow dark it needs to be is up to you. I prefer so dark you can\u2019t walk around, with a few leaks here and there .  But once in a while I get out of bed to go to the bathroom where it\u2019s not as dark, and I\u2019m amazed that it still works.\n\nYou\u2019ll go through a state of not believing it\u2019s going to work, and you\u2019ll probably claim you see nothing. Later you\u2019ll realize how absurd that is.  We've merely learned to ignore it.  We rationalize it as eye defects, dust, a side effect, just noise, too faint to be useful.  And yes it is. But it\u2019s also something you can see, which should not be there.   If you become silent, that will drift the assemblage point.  It\u2019ll drift until your mind begins to add things, via intent.\n\nI can\u2019t help much with this part, you just have to stop being lazy and do it for hours each night.  The eyes don\u2019t become fully accustomed to the darkness for at least 1 hour, at which point the colors become stronger.  Don\u2019t fantasize while you\u2019re doing it. If you find your mind focusing on something else, you\u2019ve fixed your assemblage point there. It\u2019s not going to shift from the silence.\n\nAnd even if you learn to get silent, you\u2019ll still find yourself fantasizing without words, thinking about what John said today, or when you\u2019re going to fix that tire.  But those will be at the level of feelings if you get silent, or perhaps a vague image in the mind. That\u2019s still no good.\n\nAlso, there are a few \u201ccheap\u201d tricks you can use to see colors.  You can stare at something bright, like an LED or candle, then turn it off and look at the afterimage.   You can cough. You can roll your eyes around.  You can gently press on them.  Any of these should produce colors in the darkness.\n\nWhen you figure out how to see the colors, you're ready.  You need to interact with them.  I like to use my open hand and \u201cscoop\u201d.  When you first try this, and you can see that you\u2019ve scooped up some, you might have some doubts because your head has to move in sync with your hand.  Don\u2019t worry about it.\n\nCarlos liked to explain how our energy needs \u201credeployment\u201d.  Try scooping as far out as your hand can reach, and apply that to your body.\n\nTry to compress a ball of energy.  Place one hand on top of a virtual basketball just in reach, and the other under it.  Separate the hands so that you can squish them down on the ball.  Then swap hands, bottom to top.  Try putting your hands on the sides of the ball, and blow gently into it.  See if you can make it brighter.  You can indeed learn that!  But if it\u2019s difficult, keep in mind, your assemblage point simply hasn\u2019t moved.  You aren\u2019t inept, you\u2019re stuck.\n\nAmidst the vague colors, watch for more vivid details.   Those will happen in the brighter puffs.  Or better to say, some lines or some kind of detail which might look like a piece of alien text will be inside a puff of light.  And you\u2019ll realize you\u2019ve been ignoring those.\n\nThat\u2019s the point at which hypnogogic heads can materialize.  Carlos called it a \u201csworl\u201d, probably because it does indeed sort of spin once it\u2019s active, and it generates dreaming images which emerge from it like dense smoke trails.  That\u2019s also where text comes from, when you read off the wall.\n\nIf you keep this up, at some point you\u2019ll see a hypnogogic image floating out there.  At first, it might just be 2 vague eyes, sunken into one of the energy balls, with a hint of a mouth.  When you see the first occurrence of that, make sure you don\u2019t mess it up by fantasizing.  A common fantasy seems to be, that you\u2019re going to explain this to a friend, how you learned to do it.  Or what will you write in your book about sorcery?\n\nYou have to cut that stuff out!    If you have in mind to pimp for someone else, you won\u2019t be able to learn sorcery.  No one from Carlos\u2019 classes who had that pimp mindset, succeeded in getting very far.\n\nBut the good news is, if you see that hint of a hypnogogic image, hopefully a face, that means your assemblage point has moved. It\u2019s not going to move back just because you had a fantasy. Just return to silence.\n\nThe next hypnogogic image to come along will likely be a full-fledged face, complete with intriguing expression.  It\u2019ll likely be a dull bluish grey, much like the illustrations of floating heads you find on the web.  Keep watching the head, and if you feel like it, greet it warmly.  Speak out loud to it.\n\nThe goal now is to generate as many floating head images as you can.  I don\u2019t mean more than 1.  I\u2019ve only seen more than one a few times, and they were pressed together in the same puff of energy.  What you\u2019re trying to do is see more varieties, more different faces.  Notice if you can see from the neck down, or if it\u2019s just the head.  Look to see if there\u2019s a background associated with it.  Clothes, hair.   Some even have eyeglasses and hats.\n\nNow\u2019s the hard part.   You want to hold a floating head in the middle of the room, static for long enough to make requests.  Tell it what you want it to be.  Coax it to mutate.    While coaxing it, stare at it without wavering.\n\nChances are you won\u2019t be able to hold it, and at first they\u2019ll seem to appear and disappear without any way for you to control them. But as your assemblage point drifts to a more favorable position, you\u2019ll be able to get one to remain for at least 10 seconds.\n\nIf you can stare at it for that long, you can make it change into the shape you want.  This will become a force in your dreaming, when you encounter inorganic beings. They seem to remember the last interaction, and will remain in that form until something gives them reason to change.\n\nIt\u2019s probably best to select a pleasing form.  Frightening forms will be the norm, until you get the hang of it.  If that doesn\u2019t bother you, you can keep those.  But I wouldn\u2019t recommend the Krasue.    I showed the picture to an Asian friend who\u2019s very skeptical about all this, and all he could say was, \u201cDon\u2019t do that!!!\u201d\n\nI know someone who wanted them to appear as naked people.  I'd advise against going down that road. The next thing you know, you\u2019ll be constantly dreaming about similar imagery.  The inorganic beings like to lure people closer and closer to their world, or at least a shared view of it.  Carlos was plagued in his final months by the inorganics pulling him into their watery world.\n\nInstead, try a beautiful Fairy shape.  What could be better than watching a Fairy fly around in your bedroom?    While you\u2019re doing this, pay particular attention to tiny dots of bright white and blue.  Some call these \u201cFairy Lights\u201d, but they seem to simply be something humans can see in the dark.\n\nThey also seem to have awareness.  Typically, they dart past you for less than a second, but are very clear to see.  These are not vague at all.  The blue dots can sometimes materialize, then burn out without having moved in space. Once you learn to see them, this will even happen during the day, when you weren\u2019t trying for them.  Note: I wouldn't recommend a technique unless I had taught it successfully to someone else.\n\nThe final technique you can try, is to identify whether the floating image is real, or just a phantasm.\n\nReal?  Yes.  Does it have some small component that is real, even if it\u2019s not actually a Fairy.    Remember that Carlos explained that the overlap between inorganic beings and us is very small.  Our \u201cintent\u201d fills in all the missing details.\n\nThis technique is simple; you keep staring until it reaches a final form.  It\u2019ll mutate, fuss around, contort, but finally it\u2019ll either go away, or become a bar of light.  Sometimes, you\u2019ll only see the bar inside it.\n\nOr you could have picked up a low energy inorganic being, in which case they only look like a few bright dots and squares of light, connected with weak lines.  \n\nThe bar of light is from Carlos' allies, which he passed on to us in class.\n\nA note about inorganic beings.  Carlos was never very explicit about whether the inorganics interact with people in dreaming.   Certainly, his Allies can.  And I've observed that there does seem to be constant interaction between us, and inorganic beings.    If you can wake up in dreams, you can use that technique to identify which dream beings are phantasms, and which are not. Carlos never explained if the technique is good for both waking and dreaming, but if you do what I\u2019ve described you\u2019ll have tried both.", "edited": 1565995885.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ei37nnt", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic technique is the same as the wall technique, minus the wall.  The goal is to learn to manipulate the energy you can see in the dark, find hypnogogic images in it, watch them mutate to select a pleasing form for dreaming, and then hold one in place so that you can stare at it until it mutates into a bar of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darken your room, cover the LEDs with aluminum tape, sit up on the bed with pillows,  and watch the darkness in silence.  The more you can turn off your internal dialogue, the better it will work.  This is something you will learn with absolute certainty, if you practice silence. It enhances the connection of awareness to our sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How dark it needs to be is up to you. I prefer so dark you can\u2019t walk around, with a few leaks here and there .  But once in a while I get out of bed to go to the bathroom where it\u2019s not as dark, and I\u2019m amazed that it still works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll go through a state of not believing it\u2019s going to work, and you\u2019ll probably claim you see nothing. Later you\u2019ll realize how absurd that is.  We&amp;#39;ve merely learned to ignore it.  We rationalize it as eye defects, dust, a side effect, just noise, too faint to be useful.  And yes it is. But it\u2019s also something you can see, which should not be there.   If you become silent, that will drift the assemblage point.  It\u2019ll drift until your mind begins to add things, via intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t help much with this part, you just have to stop being lazy and do it for hours each night.  The eyes don\u2019t become fully accustomed to the darkness for at least 1 hour, at which point the colors become stronger.  Don\u2019t fantasize while you\u2019re doing it. If you find your mind focusing on something else, you\u2019ve fixed your assemblage point there. It\u2019s not going to shift from the silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even if you learn to get silent, you\u2019ll still find yourself fantasizing without words, thinking about what John said today, or when you\u2019re going to fix that tire.  But those will be at the level of feelings if you get silent, or perhaps a vague image in the mind. That\u2019s still no good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, there are a few \u201ccheap\u201d tricks you can use to see colors.  You can stare at something bright, like an LED or candle, then turn it off and look at the afterimage.   You can cough. You can roll your eyes around.  You can gently press on them.  Any of these should produce colors in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you figure out how to see the colors, you&amp;#39;re ready.  You need to interact with them.  I like to use my open hand and \u201cscoop\u201d.  When you first try this, and you can see that you\u2019ve scooped up some, you might have some doubts because your head has to move in sync with your hand.  Don\u2019t worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos liked to explain how our energy needs \u201credeployment\u201d.  Try scooping as far out as your hand can reach, and apply that to your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to compress a ball of energy.  Place one hand on top of a virtual basketball just in reach, and the other under it.  Separate the hands so that you can squish them down on the ball.  Then swap hands, bottom to top.  Try putting your hands on the sides of the ball, and blow gently into it.  See if you can make it brighter.  You can indeed learn that!  But if it\u2019s difficult, keep in mind, your assemblage point simply hasn\u2019t moved.  You aren\u2019t inept, you\u2019re stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amidst the vague colors, watch for more vivid details.   Those will happen in the brighter puffs.  Or better to say, some lines or some kind of detail which might look like a piece of alien text will be inside a puff of light.  And you\u2019ll realize you\u2019ve been ignoring those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the point at which hypnogogic heads can materialize.  Carlos called it a \u201csworl\u201d, probably because it does indeed sort of spin once it\u2019s active, and it generates dreaming images which emerge from it like dense smoke trails.  That\u2019s also where text comes from, when you read off the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep this up, at some point you\u2019ll see a hypnogogic image floating out there.

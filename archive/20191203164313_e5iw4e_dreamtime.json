Or that it's going to \"do something\", or transform you in some wonderful way.\n\nI jokingly called that the \"book deal mind\" in earlier posts, but there's probably enough of that in the database.\n\nReally, it's about self-importance.  Your vision HAS to be important, because you are.\n\nCarlos' books gave the impression you need fireworks to happen at some point, because Carlos had a Nagual pushing him into heightened awareness.  He was going through staged experiences, under the control of someone else.\n\nHe was ruled by the *intent* of don Juan.\n\nBut we have to move it ourselves, and a one time freak movement isn't going to help much.\n\nWe just need to watch, in silence.\n\nEven a tiny little dream while you're laying on your side in bed, which you can see while conscious, is a path to heightened awareness.  Even a few squiggly vague lines is enough.\n\nOne day you'll realize, all you have to do is close your eyes, look for a tiny hint of something that isn't there, and you'll be pulled fully into dreaming.  The door was there all along!\n\nAlso, what's the difference between a daydream, and a dreaming vision?\n\nNot as much as you'd think.  At the height of the workshop period,   in 96 or 97 when I was in Carlos' private classes often, and obsessed with recapitulation, I came to the point that anything I thought about slowly slid me into a daydream.\n\nIn other words, recapitulation had made my assemblage point so flexible that I could think about anything, and visualize it far beyond normal.\n\nThe act of recapitulating itself, which is sort of like telling yourself stories, even enhanced the tendency to daydream.  A good daydream is also a good story.\n\nThat worked best for me while standing 10 feet away from Carlos.\n\nDon't ask me why.  But it was noticeable.  That class was like a bubble of protective orange red energy.\n\n(Nurturing energy as opposed to dark energy).\n\nIf the class hadn't been filled with lazy egomaniacs it would have been like heaven.\n\nI once daydreamed myself onto a windy mountain top, and ended up in my dreaming body at that location, with Carlos still standing right next to me in class.\n\nI found 2 more students there. They were both women, I knew them, and neither had cut their hair yet.\n\nI had the puzzling impression we'd been there a while.   Or before. I couldn't figure out which.\n\nBut I clearly remembered the wind. One had even joked about it, saying we were only there because we read about it.\n\nThat led to the thought:  No we didn't travel there!   It's impossible!!!\n\nThat ended the daydream.\n\nToo bad I didn't mention it at the time.  Carlos was looking for things like that. I bet most of the class had weird things going on, which they failed to mention.\n\nAnd over time, they fade away so much that you won't even recall them.\n\nA daydream can draw you in,  even absent real visual images.\n\nAnd the nature of daydreams is that they contain a strong percentage of the second attention.\n\nPlaying in the daydream  is also like watching the second attention, in the form of a dream.\n\nIt pulls your assemblage point.  It also releases pleasure chemicals in the brain to make it an enjoyable activity (daydreaming).   You know you're on the right track in practicing, when you go from fussy to comfortable.\n\nThat's the first sign of the assemblage point drifting.  Comfort.\n\nEventually you likely will see the scene, visually.  And typically that snaps you out of it.\n\nThe trick we're all trying to learn, is not to give a shit!  Who cares what you're seeing?\n\nThen you won't easily get snapped out of it.\n\nEdited:  Cholita let me live", "edited": 1575510302.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f9kay55", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Prompting one to infer it&amp;#39;s not ordinary active daydreaming/visualization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of hard earned pointers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you see a vision like that, while awake, resist the temptation to become involved in it &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; something important.

He was going through staged experiences, under the control of someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was ruled by the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we have to move it ourselves, and a one time freak movement isn&amp;#39;t going to help much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just need to watch, in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even a tiny little dream while you&amp;#39;re laying on your side in bed, which you can see while conscious, is a path to heightened awareness.  Even a few squiggly vague lines is enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day you&amp;#39;ll realize, all you have to do is close your eyes, look for a tiny hint of something that isn&amp;#39;t there, and you&amp;#39;ll be pulled fully into dreaming.  The door was there all along!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, what&amp;#39;s the difference between a daydream, and a dreaming vision?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not as much as you&amp;#39;d think.  At the height of the workshop period,   in 96 or 97 when I was in Carlos&amp;#39; private classes often, and obsessed with recapitulation, I came to the point that anything I thought about slowly slid me into a daydream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, recapitulation had made my assemblage point so flexible that I could think about anything, and visualize it far beyond normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The act of recapitulating itself, which is sort of like telling yourself stories, even enhanced the tendency to daydream.  A good daydream is also a good story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That worked best for me while standing 10 feet away from Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t ask me why.  But it was noticeable.  That class was like a bubble of protective orange red energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Nurturing energy as opposed to dark energy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the class hadn&amp;#39;t been filled with lazy egomaniacs it would have been like heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once daydreamed myself onto a windy mountain top, and ended up in my dreaming body at that location, with Carlos still standing right next to me in class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found 2 more students there. They were both women, I knew them, and neither had cut their hair yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the puzzling impression we&amp;#39;d been there a while.   Or before. I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out which.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I clearly remembered the wind. One had even joked about it, saying we were only there because we read about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That led to the thought:  No we didn&amp;#39;t travel there!   It&amp;#39;s impossible!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That ended the daydream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too bad I didn&amp;#39;t mention it at the time.  Carlos was looking for things like that. I bet most of the class had weird things going on, which they failed to mention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And over time, they fade away so much that you won&amp;#39;t even recall them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A daydream can draw you in,  even absent real visual images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the nature of daydreams is that they contain a strong percentage of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Playing in the daydream  is also like watching the second attention, in the form of a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It pulls your assemblage point.  It also releases pleasure chemicals in the brain to make it an enjoyable activity (daydreaming).   You know you&amp;#39;re on the right track in practicing, when you go from fussy to comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the first sign of the assemblage point drifting.  Comfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you likely will see the scene, visually.  And typically that snaps you out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trick we&amp;#39;re all trying to learn, is not to give a shit!  Who cares what you&amp;#39;re seeing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you won&amp;#39;t easily get snapped out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited:  Cholita let me live&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I  could repeat  every word don Juan had said. I  followed each one  of  his  directions. They seemed clear, logical, and easy. He  said that  my body was  disappearing and only my head was  going to remain, and in such a  condition the  only way to stay awake  and move  around was  by becoming a  crow. He  commanded me  to make  an effort  to wink, adding that  whenever  I  was  capable  of  winking I  would be  ready to proceed. Then he  told me  that  my body had vanished completely and all  I  had was  my head; he  said the  head never  disappears  because  the  head is  what  turns  into a  crow. \n\nHe  ordered me  to wink. He  must  have  repeated this  command, and all  his  other  commands  countless  times, because  I  could remember  all  of  them  with extraordinary clarity. I  must  have  winked, because  he  said I  was ready and ordered me  to straighten up my head and put  it  on my chin. He  said that  in the  chin were  the  crow's legs. He  commanded me  to feel  the  legs  and observe  that  they were  coming out  slowly. He  then said that  I  was not  solid yet, that  I  had to grow  a  tail, and that  the  tail  would come  out  of  my neck. He  ordered me  to extend the tail  like  a  fan, and to feel  how  it  swept  the  floor. \n\nThen he  talked about  the  crow's  wings, and said they would come  out  of  my cheekbones. He  said it  was  hard and painful. He  commanded me  to unfold them. He  said they had to be  extremely long, as  long as  I  could stretch them, otherwise  I  would not  be  able  to fly. He  told me  the  wings  were  coming out  and were  long and beautiful, and that  I  had to flap them  until  they were  real  wings.\n\nHe  talked about  the  top of  my head next  and said it  was  still  very large  and heavy, and its  bulk would prevent  my flying. He  told me  that  the  way to reduce  its  size  was  by winking;  with every wink my head would become  smaller. \n\nHe  ordered me  to wink until  the  top weight  was  gone  and I  could jump freely. Then he  told me I  had reduced my head to the  size  of  a  crow, and that  I  had to walk around and hop until  I  had lost  my stiffness. \n\nThere  was  one  last  thing I  had to change, he  said, before  I  could fly. It  was  the  most  difficult  change, and to accomplish it  I  had to be  docile  and do exactly as  he  told me. I  had to learn to see  like  a  crow. He  said that  my mouth and nose  were  going to grow  between my eyes  until  I  had a  strong beak. He  said that  crows  see  straight  to the  side, and commanded me  to turn my head and look at  him  with one  eye. He  said that  if  I  wanted to change and look with the  other  eye  I  had to shake  my beak down, and that  that  movement  would make  me  look through the  other  eye. He  ordered me  to shift  from  one  eye  to the  other. And then he  said I  was  ready to fly, and that  the only way to fly was  to have  him  toss  me  into the  air.\n\nI  had no difficulty whatsoever  eliciting the  corresponding sensation to each one  of  his  commands. I  had the perception of  growing bird's  legs, which were  weak and wobbly at  first. I  felt  a  tail  coming out  of  the  back of  my neck and wings  out  of  my cheekbones. The  wings  were  folded deeply. I  felt  them  coming out  by degrees. The process  was  hard but  not  painful. Then I  winked my head down to the  size  of  a  crow.

Then something bulged out  and created a  block in front  of  me. But  it  was  not  until  don Juan directed me  to see  laterally that  my eyes  actually were  capable  of  having a  full  view  to the  side. I  could wink one  eye  at  a  time  and shift  the  focusing from  one  eye  to the  other. But  the  sight  of  the  room  and all  the  things  in it  was  not  like  an ordinary sight. Yet  it was  impossible  to tell  in what  way it  was  different. Perhaps  it  was  lopsided, or  perhaps  things  were  out  of  focus. Don Juan became  very big and glowy.

going on about this guy\u2019s one time experience, that guy\u2019s vision, some scientist\u2019s study on whether ETs are angry at us, and so on.\n\nI wanted to raise my hand and say, \u201cI have a

A vow of silence is useless. \n\nIt's just an indulgence.\n\nOk, I'm exaggerating a bit here.  But I have no problem **talking** to spirits. I just have to have **no internal dialogue** in order to locate them.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t greet them when I find them! I can say, \"Oh there you are!

Not here now.\n\nDarn, it's the \"be here now\" thing again.  I never liked that phrase, but it's true.\n\nTalking is a thing humans do. \n\nIt\u2019s a point, in the 8 point diagram don Juan drew.\n\nIt's not where your attention is focused, but it can direct it.\n\nWhen you speak, your internal dialogue isn\u2019t fast enough to decide which word comes next.\n\nYou speak because you can, without having to think too much about what comes out next.  \n\nYou are in fact \"here now\".

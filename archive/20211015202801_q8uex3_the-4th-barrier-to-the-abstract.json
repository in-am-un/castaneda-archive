But... It was so obvious!](https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17eb3a91d663496a9ec8179e290030e6ca99719)\n\nIn my quest to remote view continuously on the bedspread, so I could teach shamanic drummers to give something of value to their paying customers, I stumbled on something I knew long ago.\n\nMaterializing little dreams in the air, is a very powerful sorcery technique.  Especially for learning.\n\nBut it's not as exciting as having your inorganic being teach you some \"practical magic\".\n\nMy being Fairy didn't care about practical magic. She only wanted to show me how to move along that J curve path Carlos taught to us.  In that effort, she was very efficient.  She stuck to the plan Carlos had, and encouraged me to scoop energy from the inside of my luminous egg, wherever it had been pushed to the extreme by worry.\n\nShe turned it into a game, and did a little show for me, so I could not resist learning that. I even believed I could learn her \"games\" and teach them to others. One looked a lot like Space Invaders!\n\nCould be, because Taito invited me to their facility in Tokyo, as the Japanese are like to do in their efforts to investigate American engineering and whether it could be used to improve their own engineers.\n\nBut I didn't realize, the game Fairy played with me was not important.  She just didn't want me to get distracted from the task.\n\nLaster she asked me to send her away, when she was finished teaching darkroom techniques.\n\nSo I found \"Fancy\".  An untamed inorganic being. Not proven by being part of a sorcery lineage, the way Fairy was.\n\nFancy is not very nice.  She's rough in fact.  And no doubt has bad motivations.\n\nBut she made a deal to teach me horizontal shifting.  And as I learned, the price was energy.\n\nAfter most lessons she trapped me in an abstract dream, and drained as much energy as she could.\n\nBut in exchange, I got her dark energy.\n\nIt was worth it!\n\nBut eventually, if you don't play too much in the red zone, you pass it.  You reach the crystalline dreaming fog. The inorganic beings lose power past that point.\n\nWill everyone see that dense second attention fog?  We don't know.  So far, 3 have seen it.\n\nI suspect I had the worst time with it, because I didn't realize what was happening.  It wasn't mentioned in the books.\n\nInstead, apprentices were brought to the edge of the \"Wall of Fog\" and had to be taken inside by someone as powerful as Silvio Manuel, or Emilito.\n\nWe were already inside!  Fairy materialized the second attention fog around us, with her darkroom gazing process.\n\nAnd so, without knowing it, we hit the same \"wall of fog\" smack dab in the face.\n\nInstead of needing to learn to stop the rotation,  so we could travel through it,  we got the opposite.\n\nIntense \"directionality\".  Tiny objects, scenes, and beings, materialized in the darkness, filling the entire room.\n\nNot a single cubic inch was empty of objects. If you gazed deeper to find an empty spot, it simply filled in with more.\n\nAll of them trying to trap our attention.  Just walking a few feet in the dark room took a very long time, because the \"wonders\" along the path were irresistible.  By the time you could cross the room, you had exhausted all of your dreaming attention.\n\nEventually however, everyone will get used to the endless magical objects floating near your eyes, and the crystalline fog will clear.\n\nYou'll reach the \"whitish light\" of seeing energy.\n\nThere is where you want to play!\n\nThere are so many things you can do with that. It's *SEEING*.  You don't realize that at first, but eventually it becomes obvious.\n\nAnd because it's *seeing*, it responds to your desires.  Brings you \"techniques\" you simply can't resist.\n\nEach one requiring **continuous** seeing.\n\nContinuous seeing requires virtually perfect silence.\n\nAnd then, as you succeed in whatever technique you learned, it's just not quite what you wanted.\n\nIn the case of remote viewing, it's not bright enough. It's too abstract.  If it's a scene, the people and cars don't move around.\n\nIf you get it just right, how come you can't reach in there, pull out an object, and take a closer look at it?\n\nYou need deeper and deeper levels of silence to get what you want.\n\nWhich moves your assemblage point closer and closer to the purple zone.\n\nAt some point, the answers are simply pouring into your mind non-stop.\n\nEach one so seemingly valuable, you just MUST stop to write it down.\n\nBy then you will have learned what will be forgotten, and what will be retained.\n\nAnd the kind of information you are getting now, will be lost as soon as you leave that assemblage point position.\n\nIt becomes a barrier to going further.\n\nWhat's past Silent Knowledge?\n\nThe Abstract.\n\nOur actual destination.\n\nThe point at which Carlos stopped.  He told us nothing further.\n\nIf we want to see past that, we have to do it ourselves.\n\nIt's a pretty clever plan.  We have to reach silent knowledge, and then give it up.\n\nTo perceive the abstract.  Only when the abstract is visible, can we manage to remove our obsession with the reality we are trapped in.\n\nSilent knowledge doesn't achieve that!  In fact, you become more obsessed.\n\nThe book deal mind returns to you, in your desires to \"share\" this amazing information with others.\n\nIt seems to be, the 4th barrier to the mastery of *intent*.\n\nLast night I typed a bunch of notes into the advanced chat, but now I don't know what to do with them.  I'll summarize why I don't know.\n\nSilent Knowledge is absolute.  What you learn, others will find also.\n\nThere isn't a \"list\".  But if you believe you have uncovered a \"secret\" that's valuable to others, you're confused.\n\nFor others, it's merely a \"spoiler\".\n\nDon Juan refused to give into \"sharing secrets\" when Carlos asked him about the types of inorganic beings.  Don Juan told him,  learning about that would be one of the most exciting things he did in his life.\n\nSo, you shouldn't pass on Silent Knowledge, right?\n\nThat's what I was wondering last night, in the middle of it.\n\nBut if you are in the silent knowledge realm, no query goes unanswered.\n\nI got a lecture about the topic!\n\nIt came down to an analogy.\n\nShould you tell your friends all the details of a new movie that came out?\n\nThe entire plot, the twists, the ending?\n\nNO.  Of course not.\n\nBut what if the movie had value.  And in knowing what the movie showed, you felt as if you had gained something valuable?\n\nAnd what if your friend lives in an oppressive cult in one of those \"middle states\".\n\nHoarding weapons, marrying 16 year olds, and preparing for the end of the world.\n\nThe cult doesn't allow people to go to the movies.\n\nIn that case, there's no such thing as a spoiler.  You benefit him to pass on the plot.\n\nAfter learning that, I was wondering how I knew who came from an oppressive cult that would never find this knowledge on their own?\n\nSo I got an educational video on that topic.\n\nEven more complicated than the last.\n\nEveryone lives in that cult.\n\nAnd most of them want out.\n\nBut they don't know which way to go.\n\nIf you can tell them stories about freedom, they'll work harder to find the way.\n\nThat made me wonder about the value of stories.\n\nSo I got a lecture on that.\n\nWe're swimming in stories, because of wanting to learn sorcery.\n\nSorcerers realized long ago that fighting and arguing with apprentices, trying to force them to do the right thing, consumes too much energy.\n\nSo sorcerers are story tellers.\n\nThe stories impart a \"moral of the story\", which becomes part of the apprentices decision making system.\n\nWhere am I going with this?\n\nDon't ask me. I just got a presentation on the topic, from infinity.\n\nIt plays out like a movie if you prefer.  Or it plays out in daydreaming territory.\n\nAt that point in internal silence, the two start to merge.\n\nWhen I get more time, I'll check to see what else is in those notes, and post it in a comment.\n\nBut suffice it to say, Silent Knowledge itself can become a barrier you have to pass.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The 4th Barrier to The Abstract", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"j4z9zt1hhnt71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6de3131e8aa478e4279ceed89eb23a924ece7e2"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=861fa833e325b0bf623fe306982423630be009bb"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65e8ed9d4fb2cdd8371739574608e3187cdd4dd"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e35a851c9d3c0726cc324ec31489b0571a4e783"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a75d792868d9a2609c6c0a4943c23426d384e2ce"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=030b9e603974cca1d9338c1c071589baa674efe1"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17eb3a91d663496a9ec8179e290030e6ca99719"}, "id": "j4z9zt1hhnt71"}}, "name": "t3_q8uex3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0PNa0oS7GkZt659TNWM2aZHCfTmGaQyqe0kwwRSxKmA.jpg", "edited": 1634327578.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1634322481.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j4z9zt1hhnt71.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d17eb3a91d663496a9ec8179e290030e6ca99719\"&gt;Who knew?

Or it plays out in daydreaming territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point in internal silence, the two start to merge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I get more time, I&amp;#39;ll check to see what else is in those notes, and post it in a comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But suffice it to say, Silent Knowledge itself can become a barrier you have to pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "q8uex3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/q8uex3/the_4th_barrier_to_the_abstract/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/q8uex3/the_4th_barrier_to_the_abstract/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1634322481.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hgvf3en", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hgsudfg", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Random observations on wrong places to learn:\n\nAny of the books by fake sorcerers nearly kill your chances to learn sorcery.

In fact, no one would not think of that.\n\nBut to remote view a real place is a different path.  It assumes some places are real, and some are not.  The Olmecs didn't see things that way.\n\nAny place you could see was real.  It was just a matter of how  useful. The Olmecs were such masters of reality, they could actually live in their \"unreal\" places.\n\nSo for them, each one was real, and the main difference was how easily anyone could use that place.\n\nThe easiest to use (the real ones) were simply those being used by the whole population.\n\nAnd our job is to move to the end of the J curve as fast as possible, because it's nearly impossible to do that from our horrible life situation.\n\nOnce you get a little momentum, even a tiny bit of curiosity in the wrong direction can be fatal.\n\nIt's the same reason I don't like being asked to \"experiment\" with my IOBs.  The price is too high!  It's an \"intent deviation\".\n\n*Intent* has a priority on the reality it builds for you.  Remote viewing is controlled \"skimming\" of emanations to produce a view of the selected reality.\n\nWe're just supposed to learn that **process**.  If we become interested in adding a new element, that some views are \"valid\", and some are not, you've cause a stall in the learning process.\n\nA weirder example:\n\nWe copy the Olmecs, because that path has some glow left in the emanations.\n\nThey tend to skim by themselves, if you give them a chance.\n\nSo the Olmec path will automatically repeat for us at key points, as long as we fit into that.\n\nIf we try to fit into a different path, such as Buddhism, we don't go down the Olmec path.  We'll go down the Buddha path sometimes, the Olmec others and it's a dead end that way.\n\nAlso, it's a misunderstanding of sorcery to believe you can learn to do something.\n\nSimple things, like driving a car, programming computers, we can learn.\n\nThose are mechanical processes.\n\nBut how can you possibly learn to materialize a world in front of your eyes?\n\nDoes some part say, \"Let's put a tree there, a house there, and make the doors red...\"\n\nNope.  The scene just materializes.\n\nYou can shout, \"Fire Station!!!!\" and drop it in silence, and there's a good chance you'll get a view of a fire station.  But no guarantee, because you might be thinking you need to use the bathroom at the same time, so you get the bathrooms inside Disneyland, near the magic shop.  Your favorites!\n\nWe have to learn to both TRUST intent, and not interfere.\n\nThat's what sorcery is!  Learning how to trust intent, and not interfere.\n\nSo as to the remote viewing thing, if a time comes when you REALLY need to see this world, and not one of the many phantoms, if you cleaned your link to intent you will!\n\nThe hard part is trusting that.\n\nDon Juan left us instructions on how to get the best chance to get what you need.  To invoke intent successfully.\n\nBold actions, a bit of humor,  practical jokes that don't hurt anyone.\n\nAt the most basic, you just shout, \"Intent!  Intent!!

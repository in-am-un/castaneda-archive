It's a good practice, when you've been working hard for hours, practicing silence and tensegrity in the dark.\n\nBut to understand this topic, you must learn silence until you can \"see energy\". Then you can play around, and discover what happens with each tensegrity movement.\n\nSomeone asked me if \"seeing\" can apply to intuition.\n\nIf you want to remain lame forever, sure! Go ahead and pretend your \"seeing\". You can brag it up on your Facebook, and then bully anyone who questions whether that's really seeing.\n\nSorcery by bullying.\n\nBut it's not very satisfying.\n\nHow about, we stick to the definition Carlos gave us. He even emphasized it in his final publications.\n\nYou want to move your assemblage point, until you see whitish light on all surfaces.\n\nTHAT'S seeing for sure. You can assemble views of other worlds on the walls, read text from the sky, or even raise your arms up to give a big hug to the spirit, who will oblige your desire to see all the phases of the moon floating in the sky, so you can use them for magic.\n\nThat's why that picture is there on the cover of Wheel of Time, taunting you.\n\nIt's a technique!!! Did you notice that?\n\nI've even tried it myself, but all I got was one lousy moon floating near the ceiling.\n\nDidn't make me feel bad about it. How often does the moon rise in your bedroom?\n\nTo get all of those phases, might take a little practice.\n\nOnce you can see the whitish light, you can see what makes it change.\n\nYou'll discover, it has multiple \"looks\" to it. When it's smooth like fog, it's not very active. You need to \"stir\" it.\n\nWhen it's textured, the colors and shapes of the texture determine what it's useful for.\n\nSome is useful for travel. Some is useful for seeing energy flow. Some is useful for finding trace amounts of energy so you can uncover hidden worlds and beings.\n\nCarlos liked to \"read\" it. He created his \"Readers of Infinity\" publication, to encourage us to learn to do that.\n\nWhat happened???\n\nNothing. That's the pity of it. He died, and the laziness and greed of his followers won out.\n\nLet's fix this, one person at a time.\n\nStep 1: Pledge that you want to learn magic. You don't want to write a book and steal money from others. You don't want to gather a little \"circle\" of followers, put on a Rambo headband, and pretend to teach them.\n\nYou don't want to change your name to Castaneda, Grau, Donner, or \"I\\_Love\\_Toltecs\".\n\nYou can do that later. I suspect they can even print \"Toltec\" across the butt of your underwear if you like.\n\nBut for now seek magic, and only magic.\n\nIf you don't, the spirit won't help you out. Without help from the spirit, the path of sorcery is closed. Sealed. You cannot enter.\n\nLearn to move your assemblage point, using Tensegrity. Pass the super exciting assemblage point position at the bottom of your back, where dragons and Fairies play in the air for your amusement.\n\nShun shape shifting.\n\nAnd keep moving that assemblage point until it comes up in the front.\n\nYou'll see the whitish light on surfaces.\n\nBut that's not the ideal place to learn. Keep going, until your breath changes. At first, it's dramatic.\n\nCarlos described this breath change, following the Nagual's Blow.\n\nWe get that too! But because we move to there all by ourselves, it's not so overwhelming.\n\nLater, it's even peaceful.\n\nOnce you can see whitish light on all surfaces, and your breath has become automatic, with only the low stomach moving in and out, gently, you are in an excellent position to learn about intent.\n\nAbout how to manipulate intent.\n\nI suggest using the most simple tensegrity moves. Those disturb or add to \"intent\", and you can watch the results.\n\nThe longer forms tend to transport you to a phantom realm. It might be better to start simple until you understand what those phantom realms really are.\n\nBut the longer forms, are better when the assemblage point is still on the low back.\n\nMy suggestion: First simple moves.  While you are still up at the blue station.\n\nThen, once you can see puffs of color, indicating you've moved down to the green station, use scooping movements to place them on your torso. On the 3 pouches.\n\nWhen you can see them there, start doing long forms.  It means you're halfway to the red station.\n\nKeep doing long forms and forcing absolute silence, until the jet black shows up, swirling between intense puffs of brilliant color.  You are now in the red zone.\n\nScoop it onto your torso until the air clears out.  That means, you're passing under the bottom, and headed to the front.  The whitish light will become visible as the walls stop glowing in colors. The room will bleach out, and you'll see whitish light or whitish lines, on all surfaces.\n\nAt that point, it's play time!\n\nTime to relearn reality.\n\n\\*\\*\\* end of facebook text \\*\\*\\*\n\nRelearn reality...\n\nYou need to remember that.\n\nHere's another way to understand this path:\n\nDoubt.  Don't want to be a sucker.\n\nBut you try darkroom anyway.\n\nBoredom, and doubt.\n\nMore boredom.\n\nYou must be doing something wrong.\n\nSo you force silence for real this time, figuring out you were just pretending before.\n\nAnd yet, still it does nothing.\n\nYou feel like giving up.\n\nBut you force yourself to do it anyway, the next day.\n\nAnd suddenly, something \"snaps\" and you see a puff float by!\n\nYou've just noticed, maybe there's some outside force that helps with sorcery, and you need both your own effort, and that outside forces help.\n\nLet me save you some time.\n\nKylies scary look.  That's how you get the outside force to help you.\n\nIt's \"unbending intent\".\n\nOnce you learn the truth of that a few times, so that you are clear that \"pushing\" is what makes progress, not \"practicing\", you'll keep going for a while.\n\nNow you learn the next important lesson.\n\nA one time event isn't work anything.\n\nDoesn't matter how spectacular.\n\nYou don't learn by something happening one time.\n\nIn fact, you don't learn by cool things happening over and over again.\n\nInstead, you relearn reality, very slowly, over a long time.\n\nYou still get rewards all along the path.\n\nBut sorcery is \"the mastery of intent\", where \"Your command becomes the Eagle's Command.\"\n\nAnd if you remember don Juan's words, it takes a very long time, before your command becomes the Eagles command.\n\nAnd worse, once you get there, you'll be able to do anything you like.\n\nBut you won't have anything left you want to do.\n\nIt says that too!  About don Juan and Silvio Manual being able to do anything, but not wanting to most of the time.\n\nThat's sort of the other side of \"one cool thing doesn't make you a sorcerer\".\n\nThat sorcerers don't care about doing cool things anymore.\n\nI bring this up, because Facebook is dominated by people misrepresenting a one time nightmare as having been done awake, something they could do anytime now that they \"did it\", and a reason they should have groupies flock to their social media.\n\nGet over the one time event worship, expect it to be a long path (it's just that you get rewarded right away if you try), and don't expect that the goal is to learn magic.\n\nThe goal is simply to return to what we should have become in the first place.  Free to explore all of the dark sea of awareness.\n\nAnd unattached to the intent of any particular reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Simple Tensegrity Moves Examined", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"z50jiem9lk681": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z50jiem9lk681.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22967829f9d2b430e8b3d9c236ebb358213b716e"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z50jiem9lk681.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d99f55b716746e6e20d35aa0c8f0c998660998dd"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z50jiem9lk681.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3dac8d7ed7ff1862fe5d48846c5517cb80820eb"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z50jiem9lk681.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f9cd9d6ecfd68fcdc1f1532c62d13b523dacc9"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z50jiem9lk681.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b84115c1c7ebb6b92fb5b8cea1f137fc5433030c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z50jiem9lk681.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c67e3858f13a230debff390b53c4e0dfa5694e"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z50jiem9lk681.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2191d83f7f1bd9e6515695ce8a9f15e032f8002"}, "id": "z50jiem9lk681"}}, "name": "t3_rk6sw9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/i4bdF0RyDb7HoiEUJ4sZed9PMGnkpfcziBxIHL_6dN4.jpg", "edited": 1639952678.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1639950938.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z50jiem9lk681.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d2191d83f7f1bd9e6515695ce8a9f15e032f8002\"&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t fit 3 moves, but the one where you pull on each finger is interesting to \\&amp;quot;see\\&amp;quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the text from Facebook.

reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

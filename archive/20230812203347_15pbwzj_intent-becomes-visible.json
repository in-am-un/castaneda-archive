To see if there were more memories associated with something as silly as &amp;quot;Cream of Wheat Cereal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The list must have expanded back up to 100 pages at that point, but I don&amp;#39;t recall. If I got too much and it was frustrating, I left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Planning to come back again until I did the whole store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now days, you could just cell phone video all the isles, and take them up at home, as you go.  See how far into the seconds of the video you get over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I traveled to every single place I ever lived, and walked around where I walked while there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, it didn&amp;#39;t cause as much more to get added as the grocery store and all the objects it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I traveled to every school I attended, specifically, and if I could gain access to the campus I did so.  Went everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all that was recapitulated, I still worried I hadn&amp;#39;t done enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I got a small dictionary, and went over every single word definition, starting with the As.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made it to the Ms, when I found my entire life was visible in front of me, like a 3D spider web.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; when you&amp;#39;re done.  But you have to be honest about it, not eager to finish.  There&amp;#39;s zero point to &amp;quot;finishing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On that visible web with the events stuck to junctions, I had the ability to gaze at one and get sucked into a very vivid daydream of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do that, and your situation will greatly improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can just &amp;quot;suck it up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Zuleica said, if you can just move your assemblage point to Heightened Awareness (the mid orange zone), having recapitulated or not won&amp;#39;t make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there is a &amp;quot;place of no pity&amp;quot; where what you find unpleasant, becomes meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_15pbwzj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15pbwzj/intent_becomes_visible/jvz63a3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1691912270.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jvz0vhx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_15pbwzj", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15pbwzj/intent_becomes_visible/jvz0vhx/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_jvz0vhx", "created": 1691908334.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1691908334.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]

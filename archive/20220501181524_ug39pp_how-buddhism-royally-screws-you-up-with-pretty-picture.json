Sorry Buddha boys. No glory is coming your way.](https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a10795e783c75d97ba5a9b32516cbaf2dd074f49)\n\nI suppose I'm being paranoid, but did you experience frustration watching Star Wars, when Yoda kept insisting the hero was, \"too old to begin the training\"?\n\nAnd then, with what we know now, I'm starting to suspect that's Soledad's handy work.\n\nIf you don't know who Soledad is, you'll have to read other posts. Too complicated to explain here.\n\nA dangerous old witch bent on influencing hollywood, pretty much sums it up.\n\nSo I suspect the \"wisdom\" in this Yoda quote, is the work of Soledad.\n\nIt's easy to think Yoda's just being a bastard, and of course you can train.  At any age, as long as you aren't so old you get tired quickly.\n\nBut if this subreddit has proven anything, it's that \"You can't teach individuals\".\n\nNo one ever has as far as we know.\n\nThe old seers were given children as apprentices.\n\nChildren believe whatever you tell them, and even take it on themselves to encourage others to  share the same view.\n\nYou can brainwash the little bastards very easily, and they don't mind at all.\n\nIt's their job.  To learn quickly.\n\nBut adults are hopeless.\n\nWe get 500 who flow through here, interested enough to \"join\" the subreddit, and only one will learn.\n\nAnd not the one any of us would pick.\n\nThe lineages couldn't do it either.  They needed all 15 or 16 members, just to trick the replacement apprentices into learning.\n\nThey weren't taught directly. They were coerced, using a group of powerful, magical stalkers.\n\nI could find an inspirational quote on that topic, from \"The Rule\" itself.  About how teaching sorcery became a path of deception and subterfuge.\n\nThe lineages also could **not** teach individuals. They didn't really even get to pick who they wanted to transform.\n\nThey were \"stuck\" what whatever came along and was the right \"type\".\n\nSo if you see a \"system\" claiming it can teach individuals, you know you're dealing with greedy monsters. \n\nSame goes for a phony sorcery teacher, charging money to random people with the claim he can teach them.   \n\nCharlatan!   Every time.\n\nA sinister force has long dominated the world of magic, removing the real thing and replacing it with pretending for the purpose of stealing money.\n\nCarlos tried to fix that, in cahoots with members of don Juan's lineage. We don't know who, or if there's even the very specific beings we've read about, but someone in there was helping Carlos \"tinker with the modality of our times\". Here's what don Juan had to say about that:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"From where the average man (or woman) stands,\" don Juan said, \"sorcery is nonsense; an ominous mystery beyond his reach. And he is right, not because this is an absolute fact, but because the average man lacks the energy to deal with sorcery.\"\n\nHe stopped for a moment before he continued. \"Human beings are born,\" don Juan said, \"with a finite amount of energy; an energy that is systematically deployed, beginning at the moment of birth, in order that it may be used most advantageously by the modality of the time.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the modality of the time?\" I asked.\n\n\"The modality of the time is the precise bundle of energy fields being perceived,\" he answered.\n\n\"I believe man's perception has changed through the ages. The actual time decides the mode. The time decides which precise bundle of energy fields are to be used; out of an incalculable number.\n\n\"Handling the modality of the time- those select few energy fields- takes all our available energy; and thus leaves us no extra energy that would help us use any of the other energy fields.\"\n\n\\*\\*\n\nSo Carlos and don Juan created those books to \"hook us\". Carlos said that in his own words. And once hooked, he wanted us to work hard, follow instructions, and reach the goal.\n\nSilent Knowledge is the starting point, of the road leading to the goal.\n\nBut a religion needs to suck you in, to keep you prisoner as food.\n\nReligions are like chicken coops. Once inside the chicken wire fence with the other prisoner chickens, you'll find that they've made themselves \"cozy\" in there and will literally try to kill you, if they sense you are going to escape.\n\nCarlos once joked, if a brave chicken ventured outside the chicken coop with no more than a single toe, the other chickens would begin to swarm him and \"peck on his head\".\n\nTo force him to come back.  Carlos even did a weird imitation of a chicken pecking the head of another, using his fingers clasped in a \"chicken beak\" type shape. He wanted us to see the rhythmical pecking on the top of the head, and equate it to the nagging and bullying we will all encounter as a result of practicing sorcery.\n\nBest to keep that to yourself. \n\nBut when you screw up and talk about it, at least learn from the results.\n\nAnd be glad you aren't at the level of attack this subreddit experiences!\n\nToo many pecks from the \"well adjusted chickens\" inside the chicken coop, and they'll draw blood. \n\nScabs form, and the other chickens feast on that one's head until it dies.\n\nLike Finches in a pet store. There's usually a finch who isn't long for this world, because he's producing tasty scabs on the top of his head.\n\nSo if you go into the Buddhism chicken coop, better protect your head!\n\nBut it's a lovely chicken coop! And inside it all the chickens claim they're the best off in the entire farm, and headed for the promised fields of endless golden grain, just waiting for you to peck it up at your leisure.\n\nIt's some very lovely pretending! As a religion, Buddhism is just wonderful. Nothing could be more pleasant than a vast Buddhist temple area.\n\nAnd despite being modern, it gives the impression it's \"ancient knowledge\".\n\nBut the Judeo/Christian religion has some lovely stuff going on too. Lovely if you look at their origins, in their texts.\n\nThough not so lovely in practice most of the time.\n\nAs a sorcerer, you are free to belong to any religion you like!\n\nJust don't fail to free yourself from it using recapitulation, and moving the assemblage point.\n\nThe witches have commented, out of politeness, and only when asked, \"The Buddha worked within the social order. We work outside it.\"\n\nUh... Is that actually very \"polite\", to a sorcerer who knows what they are really saying?\n\nSeems more like a \"disguised\" insult, considering that outside the social order is where 99.9999999% of reality is located.\n\nSo it's a bit like saying, \"Yea, that Buddha guy is perfect for .0000001% of reality. He really has a handle on that part!\"\n\nHere's why Buddhism is a death trap for those seeking sorcery knowledge. Just look at the pic and it'll become obvious.\n\nThe \"masters\" out there, are totally doomed.\n\nIf they knew about recapitulation, they could fix that.\n\nBut soon they'd realize, they were merely religious zealots and not actually on the path to any knowledge of the nature of reality.\n\nSo the process of \"fixing\" Buddhism, would cause a person to give it up.\n\nIt's not salvageable.  \n\n\nI was surprised to see that Michael Harner also discovered what I noticed.  About Buddhism.\n\nI still think Michael  \"cashed in\" on Carlos,  because his fame was mostly with people who couldn't learn from Carlos, seeking out alternatives.  And Michael used Shamanic drumming to help them get to the green line on the J curve.\n\nThat works!\n\nNot only does it work, but amazing magical additions to that technique are possible, with some silent knowledge members in the audience.\n\nShamanic drumming shared remote viewing is possible.\n\nit's the same as the demonstration don Juan gave the apprentices, where each saw a different costume on don Juan.\n\nBut someone else will have to accomplish that.\n\nWhat Michael said that interested me was, he'd looked at everything.  Buddhism, Hinduism, and anything else out there.\n\nAnd he never saw a single \"cool thing\" any of them can do, which you couldn't duplicate with shamanic drumming.\n\nHe realized, without having the map we do, that it was all just \"green line effects\".\n\nSo if he \"got it\", he would have liked this diagram. He discovered the truth of it all, before anyone else did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How Buddhism Royally Screws You Up, With Pretty Picture", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Buddhism"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"spghpfir2ww81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=274ff08619f7af6f928fe47ede323fe4516d08f1"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ddbd2ee7b8cb02e5bbc646e245dc1e845c642d1"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47fe2a10c711e7a3cc92b928139198dd366cc592"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=065bc7c73af34cd7f6e353bda857143a367e4914"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dee1a727d653d86396927a28f5e44b7d7939e110"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba8823cbc4cf9fe8c5150aee766507de243d7220"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a10795e783c75d97ba5a9b32516cbaf2dd074f49"}, "id": "spghpfir2ww81"}}, "name": "t3_ug39pp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Buddhism", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/W6hbNbcQyoGivAB3WsuER9KdMsOXUc0bQQCPTOQNW3U.jpg", "edited": 1651424267.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1651421724.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/spghpfir2ww81.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a10795e783c75d97ba5a9b32516cbaf2dd074f49\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s the truth!

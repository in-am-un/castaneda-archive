To their credit.\n\nBut they did lock the thread to prevent further discussions along that line.  In particular, some man seems to have created his own meditation technique, which he was pretending to \"teach\" in there.  He was particularly unhappy to hear me point out that meditation produces pathetic results.  Even describing what you can do with sorcery, so that he could compare the two and see the truth of the situation.\n\nThe mods just locked the thread to put an end to the back and forth.\n\nThe \"Remote viewing\" subreddit not only locked the thread where I explained that real remote viewing ought to let you visibly view events remotely,  anywhere in time and space.\n\nSomething I do daily, so I can assure you that any of you can reach that point also.\n\nInstead of just scribbling on paper as Monroe Institute teaches people to do, which they used to scam the CIA back in the 70s or 80s.\n\nBut they also erased all record of my comments,  for everyone's \"good\".  Because it's harmful to their profit margins to tell the truth about their \"technique\".\n\nThe Dzogchen people were shocked I would dare to question their amazing intellectually superior Buddhist minds, so they banned me permanently. It's the upturned noses smelling shit everywhere, which Carlos used to imitate when EuroBuddhists managed to get into private classes.\n\nYou get various reactions in various subreddits, based on the horribleness of the topic.\n\nThe nicest so far were the TM people, who never actually took any actions against me. Probably they were just happy to have any discussions at all going on there.\n\nNever be afraid to do that!   To confront fake magic.\n\nJust make sure your motivations are good.\n\nThen no matter how horrible it gets, you'll learn something valuable from it.\n\nAnd even get rewarded, when you practice darkroom for the evening and your assemblage point moves very far, despite the day's hostilities.  You kind of \"unbind\" your social reactions, the negative side effects of dealing with petty tyrants, from your ability to move the assemblage point.\n\nYou can never actually change yourself.  Your normal behavior will always be your normal behavior.\n\nBut you can learn to ignore it, and move your assemblage point anyway.\n\nFrom that encounter in the meditation subreddit I learned the following.\n\nPartly because someone followed me from there to other social media, and I came to realize what ought to have been obvious all along.\n\nAll forms of \"meditation\" are a scam.  And the people involved in it, have dubious motivations.\n\nThere aren't any \"innocent bystanders\" there.\n\nMeditation works a tiny bit, because if you alter your internal dialogue in just about any way, for a sustained period, \"weird stuff happens\".\n\nNot much, since your normal internal dialogue will return. But if your eyes are closed, you can notice the results of even a small change in your internal dialogue.\n\nYour assemblage point will move down to the green line on the J curve. Down to just below your shoulder blades.\n\nThat's as far as you'll get however, except rarely by accident. Since you didn't actually get rid of your internal dialogue.\n\nEven the highest Buddhist \"Master\" who ever lived never got rid of their internal dialogue, or they'd give up that criminal enterprise.\n\nOnce your assemblage point moves all the way to Silent Knowledge, you see through that kind of egotistical meditation endeavor.\n\nClearly. It's completely in the \"wrong direction\".\n\nAnd you would feel bad for inflicting it on others, once you realized it wasn't the right way to go.\n\nThe world STOPS when you truly get rid of the internal dialogue, and you're presented with infinite knowledge of endless new worlds you can visit anywhere in time and space.\n\nIn your physical body, wide awake, eyes open and completely sober!\n\nIf you're sitting there with your eyes closed like a lazy grinning Buddha, it's pretty clear you haven't gotten rid of your internal dialogue at all.\n\nAnd are merely seeking human attention or money.\n\nSo here's the basic scam.\n\nHumans have assemblage points which move slightly all throughout the day. Most are such small movements, reality isn't altered enough to be noticable. But sometimes the movement produces weirdness, which we've been trained to dismiss.\n\nWe all know of such things. Dreams are one, but so is feeling amazing after exercising and laying down to rest a bit.\n\nSome people sit in chairs and smoke pipes, and ponder the mysteries of existence like a college professor of philosophy.\n\nYou can get VERY high doing that.\n\nPeople pray, and \"Feel the love of Jesus\".\n\nJust try telling them they didn't!\n\nReally, we have no shortage of green zone magical effects during the day!\n\nJoggers high even.\n\nSo why anyone is impressed with Hindu or Buddhist meditation results, is a big mystery to me. They are completely in the range of things we can already do, without paying for delusional meditation techniques.\n\nLikely it's the self-flattering explanations they give along with the meditation technique, about how you will reach \"perfection\" or \"immortality of consciousness\" using their technique.\n\nWith their techniques inevitably being just some crappy substitute internal dialogue.\n\nIf you learned meditation, you were ROBBED!\n\nBy people who don't have your best interests at heart.\n\nThough they may not realize it, since everyone is stealing in that manner.\n\nAnd until recently, there was no real magic visible on the web. So no reason for them to notice, their results are nothing to be proud of.\n\nPeople in our era just haven't realize what human potential really is. Because no one told them about it.\n\nWe kind of knew as children, when the entire world was filled with random magic.\n\nBut we got talked out of believing that, and now we've forgotten.\n\nIf we hadn't, it would become obvious how lame Asian magical systems are.\n\nProducing results you can easily get without handing them your cash.\n\nFrankly, if you really feel you need soothing from meditation you'd be better off to pray.\n\nAt least that can activate the shared emanations for God and Heaven, and you can literally learn to visit Heaven on demand.\n\nTrust me, heaven is VERY soothing.\n\nEven the waiting room is super nice.\n\nAnd of course you can visit God that way, but that's not actually \"soothing\".\n\nBut why do people defend meditation techniques, as being helpful to people?\n\nThey just don't know any better.\n\nAnd some are con artists. Such as Deepak Chopra.\n\nSome just want to be con artists themselves some day, and believe they have to earn \"endorsement\" from their chosen organization.\n\nTheir goal being to become a \"wise teacher\" of something they never actually plan to spend the time to learn.\n\nThis harsh analysis is not quite right for women.\n\nWomen might just be seeking a \"community\".\n\nAnd being natural witches, the minor sensations meditation techniques can produce are pretty much trivial to them, so they aren't as obsessed with the techniques or the results, as greedy men.\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nMeditation is a scam.\n\nIf you believe you can use that to learn sorcery, you have no idea at all what sorcery is.\n\nYou MUST remove ALL of your internal dialogue long enough so that you stop sending your awareness into the emanations of our daily world.\n\nAnd remove it long enough so that you are essentially no longer \"human\". So that you have a \"clean link to intent\".\n\nTHEN you can perceive what comes back from the emanations themselves, when you don't interfere.\n\nInfinity will guide you to go further!\n\nIt might sound a lot like phony Chinese philosophy to explain how you must stop sending awareness into the emanations.\n\nSuch as \"you must be empty!\"\n\nExcept, Asian mystics never are.\n\nOr they'd be able to do what sorcerers can do, and wouldn't be obsessed with earning a living pretending to \"teach\" magic.\n\nOr \"higher consciousness\" if they prefer not to get mixed up with the idea they can do magic.\n\nEven so, they don't even reach beginner's lever of \"higher\" consciousness or they'd commonly shapeshift and teleport. Or find their \"double\" for real.\n\nReal magic, or real exploration of consciousness, produces DAILY impossible experiences you can't even talk about with other people.\n\nYou certainly couldn't charge anyone money to teach them how to get there.\n\nIt takes actual work.\n\nUnlike meditation, which is a \"restful\" scam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "All Forms of Meditation Are A Scam", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"330ecv87k7fc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4dbe6a581b46647d324df1ff74b2e3bb5ee048f"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b66203480f4af48bf6cd5fbda3275b2a0d8ba5d"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f06934e1b6375233c2fbce4f02875c811a1ce2"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3fcd28c8625330515741cf51c554757960e884b"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c9c201f2e612f6a648fdab7193c7fffb45f9c89"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe93100e3df1f7cdb6a58e732d129fd71bcc6f4"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=706520b1fe829a9756a8c5e7860978fee2a2bac6"}, "id": "330ecv87k7fc1"}}, "name": "t3_1ach2ib", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 36, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/eFRdNCEB3d0kPOPTNylu8QZnMskoKjasRHlTgWMWi9g.jpg", "edited": 1706459516.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1706379263.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=706520b1fe829a9756a8c5e7860978fee2a2bac6\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/330ecv87k7fc1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=706520b1fe829a9756a8c5e7860978fee2a2bac6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone in the meditation subreddit trashed Carlos, so I spent some time there arguing back and forth about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t get banned!

Or find their &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real magic, or real exploration of consciousness, produces DAILY impossible experiences you can&amp;#39;t even talk about with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You certainly couldn&amp;#39;t charge anyone money to teach them how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes actual work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike meditation, which is a &amp;quot;restful&amp;quot; scam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "1ach2ib", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1ach2ib/all_forms_of_meditation_are_a_scam/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1ach2ib/all_forms_of_meditation_are_a_scam/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1706379263.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kjugbql", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1706383821.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kju6csb", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;fall asleep\" at will with eyes open\n\nMore on this, from the students-chat:\n\n[**Individual\\_Warthog68**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Individual_Warthog68/) 4:59 PM - How does one take back personal power from the fliers when they overwhelm his mind with nonsense constantly?\n\n[**danl999**](https://www.reddit.com/user//) 5:53 PM - Through removing the internal dialogue, until the assemblage point can move all the way to the orange zone, where the breath changes, and your \"self\" no longer makes any sense.\n\nHowever, if you can just remove it^(1) (*see below)* long enough to see some purple puffs in darkness, that'll brighten our day, and worry the hell out of the fliers.\n\nThe \"nonsense\" you are referring to is an imaginary problem.

Though impossible to explain.  You could visualize it by sitting in your car in a car wash, where the car wash equipment moves, and your car does not. When the car wash machine&amp;#39;s giant brushes start spinning and moving along the edge of your car, you feel as if you released your foot from the brake, and your car is rolling forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though it isn&amp;#39;t moving at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s something surrounding the car which is moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That feeling is a tiny bit like the flow of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, when learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can detect that &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; of intent,  you come to realize that doing all of your tensegrity at once in the night, isn&amp;#39;t as effective as doing a little tensegrity during the day, perhaps on a work break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep the flow going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, that&amp;#39;s not enough to gain anyone the ability to move their own assemblage point on demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have the last 25 years to prove that. Not a single Cleargreen follower learned any sorcery at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Cleargreen started to erase the expectation of magic from their teaching materials, adding in some new form of pretending that you have &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An old &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot; delusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1ach2ib", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1ach2ib/all_forms_of_meditation_are_a_scam/kjunx8r/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1706386603.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kjuo8tg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "richardslang_MD", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1706386721.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kju8l9a", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_4ttebf0y", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I think the feeling of \"unhappiness\" is just you getting used to not being excited about meaningless bullshit.

Will never learn sorcery, because they don't actually want to.\n\nThat defined, someone took up my challenge to show another place like this subreddit where Buddhists are learning something real.\n\nHe did a good job! Even I was impressed while reading it.\n\nBut it was described with different words than we u se. Words obviously tainted by Buddhist ideas.\n\nAnd it didn't really get the person out of the green zone.\n\nIt did however shed some light on why Buddhists can get stuck in the green zone, insisting it's an ultimate achievement.\n\nWe haven't explored what happens when you shift horizontally on the green line, because we aren't confined there. Possibly because we don't shun inorganic beings.\n\nDon Juan did say that without their dark energy you can't move your assemblage point the way sorcerers do.\n\nThat might not be a \"can't get to orange without it\". Or \"can't get to SK without it\" type of thing.\n\nDon Juan didn't define where you are stopped because he didn't divide the second attention up the way we do, with our J curve obsessions.\n\nWhich are necessary for our learning methods.\n\nThe new seers had their own obsessions. Such as Nagual's Blow obsessions, \"dent removal\" obsessions, and \"remembering everything\" obsessions associated with how they learned.\n\nBut still, what if don Juan wasn't referring so much to a hard barrier along the J curve, but rather to something else less easy to define.\n\nThe difficulty level perhaps.\n\nIt's \"possible\" for someone to move, for example, down to the red zone with no help from anything.\n\nBut unlikely. And if they did once or twice, it would soon seem irrelevant and not worth pursuing if they didn't do that daily.\n\nThe second attention is easily erased from our mind over time. Sometimes mere seconds, the way a dream can be forgotten so quickly shortly after waking up.\n\nAnd if it's unlikely to move from green to red without inorganic being assistance, the same is true of red to orange, and orange to purple.\n\nSo to go from green on the J curve diagram which uses Railroad tracks as the analogy, all the way out to purple Station at the very end, without dark energy, is perhaps not \"impossible\" but just so unlikely it'll never happen.\n\nYou MIGHT suddenly decide to become the world's best golfer and put in all the effort required.\n\nBut it's very unlikely.\n\nKeep in mind, Buddhists shun spirits. They've been told to ignore them.\n\nShinzen Young did just that, after he had an inorganic being make a huge effort to become friends with him, even producing tactile and auditory information to go along with a vision of a little drummer man standing on his hand.\n\nShinzen made fun of it, saying it was a topic for philosophers. Not for an enlightened man like himself.\n\nMeanwhile Daniel Ingram talks to demons, but you have to realize he talks to demons far less often than our people do. Or he'd have realized they aren't demons very early on.\n\nStill hasn't!\n\nHe still perceives them as such which pretty much means it's extremely rare for him to be able to do that, and he's implying something that isn't true.\n\nBuddhism encourages that sort of dishonesty because it changed Hinduism by making enlightenment \"permanent\", and into some kind of real transition your teachers could detect and evaluate, to declare you enlightened and worthy of your own little throne.\n\nThey have a throne reward system going on.\n\nIt's the cheapest possible \"reward\", because you have to get your OWN little throne, and collect your OWN dedicated monk followers to chant at your feet and put money in your donation box.\n\nBut angry men are so awful, that's a gigantic motivation to them. We lost Tony to that urge.\n\nTo lord it over others as a \"recognized\" guru, saint, or master.\n\nI got into a spat with Shinzen, pointing out that Buddhism was Juvenile Hinduism.\n\nA thought he instantly understood! He's no fool.\n\nBut he couldn't accept that because it would \"dethrone him\". So he insisted I couldn't find a single scholar who would agree with that.\n\nAlso a very bizarre delusion. That there are any scholars at all who have good insight into religious systems.\n\nJust read around. There are not.\n\nAnd typical of Buddhists, who seek \"endorsement from a higher authority\" more than actual magic.\n\nAnd once you have a reward system going, instead of the reward just being magic in your face, you set up the worst thing that can happen to followers.\n\nReward seeking, outside actual magic. And rewards that are human provided. You have to be \"declared\" enlightened, by someone else from your system who has also been declared as such.\n\nBut I'm afraid to say, Japanese Zen masters almost universally look down on the Dali Lama as a fake.\n\nJust a figurehead. Who would not qualify as \"enlightened\" when faced with a Japanese Zen master teacher. So that one monk's \"endorsement system\" is not transferable to a different set of monks. They don't recognize each others credentials.\n\nI don't want to get into that controversy any deeper, even though it's very revealing.\n\nBut once you have people seeking human rewards you set up a specific mindset.\n\nThe mindset of the inventory warrior.\n\nThe guy bent on \"proving himself\" with his \"understanding\".\n\nWords mostly. At least in our predicament, surrounded by Castaneda fan inventory warriors.\n\nThey're even more hollow than Buddhists or Yogis.\n\nAt least Buddhists have cool magic in their face, like that description of Dzogchen darkroom someone posted a link to.\n\nMaybe I'll copy it to here.\n\nBut still, that's an inventory warrior.\n\nExcept, with \"proof\".\n\nOur inventory warriors don't have a meditation system that's easy enough for them to actually try it. And many add one on from an Asian system, to get that \"proof\".\n\nOr eat some shrooms.\n\nBut in fact, our own inventory warriors are even more pitiful than those in asian systems, because at least the asian systems see a taste of real magic from time to time.\n\nLet me back up here.\n\nIf you have someone interested in magic, there can be multiple reasons.\n\nWe can't pin it down to a single one.\n\nWomen for example, perhaps want to fit into a lifestyle.\n\nThey want a \"magical lifestyle\". Why not? It's easier to learn when surrounded by practitioners.\n\nIt's not universal, but we see that in the behavior of women in general in the subreddit.\n\nThey phase in and out.\n\nDepending on what's going on in their normal lives.\n\nThe men tend to be obsessive, and stick around more consistently. For a while.\n\nBut they burn out rather than fade in and out.\n\nThey seem more reliable in terms of short term participation, but they're also liable to disappear for long periods if something else catches their attention.\n\nMen and women have different motivations to learn sorcery.\n\nNeither purely based on a desire for the magic itself.\n\nSo people have something that motivates them, but it's not what it ought to be to keep them on track daily.\n\nWe have no teachers. No entertaining don Genaro to toss a bucket of miracles in our face.\n\nWe have to \"self-motivate\", which is a rare talent indeed.\n\nOur own inventory warriors believe they can pretend sensations and feelings and wise thoughts, fit them into the \"warrior's Way\", and declare themselves enlightened.\n\nThey're self-certifying now that there are no authorities around to contradict them.\n\nAnd what they want is to wear the rambo headband and lord it over others as \"genuine shaman teachers\". Stealing as much money and attention as they can.\n\nWhile their magic is non-existent.\n\nAnd they don't care.\n\nDaoists work themselves up into frenzied trances, hitting themselves on the head with boards with nails in them until blood drips down their heads. They're closely associated with the self-harming mediums in Taiwan. Who are depicted in nice cell phone pictures of high res, while you can only find Daoists beat themselves bloody, in rare youtube videos.\n\nBut Daoists also gaze at candles and such. They are very much in search of \"magic in your face\".\n\nSo they can cash in with it.\n\nAnd they know how to get green line effects, even if those are a little bloody.\n\nBuddhists also use that sort of \"forced green line\" effect when they chant and beat on drums, in a very ritualized fashion.\n\nThe idea is to stop thinking about all your problems for a while, in a repeating procedure, so that your assemblage point can learn to move a bit under that circumstance. And \"notice\" things. Which will be easier to notice, the next time.\n\nIf everyone is chanting with their eyes closed in a pleasing ritual, magic will begin to \"store\" into that container for them!\n\nMagic will even store into \"Church containers\", with \"the holy spirit\" (an unknown inorganic being that specific church picked up), flying above the old church goers.\n\nGiving them that sensation of \"magic through Christ\".\n\nAnd you end up with potentially vivid green zone effects.\n\nGreen zone effects can be generated by just about anything. As don Juan said, the fastest way to make a direct hit on the second attention is with repetitious acts.\n\nAnd we know the men of knowledge needed their rituals to succeed.\n\nSo we have various motivations possible for wanting to learn magic. Attention from others is the one we hope to avoid, but it's impossible to achieve that except in very rare cases.\n\nIt could be, our subreddit's discovery that 1 in 100 who will try, and 1 in 500 who will get far enough to see reliable silent knowledge, is mostly a measure of who actually wanted magic, more than human attention.\n\nDismal odds there.\n\nSo our own \"inventory warriors\" who have only pretending magic, such as \"I feel POWER\", or \"I can FEEL the flow of ENERGY\", are one specific level of awful.\n\nBut how much worse, if you could get to the green line doing that? Incorporate some real magic, into your egotistical motivations.\n\nWe can \"talk those simple inventory warriors down\" to some extent. The ones with no current way to see real magic.\n\nNot the angry ones perhaps.\n\nBut the borderline inventory warriors will snap out of it once they see pictures of real magic a few times.\n\nThey change over to believing they could do that too, so the fake rewards of human attention seem less appealing.\n\nBut imagine if they actually had a technique that got them to the green line, and RELIABLY.\n\nMeditation does that.\n\nBut so does shamanic drumming! It's just that you don't get a little throne for what you experience during shamanic drumming.\n\nA smelly bath with pink champagne and candles all around, gets women reliably to the green zone.\n\nBut no one \"honors\" them for self-soothing like that.\n\nFrankly, that's a mistake. We should fix it one day.\n\nMake impromptu assemblage point movement techniques like soothing baths, be more reputable as the magic they really are.\n\nCholita is the master of those forms of magic.\n\nOr make witches spells, and what you \"feel\" while doing them, more clear as an actual \"achievement\".\n\nThe Magick people swear they have the real thing, even while the principles behind it are total nonsense.\n\nYou just have to look at the history of that practice to realize it doesn't even make sense, from their own point of view. Of the claims of where it came from.\n\nIt always came from frauds if you go back far enough.\n\nBut it produces green line effects. We have some former Magick types in the subreddit, and they did in fact experience green line magic doing it. Now that they understand how the J curve works, they can clearly see that.\n\nSo here's where you get into trouble with beginner's level of real magic.\n\nHow you get \"trapped\".\n\nWhen you have a primary motivation for human rewards. Attention seeking.\n\nWhen you belong to a cash based magical system like Buddhism, which needs endless money just to survive.\n\nAnd where they have to come up with endless \"new products\" all the time, just to get by. New \"advanced meditation techniques\", new sacred scrolls you have to purchase, new \"Siddhi\" techniques.\n\nBut back to Daoists who work themselves up into frenzies, with demonic possession.\n\nIt's not really \"advertised\" in the west.\n\nOur exposure to Daoism is through bad player western men who wanted to set up a profitable franchise here. And didn't want us to understand the actual context of Daoism at his source.\n\nYou have to be in actual Chinese countries to see them running around with the silver chests to hold the exorcised demons, the Daoist priests insisting the chest is very heavy and the audience needs to pay them coins to make it worth their while to move it around like that.\n\nIt's an \"honor\" to be a \"silver demon chest\" bearer at the Buddhist Temple. They make a big show of it, and both before and after that part of the festival Daoist priests on stilts let the kids toss firecrackers at them, to show they are \"invulnerable\".\n\nAn obsession they had during the Boxer Rebellion, which lead to them all being shot to death with guns.\n\nBut our old seers were no better. They also believed they were \"invulnerable\" until other waring native american tribes nearly wiped them out. Same happened after they fled to the Toltec nation. Again invaded and nearly wiped out.\n\nBoth Daoists and Old Seers became deluded by seeing actual magic in whatever form, mixed with their own \"inventory\" of what their techniques mean.\n\nA mistaken idea plus a little \"magic in your face\", is a very hard delusion to remove.\n\nInventory warriors with a taste of the real thing, are \"invulnerable\".\n\nThat's the sense of entitlement they get, when you mix delusions plus real magic.\n\nLet's pick on the Jews a while. Everyone else does.\n\nThe Jewish prophets had \"techniques\".\n\nThey forced themselves silent, but in bizarre ways. Folding in half in the desert is one.\n\nAnd they became obsessed with perceiving inorganic beings, through the lens of religious delusion.\n\nIOBs love religious delusions! It makes them more important to humans.\n\nThe Prophets also became obsessed with visiting heaven, and God.\n\nAll of those, surprisingly, are just green line effects.\n\nHeaven is simply a 50% shift left on the green line.\n\nGod? I have no idea, but you can visit God while you can only get to the green line.\n\nI have several times in the past.\n\nIt's a far horizontal shift, which aligns that bundle of shared emanations from all the people praying to him.\n\nIn other words, those emanations are \"lit up\" with residual awareness, by people up at the blue line.\n\nWho pray, wish, hope, close their eyes, or try to have visionary dreams of God and Heaven.\n\nThat's what lights up the \"blob\" of emanations that makes it possible to visit God or Heaven.\n\nThey're phantom constructs but from blue line people, forcing green line effects through haphazard techniques.\n\nYou can't possibly dissuade a religious person who gets to visit God or Heaven, or hears Jesus speak to him during praying, that their religion is false.\n\nTry telling the Jews that Lucifer, the entire basis of their religion, is not actually in a war with God in Heaven.\n\nYou'll be accused of religious hatred.\n\nLikewise, try arguing with a Thai Buddhist. It's such a \"religious\" variety of Buddhism that the Chinese don't even consider it the same thing.\n\nI guess it's like born again christians insisting Catholics are not actually \"christians\". As they, the \"born agains\", truly are.\n\nThe Thai are much more likely than the Chinese to meditate or pray and get to the green line, while thinking about their Buddhist \"inventory\".\n\nYou could say they are \"avid inventory warriors\" for Thai Buddhism theology, but who can also get to the green line. A tiny bit.\n\nHow much worse if you have an actual serious westernized Buddhist who has the \"sanitized\" form of the religion, altered to be more western and intellectually sound in nature, and who can get to the green line.\n\nAnd experience what is stunning, to someone who hasn't seen that.\n\nIt's real magic in your face!\n\nEven if you have to sit with your eyes closed.\n\nSo once you have that magic in your face you'll want to sustain it. Get more. Get it reliably.\n\nAnd what do you turn to?\n\nYour inventory items! To what you consider sound advice from the masters.\n\nSacred scrolls. Buddhist descriptions of higher and higher states.\n\nIngram became obsessed with proving all of those, just because he saw a few puffs and talked to a few demons.\n\nHe didn't \"see the truth\". He saw an opportunity to get more human attention by using his new found magic, to \"prove\" even more Buddhist theology.\n\nHe become trapped by green line experiences, instead of liberated.\n\nOne might surmise, and I often do, that if you can get someone to the green line you won a battle with them. You got them to go from social reward seeing, to seeking magic.\n\nBut clearly you don't. You can just look at how trapped Asian meditation system people get, from a few meager green line effects.\n\nThey believe it verifies all the inventory they were given, further trapping them in delusions.\n\nSo they try to \"map out\" all the delusions to see them for themselves, because they're really, mostly, seeking human endorsement.\n\nAnd their \"inventory of higher states of conscious\" implies they're inferior, if they don't understand all of them.\n\nTheir thinking becomes, they got this far so surely they can go all the way!\n\nAn inventory warrior with a working meditation technique is virtually a lost cause for ever learning sorcery.\n\nEspecially when given the instructions to ignore spirits and visions.\n\nTo seek self-soothing \"deeper and deeper\" levels of silence.\n\nBy the way if you get silent, the world simply stops.\n\nIt can't do otherwise.\n\nSo they aren't getting deeper and deeper levels of silence.\n\nWhat they're doing is ignoring intermittent internal dialogue, because they get weirder and weird green line effects from shifting horizontally.\n\nWe have the same problem. NONE of us has ever gotten fully silent except possibly by accident, and with the help of an inorganic being.\n\nI stopped the world, but without little smoke to help I could only get to the edge.\n\nWhere you still have internal dialogue on an intermittent basis.\n\nPeople practicing meditation confuse bliss and going in and out of visions, with silence.\n\nI suppose they don't have any idea that there's a necessary 2 minutes just to get the assemblage point to start moving. And hours to move all the way to Silent Knowledge.\n\nSo they believe that \"silence\" is something you could experience, after 10 seconds.\n\nIf they blank out or loose lucidity by transitioning between visionary states, they have no understanding of assemblage point movements to explain why that happens.\n\nSo they interpret it according to their mistaken inventory items, from the religion that teaches that technique.\n\nThey literally get trapped moving horizontally at the green line trying to duplicate pointless past observations of green line results by former meditators, because they actually seek human attention.\n\nNot magic.\n\nAnd the magic they get to perceive just causes them to get all the more trapped.\n\nIt's no different than sorcerers getting trapped by the red zone.\n\nThat's just \"more fun\", so we tend to think of it as \"nobler\".\n\nJulian was hooked on shapeshifting sex in my opinion.\n\nThat's all.\n\nHe was an addict to the red zone's pleasures, the same way Buddhists and Hindus can become addicted to the green zone.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Inventory Warriors Plus Green Line Effects", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 116, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"exc7hsylauba1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 89, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/exc7hsylauba1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f370551705724630e4a403d919bb306fce12c31"}, {"y": 179, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/exc7hsylauba1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3adaf163a8180729e9c0de01a0e24d8813602aa"}, {"y": 265, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/exc7hsylauba1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b176554b19f86293e3723e5524e1d73ae4c4d4cf"}, {"y": 531, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/exc7hsylauba1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b7c7e065f100f6fb819e2713d90e72b248a70e"}, {"y": 797, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/exc7hsylauba1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dde6cd62ce6868d6ddface98654819899f906c9c"}, {"y": 897, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/exc7hsylauba1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbda45f69c92e8a322f4b16fa29f50e3bad827de"}], "s": {"y": 1436, "x": 1728, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/exc7hsylauba1.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=797a84a26764b0aa2660003de4f965402335a01d"}, "id": "exc7hsylauba1"}}, "name": "t3_10az78p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/dk3a7UW8raUlqc59zzUmN3Zgl_UGa0xwk4ajWZJips8.jpg", "edited": 1673634237.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1673628527.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/exc7hsylauba1.png?width=1728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=797a84a26764b0aa2660003de4f965402335a01d\"&gt; Chinese Spirit Medium in lieu of Daoist beating himself bloody in low res video &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me first define an &amp;quot;inventory warrior&amp;quot; for those who don&amp;#39;t know what that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a Castaneda fan, usually of only the first 3 or 4 books, who likes to pretend to be an &amp;quot;impeccable warrior&amp;quot;, but never follows the difficult instructions given by don Juan, to learn to get silent, engage in gazing, and figure out how to move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just pretend all that, taking huge pride in their knowledge of &amp;quot;sorcery facts&amp;quot;, from the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re hopeless.

They&amp;#39;ve been told to ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shinzen Young did just that, after he had an inorganic being make a huge effort to become friends with him, even producing tactile and auditory information to go along with a vision of a little drummer man standing on his hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shinzen made fun of it, saying it was a topic for philosophers. Not for an enlightened man like himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Daniel Ingram talks to demons, but you have to realize he talks to demons far less often than our people do. Or he&amp;#39;d have realized they aren&amp;#39;t demons very early on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still hasn&amp;#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He still perceives them as such which pretty much means it&amp;#39;s extremely rare for him to be able to do that, and he&amp;#39;s implying something that isn&amp;#39;t true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhism encourages that sort of dishonesty because it changed Hinduism by making enlightenment &amp;quot;permanent&amp;quot;, and into some kind of real transition your teachers could detect and evaluate, to declare you enlightened and worthy of your own little throne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have a throne reward system going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the cheapest possible &amp;quot;reward&amp;quot;, because you have to get your OWN little throne, and collect your OWN dedicated monk followers to chant at your feet and put money in your donation box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But angry men are so awful, that&amp;#39;s a gigantic motivation to them. We lost Tony to that urge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To lord it over others as a &amp;quot;recognized&amp;quot; guru, saint, or master.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got into a spat with Shinzen, pointing out that Buddhism was Juvenile Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A thought he instantly understood! He&amp;#39;s no fool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he couldn&amp;#39;t accept that because it would &amp;quot;dethrone him&amp;quot;. So he insisted I couldn&amp;#39;t find a single scholar who would agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also a very bizarre delusion. That there are any scholars at all who have good insight into religious systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just read around. There are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And typical of Buddhists, who seek &amp;quot;endorsement from a higher authority&amp;quot; more than actual magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And once you have a reward system going, instead of the reward just being magic in your face, you set up the worst thing that can happen to followers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reward seeking, outside actual magic. And rewards that are human provided. You have to be &amp;quot;declared&amp;quot; enlightened, by someone else from your system who has also been declared as such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m afraid to say, Japanese Zen masters almost universally look down on the Dali Lama as a fake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a figurehead. Who would not qualify as &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot; when faced with a Japanese Zen master teacher. So that one monk&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;endorsement system&amp;quot; is not transferable to a different set of monks. They don&amp;#39;t recognize each others credentials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to get into that controversy any deeper, even though it&amp;#39;s very revealing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you have people seeking human rewards you set up a specific mindset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mindset of the inventory warrior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy bent on &amp;quot;proving himself&amp;quot; with his &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Words mostly. At least in our predicament, surrounded by Castaneda fan inventory warriors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re even more hollow than Buddhists or Yogis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least Buddhists have cool magic in their face, like that description of Dzogchen darkroom someone posted a link to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;ll copy it to here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, that&amp;#39;s an inventory warrior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, with &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our inventory warriors don&amp;#39;t have a meditation system that&amp;#39;s easy enough for them to actually try it. And many add one on from an Asian system, to get that &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or eat some shrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, our own inventory warriors are even more pitiful than those in asian systems, because at least the asian systems see a taste of real magic from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me back up here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have someone interested in magic, there can be multiple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t pin it down to a single one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women for example, perhaps want to fit into a lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They want a &amp;quot;magical lifestyle&amp;quot;. Why not? It&amp;#39;s easier to learn when surrounded by practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not universal, but we see that in the behavior of women in general in the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They phase in and out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on what&amp;#39;s going on in their normal lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men tend to be obsessive, and stick around more consistently. For a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they burn out rather than fade in and out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They seem more reliable in terms of short term participation, but they&amp;#39;re also liable to disappear for long periods if something else catches their attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men and women have different motivations to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither purely based on a desire for the magic itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So people have something that motivates them, but it&amp;#39;s not what it ought to be to keep them on track daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have no teachers. No entertaining don Genaro to toss a bucket of miracles in our face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to &amp;quot;self-motivate&amp;quot;, which is a rare talent indeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our own inventory warriors believe they can pretend sensations and feelings and wise thoughts, fit them into the &amp;quot;warrior&amp;#39;s Way&amp;quot;, and declare themselves enlightened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re self-certifying now that there are no authorities around to contradict them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what they want is to wear the rambo headband and lord it over others as &amp;quot;genuine shaman teachers&amp;quot;. Stealing as much money and attention as they can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While their magic is non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daoists work themselves up into frenzied trances, hitting themselves on the head with boards with nails in them until blood drips down their heads. They&amp;#39;re closely associated with the self-harming mediums in Taiwan. Who are depicted in nice cell phone pictures of high res, while you can only find Daoists beat themselves bloody, in rare youtube videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Daoists also gaze at candles and such. They are very much in search of &amp;quot;magic in your face&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can cash in with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they know how to get green line effects, even if those are a little bloody.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhists also use that sort of &amp;quot;forced green line&amp;quot; effect when they chant and beat on drums, in a very ritualized fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea is to stop thinking about all your problems for a while, in a repeating procedure, so that your assemblage point can learn to move a bit under that circumstance. And &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; things. Which will be easier to notice, the next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If everyone is chanting with their eyes closed in a pleasing ritual, magic will begin to &amp;quot;store&amp;quot; into that container for them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic will even store into &amp;quot;Church containers&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;the holy spirit&amp;quot; (an unknown inorganic being that specific church picked up), flying above the old church goers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Giving them that sensation of &amp;quot;magic through Christ&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you end up with potentially vivid green zone effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Green zone effects can be generated by just about anything. As don Juan said, the fastest way to make a direct hit on the second attention is with repetitious acts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we know the men of knowledge needed their rituals to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we have various motivations possible for wanting to learn magic. Attention from others is the one we hope to avoid, but it&amp;#39;s impossible to achieve that except in very rare cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could be, our subreddit&amp;#39;s discovery that 1 in 100 who will try, and 1 in 500 who will get far enough to see reliable silent knowledge, is mostly a measure of who actually wanted magic, more than human attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dismal odds there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So our own &amp;quot;inventory warriors&amp;quot; who have only pretending magic, such as &amp;quot;I feel POWER&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;I can FEEL the flow of ENERGY&amp;quot;, are one specific level of awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how much worse, if you could get to the green line doing that? Incorporate some real magic, into your egotistical motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can &amp;quot;talk those simple inventory warriors down&amp;quot; to some extent. The ones with no current way to see real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the angry ones perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the borderline inventory warriors will snap out of it once they see pictures of real magic a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They change over to believing they could do that too, so the fake rewards of human attention seem less appealing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But imagine if they actually had a technique that got them to the green line, and RELIABLY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meditation does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But so does shamanic drumming! It&amp;#39;s just that you don&amp;#39;t get a little throne for what you experience during shamanic drumming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A smelly bath with pink champagne and candles all around, gets women reliably to the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one &amp;quot;honors&amp;quot; them for self-soothing like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, that&amp;#39;s a mistake. We should fix it one day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make impromptu assemblage point movement techniques like soothing baths, be more reputable as the magic they really are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is the master of those forms of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or make witches spells, and what you &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; while doing them, more clear as an actual &amp;quot;achievement&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Magick people swear they have the real thing, even while the principles behind it are total nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to look at the history of that practice to realize it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense, from their own point of view. Of the claims of where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It always came from frauds if you go back far enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it produces green line effects. We have some former Magick types in the subreddit, and they did in fact experience green line magic doing it. Now that they understand how the J curve works, they can clearly see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s where you get into trouble with beginner&amp;#39;s level of real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How you get &amp;quot;trapped&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you have a primary motivation for human rewards. Attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you belong to a cash based magical system like Buddhism, which needs endless money just to survive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And where they have to come up with endless &amp;quot;new products&amp;quot; all the time, just to get by. New &amp;quot;advanced meditation techniques&amp;quot;, new sacred scrolls you have to purchase, new &amp;quot;Siddhi&amp;quot; techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to Daoists who work themselves up into frenzies, with demonic possession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not really &amp;quot;advertised&amp;quot; in the west.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our exposure to Daoism is through bad player western men who wanted to set up a profitable franchise here. And didn&amp;#39;t want us to understand the actual context of Daoism at his source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to be in actual Chinese countries to see them running around with the silver chests to hold the exorcised demons, the Daoist priests insisting the chest is very heavy and the audience needs to pay them coins to make it worth their while to move it around like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an &amp;quot;honor&amp;quot; to be a &amp;quot;silver demon chest&amp;quot; bearer at the Buddhist Temple. They make a big show of it, and both before and after that part of the festival Daoist priests on stilts let the kids toss firecrackers at them, to show they are &amp;quot;invulnerable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An obsession they had during the Boxer Rebellion, which lead to them all being shot to death with guns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But our old seers were no better. They also believed they were &amp;quot;invulnerable&amp;quot; until other waring native american tribes nearly wiped them out. Same happened after they fled to the Toltec nation. Again invaded and nearly wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both Daoists and Old Seers became deluded by seeing actual magic in whatever form, mixed with their own &amp;quot;inventory&amp;quot; of what their techniques mean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A mistaken idea plus a little &amp;quot;magic in your face&amp;quot;, is a very hard delusion to remove.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inventory warriors with a taste of the real thing, are &amp;quot;invulnerable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the sense of entitlement they get, when you mix delusions plus real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s pick on the Jews a while. Everyone else does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jewish prophets had &amp;quot;techniques&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They forced themselves silent, but in bizarre ways. Folding in half in the desert is one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they became obsessed with perceiving inorganic beings, through the lens of religious delusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs love religious delusions! It makes them more important to humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Prophets also became obsessed with visiting heaven, and God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those, surprisingly, are just green line effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heaven is simply a 50% shift left on the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God? I have no idea, but you can visit God while you can only get to the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have several times in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a far horizontal shift, which aligns that bundle of shared emanations from all the people praying to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, those emanations are &amp;quot;lit up&amp;quot; with residual awareness, by people up at the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who pray, wish, hope, close their eyes, or try to have visionary dreams of God and Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what lights up the &amp;quot;blob&amp;quot; of emanations that makes it possible to visit God or Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re phantom constructs but from blue line people, forcing green line effects through haphazard techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t possibly dissuade a religious person who gets to visit God or Heaven, or hears Jesus speak to him during praying, that their religion is false.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try telling the Jews that Lucifer, the entire basis of their religion, is not actually in a war with God in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be accused of religious hatred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, try arguing with a Thai Buddhist. It&amp;#39;s such a &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot; variety of Buddhism that the Chinese don&amp;#39;t even consider it the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#39;s like born again christians insisting Catholics are not actually &amp;quot;christians&amp;quot;. As they, the &amp;quot;born agains&amp;quot;, truly are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Thai are much more likely than the Chinese to meditate or pray and get to the green line, while thinking about their Buddhist &amp;quot;inventory&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could say they are &amp;quot;avid inventory warriors&amp;quot; for Thai Buddhism theology, but who can also get to the green line. A tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much worse if you have an actual serious westernized Buddhist who has the &amp;quot;sanitized&amp;quot; form of the religion, altered to be more western and intellectually sound in nature, and who can get to the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And experience what is stunning, to someone who hasn&amp;#39;t seen that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s real magic in your face!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you have to sit with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So once you have that magic in your face you&amp;#39;ll want to sustain it. Get more. Get it reliably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what do you turn to?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your inventory items! To what you consider sound advice from the masters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sacred scrolls. Buddhist descriptions of higher and higher states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ingram became obsessed with proving all of those, just because he saw a few puffs and talked to a few demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;see the truth&amp;quot;. He saw an opportunity to get more human attention by using his new found magic, to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; even more Buddhist theology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He become trapped by green line experiences, instead of liberated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One might surmise, and I often do, that if you can get someone to the green line you won a battle with them. You got them to go from social reward seeing, to seeking magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But clearly you don&amp;#39;t. You can just look at how trapped Asian meditation system people get, from a few meager green line effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They believe it verifies all the inventory they were given, further trapping them in delusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they try to &amp;quot;map out&amp;quot; all the delusions to see them for themselves, because they&amp;#39;re really, mostly, seeking human endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And their &amp;quot;inventory of higher states of conscious&amp;quot; implies they&amp;#39;re inferior, if they don&amp;#39;t understand all of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their thinking becomes, they got this far so surely they can go all the way!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An inventory warrior with a working meditation technique is virtually a lost cause for ever learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially when given the instructions to ignore spirits and visions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To seek self-soothing &amp;quot;deeper and deeper&amp;quot; levels of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way if you get silent, the world simply stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t do otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they aren&amp;#39;t getting deeper and deeper levels of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they&amp;#39;re doing is ignoring intermittent internal dialogue, because they get weirder and weird green line effects from shifting horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have the same problem. NONE of us has ever gotten fully silent except possibly by accident, and with the help of an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped the world, but without little smoke to help I could only get to the edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you still have internal dialogue on an intermittent basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People practicing meditation confuse bliss and going in and out of visions, with silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose they don&amp;#39;t have any idea that there&amp;#39;s a necessary 2 minutes just to get the assemblage point to start moving. And hours to move all the way to Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they believe that &amp;quot;silence&amp;quot; is something you could experience, after 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they blank out or loose lucidity by transitioning between visionary states, they have no understanding of assemblage point movements to explain why that happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they interpret it according to their mistaken inventory items, from the religion that teaches that technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They literally get trapped moving horizontally at the green line trying to duplicate pointless past observations of green line results by former meditators, because they actually seek human attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the magic they get to perceive just causes them to get all the more trapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no different than sorcerers getting trapped by the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just &amp;quot;more fun&amp;quot;, so we tend to think of it as &amp;quot;nobler&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julian was hooked on shapeshifting sex in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was an addict to the red zone&amp;#39;s pleasures, the same way Buddhists and Hindus can become addicted to the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false,

The feeling was like &amp;quot;ohhhh god yes you beautiful lovely sandwich come be a part of me&amp;quot;. Joy and just wholesomeness. And the next thing I knew I had sudden expansion into my body and the space immediately around me, and I was free again. The image and its feeling was no longer grabbing my attention. It was like reality flipped over. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem like the default nature of reality is in any way serious or detrimental like organic lifeforms make it. And whatever was happening to me is the antithesis of egg sandwich love-making, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I heard a spiritual teacher I like a lot, one time say he was &amp;quot;ascending higher and higher&amp;quot; or something along those lines (maybe funny to yall lol). And some being called for him to turn back or he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to return. It felt right to my imagination then, and all of this feels oh so right now. This is the nature of life, I&amp;#39;m sure of it. I want to see it so badly. Dang it dang it dang it why does this have to be so cool!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_10az78p", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10az78p/inventory_warriors_plus_green_line_effects/j4fzmyd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1673789180.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1673789180.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j48415h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j47ucro", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "They never said.\n\nWe just have to \"find out\"!\n\nI'll volunteer you for 10 minutes in your physical body, and 2 hours in your double.\n\nThen we can find out if those times are ok.\n\nBut I do suspect the voice of seeing helps out with this.\n\nSeeing the emanations is 100% Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt's a presentation method, for what creates presentations.\n\nAnd if you need some explaining, I believe it will.\n\nI went back and forth into a single \"flame\" of emanations that was in front of me, to try to understand how that flame represented an entire world.\n\nI knew it was a \"bundle\", but not more details about how that works.\n\nBut on the second time going back and forth, a voice warned me not to keep doing that.\n\nSaid I would \"dissolve\".\n\nBut there wasn't actually a voice, because there was nothing but emanations.\n\nI just \"knew\" it was a bad idea.\n\nMaybe we can wear welding goggles, before going in there?\n\nTrue, it's silly.\n\nBut the Eagle likes silly and darning.\n\nThey might work!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j48415h", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They never said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just have to &amp;quot;find out&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll volunteer you for 10 minutes in your physical body, and 2 hours in your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we can find out if those times are ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I do suspect the voice of seeing helps out with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing the emanations is 100% Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a presentation method, for what creates presentations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you need some explaining, I believe it will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back and forth into a single &amp;quot;flame&amp;quot;

It&amp;#39;s not created by the emanations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s our &amp;quot;preferences&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So 100 million emanations are ignored, 1 million used, and the ones used are &amp;quot;all you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All your fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stop &amp;quot;selecting&amp;quot; with your internal dialogue, you&amp;#39;re face to face with 101M emanations unwilling to take any form you could comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s too many to perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for us, even a tiny bit of silence gets you to the green line.  No need to be truly silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More and you get to see intense magic in the red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when the internal dialogue is completely off, you don&amp;#39;t interpret anything to be anything in particular so the emanations start to &amp;quot;reskim&amp;quot; to help you out, but can&amp;#39;t find a basis for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality begins to &amp;quot;make you an offer you can&amp;#39;t refuse&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you end up seeing all of the emanations at once, in some kind of &amp;quot;leftover impression&amp;quot; view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see something similar to that scene in &amp;quot;The Matrix&amp;quot; where the world is just fibers of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0gfdpv2ddwba1.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=57c18529c10fc14d92f68288c0ac78455b47fd09\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0gfdpv2ddwba1.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=57c18529c10fc14d92f68288c0ac78455b47fd09&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not precisely, but close enough to be &amp;quot;suspicious&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably see that, because it&amp;#39;s the closest thing to what you might see if you had enough interpretation to make something materialize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose others might see &amp;quot;The Eagle&amp;quot; too, but that also is latent impressions someone else caused to &amp;quot;infect&amp;quot; you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll have to animate that.

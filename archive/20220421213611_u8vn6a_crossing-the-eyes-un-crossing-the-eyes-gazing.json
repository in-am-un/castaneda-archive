Also, here's a few relevant food for thought links.\n\n [https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/29771/why-cant-some-people-see-magic-eye-pictures](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/29771/why-cant-some-people-see-magic-eye-pictures)\n\n[Magic Eye Viewing Instructions](https://preview.redd.it/fnaihq7wrxu81.png?width=1312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23ed43afbed62875f2304ea53d6b9901ffcf574c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Magic Eye Working Example](https://preview.redd.it/zvxb83v3sxu81.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dd2cdc2883dd3aa34f2479fb571649418b3efbb)\n\nEach eye is an independent lens and each can focus on something further away or closer than the point where the normal line to the tangent plane of the surface of the center of each pupil of each eye intersects in three dimensional space when you look at things in the normal way. Basically the line through the exact center of the pupil through the exact center of the backside of the eyeball, which the gaze of that eye is pointed along.\n\n\"Why do we care?\" - Well, as Dan has pointed out on several occasions, your central vision reflexively erases any sights of elements of the second-attention. It is true that you can learn to focus on any point in your visual field without moving your eyes simply by altering where you are placing your attention, but that leaves you avoiding putting attention where your eyes are normally focused in the center of the visual field. Therefore, crossing the eyes is especially useful to us (especially in dark room), because it allows us to overlay the center of our visual field with peripheral vision instead of central vision! This makes it one of many useful gazing exercises for darkroom in my limited experience. All the gazing exercises I've tried are excellent and help me see the purplish/pinkish puffs in the dark room, so I'm sure others will have success as well.\n\nIt seemed silly to me initially and \"why should that be important?\" but crossing the eyes is critical in the very first act of power that Carlos recounts himself performing, that of finding his spot.\n\nFrom \"The Teachings of Don Juan\" - \"I asked him if there was a way in which he could accept just my desire to learn; as if I were an Indian ... Finally, he told me that there was a way ... the proper thing to do was to find a 'spot' (sitio) on the floor where I could sit without fatigue ... He emphasized that he knew where my spot was, and that therefore I could not lie to him. He said this was the only way he could accept my desire to learn about Mescalito as a valid reason ... I told him I had failed ... He laughed and said that it did not surprise him because I had not proceeded correctly. I had not been using my eyes. That was true, yet I was very sure he had said to feel the difference ... I began to roll again because that was the most comfortable procedure. This time, however, I rested my chin on my hands, and looked at every detail. After an interval the darkness around me changed. When I focused on the point directly in front of me, the whole peripheral area of my field of vision became brilliantly coloured with a homogeneous greenish yellow. The effect was startling. ***I kept my eyes fixed on the point in front of me***, and began to crawl sideways on my stomach one foot at a time. Suddenly, at a point near the middle of the floor, I became aware of another change in hue. ***At a place to my right, still in the periphery of my field of vision***, the greenish yellow became intensely purple. I concentrated my attention on it. The purple faded into a pale, but still brilliant, colour which remained steady for the time I kept my attention on it...\"\n\nFrom \"Journey to Ixtlan\" - \"After a long pause don Juan suddenly turned to me and said that in order to find the proper place to rest all I had to do was to ***cross my eyes.*** He gave me a knowing look, and in a confidential tone told me that I had done precisely that when I was rolling on his porch; and thus I had been capable of finding two spots and their colours. He let me know that he was impressed by my accomplishment.\n\n\"I really don't know what I did,\" I said.\n\n***\"You crossed your eyes,\" he said emphatically. \"That's the technique. You must have done that, although you don't remember it.\"***\n\nIn addition, crossing the eyes is included in one version of the instructions don Juan gives Carlos for \"the right way of walking.\"\n\n\"At the beginning of our association don Juan had delineated \\[\\* delineate- describe in vivid detail\\] another procedure: walking for long stretches without focusing the eyes on anything. His recommendation had been to not look at anything directly; but rather, to ***slightly cross the eyes and keep a peripheral view*** of everything that presented itself to the eyes.\n\nHe had insisted, although I had not understood at the time, that if one kept one's unfocused eyes at a point just above the horizon, it was possible to notice, all at once, everything in almost the total 180-degree range in front of one's eyes. He had assured me that that exercise was the only way of shutting off the internal dialogue. He used to ask me for reports on my progress, and then he stopped inquiring about it.\n\nI told don Juan that I had practiced the technique for years without noticing any change; but I had expected none anyway. One day, however, I had the shocking realization that I had just walked for about ten minutes without having said a single word to myself.\n\nI mentioned to don Juan that on that occasion I also became cognizant \\[\\* cognizant- having realization or understanding\\] that stopping the internal dialogue involved more than merely curtailing the words I said to myself. My entire thought processes had stopped, and I had felt I was practically suspended, floating. A sensation of panic had ensued from that awareness and I had to resume my internal dialogue as an antidote. \\[\\* antidote- a remedy that stops or controls the effects of a poison\\]\n\n\"I've told you that the internal dialogue is what grounds us,\" don Juan said. \"The world is such and such, or so and so, only because we talk to ourselves about its being such and such or so and so.'\"\n\nI combine that with the following hand position. From \"Stalking with the Double\" - \"... ***The tips of his middle and ring fingers were curled and pressed against the palms, while the thumbs, index, and pinky fingers were extended in a natural position.***\n\n\u201cKeep your fingers like this and you won\u2019t tire yourself,\u201d he said holding up his hand for me to see. \u201cAnd positioning your gaze just above the horizon helps to quiet your thoughts. If you succeed, you will have more energy while walking.\u201d\"\n\nThere are actually too many instances where Carlos describes crossing his eyes for me to include them all in this post, but rest assured you'll find quite a few references if you search for it.\n\nWhy *gaze* at all? Well, *gazing* is specifically called out as important for *dreaming*. I personally have experienced how *gazing* has enhanced my dark room practice, which is *awake-dreaming*.\n\nFrom \"The Second Ring of Power\" - \"He never told us what he was really doing to us. He just taught us to gaze. We never knew that *gazing* was the way to trap our second attention. We thought *gazing* was just for fun. That was not so. *Dreamers* have to be *gazers* before they can trap their second attention...\" and\n\n\"Dreamers must *gaze* in order to do dreaming and then they must look for their dreams in their *gazing*.\n\n\"For example, the Nagual made me *gaze* at the shadows of rocks, and then in my dreaming, I found out that those shadows had light. So I looked for the light in the shadows from then on until I found it.\n\n\"*Gazing* and *dreaming* go together. It took me a lot of *gazing* at shadows to get my *dreaming* of *shadows* going. And then it took me a lot of *dreaming* and *gazing* to get the two together and really see in the shadows what I was seeing in my *dreaming*. See what I mean? Everyone of us does the same. Rosa's *dreaming* is about trees because she's a tree *gazer*, and Josefina's is about clouds because she's a cloud *gazer*. They *gaze* at trees and clouds until they match their *dreaming* ...\"\"\n\nFrom \"Stalking with the Double\" - \"\u201c***Dreaming*** ***and gazing go hand in hand***,\u201d Zuleica began. \u201cYou already caught on to that when you *gazed* at the ripples in the pond. Now let the sound of the water take you. That\u2019s how you start. You find something in the world that shimmers or has a glow to it and you *gaze* at it. Then you find a sound, like rain, water from a stream, even the noise of the city will do, and you follow the sounds. Then you transfer it into your dreams by *gazing* in your dreams or hearing that sound in your sleep.\u201d\n\nSo this is again a case where the books are not messing around with flights of fancy, but giving concrete steps, methods, techniques and practices for evolving human perception and cognition. I'm only a few months into consistent-ish execution of the practices, so I can only say that I personally have found nothing to contradict what these sorcerers said and you too can test this out on yourself in your darkroom, or out in the daylight like Juann!\n\nIf you're looking to read more on gazing - [https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/misc\\_practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/misc_practices)\n\nIf you'd like to learn Tensegrity related to gazing - [https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/tensegrity/gazing](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/tensegrity/gazing)\n\nOnce you can reliably enter the second attention and really move your AP down the j-curve I understand from Dan's and Juann's posts that things like breathing properly, or doing the right things with the eyes and whatnot becomes automatic, so this is from a beginner to beginners.\n\nIntent!\n\nIntent!\n\nIntent!", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Crossing the Eyes/Un-crossing the Eyes - Gazing", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

He just taught us to gaze. We never knew that &lt;em&gt;gazing&lt;/em&gt; was the way to trap our second attention. We thought &lt;em&gt;gazing&lt;/em&gt; was just for fun. That was not so. &lt;em&gt;Dreamers&lt;/em&gt; have to be &lt;em&gt;gazers&lt;/em&gt; before they can trap their second attention...&amp;quot; and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dreamers must &lt;em&gt;gaze&lt;/em&gt; in order to do dreaming and then they must look for their dreams in their &lt;em&gt;gazing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For example, the Nagual made me &lt;em&gt;gaze&lt;/em&gt; at the shadows of rocks, and then in my dreaming, I found out that those shadows had light. So I looked for the light in the shadows from then on until I found it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Gazing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; go together. It took me a lot of &lt;em&gt;gazing&lt;/em&gt; at shadows to get my &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;shadows&lt;/em&gt; going. And then it took me a lot of &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gazing&lt;/em&gt; to get the two together and really see in the shadows what I was seeing in my &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt;. See what I mean? Everyone of us does the same. Rosa&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; is about trees because she&amp;#39;s a tree &lt;em&gt;gazer&lt;/em&gt;, and Josefina&amp;#39;s is about clouds because she&amp;#39;s a cloud &lt;em&gt;gazer&lt;/em&gt;. They &lt;em&gt;gaze&lt;/em&gt; at trees and clouds until they match their &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; ...&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From &amp;quot;Stalking with the Double&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;\u201c&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreaming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and gazing go hand in hand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,\u201d Zuleica began. \u201cYou already caught on to that when you &lt;em&gt;gazed&lt;/em&gt; at the ripples in the pond. Now let the sound of the water take you. That\u2019s how you start. You find something in the world that shimmers or has a glow to it and you &lt;em&gt;gaze&lt;/em&gt; at it. Then you find a sound, like rain, water from a stream, even the noise of the city will do, and you follow the sounds. Then you transfer it into your dreams by &lt;em&gt;gazing&lt;/em&gt; in your dreams or hearing that sound in your sleep.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this is again a case where the books are not messing around with flights of fancy, but giving concrete steps, methods, techniques and practices for evolving human perception and cognition. I&amp;#39;m only a few months into consistent-ish execution of the practices, so I can only say that I personally have found nothing to contradict what these sorcerers said and you too can test this out on yourself in your darkroom, or out in the daylight like Juann!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to read more on gazing - &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/misc_practices\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/misc_practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to learn Tensegrity related to gazing - &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/tensegrity/gazing\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/tensegrity/gazing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can reliably enter the second attention and really move your AP down the j-curve I understand from Dan&amp;#39;s and Juann&amp;#39;s posts that things like breathing properly, or doing the right things with the eyes and whatnot becomes automatic, so this is from a beginner to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,

This was 2 1/2 years before u/danl999 joined Reddit in January 2019:\n\n\"What \"fiction?\" Everything tried so far, works as described. Not the drug use. That was just to Open the Doors. Avoid the first book entirely.

It has to remain hidden in plain sight, where the outer world ridicules it**....\n\n...There's George Lucas. The Jedi religion is just Castaneda stuff. \"Intent is an energy field which surrounds us, penetrates us. It binds the universe together. It controls our actions, yet it obeys our will....\"\n\n...Also, the Matrix movies are a direct steal, like a training film for Toltec Sorcery. Mental battles between Brujos who've learned to directly manipulate base reality. Becoming a seer who penetrates the false aspect of perceived reality. The real world is made of glowing lines, connections. INORGANIC BEINGS are the real power behind reality! Heh. So, when are the Wachowski bros going to start shifting between alternate identities, or perhaps let slip that they're Practitioners? Bingo.\n\nBut note well that since the stuff is real, it's extremely dangerous. Drugs, they wear off in hours/days.\n\n\"Seeing,\" it cannot be un-seen. In the 60s, those books were famous for ruining lives. People would go part-way, then try to pull back, or try to go forward without first reducing their self-importance by one iota.\n\nAlso, \"During your dreams, try to find your own dick.\" Not in the books. Castaneda altered (it to find your hands instead.\"\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n\"Soon I spent my days race-walking to school while pushing my fingernails into the palms of my hands, while staring straight ahead and trying to see all the objects in my right peripheral vision at the same time as seeing the objects in my left peripheral vision. Only do this stuff when unobserved. A critical requirement is to remain covert, while to outside observers we appear the same as always, never showing off ever (which is very hard to do!) It's not like eastern religions: instead, by using the techniques, we take the stance of a spy in a vast enemy camp. But then, that'd been my normal life back then anyway. So Castaneda books had great appeal!\n\nI never made any breakthroughs as a kid, no weird events, no control of dreams, until 1979 in college, when I was laying in the hammock that we'd set up inside our dorm. I decided to try to not-think, awake, eyes open. Like meditation. Interior silence. It lasted for FIFTEEN MINUTES, and all the concentric shells that were my entire personality, they fell away, one by one. We are nothing; everything we think we are, those are just our removable masks. Take them off and nobody's there. What is this thing which takes off all the masks? We are the subconscious, and our entire personality and life is a toy/delusion/puppet, and is not the hand inside the sock which makes it move around.\n\nThis, and also the idea that we're covert operatives embedded in an enemy country, together these two appear to be the \"warrior stance\" that the books hadn't been able to teach me. DOH, this is the same concept as Bushido! Rejecting all our own petty actions, living a life of utter self-honesty, slowly penetrating and breaking down all the comforting and pathetic delusions that we use in order to choke off our everyday reality. Instead, we must take actions only because these are the proper, non-petty things to do, not because we expect acclaim or rewards. *Never lie to protect yourself, just lie for the sheer hell of it.*\n\nMany years later I heard about a shaman trick: sleeping in a huge leather bag suspended from a tree, in order to attain an altered mental state. EXACTLY, EXACTLY. Before that hammock, I'd never been able to stop my internal self-talk for more than about 15sec at a time. But, in the books, it appears that they didn't require all the years that I needed to make a start. They took a shortcut by getting advice from Mescalito, etc. Aging adults cannot afford to waste time like little kids can. But if we can learn to do by Intent, what drugs do by brain chemistry, well that's their definition of being a 'sorcerer.'

This was the early or mid-1990's.\n\nThey said that they had been practicing together, I believe it was a romantic couple (M/F), and discovered some huge lines (emanations) that they perceived criss-crossed the globe and could be used to physically shift locations without going through the more advanced preliminaries....such as losing the human form and whatnot. Meaning if one paired partner was in Australia and the other was in New York, they could do a switcheroo (somehow).\n\nOr maybe it was simply to move from one location to the other, using their connection to the other person as a magnet of sorts, and the energy of the Earth to do the transporting.

How could such a thing be forgotten to virtually all of mankind?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I can only speak for the men about such a curiosity.  Women are different animals.  I suspect they don\u2019t give a hoot.  But the men care about such things, always wanting to assign credit or blame, and especially, to figure out who\u2019s winning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarlos made his search, and we heard a little of it in class. There were gurus falling down staircases, clandestine visits to me-too nagual\u2019s workshops, and visits to famous female spiritualists who ended up mostly wanting to have sex with Carlos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn classes there were European intellectuals who fancied themselves above such a petty thing as popular shamanism.  I noticed that they were usually quite tall.  Now I realize, that's likely because female members of Carlos' group were the most common way to get into private class, and they might have fancied the taller ones. Otherwise, I don't remember much about them, not even their faces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarlos would indulge them as they compared some obscure intellectual philosophy to his teachings. I always felt a little jealous, because I\u2019d never heard of those philosophers.  I was a college dropout.    Best I can do now is to make one up as an example of what it sounded like.  And I never heard the actual intellectuals in class bring them up directly.  I\u2019d just notice that Carlos seemed to have gotten stuck in the back area while walking past some male students. He often walked around the class while we practiced Tensegrity, correcting body positions and putting his hand on people\u2019s shoulders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case you wondered, we weren\u2019t actually as stupid as I make it sound. We did notice when he put his hand on someone\u2019s shoulder.  That was likely the main reason everyone watched carefully when he remained somewhere longer than usual.  Everyone wanted to \u201cget zapped\u201d, and have Carlos do all the work for them.   Or if they didn't get \"zapped\", they certainly didn't want anyone else to  get it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I should note that when he lingered around the most beautiful women, who hadn\u2019t yet given up their lovely long hair, it seemed quite intimate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot so much with the men. As he lingered around men in the back, it occasionally became obvious they were whispering something to him.  And then he\u2019d say in a loud enough voice, so that you could hear from the front of the class, \u201cOf course, yes!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Carlos would paraphrase their thinking, not specifically arguing for or against it.  Mostly he\u2019d chuckle and smile a bit as he explained.  \u201cFranciscovan Socrates Devartes does indeed claim that the deconstructionist philosophy inevitably leads to\u2026 \u201c, he\u2019d explain.   I couldn\u2019t figure out if he was being malicious, or actually agreeing that this was insightful and useful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThinking about thinking can produce some amazing results. That's how we got computers.  But the opposite is more true on the path of sorcery.  The more you overcome thinking, the less rational the world becomes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Carlos was explaining their favorite philosopher's ideas about thinking, the tall intellectual European men would typically pace around in place almost imperceptibly, like a small child waiting for a cookie fresh from the oven.  When they got the cookie, they\u2019d beam proudly and look around the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOutside of class, there were even Indian reservations that had wind of Carlos, and would gossip relentlessly about his rare appearances.  Those were typically belligerent gossipers, who were unhappy that a short Mexican Anthropologist had stolen their religion and put it up for sale.  And yet they couldn\u2019t help brag that he\u2019d come to visit *them*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI first ran into that type of talk starting from around 10 years old.  I was hanging out with UC System Anthropologists, digging up old Luiseno Indian sites between Banning and Palm Springs.   Sometimes we\u2019d hear that a valuable artifact had fallen into the hands of a private collector, and we\u2019d go visit to see if he could be talked out of it (never), so that the University could put it on display \"where it properly belonged.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of those artifacts ended up at Malki Museum, out at Morongo Indian reservation.   I had the unpleasant experience of having to spend many hours at a time there, with nothing to do but look down into the gigantic hole under the old outhouse, hoping to see the angry possum they\u2019d warned me about.  The old Indian woman who was always present at Malki Museum, and who told stories about the old Indians of the past who lived in that valley, had a half African American husband with a big shotgun.   If I could locate the possum, he might have put it to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut all along the way I\u2019d hear chatter about Castaneda, and whether he was a fake or the real thing.  I\u2019d hear, \u201cThis is what an Indian clay pipe looks like, and it\u2019s nothing like what Castaneda described!\u201d  Or I\u2019d hear, \u201cSure, we have a dreaming sorceress in this very reservation, that\u2019s nothing new.   Over there you can see all the Devil\u2019s weed that\u2019s growing along the road, and our Devil\u2019s weed Sorcerer John lives right alongside it in his trailer.   Sorcerers like don Juan were common in this valley, before outsiders took it over.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack then, I also took it for granted that there were sorcerers like don Juan all over that valley, just as I\u2019d been told. I became interested in Sorcery, thinking it was just another technology, like my chemistry hobby, or maybe more like acupuncture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as the years went on, and I noticed Indians at reservations cashing in on claiming to teach something similar to don Juan, I came to ask myself, \u201cWhich came first, Carlos or the Native Indian Sorcerers?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(continued later when the actual point finally comes to me)\n\nEdited: Three times, including to add my opinion on what a computer really is.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Pain Holes", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_b9xgsd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1554507903.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1554502686.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which came first, the chicken or the egg?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s a question you\u2019re sure to be asking yourself, if you go looking for sorcery teachers similar to Carlos.

I saw other things that might have been somewhat like what Carlos was doing, including some Korean Hwa Rang Do techniques for shape shifting and rapid overland travel, but typically all I could observe about them were the claims they made, with no actual practitioners available. I\u2019d hear, \u201cSomeday I\u2019ll get around to making those work\u201d.   But not today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarlos took a liking to Howard Lee.  And between the two of them, from what I\u2019ve heard, there isn\u2019t enough information to answer the chicken or egg question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarlos likely met Howard as a result of the martial arts interest of two of the witches.  There\u2019s the famous image of them practicing at a 1973ish Shotokan Karate tournament.  I say, \u201cish\u201d, because I was actually at that tournament watching them.  So I\u2019m remembering by images in my mind, rather than a written account with an accurate date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat tournament was in Riverside County.  Los Angeles county is north of there,  and San Bernardino county is to the east.  Between those 3, there was a wonderful assortment of martial arts, part of the post WWII diaspora.  I took advantage of it by going from studio to studio, studying with martial artists who are now very famous.  And I suspect the witches did a little of that also. Perhaps with Carlos tagging along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey probably found Howard by joining Marshall Ho\u2019o\u2019s Tai Chi association.  Several famous martial artists from Hong Kong and Taiwan, where martial artists fled after the Chinese communists took over,  were members of that group.  It\u2019s still active to this day.  No doubt a tiny bit of Carlos\u2019 influence lingers there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarlos had a reputation in that group.  And it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Howard had read his books. But whatever the synergy, Carlos wrote Howard a \u201cblank check\u201d.  He put his initials, HYL, in the dedication to \u201cThe Fire From Within\u201d.   Within that dedication, he endorsed his techniques in glowing terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as I know, the identity of Howard remained mostly a secret for years, with only those close to the inner group knowing who it was.   People close to Carlos studied Kung Fu with him, but the public at large had no access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat all changed when private classes got larger. At one point the topic came up \u201cpublicly\u201d in a lecture by Carlos.   Howard was mentioned in much the same way other specific personalities often came up.  A few of the students in class brought him up, and Carlos seemed to take that as an omen that it was finally time to officially talk about Howard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarlos had a long term strategy,  possibly based on the knowledge that he was dying.  But it seems to have failed. He was trying to enlist the help of a male leader.  He tried with Tony Lama, but Tony was hooked on Tibetan Buddhism.  He also tried with Howard.  He named him \u201cThe death Defier\u201d, and once gave a lecture on how he\u2019d tried to get Howard to join the group.  But either through Carlos, or through his students, it became obvious that Howard didn\u2019t want to be part of his group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoward became more and more popular, once Carlos officially \u201couted\u201d him.   He offered a variety of paid services. Kung Fu classes  and energy techniques stood out the most. But  Howard was also trained in acupuncture.  He would sell acupuncture treatments, but typically would talk the patient out of that method, and use his energy techniques instead.  I wished I\u2019d payed more attention to those.  As I recall, he pointed his fingers at places on the body, and exuded energy into them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI once proposed to Howard that maybe ancient Chinese seers had discovered the acupuncture points, and could actually *see* them visually. Howard perked up and said, \u201cExactly!\u201d   I\u2019d tried that explanation on another acupuncture practitioner years earlier, and gotten a weird look.  \u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d, was the meaning of that look.   But not from Howard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou could pay him for a half hour of energy treatment, which included some insightful analysis of the patients current life situation.   He also sold phone consultations, which were famous because Howard was said to be able to transfer his energy across the phone, to the patient.  I witnessed one such call to a friend of mine, and it seemed to be true.  As soon has he spoke to Howard he said, \u201cI really can feel it!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always instantly felt Howard\u2019s \u201cenergy\u201d whenever I got around him.   He seemed to be able to move the assemblage point of people, to focus it on a great band of emanations which gave a feeling of health and happiness.  He was also able to show that band to people who could be relatively silent.  You could *see* his source. It was a blueish band of emanations, similar to the ones I\u2019d seen doing tensegrity, except for the tint.  I described that to Howard, and he explained that his form of *seeing* was not visual, so he could not verify what I had *seen*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe taught a technique for channeling it on your own, in his absence.  It consisted of standing with the legs apart and fixed in place,  arms stretched out and held down at 45 degrees, while you bent backwards to put the spine in a normally unused position, looking up towards the sky. Howard would move your assemblage point and create a stable focus for you, so that you could return to that feeling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoward once described a thing I now call, \u201cpain holes\u201d.  I don\u2019t know if he gave an official name to it, but it sounded very much like a description of how the luminous cocoon works, regarding the depressions that the assemblage point can fall into. Sorcerers can dent that depression to induce heightened awareness.  But the name \u201cpain depressions\u201d is sort of ambiguous and inappropriate, since depression can cause chronic pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoward explained that people fall into a depression that\u2019s not exactly comfortable, but to leave it requires moving up a little, to get out of the depression.  Moving up hurts more than remaining in the depression.  So they remain there, even when those around them can see that it\u2019s not a very happy place.  If they\u2019d only move up a little more they\u2019d roll off the side to a much better position.  But they don\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe the act of trying to do that would constitute \u201cstalking\u201d the assemblage point.  You can sort of do the same thing with silence.  At first, forcing the internal dialogue off is horrible.  But it gets easier with time, until there comes a day when you notice that inner silence is actually peaceful.  Very peaceful in fact, maybe even what Asian systems call \u201cenlightenment\u201d.   And if you can get to the point where you notice that, perhaps you can permanently slip into that new position of inner silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowards version of sorcery, if that\u2019s what it is, was very Asian.  Asians like the idea that there\u2019s one right way to do things, and their esoteric techniques tend to have one ultimate achievement.  Howard\u2019s was to move people to view his \u201cLight of Life\u201d energy, which he said would help them remain healthy and live for a very long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe once told me, \u201cWhen I live to be 150 years old, then people will listen to me.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut no man is a prophet in his own family, and talking to family friends of Howard might give the impression his techniques weren\u2019t as amazing as they seemed to outsiders.  \u201cYes, Howard\u2019s energy is incredible\u201d they\u2019d say, but more like you might say about anyone who stood out a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoward began to give workshops to teach his Light of Life technique.   At one point he became so popular that you couldn\u2019t just have a chat with him anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Carlos\u2019 classes, there were 2 schools of thought on Howard. There were those who complained that  Carlos had stolen Howard\u2019s Kungfu, and called it Tensegrity.  But there was another school of thought which said, Howard didn\u2019t join Carlos because he wanted to cash in on workshops, copying what Carlos had done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMyself, I\u2019m just waiting to see if Howard lives to 150,  lending credence to Carlos having nicknamed him, \u201cthe Death Defier\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: once for mistakes\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "edited": 1554663165.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ekbx5cz", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closest thing to what Carlos was teaching,  among the things I was able to observe first hand, was Howard Lee.

But they don\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the act of trying to do that would constitute \u201cstalking\u201d the assemblage point.  You can sort of do the same thing with silence.  At first, forcing the internal dialogue off is horrible.  But it gets easier with time, until there comes a day when you notice that inner silence is actually peaceful.  Very peaceful in fact, maybe even what Asian systems call \u201cenlightenment\u201d.   And if you can get to the point where you notice that, perhaps you can permanently slip into that new position of inner silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howards version of sorcery, if that\u2019s what it is, was very Asian.  Asians like the idea that there\u2019s one right way to do things, and their esoteric techniques tend to have one ultimate achievement.  Howard\u2019s was to move people to view his \u201cLight of Life\u201d energy, which he said would help them remain healthy and live for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He once told me, \u201cWhen I live to be 150 years old, then people will listen to me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no man is a prophet in his own family, and talking to family friends of Howard might give the impression his techniques weren\u2019t as amazing as they seemed to outsiders.  \u201cYes, Howard\u2019s energy is incredible\u201d they\u2019d say, but more like you might say about anyone who stood out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howard began to give workshops to teach his Light of Life technique.   At one point he became so popular that you couldn\u2019t just have a chat with him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Carlos\u2019 classes, there were 2 schools of thought on Howard. There were those who complained that  Carlos had stolen Howard\u2019s Kungfu, and called it Tensegrity.  But there was another school of thought which said, Howard didn\u2019t join Carlos because he wanted to cash in on workshops, copying what Carlos had done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I\u2019m just waiting to see if Howard lives to 150,  lending credence to Carlos having nicknamed him, \u201cthe Death Defier\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: once for mistakes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/b9xgsd/pain_holes/ekbx5cz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1554662561.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_b9xgsd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ek9mw0w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ek87fmk", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I don't have a problem with criticism, except that I might be too dense to pick up on it.\n\nCriticism means more discussion is possible.

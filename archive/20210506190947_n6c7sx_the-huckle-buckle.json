Some sort of Harry Potter type tale for kids, but with correct information on magic.\n\nHow about Fairies like a certain kind of old Celtic dancing, and if you do it in the dark you can summon them. At which point they begin to teach you the \"magical steps\".\n\nKids are far more talented. Some would make it work, and that would become well known.\n\nYou couldn't turn it into a competition, because that would doom it.  Too much book deal mind.  Although with Kids, it's possible the book deal mind is not as fatal.\n\nIn some ways, they live off the book deal mind, trying to get attention from adults so they can learn what they need to learn to survive on their own.\n\nThey'd have to be trying to get something from the second attention, and believe it's available with hard work.  So colors, but hopefully they'd get an IOB too.\n\nBest to classify the puffs as Fairies, and shy fairies. Shy fairies are only bright colored puffs, and you have to \"tame\" them. \n\nI do seem to have found a substitute for IOBs though.  That would help.\n\nI'll try to draw it up tomorrow.  Basically you break off a piece of the second attention and make it stable in your hand.  You use that to \"illuminate\" things.\n\nSame sort of stuff IOBs do for you.  So for instance, I suppose you could find a good looking puff of purple and make it last a very long time so you could use it.\n\nMine are \"framed\", and come in 9 or 10 types now.  I didn't add the frame, but play with stable patches of color \"implied\" it, and so now they have it.\n\nI spent 2 hours in the red zone, trying to map it out that way.\n\nMy bluish patch formed a handle..  Yea weird, but when you're over in the red zone, weird isn't noticeable.\n\nSo by the time I was ready to go to bed, I went outside to check the car.  Don't ask me why, I can't recall now.\n\nThere were two cars.  Same exact cars, next to each other, separated by 6 feet.\n\nHolding up the blue light in my left hand, I could lift either car with my right palm.  Just slide it under, and lift.\n\nPerspective is not quite right when the assemblage point is that far down the back.\n\nIt's quite interesting in the red zone!  Doesn't quite produce the bliss feeling of the orange zone, but it's very pleasant anyway, in a morbid sort of way.\n\nI've concluded we can't find the places to change into animals, without someone to \"introduce\" us to the spot.\n\nThere's just too many, and no way to know which can be made to be a full perception.\n\nSo if someone asks \"Can you turn into an animal?\", in response to looking at the J curve (and having  a raging book deal mind with a bad attitude), the answer is, \"Sure.  If I had a sorcerer to show me the precise position of the assemblage point on the red line, and what procedures to use to make the perception whole.\"\n\nThe possibilities on the red line are like holes dug randomly along a 100 mile dirt road, each with a treasure chest inside.  But buried over for 20 years,  so the dirt is  hard. You can't tell if you are standing over one, and there's not enough with treasure to be worth digging randomly.\n\nYou need someone to show you the \"spot\", and then you also need their procedures to tune it in.\n\nIt might also be that you need the other person around to make it function well.

Some sort of Harry Potter type tale for kids, but with correct information on magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about Fairies like a certain kind of old Celtic dancing, and if you do it in the dark you can summon them. At which point they begin to teach you the &amp;quot;magical steps&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kids are far more talented. Some would make it work, and that would become well known.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#39;t turn it into a competition, because that would doom it.  Too much book deal mind.  Although with Kids, it&amp;#39;s possible the book deal mind is not as fatal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some ways, they live off the book deal mind, trying to get attention from adults so they can learn what they need to learn to survive on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d have to be trying to get something from the second attention, and believe it&amp;#39;s available with hard work.  So colors, but hopefully they&amp;#39;d get an IOB too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best to classify the puffs as Fairies, and shy fairies. Shy fairies are only bright colored puffs, and you have to &amp;quot;tame&amp;quot; them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do seem to have found a substitute for IOBs though.  That would help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to draw it up tomorrow.  Basically you break off a piece of the second attention and make it stable in your hand.  You use that to &amp;quot;illuminate&amp;quot; things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same sort of stuff IOBs do for you.  So for instance, I suppose you could find a good looking puff of purple and make it last a very long time so you could use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mine are &amp;quot;framed&amp;quot;, and come in 9 or 10 types now.  I didn&amp;#39;t add the frame, but play with stable patches of color &amp;quot;implied&amp;quot; it, and so now they have it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent 2 hours in the red zone, trying to map it out that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My bluish patch formed a handle..  Yea weird, but when you&amp;#39;re over in the red zone, weird isn&amp;#39;t noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So by the time I was ready to go to bed, I went outside to check the car.  Don&amp;#39;t ask me why, I can&amp;#39;t recall now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were two cars.  Same exact cars, next to each other, separated by 6 feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holding up the blue light in my left hand, I could lift either car with my right palm.  Just slide it under, and lift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perspective is not quite right when the assemblage point is that far down the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s quite interesting in the red zone!  Doesn&amp;#39;t quite produce the bliss feeling of the orange zone, but it&amp;#39;s very pleasant anyway, in a morbid sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve concluded we can&amp;#39;t find the places to change into animals, without someone to &amp;quot;introduce&amp;quot; us to the spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s just too many, and no way to know which can be made to be a full perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if someone asks &amp;quot;Can you turn into an animal?&amp;quot;, in response to looking at the J curve (and having  a raging book deal mind with a bad attitude), the answer is, &amp;quot;Sure.  If I had a sorcerer to show me the precise position of the assemblage point on the red line, and what procedures to use to make the perception whole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The possibilities on the red line are like holes dug randomly along a 100 mile dirt road, each with a treasure chest inside.

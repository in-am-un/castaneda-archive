To believe you are \"seeking your greatness\".\n\nThat's EVERYWHERE ELSE on the internet.\n\nBut not here.  We're learning to get silent enough to move our assemblage points to the other side of the body, something drugs can never do.

And it can put you into a good mood, making it easier to get up and start working. But it also makes you tired, so the good mood is nearly negated.\n\nAt the blue line, being pushed to the green seems like a benefit. But at the red line it's bad.  Dims the intense magic of the red zone.\n\nIn the long run, any way you do darkroom that isn't based on silence and tensegrity will fail.  And while it's failing you'll give up because it won't seem worth it.  Due to not being \"amazing\" enough.\n\nInstead of Dr. Strange, you'll be like a junior high school student who got hold of \"Witchcraft Today\" or some \"Crowley Crap\" and managed to trance or ritual himself into having some odd sensations.  \n\nYou won't go on, if you don't see light shows as amazing as those of Dr. Strange.\n\nSo that the THC is really just good to give people a \"taste\" to make up for lack of real motivations.\n\nRemember the orphan kids at the outdoor restaurant in Mexico, licking the plates as customers left.  From the books of Carlos, perhaps Tales with Power.\n\nCarlos said he felt sorry for them, but don Juan pointed out that all the men he knew who had succeeded in learning sorcery came from that type of child.  The wealthy businessmen eating at the tables had no chance.\n\nThat's about  motivations.\n\nYou have 2 paths if the motivations become right.\n\nYou had a horrible past and aren't in love with the \"river of shit\" in which all of society resides.  That's a \"cozy\" place, but it's very ugly when you look honestly and realize there's an alternative on the dry shore next to it.\n\nOr, the other path than can work, but which is very unfortunately, is that you started out with a slight interest in meditation and magic, wasted an entire life, got old, and realized you'd better get real about it.  On that path, you have to work twice as  hard because your time is almost up.\n\nI honestly don't see anyone else outside these 2 \"types\" being willing to put in the work needed.", "edited": 1658410414.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ih1pxc4", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re really confused and need to study in here more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t understand the basics yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t work.

Dims the intense magic of the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the long run, any way you do darkroom that isn&amp;#39;t based on silence and tensegrity will fail.  And while it&amp;#39;s failing you&amp;#39;ll give up because it won&amp;#39;t seem worth it.  Due to not being &amp;quot;amazing&amp;quot; enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of Dr. Strange, you&amp;#39;ll be like a junior high school student who got hold of &amp;quot;Witchcraft Today&amp;quot; or some &amp;quot;Crowley Crap&amp;quot; and managed to trance or ritual himself into having some odd sensations.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t go on, if you don&amp;#39;t see light shows as amazing as those of Dr. Strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that the THC is really just good to give people a &amp;quot;taste&amp;quot; to make up for lack of real motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember the orphan kids at the outdoor restaurant in Mexico, licking the plates as customers left.  From the books of Carlos, perhaps Tales with Power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos said he felt sorry for them, but don Juan pointed out that all the men he knew who had succeeded in learning sorcery came from that type of child.  The wealthy businessmen eating at the tables had no chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s about  motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have 2 paths if the motivations become right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You had a horrible past and aren&amp;#39;t in love with the &amp;quot;river of shit&amp;quot; in which all of society resides.  That&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; place, but it&amp;#39;s very ugly when you look honestly and realize there&amp;#39;s an alternative on the dry shore next to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, the other path than can work, but which is very unfortunately, is that you started out with a slight interest in meditation and magic, wasted an entire life, got old, and realized you&amp;#39;d better get real about it.  On that path, you have to work twice as  hard because your time is almost up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t see anyone else outside these 2 &amp;quot;types&amp;quot; being willing to put in the work needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/w4byt2/deleted_by_user/ih1pxc4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658409897.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_w4byt2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_w4byt2", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ih1w6h4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_w4byt2", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "The idea here is to redeploy your energy wasted on concern into inner-silence and moving the assemblage point (AP), not make more reasons to worry.\n\nFear of IOBs is common, but not terribly significant.

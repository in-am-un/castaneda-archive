But then you get tired trying to move down to the red, so you have to stop.\n\nIf you wanted to report what happened to others, it wouldn't be difficult.\n\nWhy?  Because if you could do a huge amount, you'd end up at the red line almost immediately.\n\nSo \"sharing\" green zone experiences is easy.\n\nAt the red zone, you can get sucked into horizontal shifts and stuck there.  You'll end up doing 1 cool thing that night.  But it'll really encompass you!\n\nEventually you can barely make it to the orange zone.  Your breath changes dramatically, and you know you're there.  But in the time it took, you used up your dreaming energy.  So you can't explore much.\n\nWhat does that feel like, to use up your dreaming energy?\n\n1 You had the concentration to focus on silencing the mind, but now it's really hard, and you keep returning to fantasies of \"ME\".\n\n2 If you \"assemble\" something real, it's 90% transparent.  And keeps trying to fade away.\n\n3  Your hands can't move anything around.  Can't push purple clouds into a ball, and compress them with your hands.\n\n4 You have a mild headache, like a sinus pressure type.  It makes you want to lie down.\n\nSo how do you get the dreaming energy to do sustained orange zone experimenting?\n\nThe kind where you discover there's \"black puffery\" too?\n\nOr that the whitish light can expose intense patches of color?\n\nOr that there is \"watery whitish light\"?\n\nGo ahead and lie down.  If you lay on your side and can still see the amazing orange zone effects, you'll pass into dreaming, find a being there, hang out a while, and come back recharged.\n\nYou start a \"second round\", already in the orange zone.  No dreaming energy loss getting there.\n\nI did that last night again, and had to fight the \"silent knowledge\" trap.\n\nThat's where anything you ever wanted to know about sorcery, suddenly become obvious.\n\nYou get an absolute revelation!  It's like some guy walking up to you and handing you a pile of money.\n\n$10,000?????!!!!!\n\nYou rush to the bank to deposit it before someone takes it from you.\n\nMaybe you can help your own Cholita repair that dent in her car.\n\nBut, you didn't do what you were doing there.  What you had gone to that place to do.  The guy with the cash stopped you.\n\nNext day, same thing.  But you really needed to get that errand done!  And again, instead you rushed to the bank.\n\nFor me, the bank was typing it into some device, so I could remember it the next day, and share it here.\n\nTo make the story shorter, a week later the guy is handing you 5 stacks of cash a night, and you've learned to just stuff it in a bag, and keep going.  You really have stuff to do.  You can't put it off every single day!\n\nAnd once you do that, a very odd thing happens.\n\nThe \"silent knowledge\" gets a little hurt, and reminds you of things it showed you before.  Amazing things.\n\nSo you know in no uncertain terms, that stuff is very much worth preserving.\n\nExcept, by showing you again, you now realize, you can't lose anything.\n\nIt's like a Taiwanese family dinner.\n\nThey have restaurants with HUGE turntables in the middle of your table.  The dishes are put in the middle, at arms reach from the person sitting closest.\n\nIf you aren't fast when it rotates by you, someone else will make it turn to get what they want, and you'll lose out on that tasty \"stinky tofu\".\n\nDon't worry, it'll roll around again.  And meanwhile, you'll be able to breathe.\n\nIt's the same in the dark room.\n\nI didn't realize there were black puffs in the whitish light.\n\nExcept, last night I recalled I had in fact known that.  I just forgot.\n\nSame for the \"watery whitish light\", and the intense color patches that show up in the whitish light, to get you to focus on something in that direction.\n\nIf you want the best results from darkroom, try to emphasize making it all the way to that whitish light.\n\nDon't fool yourself, open your eyes at night, and try to believe you are seeing the whitish light.\n\nDon't cheat yourself by pretending!\n\nThe whitish light is spectacular. You have reached Zen level enlightenment, and it manifests objects with the slightest effort.\n\nEvery breath is pure bliss over there, like the \"happy ending\" of a good yawn.\n\nYou know anything you want to know, automatically.\n\nThere are of course \"shortcuts\" to the whitish light.\n\nBut it'll be crappy whitish light.\n\nMore like a drug induced version that's too dim and vague to be of any use.\n\nCarlos set us a path to follow.\n\nBe careful if you are a new person, that you don't ignore the instructions and think your \"amazing Buddhist and Daoist abilities\" allow you to be above it all, and \"cheat\".\n\nMaybe you can \"make your own system\", using Chinese philosophy to save yourself some time.\n\nYou can't.\n\nNo one could do that, because the Olmecs have  thousands of years in this.   You'll be lucky to put 20 years into your \"new system\".  And for what?   A book deal?\n\nFollow the steps precisely, so that you get noticed by the intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, who will pull you along the right path.\n\nOne day maybe I'll draw it up.    It's like running a race, where you have to press your fingerprint on a scanner at specific points in the track, or you lose.\n\nYou need to seek key things, and keep doing what you were doing, until you get those.  Only then should you move on.\n\nCarlos made us very aware of them in private classes.\n\nDo Tensegrity in the dark, while forcing your internal dialogue off.     I like mashing energy and the others in that simple foot movement series.  I do them, until I at least see a flicker of yellowish light down there.\n\nThen I do Zuleica's pass,  a favorite of Carlos, and one he said was all you need,  until the results are at least a tiny bit visible.\n\nIf not, it's my silence level. It's not good enough.\n\nSo I sit on the bed, and wiggle my fingers on the second attention spot Zuleica recommended for darkroom practice.  While forcing silence that way.\n\nI keep that up, until I see colors or sparks being generated by the wiggling fingers.  And if you feel some cobwebs, or a physical sensation, that's excellent.\n\nTHEN, scoop puffs onto the \"pouches\".  You MUST do that until you can visually see them remain there.  Eventually, you'll see your whole energy body, in great detail.  But that will take many sessions.\n\nWhen it happens, it still won't be exciting to see. The mind blocks the urge to see that.\n\nTHEN, check out how bright the puffs are.\n\nNot \"brilliant\"?\n\nYou are green zone.\n\nKeep doing scooping, building the energy body, but ESPECIALLY, learn to force even deeper silence.\n\nIf at anytime you forget that the main thing is silence, and you get all \"book dealy\" and think the puffs or spots of light in the air are the goal, you are screwed.\n\nWe aren't trying to impress our mom!\n\nWe're trying to reach ABSOLUTE SILENCE.\n\nIf you do a good job, the puffs of color will become INTENSE!   Amazing.\n\nBlackness will swirl between them, making the entire scene qualify for being called, \"Hell\", or \"The realm of dragons and Fairies\".\n\nScoop all of that magic onto yourself, and continue trying to silence the mind, until you don't even recognize the puffs.  You almost fall into a trance, of not paying attention.  Your concentration is 100% on finding all traces of internal dialogue, and squashing them.\n\nOr you pay even more attention!  That part is personal.  But you have to \"refuse\" the intense magic of the red zone, after you actually have it.\n\nThe colors will go pinkish, start to fade, and you'll soon seen the whitish light of the orange zone.\n\nTHAT'S how you get to the orange zone.\n\nCholita disagrees on that one.\n\nShe just walks over there.\n\nThe whitish light is \"seeing energy\".  If you explore that continuously, silent knowledge begins to happen.\n\nYou'll be confused and think it's your amazing insight. Or that your inorganic being is teaching you the secrets of sorcery.\n\nBut it's just silent knowledge.\n\nIt's like an all you can eat buffet.  Very exciting the first time you visit.\n\nBut after 100 visits to the all you can eat buffet of knowledge, it loses a bit of its luster.\n\nWhich is good. It turns out, being dazzled by it you missed the best parts!\n\nOnce you get to the orange zone the \"right way\", there will be so much magic that night, sharing it is impossible.\n\nYou've been put out of the \"book deal business\".\n\nNow you have a real chance to go further.\n\n(But still post some).\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Date with a Demon", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"yjbl7u1aj1t71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yjbl7u1aj1t71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21671e945e31955848a9a3f873331ca7e63ef73f"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yjbl7u1aj1t71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4dc6472d5741e75985259d0265e256dad7a03e3"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yjbl7u1aj1t71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53582ec9d0862b77114f0cedfc82e1fc5f253018"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yjbl7u1aj1t71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b7d57136d55af030289dcc68f23892de128560f"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yjbl7u1aj1t71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11fe1eebfefc0e3ec64567db960f2fbb31d138d9"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yjbl7u1aj1t71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d8c47ff65d011066911a2d66294879634ef0106"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yjbl7u1aj1t71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a2211f2cec71a9df496591b8c0cf7142b0d58b2"}, "id": "yjbl7u1aj1t71"}}, "name": "t3_q61ie7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/f533UWmeGod0qmWxeIVa7Vr7eKh6cE8HXbCiju2X2mI.jpg", "edited": 1634053816.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1633974772.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yjbl7u1aj1t71.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1a2211f2cec71a9df496591b8c0cf7142b0d58b2\"&gt;If you invite your IOB to go on a date, expect her to try to repeat it!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;#39;re up at the green line, seeing some cool things.

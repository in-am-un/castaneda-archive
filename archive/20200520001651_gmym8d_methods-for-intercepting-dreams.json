At least, according to a \"desirable movement\" Carlos showed us.\n\nUnfortunately, there won\u2019t be any don Juan around to explain the things that can happen at that position of the assemblage point.\n\nYou\u2019ll just have to learn what they are, by yourself.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you a secret\u2026\n\nYou won\u2019t fucking mind at all!!!!!\n\nI mean, when you hit the jackpot and the coins are pouring out of the slot machine, you don\u2019t separate them into piles by coin dates.\n\nYou just scoop them up with your hands!\n\nAnd that\u2019s what you can do with all of these things you can find in darkness.\n\nThe relative brightness is the closest I can come to what I usually see, however you should know that the brightness of any of them can increase to the point that it rivals the sun.\n\nOr it can decrease until you are in doubt.\n\nDon\u2019t.\n\nJust play with it. You aren\u2019t trying to \u201cdo something\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019re just there to play with whatever presents itself.\n\nEliminate all the \u201cbook deal\u201d concerns from your mind.\n\nIn case you haven't gotten it yet,  \"book deal\" = Concept of self as separate from everyone else, and in need of attention or money from other people.\n\nEgo.\n\nGreed.\n\nIt'll only hold you back!\n\nYour only job is to interact with whatever you find in the dark, any way you can.\n\nExcept Cholita.\n\nDon\u2019t play with Cholita.\n\nDon\u2019t scoop her into your hand.\n\nJust let her be or she\u2019ll know about it.\n\nIt takes only approaching to within 1 foot for her to notice.\n\nAt best, she\u2019ll give you an angry look like you just put your hand on her body without permission,  and run away.\n\nAt worst, she\u2019ll do something scary. \n\nThat dreaming body of hers can hit you.\n\nNot hard, but it'll be enough to scare the hell out of you.  It's just a little \"too real\", when the dreams can touch your waking body.\n\nApparently, Cholita doesn\u2019t approve of Fairy and has a Ba Gua protection spell pushed against the main wall of my bedroom, in the front yard.  A spell designed to ward off evil spirits.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have realized that, except that the Taiwanese Bosses\u2019 son helped me install a new car battery at home.\n\nCholita had disabled my car for too long, and the battery didn\u2019t survive.\n\nI joked about a pile of dog poop on the grass near my front door, suggesting it might be another of Cholita's spells.\n\nHe said, \"Of course it could be!\"\n\nThen he noticed the Ba Gua mirror, and started searching the yard for other \u201cthings\u201d.\n\nHe had a list, saying, \u201cThis type of war goes on in Taiwan all over the place!\u201d\n\nIf they don\u2019t really believe in witchcraft here, they certainly do in Asia!\n\nI of course, don\u2019t actually mind witchcraft.\n\nThe more the better!\n\nHopefully Cholita will bring another demon home.\n\nMinx is cool!\n\nHaven\u2019t seen him in a while, but I\u2019m hopeful he\u2019ll return.\n\nFairy always does.\n\nStarting in the upper left, that\u2019s a random dream intercepted by gazing. To the right are some \u201cdetails\u201d floating in the purple dreaming fog.\n\nYes, you need the fog first. If you\u2019re only at the \u201cscooping\u201d stage with colors in darkness, you have to keep that up until the entire room fills with purple light.\n\nEither Carol or Taisha called it \"Second Attention Fog\".\n\nIt can be dim like that, or chunky.\n\nChunky is better.\n\nWhy is chunky better?\n\nBecause you can find those weird \u201cdetails\u201d, and gaze at them to see if they bloom into a dream.\n\nThey don\u2019t really look like those \u201corbs\u201d, so just accept any \u201cdetail\u201d you can find.\n\nIf you think about it, there shouldn\u2019t be colored light fog in your bedroom, and if there is, there shouldn\u2019t be any details on it.\n\nSo ANY details are good details!\n\nI figure, it\u2019s people who live nearby. I haven\u2019t seen anything that wouldn\u2019t match that description.\n\nBut it\u2019s not as if you can ask them.\n\nI once scooped Fairy up into my hand, and tried to drop her into someone\u2019s dream. I thought maybe I\u2019d hear about it the next day, or something.\n\nMaybe someone would scream nearby, in one of the houses?\n\nActually, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking...\n\nIt's not very nice to drop demons into people's dreams.\n\nBut I just wanted to see if I could alter the dream, without joining in on it.\n\nFairy was only 3 inches tall when I tried that. I compressed her into a ball, the way Carlos had shown us in private classes, walked over to an intercepted dream, and gently put her on the ground.\n\nJust inside the dream.\n\nI guess in that old woman dream in this picture, it would be like setting a ball on the bed near her book, on her lap.\n\nFairy behaved like a real object and left my hand, resting where I\u2019d put her in the dream scene.\n\nThen she morphed and tried to stand up, as a full sized person.\n\nIt was kind of freaky...  It imitated a Japanese horror movie, where they like to make the nightmare characters jerk far too much.\n\nBut she was made entirely of blackness, and got absorbed by the dream.\n\nThe person in the dream didn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\nHow do I know they\u2019re actually someone\u2019s dreams?\n\nFirst, they animate at full speed. Meaning, it\u2019s like watching a movie.\n\nFairy does not. She only changes 1 or 2 times per second.\n\nSo they are \u201cdreams\u201d.  Not Inorganic Beings.\n\nBut someone who lives nearby?\n\nI have no idea. I only know that in Eagle\u2019s Gift, that\u2019s how it was done.\n\nYou just wait in dreaming for the person you want to show up.\n\nAnd grab them.\n\nIf random people are showing up, I have to assume it's people near by.\n\nBesides, I only get Cholita showing up when she's actually in the house.\n\nWhen she runs away, which occurs often, with me not even realizing it, there's no Cholita.\n\nSo proximity seems valid.\n\nPlus, Carlos gave us a lecture on that in private classes.\n\nI've gone over that before. With dreaming doubles, proximity makes them easier to find.\n\nIn Cholita\u2019s case, it\u2019s pretty easy to verify it\u2019s her.\n\nIf there\u2019s some \u201cevidence\u201d that is, which there is, 1 out of 5 times.\n\nAnd it\u2019s always Cholita!\n\nFor example, she\u2019s depicting a dream scene that I see the next day, in a picture on her cellphone.\n\nAn obsession of the day, which she dreamt about the night before.  A specific obsession I had no way of knowing about.\n\nYou\u2019d think I could just ask her.\n\nBut if you think that, you need to go to the wiki and read more about Cholita.\n\nCholita is a \"worthy opponent\", like La Catalina.\n\nCarlos sort of arranged it.\n\nMeaning, I had no choice.\n\nAside from constant risk of attack and death, you can\u2019t ask Cholita anything.\n\nUnless she wants you to.\n\nAnd she doesn\u2019t.\n\nFairy was misbehaving that night.\n\nBut usually if she makes an unpleasant face, it turns out she\u2019s trying to communicate a warning.\n\nAt least twice she\u2019s warned me that Carlos\u2019 allies are about to come.\n\nShe always likes to watch what I\u2019m doing in my hand, if it involves the second attention. If she\u2019s absent, and I scoop up a dream, she\u2019s sure to show up soon.\n\nIt could be she's there to help. But at the least, she keeps my assemblage point very stable when she's around.\n\nIn the hand on the left, you see a dream I materialized.\n\nI didn\u2019t scoop it.\n\nI got the idea because Carlos said you could form \u201cThe Wall\u201d on any surface, including your hand.\n\n\"The Wall\" is nothing more than a waking dream.\n\nA flat surface created by the Second Attention.\n\nI just gazed at my hand with the idea that it\u2019s possible, and a dreaming scene formed.\n\nI was a little surprised by the intense black background.\n\nBut you take what you get.\n\nI also tried scooping a dream out of the air.\n\nFirst, I found some details in the dreaming fog to my right, gazed until the details were obviously part of a larger scene, and I was able to discern more of it.\n\nIt materialized at a convenient spot to my right, and I just put my hand under it (didn\u2019t feel anything), and moved my head with my hand, until it looked like it was inside my hand, near my lap.\n\nDreams materialized in this way only take up a portion of the room, in the dreaming fog.\n\nI guess it\u2019s because you\u2019re using your \u201cdirectional\u201d gaze to find them.\n\nAnd they shrink when you put them into your hand.\n\nYou can of course get sucked in until the dream takes over the entire room.\n\nAnd that comes with a blank out, and forgetting your purpose.\n\nSo don't do that!\n\nKeep it all at a safe distance.\n\nI expected the scooped dream to lay flat in my hand, and at first it did.\n\nI gazed into it, as if it were a window.\n\nBut then I noticed the depth of the window allowed me to look through it at \u201can angle\u201d.\n\nOnce I had sliced it with my gaze, it puffed up to show the 3D details.\n\nI can\u2019t say it formed a perfect sphere like that, but it was darned close.\n\nIt started to float away, but by worrying that it would get away, I was able to make it stop.\n\nAnd, I once had both.\n\nThe materialized flat dream in black goo, as you see in that picture,  and the amazing spherical dreaming bubble, which you also see.\n\nAt the same time!\n\nThat's important, for reasons you'll discover on your own, while trying to scoop colors.\n\nHint: Directionality is a battle we all must go through.  We must make the \"wall of fog\" stop rotating.\n\nBut really, we have to make the second attention more real, so it responds to which direction we are looking.\n\nOtherwise it's hard to interact with it.\n\nBut HOW ON EARTH DO YOU LEARN TO DO THIS!!!\n\nI often get that question.\n\nIf you have to ask, you need to read from the wiki more.\n\nThere are no procedures in sorcery.\n\nYou either can do something, or you can\u2019t.\n\nYou notice when you can.\n\nWhen you can\u2019t it doesn\u2019t occur to you, unless your internal dialogue is fixated on a book deal again.\n\nEdited three times\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Methods for Intercepting Dreams", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 88, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"x4f5y35aqsz41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 68, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb949d0f345c9e9cc31a8a6211be5b7f866da07c"}, {"y": 137, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d0bee2142312f884f37746bb394f3a21f78f80e"}, {"y": 203, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb68bdd277b9cc5138d4b035bb638431f1e40f07"}, {"y": 406, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb378895295f61149298f4c04cf61c70c66c0747"}, {"y": 609, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699d03bf61e97d644f4fb6804a1d9167fa50bdf1"}, {"y": 686, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db6426ec6af68323f8d2367a00e9e9f336cbd3c1"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1700, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e947bed5b9bf77310ad0ee90736a8ebcce93bd"}, "id": "x4f5y35aqsz41"}}, "name": "t3_gmym8d", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/87kJdpvszLBGf72Vn79ydv408zCeSJikyipCsIOor7Y.jpg", "edited": 1589932762.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1589926611.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=1700&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1e947bed5b9bf77310ad0ee90736a8ebcce93bd\"&gt;Methods for Intercepting and Identifying Dream Types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are multiple &amp;quot;visions&amp;quot; you can have in darkness, when you reach Heightened Awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is, when you are wide awake, eyes open, in a completely dark room, and have played with the darkness until your assemblage point moves several feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted the path it takes recently.

With dreaming doubles, proximity makes them easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Cholita\u2019s case, it\u2019s pretty easy to verify it\u2019s her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there\u2019s some \u201cevidence\u201d that is, which there is, 1 out of 5 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it\u2019s always Cholita!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, she\u2019s depicting a dream scene that I see the next day, in a picture on her cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An obsession of the day, which she dreamt about the night before.  A specific obsession I had no way of knowing about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019d think I could just ask her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you think that, you need to go to the wiki and read more about Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is a &amp;quot;worthy opponent&amp;quot;, like La Catalina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos sort of arranged it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, I had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from constant risk of attack and death, you can\u2019t ask Cholita anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless she wants you to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she doesn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy was misbehaving that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But usually if she makes an unpleasant face, it turns out she\u2019s trying to communicate a warning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least twice she\u2019s warned me that Carlos\u2019 allies are about to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She always likes to watch what I\u2019m doing in my hand, if it involves the second attention. If she\u2019s absent, and I scoop up a dream, she\u2019s sure to show up soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could be she&amp;#39;s there to help. But at the least, she keeps my assemblage point very stable when she&amp;#39;s around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the hand on the left, you see a dream I materialized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t scoop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the idea because Carlos said you could form \u201cThe Wall\u201d on any surface, including your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Wall&amp;quot; is nothing more than a waking dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A flat surface created by the Second Attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just gazed at my hand with the idea that it\u2019s possible, and a dreaming scene formed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a little surprised by the intense black background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you take what you get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also tried scooping a dream out of the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I found some details in the dreaming fog to my right, gazed until the details were obviously part of a larger scene, and I was able to discern more of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It materialized at a convenient spot to my right, and I just put my hand under it (didn\u2019t feel anything), and moved my head with my hand, until it looked like it was inside my hand, near my lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreams materialized in this way only take up a portion of the room, in the dreaming fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it\u2019s because you\u2019re using your \u201cdirectional\u201d gaze to find them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they shrink when you put them into your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can of course get sucked in until the dream takes over the entire room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that comes with a blank out, and forgetting your purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t do that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep it all at a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I expected the scooped dream to lay flat in my hand, and at first it did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed into it, as if it were a window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I noticed the depth of the window allowed me to look through it at \u201can angle\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I had sliced it with my gaze, it puffed up to show the 3D details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t say it formed a perfect sphere like that, but it was darned close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started to float away, but by worrying that it would get away, I was able to make it stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, I once had both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The materialized flat dream in black goo, as you see in that picture,  and the amazing spherical dreaming bubble, which you also see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s important, for reasons you&amp;#39;ll discover on your own, while trying to scoop colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hint: Directionality is a battle we all must go through.  We must make the &amp;quot;wall of fog&amp;quot; stop rotating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, we have to make the second attention more real, so it responds to which direction we are looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it&amp;#39;s hard to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But HOW ON EARTH DO YOU LEARN TO DO THIS!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often get that question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have to ask, you need to read from the wiki more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are no procedures in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You either can do something, or you can\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You notice when you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can\u2019t it doesn\u2019t occur to you, unless your internal dialogue is fixated on a book deal again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "gmym8d", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 15, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gmym8d/methods_for_intercepting_dreams/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gmym8d/methods_for_intercepting_dreams/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1589926611.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fr99lm5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1589993935.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gmym8d", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I had a strange experience last night.\n\nI thought I'd materialized a dream in front of me.\n\nBut it looked like a strange structure made from TV static.\n\nNot quite, but that's the best description I can give of it.\n\nGazing into it produced the strangest sensation.

It must have fallen there when I was unpacking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am still waiting for her return if only to apologize for my harsh reaction, I feel bad that I never heard her message and would actually like to know what she said... so if you\u2019re listening you know who I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gmym8d/methods_for_intercepting_dreams/fr87aep/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1589970289.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_gmym8d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fra4hdx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fr9x36j", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Yea, and it's perplexing too.\n\nAt some point, even in absolute darkness, you can see your body just fine.\n\nYou can even see your arm wave in front of you.\n\nI suppose some is that psychological mechanism.\n\nBut whether it's a \"shadow\" is hard to say, because we don't really know anything at all, about why we perceive what we do.\n\nWhat's real and what isn't?\n\nHow could we even know that?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fra4hdx", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yea, and it&amp;#39;s perplexing too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point, even in absolute darkness, you can see your body just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even see your arm wave in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose some is that psychological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But whether it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;shadow&amp;quot;

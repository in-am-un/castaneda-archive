Spiritual, or not.  Religious, or Atheist.\n\nBOTH are false choices, because if you move your assemblage point everything changes.\n\nThe idea that \"spirituality\" is a path, or that those not on it are merely physical matter forming an organic robot, is a delusion placed in our minds by something outside of ourselves.\n\nNeither choice has the meaning we believe it does.  We have more than 10,000 choices for worlds at every depth of the assemblage point.  And there are MANY of those.\n\nEach contains phantom worlds, alternate versions of our world, and even 600 alternate real beings we can become, in an alternate view of the universe.

No profit motive here.\n\nMost alternate choices available to us are non-human.  You can literally step right through the solid wall of your practice room and switch to another life.  The way Carlos and Carol Tiggs used to do.\n\nWhen the assemblage point moves EVERYTHING changes.  Nothing of \"Spirituality\" or \"Our real Existence\" can survive.\n\nBut we've been so brainwashed, the idea that our reality changes and nothing human remains at some point, seem ludicrous.\n\nIf you practice darkroom and keep it up, never stopping, you won't be able to pretend anymore.\n\nIt was designed by one of the Allies of Carlos, to eliminate what has destroyed this community all these years.\n\nPretending.\n\nThe instructions are clear, and if you follow them you will absolutely see the results.\n\nAnd you can't lie to yourself about them, because they're fully real. Beyond anything in any other \"system\", whether it pretends to be spiritual or magical.  You'll kick it's butt and make its prophets look like the greedy con artists they really were.\n\nBut more importantly, as you keep going intent will store into your practices, until it begins to guide you down the same path the Olmecs blazed into the chaos of the dark sea of the emanations.\n\nWe must follow the Olmecs only or all we will have left is the pretending of the left over make believe magical systems from times past,  which form all religions and all mystical practices currently on earth.

Don't deceive yourself out of greed.\n\nYou can't find a single web page teaching obvious real magic to a group of people, in any system.\n\nBut ours. I wish that were not true!  I could take a rest if there really was magic elsewhere. No one pays me to do this!\n\nIf you get to work for real, then you get to speculate about amazing things like this diagram.\n\nIs it true?\n\nI don't know.  I need a bunch of you to stop pretending, work hard, and come take a look yourself.\n\nAnd what I might ask, are those amazing \"green puffs\"???\n\nCould they be a finished mini-version of the blue

Seems both could be useful, also feel I can eventually answer this question myself. Tried this all yesterday with no real expectations, just a silent curiosity. After about an hour I sat and saw what today I found out were the images around the green zone on the jcurve diagram. Needless to say I was excited to try again but didn't have the energy really and was trying too hard I think. When I saw the decaying face it was a vibrant Led blue, my absolute favorite color oddly enough. It disappeared but I looked straight above me and there was the blue again. Like looking at the peaks of a rippling pool, I grabbed it. Resembled a crystal structure in my fingers I grabbed the edges and stretched it out.

Ordinary, men of knowledge, and seers.\n\nAll the benefactor stuff was about how the Olmecs were given people to teach.  It was a one on one situation.  Or it might have been the Toltecs at that point.\n\nWe have 3 \"historical situations\" mixed in there.  The time of the olmecs 8000 years ago (old seer origin), then the Toltecs perhaps only 1200 years ago, and then the lineages, perhaps starting around 800 years ago.\n\nAnd don Juan made it clear that the men of knowledge didn't bother to learn to see, usually.  I only add \"usually\" because after it was clear they didn't learn to see in the first books, some of the much later ones spoke as if they did. Techno found it.\n\nProbably \"men of knowledge\" often evolved to finally learn to see.  I can't imagine they wouldn't have wanted to later in life.  Seeing removes the need for those horribly long rituals.  You can make as many new ones as you like, once you can see.\n\nIn books much later,  we learn the Men of Knowledge were part of society and licensed by the government.  And could be bakers even.  A cultural role that could take many forms.

So they traded rituals.\n\nWhat people like most!  Easy magic and pretend magic.\n\nLook at the endless trouble in here!  People want rules and demonstrations, not the hard work of learning to see.  We can't even keep people longer than a couple of weeks, with it clearly working here and nowhere else, and everyone claiming it's super important and they'll put in a huge effort.\n\nAnd don't.  They realize you can't pretend it like you do in all other \"systems\".\n\nBut you can certainly get \"stuff\" from people based on that sort of pretend \"warrior's way\" talk.  Which is more like shamanism than sorcery.  Michael Harner, much older than Carlos, commented on that.  To defend Carlos, he'd tell people that what Carlos was talking about was sorcery, not mesoamerican shamanism.  So it was NOT cultural appropriation.\n\nSomething the enemies of Carlos constantly try to use to take him down.\n\nDon Juan explained that modern shamanism is descendant from those men of knowledge, not from the seers.  And they lost the rituals and allies, so it's all pretending now.  Which it is, unfortunately.  Shamanism, even the famous Maria Sabina, isn't even beginner's level in this subreddit.  She drugged herself, and sat with eyes closed.\n\nShe'd be kicked out!  And deserve it too.\n\nAnd also keep in mind,  don Juan needed Carlos to stick around, and Carlos needed to be learning from \"an informant\".  It was standard procedure in the UC system back then.   I know because I was around it all the time.  And Carlos showed up at the reservation I spent the most time at, but couldn't get the shamans there (John and Ruby) to be his informants because UCR already had them.\n\nNo way could Carlos have started with the lineages explanation, and stuck around.  Wouldn't have gotten him his PhD at all.  So don Juan \"tricked\" him, without lying completely.\n\nCarlos himself tilted his understanding of what was going on, based on that standard UC System model for learning native american rituals.\n\nThe fear back then was, it would all be lost unless anthropologists worked fast.\n\nOddly, Carlos was mostly responsible for it NOT being lost, as the tribes tried to cash in on the popularity of his books.  \n\nWhile angry with Carlos, for \"cultural appropriation\".\n\nI witnessed that too.  The people at Morongo had a main road leading to their dilapidated homes. The road was lined with Devil's Weed plants for perhaps 100 years!\n\nThe Devil's Weed shaman there, John, was trying to duplicate the \"depth of a yard\" bit from the books of Carlos.\n\nBut it wasn't originally part of their shamanism!  They just made tea from the leaves.\n\nHe'd gone nuts over the books of Carlos too, and later in life turned to christianity.\n\nI believe he's still alive, but Ruby is gone.\n\nCarlos would have known both through Joanie.", "edited": 1664446058.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iqcjw7f", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to see that passage.

And Carlos showed up at the reservation I spent the most time at, but couldn&amp;#39;t get the shamans there (John and Ruby) to be his informants because UCR already had them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No way could Carlos have started with the lineages explanation, and stuck around.  Wouldn&amp;#39;t have gotten him his PhD at all.  So don Juan &amp;quot;tricked&amp;quot; him, without lying completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos himself tilted his understanding of what was going on, based on that standard UC System model for learning native american rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fear back then was, it would all be lost unless anthropologists worked fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, Carlos was mostly responsible for it NOT being lost, as the tribes tried to cash in on the popularity of his books.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While angry with Carlos, for &amp;quot;cultural appropriation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I witnessed that too.  The people at Morongo had a main road leading to their dilapidated homes. The road was lined with Devil&amp;#39;s Weed plants for perhaps 100 years!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Devil&amp;#39;s Weed shaman there, John, was trying to duplicate the &amp;quot;depth of a yard&amp;quot; bit from the books of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&amp;#39;t originally part of their shamanism!  They just made tea from the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d gone nuts over the books of Carlos too, and later in life turned to christianity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe he&amp;#39;s still alive, but Ruby is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos would have known both through Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_xqg5yk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xqg5yk/how_the_sight_refines_as_you_keep_working_hard/iqcjw7f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1664445443.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iqj2irj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iqdimiw", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "He was only stuck for moving his assemblage point fast enough to burn from within.\n\nIt has to move the whole range in what I estimate to be less than 2 seconds.\n\nContrast that with the 3-6 hours it takes me or Juann to move most of the curve, and you can see what an accomplishment it is to achieve the 2 seconds.\n\nJulian did too much shapeshifting sex with his apprentices.\n\nSo when his assemblage point passed through \"the shift below\", it got stuck for an instant.\n\nToo long to burn from within, because the emanations lit by the glow of the assemblage point keep glowing only a few seconds before they fade.\n\nHe couldn't light them all up at once.\n\nInteresting is that once lit up, the emanations never entirely cool off.\n\n100,000 years later you can still find what happened, in the latent glow of awareness on Man's band of emanations.\n\nThat's what Silent Knowledge is.\n\nAt the end, there's cryptic references to Carlos having found a new path to immortality.\n\nAnd in Star Wars the idea is echoed in the second set of 3 films.\n\nMy guess is that he stored himself in the same way that there's latent awareness from everything that ever happened, in Man's band.\n\nBut no one's ever researched that topic.

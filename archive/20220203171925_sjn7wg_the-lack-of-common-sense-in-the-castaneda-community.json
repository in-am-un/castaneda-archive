But until you get the Spielberg kind, please don't go around introducing yourself to other Castaneda fans by saying, \"I can *see*.\"\n\nFortunately there's so many of the books, and so many conversations with the members of don Juan's lineage that you can often find the answer if you just go back to the source.  And in the case of the dreaming emissary and seeing, which are closely tied together,  the \"seeing\" answers you get are commonly something you already knew or should have known, if you were \"worth your salt\".\n\nYou don't get the audiovisual show until you reach DEEP orange zone.  But you get the answers starting at the very early part of the orange zone.\n\nThose of you who don't instantly recognize that last quoted part about the high cost of salt,   are at a great disadvantage.   You really do need to read the books.\n\nBut it's a very wise statement.  It's even a warning to new people but you have to get there and see it, to understand the warning.  If I just tell you you may understand and even be better off on that single topic, but the knowledge won't contribute to \"common sense\".\n\nWe can't acquire common sense by memorizing inventory.  Common sense only comes from living a situation for a long time.  It's that way in the real world, and it's that way in sorcerery.\n\nHere's an example.  I'll make up a new phony teacher:  The **Nagual Bob Matus**.\n\nBob has a book.  And he gives workshops.  And he has his own tensegrity moves.  He charges a ton, and then he brainwashes young people to go out and give him glowing reviews.  There's no magic at all, just good feelings and path with heart hugs.\n\nBut that's all there's ever been in this community since Carlos died, so no one thinks otherwise.\n\nWe have no common sense about how people actually learn sorcery, because no one bothered to try.\n\nThis is hard to convey... \n\nIt's so obvious, but to consider how to talk about it exposes where people can go wrong trying to understand, and  you just know they will because what you're trying to explain steps on some sacred cows. They aren't going to accept it, out of greed.\n\nSo for starters, where did the Nagual Bob learn sorcery?\n\nFrom who?\n\nWhy is he so talented, when the rest of us have to sweat blood to move just a fraction of an inch down that path?\n\nHow come the Nagual Bob is not full of stories and techniques explaining how to overcome the awful learning hurtles, but instead is just full of confident smiles, telling you to keep taking his expensive workshops and everything will become clear.\n\nWhy the absolute lack of common sense in the community, not to instantly recognize Bob is a serial killer?  Don't you watch any cop shows?\n\nOr at least, if there was money in murdering his workshop attendees, he'd do it.\n\nLet's back off to the real world, where we have some common sense.\n\nIf the Nagual Bob changed his name to \"The Amazing Bob\" and claimed to have mastered all sports overnight, learned to break all world records with no obvious period where he was struggling, and if all of his advice about how to do sports was empty of any hint what a daily struggle that is,  no one would fall for it.\n\nUnless they had a gun to their head, like they do in North Korea. Where their exalted leader made 7 holes in one playing his first gold game.\n\nNaturally no one believes that.  But the government officials are trying to avoid being fired by firing squad, so they put on a good show to make it seem like they've convinced some of the population that's true. It pleases the great leader.\n\nUsing violence to create pretend super powers is not restricted to north Korea.\n\nWe see it in here, when a new person starts making up experiences which come out completely void of any hint of hard work or a struggle and then we  don't instantly see that, mostly out of self-pity.  We don't want to \"accuse\" anyone of being a total fraud, even when in the real world our common sense would not hesitate.\n\nWe just don't have common sense when it comes to sorcery.\n\nSo we give \"Bob\" the benefit of the doubt and think, \"Maybe he's just super talented?  And his abilities are 10 times greater than any Nagual we've read about, all of whom had to struggle horribly for years to become a sorcery teacher.  Even then, it took an entire team of 15, the previous lineage, to teach them.\"\n\nNope.  Maybe Bob is just that cool!\n\nBut if it were something in the real world, like Bob pretended to master understanding all of quantum physics in a week, we'd know for sure it was childish.\n\nI hope everyone can extrapolate that. Please borrow some common sense from your \"real life\" and use it in your \"magical life\".  But  that won't be possible until you actually put in some work to learn.\n\nIt's very hard to learn sorcery.  The hardest thing any human can do. If you can speak about it to others without a horrible frown on your face once in a while, maybe you cheated and used too many power plants?\n\nSo in the real world we learn that no one hits 7 \"hole in ones\" on his first golf game.\n\nBut sorcery is vast.  And some aspects of it seem to be different from other aspects.  You almost need \"multiple sets of common sense\".\n\nTake dreaming.\n\nIf you never actually put in the work to learn 4 gates, or if you lied and ignored the instructions so you could pretend, you failed to gain the common sense needed to figure out when someone is pulling your leg.\n\nThus we get bad men in the community claiming that don Juan showed up in dreaming and taught them new tensegrity moves.  And when you ask how they know that's true, they make up that they can \"see energy\", so they could verify that was in fact \"the real don Juan\".  And also, they have use of the Emissary, and he can't lie.  So there you go.\n\nTo get away with that sales pitch shows an astounding lack of common sense in the community.\n\nIt's because no one learned to do 4 gates dreaming.  I've never met a person who actually tried.  It's all just lazy men ignoring the instructions, so they can pretend their magic in a chat room.\n\nStill, unless you worked as hard as it really takes to learn 4 gates dreaming, as hard as it takes to actually find your hands and look from item to item every single time you enter, to protect yourself from make believe, it might seem possible someone is simply more talented than you and their \"tales of dreaming power\" ought to be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAgain, until you actually try to master that path, nothing I say will give you the common sense you need.\n\nBut just to help you out, if you don't hear of intense struggles, with the person almost obsessed with trying to help you overcome those struggles yourself, using the benefit of their own sweat and blood, the person making the claims is either a fraud or it's a bad person who doesn't care about anyone else. And the bad person scenario still makes no sense, even though it's implied anytime someone inflates their ordinary dreaming into 4 gates success.\n\nIt's true that you can hit 7 holes in one in a golf game in *dreaming*, but if the person told you the actual details it would be nothing like that.  Even in dreaming no one can actually hit 7 holes in one.\n\nOn looking back you'd find that \"hole in 1\" #3 was actually a rock, going into an alligators mouth at the water trap.\n\nAnd you suddenly had a woman's breasts in  your hand, while shooting #6.\n\nThat's what dreaming is like.\n\nIt's that \"double\" guy.  He's totally irrational.  And because he never had to struggle to do anything, he also has no common sense.\n\nSo let's say Bob returns, having failed to convince anyone he's a \"Nagual\", and having been humiliated when forced to demonstrate his amazing sports skills, or his golf ability, and decides to go for something like dreaming where no one in the world has any common sense.\n\nHe  learns Tensegrity moves from the inorganic beings.\n\nFirst of all...   really?\n\nHow did that happen?  It would be such a cool thing in reality, you would expect to hear more details.  Not just the claim.\n\nWas it the inorganic being version of Kylie?\n\nHow long did she give you to memorize that tensegrity form?\n\nHow come you can suddenly remember all details of a dream where you had to memorize complicated body movements?\n\nDid the phantom Kylie just \"beam it into your mind\", with her fierce stare?\n\nTo say you learned it in dreaming is clearly not a true representation of what might actually have happened.\n\nSo let's say we all agree, you can't learn a long form in dreaming. Or if you could there ought to be lots of explanations the person telling the story wants to convey, to help others.\n\nHis concern ought to be helping others do what's nearly impossible, instead of pretending it all just happened very easily with no struggle and no memory problems.\n\nWe have no common sense about not only dreaming, but also no common sense about the community of Castaneda fans itself.\n\nBy now you should have realized, the #1 feature of Castaneda followers is that they lie to get attention.\n\nBecause they don't want to put in hard work, and besides, no one else does anyway.  There's no \"hard working\" role models at all.  Just people trying to con other people.\n\nI suppose, to get those \"path with heart\" hugs?  I never liked those myself.\n\nAnd tt be fair, there's no common sense anywhere else!  Buddhists haven't noticed, there's no magic in Buddhism.  Daoists haven't noticed, Daoists have even less than Buddhists, and are a bit evil to boot.\n\nThe Castaneda world is just living up to the standards of magic systems in general. There's no magic, and it's ok to lie about that.\n\nAnd so the lack of common sense about the horrible nature of accounts of success in the Castaneda world causes some people to fall for such an account without requiring some details that ought to have been included, because there's no way they should have known better.\n\nSuch as, how do you know that was an inorganic being in your dream, and not just the checkout clerk at the super market who had bizarre hair, coming back to haunt you.\n\nDescribe the IOB!\n\nWas it stable?\n\nDid you stare at it and try to make it dissolve?\n\nIf you did, how come you managed to be so lucky you found the \"real one\", and not one of his several projections?\n\nAnd how come you didn't mention any tips for how to instantly turn to the \"real inorganic being\"?  \n\nDidn't you realize your listeners might benefit from tips about that very difficult topic?\n\nHow long did you manage to stay lucid? Even 30 seconds is next to impossible for people who haven't gotten some dark energy yet.\n\nHow did you get that much dark energy?  Which inorganic being got you there?  Couldn't have been that one.  You just met him.\n\nWhy is a new tensegrity move more important than telling us how you did the very basics of 4 gates dreaming? \n\nWhat did the IOB world look like?  How many came to greet you?\n\nHow come you could retain the memory of the movement? \n\nThe whole things smells bad from the start and yet we have so little common sense we often don't notice.\n\nOr better put, our self-pity kicks in and we feel bad for the guy, so we don't want to point out what we instantly knew the moment we saw his face.\n\nWe feel sorry for ourselves and use him as the manifestation of it.\n\nFinally, how come no one asks, is this sorcery?\n\nDon Juan never mentioned this.\n\nYes, Zuleica said you could make up your own movements.  By the way, DON'T give those out, or the community will eventually be destroyed.  We don't need \"authorized lying categories\". Acceptable ways to get attention using deception.\n\nSo don't share movements you made up, until you are only using them as an example of some principle. And  they'd better be 50% real tensegrity moves, rearranged.\n\nFrom the books, I don't recall any inorganic being designed movements being mentioned.  If that were possible it would be a dazzlingly higher level of sorcery than the rest of the storyline.\n\nAnd it lacks common sense!  \"Tensegrity\" is just a name Carlos made, so he could teach all sorts of motions and techniques he was taught in the course of learning sorcery.\n\nThere was no organized \"thing\".   That's a recent addition.  If the IOBs were copying sorcery, they'd just show you a hand movement.  Not a kungfu \"kata\".\n\nSo maybe, it's not actually sorcery.  Maybe it's the book deal mind at work.  And maybe, if you hear that from someone it's a sign they will make things up to get attention.\n\nOr maybe it's the \"assistant motivated book deal\" mind. That's where you carelessly brag to a friend, and then he seizes it as an opportunity to get some cash.  And now you're stuck with your lie.\n\nLike Juan the children's book maker, turning Armando evil for money.\n\nConvincing him to take his set of lecture notes, not give them out freely like others did, and instead to turn them into a 3 book deal, as if over the years he just absorbed sorcery talent because he \"met Carlos\". All as a result of merely going to a book store to hear Carlos speak.\n\nMaybe the new tensegrity movement was just a hand gesture with some other simple thing, and never was a complete anything.  But now someone's ego is on the line.  Because he wasn't entirely accurate when he told his friend.\n\nSo it escalates.\n\nBut that still doesn't answer whether this is sorcery.\n\nWhich is why Carlos warned us over and over at the end.\n\n\"The *Intent* of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nIf you go around to bars picking up new tensegrity moves from strangers, where's the intent of the ancient sorcerers in that?\n\nAnd why would you go \"off path\"?\n\nBecause what Carlos gave us wasn't enough?!?\n\nThat's the old days.  Things have changed now. It actually works!\n\nWould you go off path because someone might randomly save you some time, with something more powerful than the sorcery of all of the lineages?  Can you look at the person and honestly say they have any sorcery knowledge whatsoever?\n\nHow would you even begin to figure out if that's ok to do, before you learn to \"see energy\"\n\nAnd if you had learned to *see* energy and found yourself face to face with 1000 cool things you need to investigate, why would  you put any effort into a tensegrity move that was never taught through the only path that has the intent we need?\n\nDo you actually believe sorcery is just about learning a new move, and then you're good to go?\n\nYou **can't** learn sorcery.  You **really** can't.  To believe that, shows a total lack of understanding.\n\nSorcery is the phantom house of the Olmecs.  They could have made a completely different one which is just as cool. But they made what we read about.\n\n**Entry** is what you need.  Not to try to learn it on your own.  The motivation for that is obvious: You want to become a pretend teacher.  And you don't actually care about magic.\n\nCarlos was so obsessed over giving his people \"entry\" to that world that he made up crazy stories about the members of his inner circle.  Stories, weird outfits, weird hair, new names. All designed to try to capture even the tiniest part of the *intent* of the old seers.\n\nHe told us:  We copy them **exactly** until the very end because it's the only path of *intent* we have. And THEN, at the very end,  we stretch into a line instead of a pipe shape.\n\nCarlos had no idea if any of his made up stories to invoke intent would work, but when you are dealing with the emanations being \"skimmed\" by *intent*, even a tiny detail might be enough to help.\n\nSo if we knew for a fact that one of the old seers tripped on a rock and tore off a toenail, just before he discovered some astounding new aspect of Olmec sorcery, it would not be completely insane to try to stumble and tear off that toenail yourself.\n\nKind of gruesome though.\n\nLets just say, wearing those bizarre rubber hats the Olmecs wore, and their cotton underwear, might not be such a bad idea if you really want to gain some advantage.\n\nIt would certainly make a lot more common sense than a new tensegrity move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Lack of Common Sense in the Castaneda Community", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xmj1cb14bnf81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmj1cb14bnf81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efe177eff8669f409e2258f66913089fefdd62cd"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmj1cb14bnf81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4835237b1824ee22c96e6da9c40e8d479e27752"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmj1cb14bnf81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e61851f34722f3ee898b826567776960c59c6a2"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmj1cb14bnf81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ebd3500eb46bb67fc0cf6fbcc16a9e86a65622"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmj1cb14bnf81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b3ab3b2760cbc6abe1e8684502d87bd1fd22008"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmj1cb14bnf81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a001813b97c87bb81daba87314e59848d86b8535"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmj1cb14bnf81.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce04884302cf4a402cbec83dc773a4324e8624a2"}, "id": "xmj1cb14bnf81"}}, "name": "t3_sjn7wg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xYVVx0quWRcZGw0hDg2tEuvjIDY0Kmwyg4G6_t7HqqI.jpg", "edited": 1643908078.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643905165.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xmj1cb14bnf81.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce04884302cf4a402cbec83dc773a4324e8624a2\"&gt;It really has gotten this bad.

And some aspects of it seem to be different from other aspects.  You almost need &amp;quot;multiple sets of common sense&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you never actually put in the work to learn 4 gates, or if you lied and ignored the instructions so you could pretend, you failed to gain the common sense needed to figure out when someone is pulling your leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus we get bad men in the community claiming that don Juan showed up in dreaming and taught them new tensegrity moves.  And when you ask how they know that&amp;#39;s true, they make up that they can &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot;, so they could verify that was in fact &amp;quot;the real don Juan&amp;quot;.  And also, they have use of the Emissary, and he can&amp;#39;t lie.  So there you go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get away with that sales pitch shows an astounding lack of common sense in the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s because no one learned to do 4 gates dreaming.  I&amp;#39;ve never met a person who actually tried.  It&amp;#39;s all just lazy men ignoring the instructions, so they can pretend their magic in a chat room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, unless you worked as hard as it really takes to learn 4 gates dreaming, as hard as it takes to actually find your hands and look from item to item every single time you enter, to protect yourself from make believe, it might seem possible someone is simply more talented than you and their &amp;quot;tales of dreaming power&amp;quot; ought to be given the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, until you actually try to master that path, nothing I say will give you the common sense you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just to help you out, if you don&amp;#39;t hear of intense struggles, with the person almost obsessed with trying to help you overcome those struggles yourself, using the benefit of their own sweat and blood, the person making the claims is either a fraud or it&amp;#39;s a bad person who doesn&amp;#39;t care about anyone else. And the bad person scenario still makes no sense, even though it&amp;#39;s implied anytime someone inflates their ordinary dreaming into 4 gates success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that you can hit 7 holes in one in a golf game in &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt;, but if the person told you the actual details it would be nothing like that.  Even in dreaming no one can actually hit 7 holes in one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On looking back you&amp;#39;d find that &amp;quot;hole in 1&amp;quot; #3 was actually a rock, going into an alligators mouth at the water trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you suddenly had a woman&amp;#39;s breasts in  your hand, while shooting #6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what dreaming is like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s that &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; guy.  He&amp;#39;s totally irrational.  And because he never had to struggle to do anything, he also has no common sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s say Bob returns, having failed to convince anyone he&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;Nagual&amp;quot;, and having been humiliated when forced to demonstrate his amazing sports skills, or his golf ability, and decides to go for something like dreaming where no one in the world has any common sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He  learns Tensegrity moves from the inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all...   really?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did that happen?  It would be such a cool thing in reality, you would expect to hear more details.  Not just the claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it the inorganic being version of Kylie?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long did she give you to memorize that tensegrity form?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How come you can suddenly remember all details of a dream where you had to memorize complicated body movements?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did the phantom Kylie just &amp;quot;beam it into your mind&amp;quot;, with her fierce stare?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To say you learned it in dreaming is clearly not a true representation of what might actually have happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s say we all agree, you can&amp;#39;t learn a long form in dreaming. Or if you could there ought to be lots of explanations the person telling the story wants to convey, to help others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His concern ought to be helping others do what&amp;#39;s nearly impossible, instead of pretending it all just happened very easily with no struggle and no memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have no common sense about not only dreaming, but also no common sense about the community of Castaneda fans itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now you should have realized, the #1 feature of Castaneda followers is that they lie to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they don&amp;#39;t want to put in hard work, and besides, no one else does anyway.  There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;hard working&amp;quot; role models at all.  Just people trying to con other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, to get those &amp;quot;path with heart&amp;quot; hugs?  I never liked those myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And tt be fair, there&amp;#39;s no common sense anywhere else!  Buddhists haven&amp;#39;t noticed, there&amp;#39;s no magic in Buddhism.  Daoists haven&amp;#39;t noticed, Daoists have even less than Buddhists, and are a bit evil to boot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Castaneda world is just living up to the standards of magic systems in general. There&amp;#39;s no magic, and it&amp;#39;s ok to lie about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so the lack of common sense about the horrible nature of accounts of success in the Castaneda world causes some people to fall for such an account without requiring some details that ought to have been included, because there&amp;#39;s no way they should have known better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, how do you know that was an inorganic being in your dream, and not just the checkout clerk at the super market who had bizarre hair, coming back to haunt you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Describe the IOB!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it stable?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you stare at it and try to make it dissolve?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you did, how come you managed to be so lucky you found the &amp;quot;real one&amp;quot;, and not one of his several projections?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how come you didn&amp;#39;t mention any tips for how to instantly turn to the &amp;quot;real inorganic being&amp;quot;?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t you realize your listeners might benefit from tips about that very difficult topic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long did you manage to stay lucid? Even 30 seconds is next to impossible for people who haven&amp;#39;t gotten some dark energy yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did you get that much dark energy?  Which inorganic being got you there?  Couldn&amp;#39;t have been that one.  You just met him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is a new tensegrity move more important than telling us how you did the very basics of 4 gates dreaming? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did the IOB world look like?  How many came to greet you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How come you could retain the memory of the movement? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole things smells bad from the start and yet we have so little common sense we often don&amp;#39;t notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or better put, our self-pity kicks in and we feel bad for the guy, so we don&amp;#39;t want to point out what we instantly knew the moment we saw his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We feel sorry for ourselves and use him as the manifestation of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, how come no one asks, is this sorcery?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan never mentioned this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Zuleica said you could make up your own movements.  By the way, DON&amp;#39;T give those out, or the community will eventually be destroyed.  We don&amp;#39;t need &amp;quot;authorized lying categories&amp;quot;. Acceptable ways to get attention using deception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t share movements you made up, until you are only using them as an example of some principle. And  they&amp;#39;d better be 50% real tensegrity moves, rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the books, I don&amp;#39;t recall any inorganic being designed movements being mentioned.  If that were possible it would be a dazzlingly higher level of sorcery than the rest of the storyline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it lacks common sense!  &amp;quot;Tensegrity&amp;quot; is just a name Carlos made, so he could teach all sorts of motions and techniques he was taught in the course of learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no organized &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.   That&amp;#39;s a recent addition.  If the IOBs were copying sorcery, they&amp;#39;d just show you a hand movement.  Not a kungfu &amp;quot;kata&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe, it&amp;#39;s not actually sorcery.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s the book deal mind at work.  And maybe, if you hear that from someone it&amp;#39;s a sign they will make things up to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;assistant motivated book deal&amp;quot; mind. That&amp;#39;s where you carelessly brag to a friend, and then he seizes it as an opportunity to get some cash.  And now you&amp;#39;re stuck with your lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Juan the children&amp;#39;s book maker, turning Armando evil for money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Convincing him to take his set of lecture notes, not give them out freely like others did, and instead to turn them into a 3 book deal, as if over the years he just absorbed sorcery talent because he &amp;quot;met Carlos&amp;quot;. All as a result of merely going to a book store to hear Carlos speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the new tensegrity movement was just a hand gesture with some other simple thing, and never was a complete anything.  But now someone&amp;#39;s ego is on the line.  Because he wasn&amp;#39;t entirely accurate when he told his friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it escalates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that still doesn&amp;#39;t answer whether this is sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why Carlos warned us over and over at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you go around to bars picking up new tensegrity moves from strangers, where&amp;#39;s the intent of the ancient sorcerers in that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why would you go &amp;quot;off path&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because what Carlos gave us wasn&amp;#39;t enough?!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the old days.  Things have changed now. It actually works!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you go off path because someone might randomly save you some time, with something more powerful than the sorcery of all of the lineages?  Can you look at the person and honestly say they have any sorcery knowledge whatsoever?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How would you even begin to figure out if that&amp;#39;s ok to do, before you learn to &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you had learned to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; energy and found yourself face to face with 1000 cool things you need to investigate, why would  you put any effort into a tensegrity move that was never taught through the only path that has the intent we need?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you actually believe sorcery is just about learning a new move, and then you&amp;#39;re good to go?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; learn sorcery.  You &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; can&amp;#39;t.  To believe that, shows a total lack of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is the phantom house of the Olmecs.  They could have made a completely different one which is just as cool. But they made what we read about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry&lt;/strong&gt; is what you need.  Not to try to learn it on your own.  The motivation for that is obvious: You want to become a pretend teacher.  And you don&amp;#39;t actually care about magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was so obsessed over giving his people &amp;quot;entry&amp;quot; to that world that he made up crazy stories about the members of his inner circle.  Stories, weird outfits, weird hair, new names. All designed to try to capture even the tiniest part of the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told us:  We copy them &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; until the very end because it&amp;#39;s the only path of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; we have. And THEN, at the very end,  we stretch into a line instead of a pipe shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had no idea if any of his made up stories to invoke intent would work, but when you are dealing with the emanations being &amp;quot;skimmed&amp;quot; by &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, even a tiny detail might be enough to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if we knew for a fact that one of the old seers tripped on a rock and tore off a toenail, just before he discovered some astounding new aspect of Olmec sorcery, it would not be completely insane to try to stumble and tear off that toenail yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of gruesome though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets just say, wearing those bizarre rubber hats the Olmecs wore, and their cotton underwear, might not be such a bad idea if you really want to gain some advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would certainly make a lot more common sense than a new tensegrity move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow":

That's seeing!\n\nBut there's seeing yourself shape shift down in the red zone, and listening to your Ally try to guide you. That's seeing!\n\nBut the TRUE seeing, I suppose, is \"Seeing Energy\".\n\nNOT however, \"seeing energy on a horizon\".\n\nThat's a \"lesser seeing\".\n\nEven though that kicks butt over all other systems.  They only wish they could do that.\n\nIt takes near perfect silence for long periods, like 30 minutes.\n\nDon Juan sort of covered this topic, and there was an interesting clue in there.\n\nSo seeing energy on a horizon,  and summoning videos like on the cover of Wheel of Time, is easy.\n\nCarlos greatly emphasized this in the months before he died.\n\nIt only takes sustained effort to learn silence.  Silence automatically causes that to happen.\n\nBut to switch to seeing the raw emanations, you likely have to stop the world.\n\nAt least, that's the only way I've done it.\n\nAnd then according to don Juan, you can't sustain the view of it, in your Tonal body.\n\nYou need the double.\n\nThe tonal doesn't have enough energy to see the raw emanations for long.  I have no idea how long it can manage, because I never did that.\n\nBut I did do it in my double.\n\nIn my case, my IOB \"Fairy\" (aka Little Smoke) pushed me into the double to accomplish it.\n\nJust gave me a tap on the left shoulder, where the Nagual might strike it,  and I \"popped out\" into a realm of golden fibers of light. The universe was on fire.\n\nI could tell for certain it was the raw emanations, because the bundles became visible, when I looked for the spaces between the emanations, so I could levitate into them.\n\nOnce you see a bundle it pulls you in, and you find yourself whole again, standing in a new world (where you can stay for hours, until you run out of energy).\n\nYou can move back and forth between teh emanations, and  the world created by  a bundle, but while doing that, I got the impression 2 is the limit or you can be absorbed into the emanations.\n\nThe double is, after all, just pure energy of awareness.\n\nBut I didn't realize that's what had happened.  That I'd switched to the double.\n\nI felt myself pushed, but didn't realize I'd left my tonal body on the bed.\n\nI guess if you're asking, you aren't aware. All darkroom is done fully awake, eyes open, no drugs. There's no sleeping dreaming involved at all.\n\nThe double can gaze at the emanations for long periods, but the warning from don Juan is, he's eventually consumed by them.\n\nIf you want to be strict about it, that's possibly the first \"real\" seeing.\n\nBut there's a layer even above that.  To see the Eagle.\n\nAnd there's seeing the luminous eggs.\n\nA different kind of seeing.\n\nSo seeing is a complicated topic, with plenty of places for people to screw themselves up with pretending. As they always have.\n\n\\&gt; not realizing that this abstract sensation of \"knowing\" facets of xyz is in fact seeing.\n\nYes, of course, but you need to get to the deep orange zone to understand this directly.\n\nFirst, if you can think of an incident in the books like that, there's no way you know if they \"just knew it\", or if a whiteboard materialized above someone they were pondering, with writing on it say, \"Ask about the button nosed boy.\"\n\nThat is MORE COMMON than what you propose.  Written messages.\n\nCarlos gave half of an entire lecture just reading it off the wall to the south east.\n\nI suspect the intent of that, is still altering our course.\n\nIt's why Carlos wrote the \"Readers of Infinity\" publication.\n\nTo learn about this, go to the deep orange zone, where you get \"topical seeing\".\n\nIt's like a video presentation, with a voice over explaining.\n\nVery fun!!!\n\nExcept, you don't give a damn.\n\nWhen you can do stuff like that, it feels like \"Of course you can do that.\"\n\nNo thrill.\n\nSo you never really get to be excited over an accomplishment.\n\nWhile in that mode, the flow can start and you just \"know\" things, without the need for the video presentation.\n\nHowever, it's not good to promote that idea, because a segment of the Castaneda population has been pretending they have sorcery powers, based on no evidence at all. Just their mood.  And then if they think up a clever idea, like all people do once in a while, they pretend that's seeing.\n\nRemember that the spirit of darkroom is to remove the possibility of pretending.\n\nI didn't do that. It was Little Smoke.  Carlos sent her to help just before he died, and I suppose she eventually figured out what went wrong.\n\nYou REALLY need to insist on visual, otherwise you will lie to yourself.\n\nAnd we don't have anyone of the skill level needed, to figure out if that's what's going on.  So if you do a good job lying, you really screwed yourself over.\n\n\\&gt;I believe I've read enough of your posts to recognize that your flash\n\nI'm not sure what that means, but this all comes from Little Smoke. She blackmailed me.  Chased me across 6 countries, to force me to come out and help people.  I started out wrong though, and lost 10 years.  Then I came here.\n\nLast night Fairy returned and tried to teach me to sing.\n\nA fairy is one thing. But singing to it is another. I have to put my foot down somewhere.\n\nApparently she wanted me to understand what Nyei is up to.\n\nAnyway, I just work here...  no need to figure out where what comes from.\n\nIt's not me.", "edited": 1643998013.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hvl7cl7", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Is seeing simply the alignment of internal and external bands of emanations?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing is too complicated to define so easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s perceiving colors in darkness. That&amp;#39;s seeing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s seeing yourself shape shift down in the red zone, and listening to your Ally try to guide you. That&amp;#39;s seeing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the TRUE seeing, I suppose, is &amp;quot;Seeing Energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOT however, &amp;quot;seeing energy on a horizon&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;lesser seeing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though that kicks butt over all other systems.  They only wish they could do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes near perfect silence for long periods, like 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan sort of covered this topic, and there was an interesting clue in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So seeing energy on a horizon,  and summoning videos like on the cover of Wheel of Time, is easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos greatly emphasized this in the months before he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only takes sustained effort to learn silence.  Silence automatically causes that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to switch to seeing the raw emanations, you likely have to stop the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, that&amp;#39;s the only way I&amp;#39;ve done it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then according to don Juan, you can&amp;#39;t sustain the view of it, in your Tonal body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tonal doesn&amp;#39;t have enough energy to see the raw emanations for long.  I have no idea how long it can manage, because I never did that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I did do it in my double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, my IOB &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; (aka Little Smoke) pushed me into the double to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just gave me a tap on the left shoulder, where the Nagual might strike it,  and I &amp;quot;popped out&amp;quot; into a realm of golden fibers of light. The universe was on fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could tell for certain it was the raw emanations, because the bundles became visible, when I looked for the spaces between the emanations, so I could levitate into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you see a bundle it pulls you in, and you find yourself whole again, standing in a new world (where you can stay for hours, until you run out of energy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can move back and forth between teh emanations, and  the world created by  a bundle, but while doing that, I got the impression 2 is the limit or you can be absorbed into the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double is, after all, just pure energy of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t realize that&amp;#39;s what had happened.  That I&amp;#39;d switched to the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt myself pushed, but didn&amp;#39;t realize I&amp;#39;d left my tonal body on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess if you&amp;#39;re asking, you aren&amp;#39;t aware. All darkroom is done fully awake, eyes open, no drugs. There&amp;#39;s no sleeping dreaming involved at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double can gaze at the emanations for long periods, but the warning from don Juan is, he&amp;#39;s eventually consumed by them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to be strict about it, that&amp;#39;s possibly the first &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a layer even above that.

And how hard you need to actually work to see the good good stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re making a point in this post that the whole process requires an extremely sharp sense of discernement, something I reckon that the average person lacks even in a mundane situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My takeaway is that while this mundane form of seeing is a start, it isn&amp;#39;t fully the seeing \u00e0 la Spielberg that sorcerers are after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And knowing how tricky it&amp;#39;s been to adjust my own perspective (or dampen my I.D.) enough to realize this alone, it just seems terribly unlikely that anyone could make it so far into sorcery without possessing such basic forms common sense. Good way to spot a fake I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the magic isn&amp;#39;t always dazzling, but we&amp;#39;d learn more from honest and boring but reliable results, than a flashy lie. I would say the awareness I&amp;#39;ve gathered from these practices, though not what I had expected, feels inherently magical. Never had a distinctly visual experience of this magic but if I expand my definition of it based on what you&amp;#39;re saying here, it&amp;#39;s more than enough to keep me involved on its own. Attention seeking just misses the point entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sjn7wg/the_lack_of_common_sense_in_the_castaneda/hvhav5j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1643926393.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_sjn7wg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}]

[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "Last night I was continuing to discover if it\u2019s possible to \u201censlave\u201d Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nFor someone new, Mr. DoubleTake is what I call our tendency to shake off anything we deem impossible, or delusional.\n\nSo for instance, if you\u2019re a sorcerer, you find out there\u2019s all kinds of things out there in the real world, running around in the day, unnoticed. You\u2019ll be at work, and see a man made of black light dart past a hallway.\n\nOr a big insect with actual eyeballs, zip past your feet.\n\nSome see lines waving like smoke or vibrating like string, all over the ground outdoors.\n\nIf \u201cnormal\u201d people catch a glimpse, they rub their eyes, shake their heads, and generally force themselves to ignore it. Except, they\u2019ve gotten so good at doing that over the years, it's now instant.\n\nA small child for example has to run to Mommy to make it all go away, when the monster under the bed wants to play. Mommy can stabilize his assemblage point on the miserable place mankind now prefers.  She cuddles him to remind him how cozy it is in **her** view of the world.\n\nThat tendency to censor our awareness is buried below our internal dialogue. It takes a sorcerer or witch to see it.\n\nThe good news is, Mr. DoubleTake can be retrained. His first training was from your family, who were also blinded to magic as babies.\n\nCarlos called it, \u201cthe fliers mind\u201d, meaning, what prevents humans from escaping to freedom.\n\nBut where Mr. DoubleTake ends and something else begins, I have no idea.\n\nThat\u2019s what I was trying to discover.\n\nI was using Mr. DoubleTake to find \u201cbad things\u201d that shouldn\u2019t be there, on puffs of purple smoke glowing in my dark bedroom. It turns out, he's happy to \"surround\" them and hold them captive, when he finds one. And he'll defer judgement to you in such a situation.\n\nHe runs to Mommy.\n\nThus instead of making them go away, I had him \u201ctattle telling\u201d me. His desired to do something about things that I\u2019m not supposed to see, caused him to light up the edges of the puffs. The purple lights burned with red and yellow edges, and they were so bright even Mr. DoubleTake was afraid.  The visions in the middle had no chance of leaking out.\n\nIn the middle of each puff was a dreaming scene. Not a floating head. Not a single being. It was a hole in reality, through which I could see scenes of activity. They were animating smoothly.\n\nIn one I saw a fisherman in a small boat, looking over the bow for fish.\n\nI had a sudden insight. \n\nYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Fishing!\n\nCarlos called it navigating, but if I have to explain this to someone new, I could just as easily tell them it was \u201cfishing\u201d. For magic.\n\nBut I was absolutely silent. To do that kind of fishing, you have to be very quiet, so you don\u2019t scare the fish away. \n\nAnd that kind of fish can hear your internal dialogue.\n\nBecause I was silent, but had just had an \u201cinsight\u201d, it produced an echo in my awareness.\n\nI had a strange thought.  Carlos had said something about fishing. What was it?\n\nI realized, he\u2019d told Don Juan the story of his lazy, good for nothing dad, who always insisted Carlos had to get up very early in the morning, so they could go fishing.\n\nBut his father could never get up. And he never learned that. He kept insisting the two of them were going in the morning, but it always came to nothing.\n\nCarlos wanted don Juan to criticize his father, but was surprised when don Juan didn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019ll add, don Juan **could not**. In no way could he do that.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because, we ALL need to get up very early in the morning to go fishing. Like, at 2AM even. So we can go fishing in the second attention.\n\nIf we punish ourselves mentally for not being able to do that, and consider ourselves useless, we\u2019ll hold back our progress.\n\nIf we just realize it\u2019s hard to get up, but otherwise we\u2019re fine, we\u2019ll make faster progress.\n\nWe\u2019ll catch more fish until we get \u201cthe big one\u201d, which makes it easier to get up.\n\nThe vision of a fisherman in his boat was gone. I was thinking about too many book deals. \n\nWhat I\u2019d write here about that.\n\nSo I lost him.\n\nBut Mr. DoubleTake was still my slave, so I continued to scan my eyes. I turned my head left and right slowly, while emphasizing that I was trying to \u201crecognize\u201d things. To identify them.\n\nI had Cholita the Witch\u2019s dreaming fog. When she\u2019s not around it\u2019s not there. When she\u2019s in the house, it is.\n\nIt\u2019s like a fractured purple fog. Tiny pieces have been concentrated.\n\nOn other occasions, it organizes as bars, going at all angles.\n\nBut when Mr. DoubleTake is in charge, it seems to conform to smaller pieces.  I guess Mr. DoubleTake is like staring at a dream phantom. They break up into small pieces.\n\nEach time my head moved slowly left or right and I \u201crecognized\u201d a patch of colors as being unusual, an entire puff of bright purple bloomed from the details, Mr. DoubleTake set the edges on fire, and I had a very vivid scene of people and places.  They were around 3 feet in diameter, at a distance of around 15 feet from me.\n\nThey were like small misshapen monitors floating in front of me in the darkness.\n\nCholita showed up. \n\nOr at least, it seemed to be her at first. But Mr. DoubleTake had pinned her, and burned off the right top of her head.\n\nI saw her now floppy hair, her expensive clothes, and even her entire body. She was struggling a bit, trying to come closer to me on the bed.\n\nBut Mr. DoubleTake had her pinned.\n\nShe left the room on her own, walking out through the closet doors to my right. She was  headed towards the fountain in her garden.\n\nI resumed fishing. And after a few more catches I realized my breathing was now  fully automatic. I had a bit of a hangover from too much wine, but that evaporated and all I felt was the intense bliss of Samadhi.\n\nI hate to use those terms. I'd like to loathe the Hindus as much as the Buddhists.\n\nThat's because I\u2019ve always seen, they keep people prisoner for years with no real progress.  To get donations.\n\nBUT, they say the coolest things!\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing you can do but admit, they know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nI thought about the other kind of fishing technointent and I do. He sees questions asked in other subreddits, and points them out to me. If I can answer it, sometimes I try.  Typically I catch 2 to 10 fish each time.\n\nThe other day he found a subreddit which seems to be populated by ex-fans of Carlos.\n\nBitter ones. They\u2019ve made their own thing. It includes navigating, but you have to hate systems of belief other than physics, in order to fit in.\n\nThey\u2019re really bitter. And maybe they use drugs to explore.\n\nBut I tried fishing over there too. Here\u2019s what I learned:\n\nFormer followers of Carlos who \u201cgave up\u201d, have joined the ranks of the petty tyrants, forever. Don Juan warned us all.\n\nCarlos didn\u2019t like hearing that, and insisted they could always try again.\n\nDon Juan told him, no. If they\u2019ll try again, than they never really gave up in the first place. And that\u2019s ok, they can still try.\n\nBut over there I learned, it\u2019s easy to tell when they really gave up.\n\nThey insult, lie, exaggerate, and insist on proof.  They equate LSD trips with hard work, so that everything seems cheap and common.\n\nThey put out non-sequiturs in order to suppress open conversation, use labels that were pinned on them by other systems, such as \u201cprideful\u201d, and generally repeat their own internal dialogue right before your eyes.  Even worse, they try to embed their own nasty internal dialogue in yours.  A fragment here or there, to make you suffer as they do.\n\nA good example of lying is, \u201cWe all can do those things. They prove nothing. Carlos was a big fraud, and wherever he is he\u2019s laughing his ass off over you.\"\n\nDid you see the lie in there?\n\nOddly, it\u2019s hard to see. It\u2019s buried in a syntactic command.\n\nGive up? \n\nNo. Everyone DOESN\u2019T do those things. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s infuriating that person. He can\u2019t.  And look around.  No one else can too!\n\nIf he could, he\u2019d do what all of you would do. He\u2019d say, \u201cCool!  Can you tell me how you did that?\"\n\nHe\u2019s created a virtual world in his internal dialogue, where what Carlos was teaching is cheap, and easy to get elsewhere.\n\nExcept, it\u2019s not.\n\nAs a fisherman, when you get a stubborn fish you get out the best lure. Put something so tasty on the hook that they can\u2019t resist.\n\nI pointed out that Cholita can violate the laws of physics.  To me that sort of takes away the \"it's all in your head\" argument.\n\nThe response to that is always the same. There\u2019s 3 kinds.\n\n1). Women, or men who took too many drugs, will say: Cool, tell me more details. \n\nAnd they ask for kind of tripy (spaced out) details.\n\nThose are fish you can reel in. Not sure what will happen when you try to fry them, but you can get them. \n\nConsider them like trout. Trout are good. But a Halibut's better.\n\n2). Former Castaneda students who got sad or tired and went elsewhere, but still long for what seemed so true.\n\nThose are the best. It\u2019s the ones don Juan said, didn\u2019t really give up. They can try again.\n\n3). Former Castaneda students who \u201cgave up\u201d and returned to the world of the petty tyrants. You'll find them picking fights at the local bar (chatroom).\n\nThose can be argued with, because you have the truth on your side. Castaneda\u2019s techniques blow anything else away.\n\nBut if you put the tastiest bait on the line, that causality can be violated, they insist on proof.\n\nWhere\u2019s your *proof* **sir**? \n\nCalling people \u201csir\u201d to deride them is a Zen master influence.\n\nI suspect it loses something in the translation from the Japanese. It probably implies \"gaijin\" or such.  But you\u2019ll find it common among Zen master followers who get challenged.  They also like to call you, \"Gentleman\".  Probably a parting gift to show they're compassionate Buddhists. \n\nThe Gentleman class was a \"thing\" in Japan. Likely people you had to honor, because they had lots of cash you wanted. Zen masters always need more cash.\n\nI\u2019m always puzzled by the demand for proof.\n\nWho needs proof that pirates roamed the Caribbean, while riding on that lovely ride in Disneyland?  Can't you just enjoy the ride?\n\nProof?\n\nShould we go to a lab and get someone to hook electrodes to Cholita? Video tape her getting angry and trying to bite someone,  as you have her strapped to a Chinese restaurant table, with dim sum plates in front of her? All filmed with high speed cameras?\n\nProof is the furthest thing from your mind when you\u2019re fishing. You just want to enjoy the lake.\n\nEdited six times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Gone Fishing", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_fj4aa1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1584309704.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1584291018.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night I was continuing to discover if it\u2019s possible to \u201censlave\u201d Mr. DoubleTake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For someone new, Mr. DoubleTake is what I call our tendency to shake off anything we deem impossible, or delusional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for instance, if you\u2019re a sorcerer, you find out there\u2019s all kinds of things out there in the real world, running around in the day, unnoticed.

Castaneda\u2019s techniques blow anything else away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you put the tastiest bait on the line, that causality can be violated, they insist on proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where\u2019s your &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sir&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calling people \u201csir\u201d to deride them is a Zen master influence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect it loses something in the translation from the Japanese. It probably implies &amp;quot;gaijin&amp;quot; or such.  But you\u2019ll find it common among Zen master followers who get challenged.  They also like to call you, &amp;quot;Gentleman&amp;quot;.  Probably a parting gift to show they&amp;#39;re compassionate Buddhists. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Gentleman class was a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; in Japan. Likely people you had to honor, because they had lots of cash you wanted. Zen masters always need more cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m always puzzled by the demand for proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who needs proof that pirates roamed the Caribbean, while riding on that lovely ride in Disneyland?  Can&amp;#39;t you just enjoy the ride?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should we go to a lab and get someone to hook electrodes to Cholita? Video tape her getting angry and trying to bite someone,  as you have her strapped to a Chinese restaurant table, with dim sum plates in front of her? All filmed with high speed cameras?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof is the furthest thing from your mind when you\u2019re fishing. You just want to enjoy the lake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited six times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "f2d3e494-6005-11ea-be90-0ed931fcda17", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "fj4aa1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fj4aa1/gone_fishing/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/fj4aa1/gone_fishing/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1584291018.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fkldlio", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fkl7iiz", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Try to \"feel\" what it was like to see it.\n\nIf you can learn to produce that \"feeling\", you'll see a lot more things.\n\nOr, go outside and take a walk on an asphalt loop, such as around an industrial park.

MIght even make it possible to do without physical darkness.\n\nBut I'd suggest he start while he still has some sight, so that darkness is meaningful and he gets into the routine.\n\nOtherwise, it's a mistake to think you can explain things like he sees, using sorcery.\n\nOr that it can explain anything else!\n\nSorcery is just what the Olmecs created.\n\nIt's not a \"higher\" or more true reality.\n\nTo try to use it to gain something in our normal reality, is usually a fatal mistake.\n\nLet me use a silly example.\n\nYou could create sorcery around a 3 year old girl's tea parties.\n\nIt'll never happen, but if you had nothing but 3 year olds who lived 60 years in that 3 year old mindset condition, and you had tens of thousands of them playing tea party over a period of 5000 years (about the situation with the Olmecs),  each one trying to outdo the others for super exciting tea parties,  and if they weren't brainwashed the way we are to ignore magic, at the end of that 5000 years the children could surely materialize guests all around the table for the tea party.\n\nWhy not, I do it!  At least, I get enough visitors in my darkroom for a good tea party, every single night. Some nights, too many!  They'd run out of tea.\n\nI could probably re-enact \"The Mad Hatter\" tea party, if I wanted to use up a ton of energy over a few years period.  I'd go for Johnny Depp's version of course.  As long as it came with \"The real Alice\".\n\nThe old seers who created our sorcery, did things just as crazy as phantom tea parties.\n\n They did in fact pursue crazy stuff like that over long periods of time.  Don Juan refers to it as \"The old Seer's Aberrations\".\n\nI just call it fun!\n\nThey did crazy things until they perfected them over many years, to get \"creds\" with their buddies I suspect.  A non-destructive competition.\n\nSo those 3 year olds could create a new form of \"sorcery\", and  maybe even cause the table and all the phantom people sitting around it to teleport across the universe to another even nicer place to hang out.\n\nI've moved my bed to a bamboo forest on some planet far away at least twice. \n\nI even tried to get off the bed and walk around, and it hurt the hell out of my foot.  \n\nYou don't want to step on baby bamboo shoots!\n\nThat's all sorcery really is. \n\nCraziness like that.  \n\nThe realization that \"reality\", isn't actually very real.  But that it can be manipulated to your advantage.\n\nThe universes possible out there in the dark sea of awareness don't have to be rational or \"logical\".\n\nAnd there's no \"causality\", solid matter, God, Angels, or anything else you can think of.\n\nThose are just artificial constructs based on humanness, which is only a temporary condition.\n\nSo asking the 3 year old tea party girls to explain your brother's blindness using their \"tea party sorcery\" is not as meaningful as you expect.\n\nAnd it's a big misunderstanding of what sorcery is.\n\nBut the first 4 books were designed to cause that kind of confusion.\n\nWe suffer over it daily in here!\n\nIf you want to help him, read one post after the other until you \"get it\".\n\nBecome an expert on darkroom, even before you have to do it.\n\nIf you read a full 10 posts and most of the comments, you'll start to realize what we do in here.  There's a good 10 or more \"old timers\" in here, who understand everything.    \n\n\nPerfectly. They can even advise people all by themselves.  \n\nIt's not all that complicated. The hard part, is realizing we aren't making it up!\n\nThen you figure out how to help him.\n\nBut I for one am glad I learned darkroom while I still had sight.\n\nMy mom went blind around 92.\n\nSo if I get to live that long, I'll have to face it.\n\nBut if I do go blind, it wouldn't make any difference for practicing pretty fun sorcery.\n\nWhich is what I do half the day.\n\nAnd I'm sure my double's eyes are just fine.  In case I need to have my sight back, to deal with other people in the real world.\n\nYour double can act in the real world!\n\nIt's even possible that all of the sorcerers you read about in Ixtlan, are in their double.\n\nAnd the real copy of them is nowhere near Carlos.\n\nIn fact, that's the actual situation with don Juan and don Genaro.\n\nThose weren't the real copies.\n\nThe Ally Carlos spins with in that book, is shared in this subreddit.  Carlos gave her to his private classes.\n\nWe call her \"Fairy\" now.\n\nIt made her less scary.  When Carlos first introduced us, she had a habit of becoming a very scary demon, ready to harm you.\n\nNot anymore.  I think she's realized, we're on our own. So she shouldn't scare, more than is useful to establish a link.\n\nYour brother could play with her too.", "edited": 1677022088.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j9h7w4f", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could do darkroom blind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see how that would alter it.

At least, I get enough visitors in my darkroom for a good tea party, every single night. Some nights, too many!  They&amp;#39;d run out of tea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could probably re-enact &amp;quot;The Mad Hatter&amp;quot; tea party, if I wanted to use up a ton of energy over a few years period.  I&amp;#39;d go for Johnny Depp&amp;#39;s version of course.  As long as it came with &amp;quot;The real Alice&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers who created our sorcery, did things just as crazy as phantom tea parties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They did in fact pursue crazy stuff like that over long periods of time.  Don Juan refers to it as &amp;quot;The old Seer&amp;#39;s Aberrations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just call it fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They did crazy things until they perfected them over many years, to get &amp;quot;creds&amp;quot; with their buddies I suspect.  A non-destructive competition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So those 3 year olds could create a new form of &amp;quot;sorcery&amp;quot;, and  maybe even cause the table and all the phantom people sitting around it to teleport across the universe to another even nicer place to hang out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve moved my bed to a bamboo forest on some planet far away at least twice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even tried to get off the bed and walk around, and it hurt the hell out of my foot.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t want to step on baby bamboo shoots!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all sorcery really is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Craziness like that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The realization that &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot;, isn&amp;#39;t actually very real.  But that it can be manipulated to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The universes possible out there in the dark sea of awareness don&amp;#39;t have to be rational or &amp;quot;logical&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;causality&amp;quot;, solid matter, God, Angels, or anything else you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are just artificial constructs based on humanness, which is only a temporary condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So asking the 3 year old tea party girls to explain your brother&amp;#39;s blindness using their &amp;quot;tea party sorcery&amp;quot; is not as meaningful as you expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a big misunderstanding of what sorcery is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the first 4 books were designed to cause that kind of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We suffer over it daily in here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to help him, read one post after the other until you &amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Become an expert on darkroom, even before you have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read a full 10 posts and most of the comments, you&amp;#39;ll start to realize what we do in here.

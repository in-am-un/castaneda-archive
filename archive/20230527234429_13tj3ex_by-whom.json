Instead of just dropping smoothly, such as it would if you weren&amp;#39;t attacked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most attacks by humans are aimed at the internal dialogue.  Physical attacks of course, are another matter and should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the assemblage point flutters, moving down slower, it cuts a &amp;quot;wider&amp;quot; path down the middle of the J curve.  Perhaps it &amp;quot;expands what is considered the middle&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you manage to move it as far as the last time, despite an attack by  a petty tyrant, then you get &amp;quot;gifted&amp;quot; by the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With more magic than the last time you moved it that far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, concerns triggered by petty tyrant attacks remain as latent thoughts, even when fully silent and in the purple zone of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you get silent knowledge lectures on the latent thoughts (or concerns).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We perhaps don&amp;#39;t avoid, but rather overcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with TM practitioners (simple mantric meditation) who on reaching bliss try to isolate themselves from any &amp;quot;stress&amp;quot;, so they can try to sustain that miserable state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They become bliss drug addicts, and don&amp;#39;t learn more than how to get to the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly because they were lied to by their &amp;quot;masters&amp;quot; who claimed they&amp;#39;d reach some permanent always happy state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers use the world.   All of it.  And more than the average person by 10000%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t hide from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the process of overcoming petty tyrant attacks, they learn so much more about themselves that they begin to become immune to simple attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_13tj3ex", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13tj3ex/by_whom/jlznkcr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1685307322.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1685307322.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jlz5zxm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Ok-Lengthiness-7613", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jlz13oc", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_9n89tsi8a", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "So there are two situations: either having feelings makes the radiant cover delicious and the flyer eats it, or there is no flyer and having feelings makes the radiant cover disappear.

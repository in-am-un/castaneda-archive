Some day I\u2019ll have my own workshops teaching everyone my own unique understanding of Castaneda, who no one else has \u201cgotten\u201d, and then I\u2019ll finally get the recognition I deserve!\u201d\n\nNO!\n\nPlease\u2026\n\nNot that kind.  We have enough of that sentiment in the Castaneda community.\n\nI mean, they want you to **recognize** them.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter much as what. Demon, Fairy, Ghost.\n\nDisembodied head, like the Krasue.\n\nANYTHING.\n\nPlease, just see them, so you can play together!\n\nThat\u2019s what they want from us.\n\nProblem is, we\u2019ve been brainwashed.\n\nOur parents did a real number on our heads, out of worry we\u2019d grow up to be \u201cweirdos\u201d.\n\nThey stripped all tendencies to pay attention to magic from our souls, and added cookies and sex as a distracting substitute. To keep us in prison, they included the myth of the \u201cclose family\u201d.\n\nOur busy daily lives then took their toll on us, until we\u2019re too tired and senile to fight back.\n\nTo find the magic again!\n\nBut this post isn\u2019t about how to do that. This post assumes you already have.\n\nBut, perhaps don\u2019t realize, there are layers and layers to reality, and we aren\u2019t what we seem to be.\n\nThis is to encourage you to take a closer look when you get a chance.\n\nThe inorganic beings are always on the lookout for humans who can perceive things in the second attention.\n\nThat\u2019s why the 4 gates of dreaming start with finding your hands, and then looking at object after object in the dream, finally returning to your hands.\n\nTo you, it will feel something like this, from inside a dream:\n\nGaze at hands. \u201cWow, kind of distorted! Are those my hands???\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I guess that will have to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m supposed to look at objects. What\u2019s that over there? I recognize it!!! It\u2019s a tree!\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, this is cool. Let\u2019s look to the left. A rock? Yea, that\u2019s actually a rock! So realistic looking\u2026\u201d\n\nAt that instant, you\u2019ve just compelled the inorganics to take notice of you, according to don Juan.\n\nThat\u2019s what they were after! Recognition.\n\nIf you can recognize a dreaming tree or rock, they\u2019ve got wonders for you to see!\n\nYou\u2019ll get your own scout.\n\nThen you ask the scout\u2026\n\nWell, that\u2019s gates dreaming. Everyone knows, I don\u2019t think much of that. It\u2019s a dead end.\n\nYou can do this awake!\n\nOnce you find the puffs of color and redeploy some to make your energy body curious, it comes closer to you.\n\nIn fact, as you practice gazing at colors in darkness you practically drag it along with you.\n\nAnd it\u2019s there ready to help you out.\n\nBut sometimes you have to redeploy that too!\n\nAs you gaze at blobs of color, take a little time to examine the edges closer.\n\nLook for that shimmer don Juan mentioned.\n\nAs you do, you might ask yourself, what am I?\n\nDid you ever ask that?\n\nIt seems, the ancient sorcerers did. They left no rock unturned in their quest.\n\nAnd they went all the way to the bottom of perception.\n\nWhat they noticed there, was a shimmer.\n\nTo understand this, it\u2019s best to define \u201cshimmer\u201d.\n\nAn animation fan can tell you that you need 3 frames, to draw a figure in motion.\n\nYou can\u2019t do it with 2. It just looks like the object is switching back and forth.\n\nThe same is true of a little LED, those tiny electronic lights.\n\nOne light can blink. It can even flicker, if the blinking is fast and random.\n\nBut a single light cannot \u201cshimmer\u201d.\n\nEven 2 leds can\u2019t shimmer. They can blink in or out of sink, but it\u2019s impossible to indicate movement, with just 2.\n\nOnce you have 3, you can shimmer. The light on the far left can light, then go out, and the one in the middle can go on at the same time. Then it can go out, and the one on the far right can come on. It looks like a little glow moved from left to right. And it can go back again, or bounce randomly as long as there\u2019s always 3 changing.\n\nA shimmer is a movement of light along a surface.  It doesn\u2019t have to leave the surface.  It can circle around.  But it has to have an indication of movement, to shimmer.\n\nAs it moves, it defines the surface.  Creates the shape of it.\n\nHumans are complicated beings, but at their most basic level, they \u201crecognize\u201d things.\n\nThey\u2019re awareness encapsulated in a container until death.\n\nAnd first and foremost, they are perceivers.\n\nIf you go shimmer hunting, you\u2019ll be breaking our existence down to the tiniest level.\n\nA tiny sparkle here, the one next to it there, around it moves, and we have a surface.\n\nSurfaces form objects, objects form worlds.\n\nBut down below it all, are those tiny little sparkles of light.\n\nThey\u2019re in everything.\n\nAnd the puffs of color, inorganic beings, and energy seen on horizons which you can find in darkness, are no different.\n\nCarlos told us where to look. Here\u2019s the inspirational quote:\n\n\u201cI found all those hues, or rather I saw glimmers of them whenever items that I encountered in my dreamlike states changed shapes.\u201d\n\nLook for the shimmers on the edges of objects which are changing or moving.\n\nApparently it\u2019s more difficult to see them on a solid looking surface. Perhaps the mind is already caught up in what that thing \u201clooks like\u201d, and isn\u2019t at a deep enough level to see everything happening.\n\nThat\u2019s where your dreaming double is useful. He can walk right up to the thing and gaze down at the microscopic level.\n\nYou won\u2019t be aware of it. It won\u2019t be until later, when you consider what you were viewing, that you\u2019ll realize it wasn\u2019t possible.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like you had a magnifying glass!\n\nIn the picture accompanying this post, you see how puffs of purple can be examined at the edges to find how they are formed.\n\nYou will indeed see that they are built from single sparkles of light, which move all over to give the impression of a larger object.\n\nPlease don\u2019t take those colors too literally. It\u2019s impossible to depict what you\u2019ll see.\n\nBut that\u2019s close.\n\nAfter gazing at puff sparkles for an hour or two (it\u2019s very amusing), I wanted to gaze at something else.\n\nFancy made an appearance. First she tricked me for a while, pretending to be someone else, but finally Bob gave it away.\n\nHe was sniffing around the trash bin. Don\u2019t ask me what an inorganic being wants with trash, but there he was.  In his favorite tuxedo.\n\nI turned to the female head and said, \u201cFancy! I know it\u2019s you\u2026\u201d\n\nShe did a few magnificent face changes, with big hair and accessories, then floated close enough for me to put my hands on her.\n\nI stared deep at one of the edges of her head.\n\nI saw the sparkles there too!\n\nThen I noticed Fancy had stuffed a rag into her mouth.\n\nShe actually made me laugh, for the very first time.\n\nI hope Cholita didn't hear that.  It was an authentic joyous laugh.\n\nCholita would have suspected I had a woman in the room.\n\nThe only thing I could think about the rag  was, Fancy had been watching too many episodes of the original Superman TV series.\n\nCertainly I had.\n\nEver notice that Lois Lane gets gagged and tied up a lot in that show?\n\nAnd they always stuff a (clean) rag in her mouth. Then they tie her anorexic body to a chair.\n\nOr to railroad tracks.\n\nThat\u2019s what Fancy was doing, except maybe she was waiting for someone to tie a rope over the gag.\n\nI supposed, she didn\u2019t like Shimmer Gazing and wanted to play a different game?\n\nDidn\u2019t matter. I was on a roll.\n\nI looked around the room, and realized I\u2019d made it to heightened awareness. There was a whitish light on all of the walls.\n\nUsually I'm bored until I get there!  This time, I hadn't missed it at all.\n\nI had plenty to do along the way, moving my assemblage point through the J curve.\n\nI suspect, shimmer gazing produces micro lateral shifts, which makes each position more entertaining.\n\nI noticed that,  due to heightened awareness, details made from whitish light were forming on the south wall.\n\nSo I used my outreached hand to concentrate it.\n\nIf you slowly drag your flat palm across the whitish light you see, and especially if there are already details, you will concentrate it.\n\nNo need to stick your thumb in the way, the palm will do it. That was simply the only hand picture I had easily available.\n\nOne result of concentrating it is that you\u2019ll create an \u201c*intent* disturbance\u201d.\n\nAnything can come from that!\n\nThe energy on your walls is filled with areas which intersect with other realms.  Inorganic being realms included.\n\nSomething will pop out!\n\nOr, it will remain on the wall, and intensify until it seems to overshadow what you are doing.\n\nJust ignore it, if you want to continue shimmer gazing.\n\nConsider it an intercepted dream, and move on.\n\nForget the little Mexican Indian warrior floating next to your hand.  Those are common.\n\nFancy got so curious about what I was up to that she tried her special \u201cprom look\u201d on me.\n\nShe got me!\n\nI turned to her and said, \u201cYou know I LOVE it when you do that!\u201d\n\nShe smiled.\n\nEdited twice\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Shimmer Gazing",

Creates the shape of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans are complicated beings, but at their most basic level, they \u201crecognize\u201d things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019re awareness encapsulated in a container until death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And first and foremost, they are perceivers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you go shimmer hunting, you\u2019ll be breaking our existence down to the tiniest level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tiny sparkle here, the one next to it there, around it moves, and we have a surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surfaces form objects, objects form worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But down below it all, are those tiny little sparkles of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019re in everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the puffs of color, inorganic beings, and energy seen on horizons which you can find in darkness, are no different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos told us where to look. Here\u2019s the inspirational quote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI found all those hues, or rather I saw glimmers of them whenever items that I encountered in my dreamlike states changed shapes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for the shimmers on the edges of objects which are changing or moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently it\u2019s more difficult to see them on a solid looking surface. Perhaps the mind is already caught up in what that thing \u201clooks like\u201d, and isn\u2019t at a deep enough level to see everything happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s where your dreaming double is useful. He can walk right up to the thing and gaze down at the microscopic level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won\u2019t be aware of it. It won\u2019t be until later, when you consider what you were viewing, that you\u2019ll realize it wasn\u2019t possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s almost like you had a magnifying glass!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the picture accompanying this post, you see how puffs of purple can be examined at the edges to find how they are formed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will indeed see that they are built from single sparkles of light, which move all over to give the impression of a larger object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don\u2019t take those colors too literally. It\u2019s impossible to depict what you\u2019ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that\u2019s close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After gazing at puff sparkles for an hour or two (it\u2019s very amusing), I wanted to gaze at something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy made an appearance. First she tricked me for a while, pretending to be someone else, but finally Bob gave it away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was sniffing around the trash bin. Don\u2019t ask me what an inorganic being wants with trash, but there he was.  In his favorite tuxedo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to the female head and said, \u201cFancy! I know it\u2019s you\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did a few magnificent face changes, with big hair and accessories, then floated close enough for me to put my hands on her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stared deep at one of the edges of her head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw the sparkles there too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed Fancy had stuffed a rag into her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She actually made me laugh, for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope Cholita didn&amp;#39;t hear that.  It was an authentic joyous laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita would have suspected I had a woman in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing I could think about the rag  was, Fancy had been watching too many episodes of the original Superman TV series.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly I had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever notice that Lois Lane gets gagged and tied up a lot in that show?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they always stuff a (clean) rag in her mouth. Then they tie her anorexic body to a chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to railroad tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what Fancy was doing, except maybe she was waiting for someone to tie a rope over the gag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed, she didn\u2019t like Shimmer Gazing and wanted to play a different game?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn\u2019t matter. I was on a roll.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around the room, and realized I\u2019d made it to heightened awareness. There was a whitish light on all of the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually I&amp;#39;m bored until I get there!  This time, I hadn&amp;#39;t missed it at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had plenty to do along the way, moving my assemblage point through the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect, shimmer gazing produces micro lateral shifts, which makes each position more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed that,  due to heightened awareness, details made from whitish light were forming on the south wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I used my outreached hand to concentrate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you slowly drag your flat palm across the whitish light you see, and especially if there are already details, you will concentrate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No need to stick your thumb in the way, the palm will do it. That was simply the only hand picture I had easily available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One result of concentrating it is that you\u2019ll create an \u201c&lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; disturbance\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything can come from that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energy on your walls is filled with areas which intersect with other realms.  Inorganic being realms included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something will pop out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, it will remain on the wall, and intensify until it seems to overshadow what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just ignore it, if you want to continue shimmer gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider it an intercepted dream, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget the little Mexican Indian warrior floating next to your hand.  Those are common.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy got so curious about what I was up to that she tried her special \u201cprom look\u201d on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to her and said, \u201cYou know I LOVE it when you do that!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "if5koq", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 37, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/if5koq/shimmer_gazing/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/if5koq/shimmer_gazing/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1598198128.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g2m8cn3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1598212048.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g2m7en0", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It could be you've already seen this, but just in case you should read this post.

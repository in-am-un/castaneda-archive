By engaging \"muscle memory\" they can help greatly, but only if you can already reduce your internal dialogue to near zero.**\n\n**So Carlos had us use crystals, rocks, silence poles, paper weights,  pinching in various places, the right way of walking.**\n\n**All the stuff he did!  Relentlessly.**\n\n**You can't skip that part!**  What, are you crazy or something???\n\nYou can't pretend they are working.  Because when they do, you end up defying the laws of physics all over the place.  Inorganic beings come to allow you entry to their world.  They teach the way the dreaming emissary does.\n\nYour double comes out to play with you.  (It's) visible!  Fully.\n\nOne pass allows you to switch over to (it) and travel off into fully real looking dream worlds.\n\nLook... No magic, and it's not \"The Magical Passes\".\n\nI've had a few women who didn't want to understand that because it spoils their illusions.\n\nThey came to attack my posts on social media...\n\n... (but) Follow (profiteers and crooks), and you are following the intent of greed and deception.\n\nAnd \"the mastery of intent\" is what sorcery really is.  The intent you pick up, is key to everything.\n\nThat's why we do recapitulation. To clean that link to intent.\n\nSome in the Castaneda community haven't even read all the books and publications of Carlos and the witches, so they don't even know that Carlos told us EXACTLY what to do after he was gone.\n\nAnd yet virtually no one is doing it.\n\nIt's a horrible situation.  And I sure hope the women won't contribute to it. It's bad enough to have to fight back the Armando's, Victors, Miguels, Sergios, Kens, Kachoras, Lujan's, and other thieves robbing our community and making sure no one ever learns any real magic.\n\nBut to have women trying to suppress magic is beyond words awful to me.\n\nRead the publications please!   Silent Knowledge tells you what our goal is.  Readers of Infinity suggests a safer way to experience Silent Knowledge, because there are so many, and some are very confusing.\n\nEach Tensegrity pass was created to hold old seer sorcery.  Carlos created a kungfu like \"system\", to make sure none was lost.\n\nIt's amazing stuff!  Remember in the books when La Gorda did the \"sliding door\" pass, and opened a portal in reality, so that Carlos and her could escape the Allies?\n\nHow about La Gorda's flying technique?  YOU HAVE THAT PASS.  You just didn't know it.  Because you never followed instructions?\n\nDon't you want to do that for real?  You can!\n\nI'm certain one of the passes even allows you to run on the walls of your room, the way the little sisters could.  We just haven't figured out which one yet.\n\nAnd Pablito's 3rd arm he used to tease Carlos?\n\nWe've done that!  More than one person now.\n\nThe instructions are on this very social media.\n\nSo please, don't fight me!  We're trying to save the teachings from the junkyard of fake gurus.  Where the enemies of Carlos have managed to place it. His reputation was completely destroyed  by his enemies....\n\n...As for the Tensegrity, Cleargreen was tasked with preserving it.  Here's a list of the passes for which they have videos. ***(these passes have now been marked*** \u2705 ***in this subreddit's [Tensegrity Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/tensegrity))***\n\nEACH tensegrity move has a \"surprise inside\".\n\nYou can make friends with Stars, for real!  They're sentient!\n\nYou can open portals on your solid wall, and step off into other worlds.\n\nYou can do every single cool thing Carlos wrote about, in the descriptions for the passes.\n\nBut please don't ignore all that so you can go around feeling good about yourself, while not actually ever learning that it all works exactly as Carlos wrote! \n\nFind another way to \"soothe yourself\", and please don't attack real magic because it causes you to realize you haven't been serious all along.\n\nWe have a project going to seek out and recover all passes ever taught by Carlos or at workshops.\n\nWe might even be able to recover all of his lectures, word for word. Even where no one took notes.\n\nThere are MANY tensegrity passes not in this Cleargreen (Home practice) Library.\n\nUsing 3D animations we will reconstruct them, practice them, and show you the \"surprise inside\".\n\nThe unbelievable old seer magical technology hidden in each one.\n\nUpdate: I've been corrected. Some of these Cleargreen long form thumbnail pictures actually represent multiple individual tensegrity forms\n\nPlease listen to me.  EACH ONE of the magical passes, is PRECIOUS!  If you are a fan of \"Grimoires\" as I am, you'd know that TRUE magic books and witchcraft spell books, are very few.  There can't be more than 3 that are real, in existence.  Abramelin being one.\n\nThe entire book of Abramelin is pathetic, compared to a single tensegrity long form.

I can&amp;#39;t show them that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s built into the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It eclipsed all of my previous projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll still try to finish them, but this was too amazing not to spend the rest of the session exploring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how it goes, once you put in enough time to be on the &amp;quot;magic gravy train&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think, the spirit tries to duplicate the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s how sorcery MUST be taught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s a 1000 mile road, not a 10 mile road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s absolutely no time for sightseeing if you want to reach the end destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just get one magic demonstration after the other, each new, with almost no time to try them twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might get away with a second time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or get &amp;quot;half&amp;quot; the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not a third.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That could in fact be the spirit saying, &amp;quot;What, that again...  Ok, go ahead.  I&amp;#39;ll wait.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you try a third night and it says,  &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s too much left to see, I&amp;#39;m not going to allow it this time.  You just have to learn not to dwell on things so long.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get the &amp;quot;magic smackdown&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to accept that you only get what you&amp;#39;re given by an outside force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to worry.  Moving the assemblage point is repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deeper and deeper along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just don&amp;#39;t get to pick what you see there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  yet the further you go, the crazier it gets.

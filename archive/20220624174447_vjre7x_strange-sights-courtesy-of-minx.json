Very Scary!!! ](https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3849f9e18670662a1f3dbd3e19d5ad4a21964577)\n\nThere's something very comforting about the puffs of the energy body, found in darkness through tensegrity,  being transparent and ghost like.\n\nAt first they even follow your gaze, and so they seem to be \"eye junk\".\n\nEventually they become independent to some extent, and move around even if your eyes don't.\n\nAs pieces of your energy body, each one can contain a dream.\n\nOr an inorganic being can \"assist\" you to perceive himself, on top of one of those puffs.  A little face can materialize on the puff.  Or it can even be the full body of an inorganic being, in smaller size.\n\nIf you are able always scoop those out of the air, and use them in a \"puppet show\". The IOBs love that! Just make it walk along going \"up and down\".  Or push them back into the air, blowing on them, and pull them forward towards you, inhaling.  \"Push and Pull\" on them.\n\nThe inorganic beings seek to be \"real\", and for that they need you to tie up some of your awareness, in memories of them.\n\nAt times inorganic beings are also fully capable of walking around like real beings, and can even push a few ounces of weight around in your environment.\n\nEspecially if the object is associated with water.\n\nBut they're still just \"ghosts\".  Not real, and you know that if you turn on the lights they go away.\n\nYou believe all that, because you're in your tonal body most of the time.\n\nMeaning, your physical body, with your physical eyes doing the watching.\n\nThat isn't always going to be the case!\n\nLast night Minx taught me how it can be otherwise. \"Minx\" is one of the two inorganic being Carlos introduced us to just before he died.\n\n\"Fairy\", the other of the two, tended to be helpful to me.\n\nShe created the techniques in this darkroom.\n\nBut Minx stuck with Cholita, only taunting me from time to time over the fact that he only obeyed Cholita.\n\nUntil I started trying to create my own \"permanent\" phantom room in our home.  Right next to the one Cholita created!\n\nMinx taught me \"the three outcomes of the affection pass\", something I've been using as part of a combination of tensegrity moves, to make my phantom room transportation station more real, and to \"restore it\" faster.\n\nI should have known something was  up when I got home and Cholita casually defied the laws of physics. She was even taunting me over it.   She exclaimed, \"You ought to benefit from my physical movements!\".  And she gave me a small show right after she disappeared out the front door of our home,  turning in a circle on the lawn so I could see what she was holding. Except I realized she was still in the kitchen cooking.\n\nAnd yet, the copy of her that went outside was carrying fresh food in it's hands.  She had brought food along, to go outside and walk away into the neighborhood.\n\nNone of it seemed to make any sense.\n\nShe \"split off\" a copy of herself, and went outside to play. Bringing a snack along.\n\nThe problem with Cholita is, she does \"hit and run\" magic demonstrations and there's never any way to know if she intended to do that.  Often there's an inorganic being pulling the strings, or her double, or her tentacle energy body becomes involved.  And you can't figure out if her Tonal body, the one that is completely crazy, is aware of it all.\n\nTrying to ask her is pointless. Death threats follow.\n\nSo when I got into my darkroom to practice, I was already very confused over what was going on with Cholita.\n\nAnd Minx obeys Cholita.  He even told me so.\n\nI used my combinations of tensegrity passes to \"form\" Bubble Station. My phantom room hooked to a 6000 mile long tunnel into south america.\n\nThen I added in \"Affection for the Energy Body\" after forming the phantom room, because I was taught that this would make it easier to perceive at first, until I managed to store more awareness into that phantom structure.\n\nAt the end of the affection pass, perhaps the 2nd time I did it in a row, I felt something odd.\n\nI felt REALLY GOOD, on the last move where you put your arms around the energy body you formed, seemingly to give it a big hug, and then you stand up as you pull it over yourself.\n\nI was hungry!  And not  just hungry. I was beastlike.  Ferocious and voracious at the same time.\n\nI got an image of the \"Kylie fierce stare\". But this was more \"animal like\".\n\nI could still smell Cholita's food from earlier, spicy with chilis and garlic, and it made me realize something very odd.\n\nJaguar's like to hunt best when they are a little bit hungry.\n\nI simply \"knew\" that.  They enjoy the feeling of being voracious, and going off to hunt for a creature to devour.  They especially like the smells of food \"soon to be theirs\".\n\nI also remembered that the old seers did not prefer a \"blue ball of light\" form for their energy body.  That's the form the new seers prefer, because it's \"impersonal\".\n\nThe old seers were shapeshifters!  They liked to transform into a Jaguar.\n\nSometimes the Jaguar was separate from the old seer, and we have jade figurines of that situation.\n\nSometimes they went into their werejaguar form, and even rode off on the back of what looked to be a \"real\" big cat.  Possibly their inorganic being liked to go hunting with them.\n\nIn that case, I realized that the \"energy body\" that resulted from the affection pass could become any of three things.\n\nYou could step off into a real dream at the end of the pass, like my shopping mall.  In a copy of your physical body, made only of purple light.\n\nMy double loves that place, and I've been there dozens of times as a result of doing the pass.\n\nBut you could also simply find yourself in a very \"puffy\" room.  Surrounded by brilliant puffs of color, with little dream scenes inside them.\n\nThe view of the \"puff body\" around you is almost like an \"Ironman\" Suit, where displays on the inside of the suit give you alternate views of the environment.\n\nAnd now I realized the obvious.\n\nYou can also shapeshift using that affection pass!\n\nTricky Carlos warned us about that in his \"Silent Knowledge\" publication when he said that the tensegrity passes come from DEEP in dreaming, and  that the old seers liked the \"feelings\" they generated.\n\nI misinterpreted that as them taking a hit on their equivalent of a Cheech and Chong sized blunt, and enjoying the \"feelings\".\n\nI pictured them saying, \"Wait... I'm peeking!!!  Yes, I can feel it.   I'm turning into a crow!\"\n\nOr something like that.\n\nBut in fact, they could actually shapeshift.\n\nThe \"feeling\" in this case, belonged to a hungry Jaguar.\n\nI'd tapped into it via Silent Knowledge, and it had \"pulled me\" into their 8000 year old dream \"feeling\".\n\nAnd they **craved** it as much as modern man craves his bong.\n\nEven \"feeling\" it just once myself, briefly, I would very much like to feel that again.\n\nI had a chat with a witch over this.\n\nWho informed me she's always suspected the Saber Tooth Tiger form is in fact for shapeshifting.\n\nFYI: The saber toothed tigers were gone by the time the Olmec crossed over Los Angeles.\n\nBut they weren't gone, back when my \"Dream Bubble Station's\" vast transportation complex was in use by \"ancient\" seers.  The Saber Toothed tigers were very much part of those seers lives.\n\nMuch later, hours in fact,  I was scooping puffs with my hands which were now \"fiber hands\".\n\nNo sight of normal hands at all. That picture is the best I could do, but there was no trace of any \"hand shape\" at all, other than the fact that the blob of white fibers was the right size to be a hand.\n\nAnd it had fibers sticking out.\n\nI could scoop the air and \"hook\" stuff, the same as I could scoop and find purple puffs, but now the \"stuff\" I found was more fibers.\n\nEmanations in some micro-bundle form.  With lots of \"twinkling\" among them.\n\nI fact, I could make the air literally \"sparkle\" with white fibers.  Just by pushing my \"fiber hand\" around.\n\nIt was utterly reliable. I could have continued doing that a full hour if I had wanted to.  No chance of it \"fading away\", unless my internal dialogue returned.\n\nI scooped those onto what looked to be a puff in the air, a vague one at that,  and Minx appeared.\n\nHe'd been teaching me for hours as the dreaming emissary, driving me nuts with too much information for me to remember.\n\nThey do that.\n\nI commented to him, \"You like this white fiber stuff?\"\n\nHe got more solid.  I saw some pinkish fur against dull blue grey fur.\n\nIt was REAL!\n\nIt's hard to explain, but a puff of purple light, even when it has a dream scene, does not look \"real\".\n\nAt least, it doesn't look solid.\n\nIt looks like projected light.\n\nThis was a solid puff.  A furry, solid puff, looking very much like a weird poodle's head, if  a hippy owned it and had colored its hair.\n\nExcept it had Minx's face on it, and some horrible distorted dwarf body.\n\nI almost jumped up to  run, but a voice said \"None of this is real.  You know that!  What's to fear?\"\n\nI assumed he was right, while I continued to push whitish fibers into the solid puff that contained Minx, marveling at how stable and clear my \"fiber hands\" had become.\n\nThose are usually a sight you only get to see a little of, as a result of the claw hand movement.\n\nOr Zuleica's pass.\n\nI can't recall what happened after that.\n\nLater I heard Cholita chanting far away, like she was happy.\n\nSomeone had given her work to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Strange Sights Courtesy of Minx", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"rrdqyj8hbl791": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64ebc6778020f34dc1142ab5cb74adfd66175352"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=175477d962b6f885e59a151c8ed059d4bc2f9379"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3783fac6cec50721b5ea12daacbd569d4a95f7e"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd0bec2d75e4494b498bcf020dac040dc8f79c58"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92a0ed570496ea7a5d1523b13e6c1c87974e097f"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd21822d1d32bac620a3d16a63c9d4e358aed401"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3849f9e18670662a1f3dbd3e19d5ad4a21964577"}, "id": "rrdqyj8hbl791"}}, "name": "t3_vjre7x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 31, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/XdIsXyrWFqLSOeFeSDD9yWHtMeqCRQUG182xJrN3q_4.jpg", "edited": 1656092104.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1656085487.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rrdqyj8hbl791.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3849f9e18670662a1f3dbd3e19d5ad4a21964577\"&gt; Minx showing me what a \\&amp;quot;solid\\&amp;quot; puff is like.

I got some new subscribers with incredibly stupid names like \"Florinda Matus Grau\", and so on.  Their facebook pages seemed to link to a whole group of pretenders, making up stuff about sorcery.\n\nSo I used Juann's picture, and a bizarre advanced dreaming experience I had this morning, to shame them a bit.\n\nThat's actually worked on facebook a few times.  People realized what they were doing, and apologized.\n\nAnd \"a few\" is all we need!  Screw the rest!\n\n\\*\\*From Facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Bizarre Nature of Waking Dreaming\n\nIt's important to read ALL of the books, and ALL of the lecture notes if you want the most help along the path of sorcery, as described by Carlos Castaneda.\n\nThe path is not to name yourself, \"Don Juan Donner Grau Luhan Bob Genaro\".\n\nThat's NOT going to teach you any sorcery at all. And if you crave human attention to that extent, it will be IMPOSSIBLE for you to learn real magic.\n\nIf you don't understand why, you need to start reading.\n\nIt has to do with a \"dirty link to intent\".\n\nIntent takes the dark sea of awareness, looks at which emanations currently have some of your awareness in them, and then creates a \"bundle\" for you to perceive as your own \"reality\".\n\nWe want to MOVE AWAY from the reality we're constantly stuck in.\n\nIf you crave other people thinking your pretend sorcery is real, those emanations of \"attention seeking\" are glowing with your very own awareness.\n\nSo INTENT! will see those, and your reality will be stuck at the top of your shoulder blades. Where the assemblage point of normal people is stuck, for their entire lives.\n\nYou can't cheat sorcery! Can't pretend, can't steal from others with your phony book on TOLTEC!!! If you do that, you will NEVER learn.\n\nYou MUST want magic, and only magic, and only that from the books of Carlos.\n\nThe rest out there? Buddhism, Daoism, Hinduism, Kabbalah?\n\nAll fake. Pretend. They stole what they have from 10,000 year old north African Shamanism, but along the way it became so weak, none of those systems can actually do anything at all. It's obvious to see if you just use google.\n\nThey get a mild \"shamanic drumming\" high and have a few miserable visions, while sitting with their eyes closed.\n\nEven a jogger can do that! Get the \"bliss\" of a mild meditation high. It's NOTHING. It will lead to delusion if you wallow in it. You'll be like a \"Zen Master\". Full of delusions and ego, wanting to lord it over monks.\n\nReal magic is nothing like that at all. It's freedom, not slavery to some evil temple system.\n\nSo stick with the Olmec strain of magic, which is 10,000 year old proto-siberian shamanism modified by the populations in Mexico who practiced it unbroken for many thousands of years.\n\nThat magic still works!\n\nAnd read ALL of the publications of Carlos and the witches!\n\nIn the last 3, you'll find out about purple and pomegranate manifestations of color in the air. But also remember the mirror in the river trick, where he saw a violet blob just before seeing an Ally.\n\nOr Zuleica teaching them to find colors in darkness.\n\nOr the Tensegrity!!! It manipulates those blobs of colored light, which are part of your energy body. How much easier would it be to maximize Tensegrity, if you could LITERALLY SEE that energy.\n\nThis man, who drew the picture in this post, uses daylight and silence to make the puffs of color visible.\n\nI like darkness. I get more supernatural visitors, in a dark room. Those are too difficult to perceive in full sunlight.\n\nBut by either path, it's \"Waking Dreaming\".\n\n\"Dreaming awake!\"\n\nSo cool because you don't have to \"wish for it\" for months, trying to find your hands in dreams. That's hopeless!\n\nFor the women, not so much. They can go that sleeping dreaming path, if they follow instructions for the use for the paper weight Cleargreen taught us about.\n\nThey can \"see the layers of dreaming\", which men cannot.\n\nAnd they \"slip through the cracks\" of those layers, while focusing on their womb in silence, and the dark energy it can hold.\n\nBut the men have their own advantages. Their vision of the world is concentrated to a point. For women, it's more like a \"scoop\" taking in everything they can perceive.\n\nBut the men focus down to a tiny point, so they can make a better spear head, or invent better weapons.\n\nThat can be used in darkroom, to move further and further into full on dreaming, but while still awake.\n\nThe results can be BIZARRE! Consider that with 4 gates dreaming, you try to move from inside a dream, to the real world.\n\nHere, in this picture, a sorcerer moves from outside dreaming, in his waking world, and into sleeping dreaming, which \"the double\" controls.\n\nThe bizarreness comes at first, when your own double comes to visit you and help with your tensegrity. If you don't understand that, follow my suggestion and read ALL of the publications. Taisha's latest book from 1996, never published, explains how easy it is to lure the double out with tensegrity.\n\nCholita was given a copy in 1997, but other copies have been scanned in, and you can find a link to that book in the castaneda subreddit.\n\nComing into dreaming from the outside, instead of from the inside as in 4 gates dreaming, produces crazy situations!\n\nThis morning I was in my sleeping dreaming body.\n\nThe one used to do 4 gates dreaming. The ordinary dreams, turned magical because you are lucid.\n\nI was roaming around in a French village, when I smelled something bad.\n\nSome dirty animal.\n\nI walked into a large barn, obviously used to keep horses and cows.\n\nAcross the room I could see a man laying on some thin straw, right over filthy dirt.\n\nBut then, laying in my bed, half asleep, I saw my dreaming double at the doorway to a huge barn.\n\nNeither my double, nor my tonal body, realized what was happening.\n\nUntil my double walked up to the filthy man animal, tapped him on the shoulder and realized, it was HIM!!!\n\nHe was the filthy organic beast. That was his tonal body, in the \"real world\".\n\nThe tonal copy of \"me\" turned to look at him and asked, \"How did you get here into the real world???!\"\n\nThe real thing, real magic, is a lot more fun than a stupid user \"sorcery\" name on facebook.\n\nTry it!\n\nI suppose you can keep the silly name for now, but someday you'll be ashamed of yourself from spreading ignorance around like that. If you learn the real thing.\n\nNo problem.

They can go that sleeping dreaming path, if they follow instructions for the use for the paper weight Cleargreen taught us about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can &amp;quot;see the layers of dreaming&amp;quot;, which men cannot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they &amp;quot;slip through the cracks&amp;quot; of those layers, while focusing on their womb in silence, and the dark energy it can hold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the men have their own advantages. Their vision of the world is concentrated to a point. For women, it&amp;#39;s more like a &amp;quot;scoop&amp;quot; taking in everything they can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the men focus down to a tiny point, so they can make a better spear head, or invent better weapons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That can be used in darkroom, to move further and further into full on dreaming, but while still awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The results can be BIZARRE! Consider that with 4 gates dreaming, you try to move from inside a dream, to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here, in this picture, a sorcerer moves from outside dreaming, in his waking world, and into sleeping dreaming, which &amp;quot;the double&amp;quot; controls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bizarreness comes at first, when your own double comes to visit you and help with your tensegrity. If you don&amp;#39;t understand that, follow my suggestion and read ALL of the publications. Taisha&amp;#39;s latest book from 1996, never published, explains how easy it is to lure the double out with tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was given a copy in 1997, but other copies have been scanned in, and you can find a link to that book in the castaneda subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming into dreaming from the outside, instead of from the inside as in 4 gates dreaming, produces crazy situations!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning I was in my sleeping dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one used to do 4 gates dreaming. The ordinary dreams, turned magical because you are lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was roaming around in a French village, when I smelled something bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some dirty animal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked into a large barn, obviously used to keep horses and cows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Across the room I could see a man laying on some thin straw, right over filthy dirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, laying in my bed, half asleep, I saw my dreaming double at the doorway to a huge barn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither my double, nor my tonal body, realized what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until my double walked up to the filthy man animal, tapped him on the shoulder and realized, it was HIM!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was the filthy organic beast. That was his tonal body, in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tonal copy of &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; turned to look at him and asked, &amp;quot;How did you get here into the real world???!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real thing, real magic, is a lot more fun than a stupid user &amp;quot;sorcery&amp;quot; name on facebook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you can keep the silly name for now, but someday you&amp;#39;ll be ashamed of yourself from spreading ignorance around like that. If you learn the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No problem. Recapitulation can erase that mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium":

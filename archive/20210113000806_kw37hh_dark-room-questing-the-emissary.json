Here's the passage:\n\n\\---\n\n\"For perfect dreaming, the first thing you have to do is shut off your internal dialogue,\" it said to me one time. \"For best results in shutting it off, put between your fingers some two- or three inch-long quartz crystals or a couple of smooth, thin river pebbles. Bend your fingers slightly, and press the crystals or pebbles with them.\"\n\nThe emissary said that metal pins, if they were the size and width of one's fingers, were equally effective. The procedure consisted of pressing at least three thin items between the fingers of each hand and creating an almost painful pressure in the hands. This pressure had the strange property of shutting off the internal dialogue. The emissary's expressed preference was for quartz crystals; it said that they gave the best results, although with practice anything was suitable.\n\n\"Falling asleep at a moment of total silence guarantees a perfect entrance into dreaming,\" said the emissary's voice, \"and it also guarantees the enhancing of one's dreaming attention.\"\n\n\"Dreamers should wear a gold ring,\" said the emissary to me another time, \"preferably fitted a bit tight.\"\n\nThe emissary's explanation was that such a ring serves as a bridge for surfacing from dreaming back into the daily world or for sinking from our daily awareness into the inorganic beings' realm.\n\n\"How does this bridge work?\" I asked. I had not understood what was involved.\n\n\"The contact of the fingers on the ring lays the bridge down,\" the emissary said. \"If a dreamer comes into my world wearing a ring, that ring attracts the energy of my world and keeps it; and when it's needed, that energy transports the dreamer back to this world, by the ring releasing it into the dreamer's fingers.\n\n\"The pressure of that ring around a finger serves equally well to ensure a dreamer's return to his world. It gives him a constant, familiar sense on his finger.\"\n\nDuring another dreaming session, the emissary said that our skin is the perfect organ for transposing energy waves from the mode of the daily world to the mode of the inorganic beings and vice versa. It recommended that I keep my skin cool and free from pigments or oils. It also recommended that dreamers wear a tight belt or headband or necklace to create a pressure point that serves as a skin center of energy exchange. The emissary explained that the skin automatically screens energy, and that what we need to do to make the skin not only screen but exchange energy from one mode to the other is to express our intent out loud, in dreaming.\n\nOne day the emissary's voice gave me a fabulous bonus. It said that, in order to ensure the keenness and accuracy of our dreaming attention, we must bring it from behind the roof of the mouth, where an enormous reservoir of attention is located in all human beings. The emissary's specific directions were to practice and learn the discipline and control necessary to press the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth while dreaming. This task is as difficult and consuming, the emissary said, as finding one's hands in a dream. But, once it is accomplished, this task gives the most astounding results in terms of controlling the dreaming attention.\n\nI received a profusion of instructions on every conceivable subject, instructions that I promptly forgot if they were not endlessly repeated to me. I sought don Juan's advice on how to resolve this problem of forgetting.\n\nHis comment was as brief as I had expected. \"Focus only on what the emissary tells you about dreaming,\" he said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Dark Room Questing: The emissary", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"9cnejwhscza61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9cnejwhscza61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e082d4f9a2f149aba17888765897ed40735505d"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9cnejwhscza61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f3ebf981d1ef1cd8e8a0a447c06088bce74fa8"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9cnejwhscza61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c80af5a5a6c4bf14502fc01af26795f7e614182"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9cnejwhscza61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3879f2c1b8dfb10474e320e35c146a6edd4156f7"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9cnejwhscza61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3938e6c729d5b03255dc9813ed8ef8cfe78c9a7"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9cnejwhscza61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dd1f8a4278c04640c627d43e120cc2ecef5a5fc"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9cnejwhscza61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41dc0280ef266b52eceed7e070f5f80f33d2b36c"}, "id": "9cnejwhscza61"}}, "name": "t3_kw37hh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/j-44jzWhbi5x5cNLEBGY3EkutsWwqyVcFWrd7zft49Q.jpg", "edited": 1610493686.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610492886.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9cnejwhscza61.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41dc0280ef266b52eceed7e070f5f80f33d2b36c\"&gt;Everyone who continues dark room gazing will discover things to investigate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first in the darkroom you are highly dependent on &amp;quot;intent gifts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And on the energy released as the assemblage point moves further and further, finding new and unused positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It almost seems like you only get to do the same thing once, or perhaps twice with the second time being less vivid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know when this changes, but it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could be that you learn what exactly is repeatable, and what is not.

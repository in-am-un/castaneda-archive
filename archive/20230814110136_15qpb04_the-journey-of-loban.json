I've heard that name before.\n\n\\*\\*\\* From ChatGPT \\*\\*\\*\n\nTo ChatGPT:\n\nCould you theorize for me?  Let's say a Daoist Kungfu sorcerer came from China in a trading ship. We don't know what variety, it could even be Dutch. But Chinese too. He traveled to Mexico, in the 1600s.  Would he have most likely come from Hong Kong, going to Mexico City?  I've seen some statues in Mexico City of Chinese historical figures.\n\nChatGPT:\n\nYour scenario presents an intriguing blend of historical fact, myth, and speculation. While the concrete documentation of a Daoist Kungfu sorcerer from China visiting Mexico in the 1600s is nonexistent (to the best of my knowledge), the broader aspects of your premise, such as maritime trade, Chinese diaspora, and cross-cultural exchange, offer fascinating avenues for exploration. Let's dissect the scenario:\n\n1. **Origin of the Daoist Kungfu Sorcerer**: If we were to pick a port of departure in the 1600s, Guangzhou (also historically known as Canton) would be more probable than Hong Kong. In the 1600s, Guangzhou was the primary port for the maritime Silk Road and a central hub for trade between China and the rest of the world.\n2. **The Vessel and Route**: The mention of a Dutch ship is not entirely out of place. The Dutch were active in maritime trade in the 17th century, including routes that connected Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Chinese junks (large ships) were also known to travel far and wide, though primarily within the Asian region. If our hypothetical sorcerer sailed on a Dutch ship, it's plausible he could have traveled from China to the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), and from there, across the Pacific, possibly to the Spanish colonies in the Americas.\n3. **Mexico as a Destination**: Mexico, particularly Acapulco, was a significant part of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade that lasted from the 16th to the 19th century. This trade connected the Spanish colonies in Asia (primarily the Philippines) and the Americas. Goods, people, and ideas traveled along this route. If a Chinese individual ended up in Mexico during the 1600s, the galleon trade route would be the most probable explanation. While most Chinese migrants in this period were recorded in the Philippines, it's not entirely impossible for some to have traveled further to the Americas.\n4. **Chinese Historical Figures in Mexico**: By the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a more pronounced Chinese presence in parts of Mexico due to migration during that period. The statues you've seen might be connected to this later wave of Chinese migration. Alternatively, they could be a modern homage to the diverse influences and peoples that have shaped Mexico over the centuries.\n5. **Daoism and Mesoamerican Beliefs**: If we're to play with the notion of a Daoist Kungfu sorcerer, it would be fascinating to imagine the potential cultural and spiritual exchanges between Daoist beliefs and Mesoamerican indigenous religions. Both traditions have rich cosmologies, understandings of balance, and reverence for nature. A blending or mutual appreciation of these spiritual traditions would make for an exciting narrative.\n\nWhile the specifics of your scenario might be more rooted in fiction than fact, the broader strokes touch on real historical connections and migrations that shaped the early modern world. It also offers a rich tapestry for imagining \"what ifs\" and the myriad ways cultures have intersected and influenced one another over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Journey of Loban", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 106, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"uiwsiajwj1ib1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ba1e4deaf68161e4a9620eeae612c82756b604"}, {"y": 163, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a27f32734de68075be8465db4204e815592d298"}, {"y": 242, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c52f6b30d469d9091e946211b98bf44a53b270"}, {"y": 484, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96628646ad946d9746215b46e40e32c139f51e06"}, {"y": 726, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2f3301cb8eb543658eda6173664fd42395914d6"}, {"y": 817, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fcefa9b55f9bfc7e7993bcaab92d549b84cab14"}], "s": {"y": 1210, "x": 1598, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=1598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622d4b83d009f1417e69630245ee065832d6718b"}, "id": "uiwsiajwj1ib1"}, "cfoe69a9n1ib1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 50, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cfoe69a9n1ib1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81ef245c7557af7c21e09f80c1fde787d4fb28ef"}, {"y": 100, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cfoe69a9n1ib1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94c45b15862c7be2d3162ed61d04fb0a4f3f8914"}, {"y": 148, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cfoe69a9n1ib1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0bc9daa396b58c87b68072a7e04251bfea6c91"}, {"y": 296, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cfoe69a9n1ib1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25061a39fcf85ccaae6e7a165b166c983693136a"}, {"y": 445, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cfoe69a9n1ib1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b76c5248c6258405bd11221371d73606922a7c04"}, {"y": 500, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cfoe69a9n1ib1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2396f060dd02950be68c571e270fb998627477be"}], "s": {"y": 1211, "x": 2612, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cfoe69a9n1ib1.jpg?width=2612&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb2360cb28cfdd8a35b7201e5504942f3c7fa07"}, "id": "cfoe69a9n1ib1"}}, "name": "t3_15qpb04", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/byWQUTIHT-I3z95J_1YNNre7BQSmyyQ5OiszUUSqi6E.jpg", "edited": 1692004955.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1692003696.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=1598&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=622d4b83d009f1417e69630245ee065832d6718b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/uiwsiajwj1ib1.png?width=1598&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=622d4b83d009f1417e69630245ee065832d6718b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was all over asia a decade or so back, and at one point the Allies of Carlos decided to push me into heightened awareness, and blackmail me to try to fix this mess in the Castaneda community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point, they pulled me into the entry way to the inorganic being&amp;#39;s world.

Or even the little human face (yours) that will become visible above the clouds of colored light, as you get more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; the clouds spread down, obeying your hands.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, obeying your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that &amp;quot;your command becomes the Eagle&amp;#39;s Command&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s intending to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you CANNOT be intending to become famous, get your own little franchise and steal money from people based on your mistaken sorcery knowledge in fake books on the topic, you can&amp;#39;t believe you can bully others to accept your lies about &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; or whatever you have been making up in your mind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to dominate chat groups and social media for what can only be a hellish imaginary purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to ONLY want to really, truly learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have visions of people adoring you, you screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want a little Buddhist throne to sit on, you&amp;#39;re doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to be &amp;quot;intending&amp;quot; something so bizarre, namely to follow the path of the 8000 year old seers, that you really can&amp;#39;t even tell other people about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the absolute opposite of attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because attention seeking is ALSO &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the intent to stay where you are, but try to climb above the heads of the other prisoners of the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To profit by climbing up on their backs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be the &amp;quot;Dali Lama&amp;quot; parasite living off the hard efforts of others while pretending you can lift them up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With ALL of you still stuck in the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used to describe the bad men such as Miguel, Victor, or Ken as &amp;quot;riding on his back like a monkey&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s impossible to learn any real sorcery at all, with those motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re looking for a &amp;quot;franchise&amp;quot;, get a Del Taco.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery isn&amp;#39;t franchisable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it CAN be &amp;quot;intended&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15qpb04/the_journey_of_loban/jw4dr6l/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1692008649.0, "media_metadata": {"m1fxk1hgx1ib1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1fxk1hgx1ib1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71ec396201831f0ceb8136037e9bd32e2444fe17"}, {"y": 120, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1fxk1hgx1ib1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0fae277f4b78a537fbdb21a2c2102a1610665cd"}, {"y": 178, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1fxk1hgx1ib1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9cbc584fda1c35a42f2d4bb71c5fe585173fe63"}, {"y": 357, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1fxk1hgx1ib1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdcb19aad22ef75be7f677f229fbeff62a0afa15"}, {"y": 535, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1fxk1hgx1ib1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4a6d1e4a5f6aa375d44891033c14e1a1d1fe157"}, {"y": 602, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1fxk1hgx1ib1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d32468eb29f23262d7f76ece65229edc7bb2d79"}], "s": {"y": 819, "x": 1467, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1fxk1hgx1ib1.jpeg?width=1467&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=482de64c96fd3e958a793f1124544972d77b85a7"}, "id": "m1fxk1hgx1ib1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_15qpb04", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 19}}], "before": null}}]

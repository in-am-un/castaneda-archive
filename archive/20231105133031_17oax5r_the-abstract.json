It ends up with multiple meanings.\n\nDuring darkroom, it goes like this:\n\nPuffs, shift below, whitish light, energy body, the Abstract, Silent Knowledge.\n\nCarlos actually told us that was the sequence, although you'd have to see it with your own eyes to notice he was quite \"linear\" in that explanation.\n\nHe didn't like doing that at all. But towards the end he became more willing to describe things to us, hoping it would motivate us to put in some real work.\n\nHe gave us specific goals.\n\nFor instance, he described \"The Whorl\".\n\nA slowly rotating smear of purple color with jet black swirling around with it just above the horizon, the blackness eating up the edges of the purple.\n\nLike a Yin/Yang symbol at times, although don't expect that to stick around. It just seems to be in the back of our mind as something where the blackness eats up the light.  A negative side effect of accumulating Eastern \"inventory items\".\n\nOn the edge where the dark consumes the light a pomegranate dot will materialize and text will spit out.\n\nBut elsewhere he described a purple smear in the sky.\n\nAnd many times he described reading entire pages of text, floating in the air.\n\nSuch as \"Reading off the Wall\".\n\nHe also read lecture notes from his palm, which didn't seem to be there to anyone else who snuck a peek.\n\nPoint being he DID NOT like to describe specifics, perhaps for the reason that he explained our seeing at first is dominated by \"prefaces\".\n\nYou see something and want to describe it to another person, so you figure out what it \"looks most like\" and say it was that.\n\nWhen it really wasn't.  But what can you do?\n\nAnd in so doing you fix it as \"that\" in your memory of the event.\n\nWhen the actual goal of a sorcerer is to see \"Energy as it flows in the universe\".\n\nTo allow the abstract to remain abstract.\n\nMuch less fun if you ask me...\n\nSo his last books, his \"how to\" books, were filled with specifics he wouldn't have wanted to give out in the past.\n\nHe was hoping that dangling the carrots in front of our noses would cause us to pull on the cart and do some work.\n\nWe're really fortunate he did that, not because getting specifics is better.\n\nIt's not!\n\nBut with no teacher around, specifics are NEEDED.\n\nOtherwise, everyone will just make up their own idea of what progress is, and we'll end up with a Hari Krishna Segment of the Castaneda fan base.  \n\nIn fact that may already be the case, depending on how you look at things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What could have happened to

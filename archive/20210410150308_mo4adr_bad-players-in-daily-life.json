Some is a practical matter. It's hard to zip into another reality, when daily worries are holding you to this reality.\n\nMost of that is internal dialogue.\n\nBut not all of it.\n\nThere's also the secondary issue of whether you can speak about what you experienced,  with others who have not.\n\nCarlos faced that often. And he discovered what you will all discover if you keep going.  You'll find that after battling to experience things outside our normal reality, and finding wonders there, you'd like to help others learn about it.\n\nIt's just too wonderful!  And if you could have others also doing the same, you could improve both their situation, and yours.\n\nIt's important to have a little company when exploring the unknown. I often worry that's the big flaw in this subreddit.  It's no substitute for a lineage.\n\nIf you could share, and motivate others so that you gain a little company along the way, it would be good for everyone.\n\nBut you can't.  There are rules about what is allowed to exist, and they are strongly enforced at this level of reality.  Only small deviations are permissible.\n\nThis isn't entirely as obvious as it sounds.  What we're discussing here are the \"skimings\" of emanations at this position of the assemblage point, which can be allowed to glow and still maintain this version of reality.\n\nWe only use a tiny fraction of emanations available at this position, and in order to maintain our perception of them, others must be de-emphasized.\n\nThere's almost a primal need to force the others away, in order to prevent chaos.  Some unused emanations might be compatible, or even enjoyable in small doses. Everyone loves a good ghost story.\n\nBut chaos is threatening.\n\nAnd so for example, when you read the books of Carlos the deviations are exciting, and make you feel good and optimistic.\n\nBut when you hear a story told by Carol about her experiences with Carlos in the second attention, or if you got a chance to hear Carlos lecture, where he was not being as guarded, the stories are disturbing.\n\nThey branch off into the \"Is he making that up?\" realm.\n\nThe only fix for that problem, assuming Carlos had lived and continued to teach, would be for some practitioners to rise to that level, and  have their own \"disturbing tales of power\".\n\nBut no one rose at all!  The entire community failed to learn.\n\nIf you want to understand what went wrong with the Castaneda community so that it was rid of magic and replaced with endless dominating social media  and book authors fighting for attention, you need look no further than any hobby or activity you enjoy, which involves others working along side others.\n\nYou see bad players there also.\n\nWe tend to call it \"competitiveness\".  But in fact, that's not quite right.\n\nThe bad players aren't using competition to improve their skills, but rather to get more attention for themselves.  It's not that they actually want to be the best.   In most activities, the \"best\" person tends to become a little humble and helpful, rather than aggressive and derisive.\n\nBasically, what the bad players want is more attention from mommy or daddy.  Something went wrong in their childhood, and they've become obsessed with a never ending search for self-validation, but through their perceived view of the opinion others have of them.\n\nIn a given hobby, you see this more when you are doing well at your hobby.  You get noticed by the bad players, who are constantly rating everyone in their little hobby group, to see who they have to \"conquer\", to be seen as the best.\n\nThis isn't usually a bad thing. For example, in martial arts there's a lot of that type of competition going on, and it tends to cause people to work harder.\n\nIn the sports world, the players enjoy having \"the best\" on their team, because it adds side interest to playing, even if they themselves can't be that guy at the top of the team.\n\nIt doesn't really matter what type of hobby or activity we are talking about, there are always \"bad players\" in there.  The ones more concerned about other's opinions, than the thing they are doing.  It happens even at work, in both factory and office settings.\n\nThe lack of magic in people's lives causes them to seek unhealthy attention as a replacement.\n\nAnd in general, it's not necessarily a bad thing because it increases the overall skill levels of the activity, when averaged out over a long time.\n\nBut with sorcery, it's fatal.  A death blow to learning.\n\nSorcery is off the Island of the Tonal.  While attention seeking is entirely on it.  Not only is attention seeking firmly attached to the Island of the Tonal, but it's like a drug addiction to the worst aspects of it.\n\nAnd attention seeking is infectious.  It will infect even those sincerely interested in the activity.\n\nBecause even if a person is sincerely interested in the activity, the attention seekers in the group will create false narratives, designed to raise their own status level at the expense of someone else.\n\nThe false narratives can either build up another person in the group, as being on path that should be watched so you can enjoy their glory, or they create a narrative to show that person is failing, and doing wrong.\n\nThe false narrative is always built on attention seeking, and can't help but drag people who want to be focused only on the activity, into the same mud of attention seeking.\n\nIt's important to recognize that attention seeking can be indirect.  A person might want to convince others they are the best at something. But when that's not an option for them, a bad player will select a proxy, another person, and build them up in the eyes of others, becoming their \"spokesman\".\n\nA troublesome mom can do this.  That's perhaps one of the most obvious examples.\n\nEspecially when there's some mental illness involved.\n\nFor example, a schizophrenic mom hears that her daughter was in consideration for some award, and starts passing around the rumor that she's a sure bet to get it.  She gets on the phone to spread rumors with her new \"good news\", while taking care of boosting her own power in her social circle.\n\nShe creates a false narrative, mostly not because of the thing itself, for instance the award, but because she has to constantly work to uphold her imaginary self image in her social circle, and she needs an excuse to bother everyone on the phone.\n\nIf fit turns out the award doesn't pan out the mom is slightly humiliated in her own mind, and will get back on the phone to try to repair her reputation.  Perhaps she spreads the rumor that she was lied to.\n\nAnd so the next time that daughter attends a family gathering, she has others looking at her as if she tends to lie.\n\nIt's a big mess out there on the Island of the Tonal,  a fussy swamp of bad players.\n\nEach one essentially, trying to \"steal energy\" from others.\n\nThat's really what we see when we examine bad players from an analytic point of view.\n\nThey are trying to steal energy.\n\nWhen a new bad player comes in this subreddit and only notices the real magic being learned here as a sign this place is more important than other places, rather than as something they want to put some effort into, and then begins to post their own understanding (which is basically zero), they are simply trying to steal energy.\n\nWhen confronted they create false narratives, designed to slander the person who confronted them.\n\nAnd there's the harm.  The false narratives are \"sticky\". They constitute what Carlos used to call, \"Syntactic Commands\".\n\nA command to remain on the Island of the Tonal and protect your idea of self, or you will lose status with others.\n\nWhat's the practical harm from this?\n\nIf you find a passage off the Island of the Tonal, you will have to unhook some false narratives in order to make use of it.\n\nYou'll have to get more experience with that in the darkroom to understand what that feels like in practice.\n\nA good example might be the case of La Gorda and Josefina learning darkroom gazing from Zuleica.\n\nCrazy Josefina found her colors and zipped right into them, presumably vanishing into the second attention, in her energy body.\n\nBecause Josefina was crazy, she couldn't feel as involved in the false narratives and competition around her.  She was too damaged to care about a fine detail, like her \"reputation\".\n\nShe had nothing to hold  her back.\n\nCholita is the same way.  I'm constantly amazed at the things she can do, none of which would be noticed by anyone who was not a sorcerer. But Cholita doesn't care.\n\nIn contrast to Josefina,  La Gorda was all about reputation and how others thought of her.  She was able to overcome that for the most part, but she couldn't simply zip into the first colors she found, because she was firmly tied to the Island of the Tonal, by the concerns of daily living.\n\nThere are however, ways to attack the barriers we face, indirectly.\n\nIt's back to that idea of things you can experience with sorcery, but cannot share because they are simply not allowed on the Island of the Tonal.\n\nAnything which is too far out for Mr. DoubleTake to notice or understand, is relatively free from those magical barriers.\n\nThe problem then becomes,  they are also nearly impossible to remember.\n\nThey are \"invalid\".\n\nCarlos did some teaching at that level but so far we haven't  uncovered any of it.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Bad Players in Daily Life", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_mo4adr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1618060317.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1618059788.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of thing you notice more and more, when you break down the wall between the first and second attention.

This post contains much revelations that help understand bad players but also a LOT of human behavior (that I personally often found very confusing, maybe because of my autism).\n\nA bit lengthy but here is a portion of a paper I wrote for my \"motivation and self-regulation\" class couple of years ago that may be of interest to few here, as I believe it illuminates what is going on with bad players and much of our own behavior in a bit more detail.\n\n\nNeed for Self-Esteem.\n\nNeed for self-esteem is defined as a motivation to have a stable, firmly based and positive evaluation of the self. This need further gives rise to three broad supporting motivations. The first set aid the construction of the self and self-guides, this encompasses the need for attachment, understanding, and self-expansion. The following set of motives concerns with stability of self-evaluations, this includes need for belonging, self-enhancement, self-validation as well as self-preservation. The final set of motives arises from stable negative evaluation of self and primarily creates a need for self-dissolution.\n\n\nConstructing a Positive Evaluation of Self\n\nInitially, social organisms don\u2019t have a coherent sense of self, and thus are motivated to form attachments to caregivers. This begins the socialization process, through interaction with caregivers, an organism learns what is \u201cright and wrong\u201d and acquires guides that dictate desired and undesired states of self. The organism then begins constructing the self-according to these guides by interacting with the world, gaining further knowledge and competence. Through a feedback mechanism it also begins to acquire aspects of self-knowledge such as self-efficacy. As the organism perceived self becomes more in line with the socialized image of the self, positive evaluation of self emerges. Because, the self is socially constructed, self-evaluations correspond to organisms\u2019 value within the social context they were raised in. Thus the motivation to attain a positive self-evaluation increases the fitness of the social group the organism is part of.\n\n\nMaintaining a Stable Positive Evaluation of Self\n\nBy its very nature the perception of the self is volatile. An organism may possess the perception of self-efficacy and self-worth, and they may even have value to society, but without actively defending, reinforcing and validating the self the stability of positive self-evaluation is in jeopardy. \n\nThreats to stability can come from incongruent information, such as those indicative of incompetence. Likewise exposure to inconsistent self-guides, can pose a major threat, a property that is valued within one culture maybe worthless in another, and thus can have a profound effect on one\u2019s self-evaluation. Similarly, existential threats can render self as worthless by exposing its virtual nature. One key mechanism by which stability is achieved is through the need for belonging, whereby the organism affiliates and reinforces self-guides existing self is based on, effectively validating and stabilizing the perceived positive evaluation of self. Alternatively, the organism may stabilize their positive evaluations of self by proving their value to themselves and to society by expanding action in self-congruent ways.\n\nHowever, various form of validation are not always possible, and may actually be detrimental to self-stability. Instead, an organism may opt out of action and avoid the potential for negative evaluation, by justifying inaction to extraneous sources in a feat of self-handicapping. Because of flexibility of perception, stability can be maintained by distorting the self or self-guides. In distorting the self, an organism may overestimate their competence, knowledge, social status and importance, while downplaying their inadequacies.  Alternatively, the organism may downplay others` competencies, or be subject to false consensus bias, normalizing ones level of worth to a new distorted standard.\nSince self-evaluations reflect values that have correspondence to the values of contextual social fabric, organisms who have positive evaluations of self, gain a sense of self-importance. High self-importance, and thus are motivation to preserve the self physically, this means that the organism continues being motivated to increase their fitness, feel and act as they are more deserving of resources than others of perceived lower importance, and may even be willing to sacrifice the lives of other to save themselves. The motivation to physically preserve positive perception of the self is mirrored in expressions such as \u201chaving something worth living for\u201d. This conceptualization is reverse of TMT, which states that self-esteem sub serves self-preservation, instead self-esteem motivates self-preservation in conditions when positive self-evaluations are possible or possessed.\n\n\nDissolving the Self\n\nPositive self-image cannot always be effectively constructed, likewise defense mechanisms and other biases and distortions of reality can only go so far to buffer the declining or negative perceptions of self. When an organism has a perception of a stable negative evaluation of the self, they are motivated to deal with the evaluative component itself, the only aspect of the process they have control over. In common cases only a part of the self is affected, and thus the organism may try to forget, deny, or ignore the negative evaluation, perhaps by regulation attention such that stable positive aspects of the self are in awareness. However in extreme cases, compartmentalization may result in multiple identities. Likewise, dissociation from reality can serve as a coping mechanism. Endogenous dissociation may not always be possible thus an organism can turn to chemical agents that have similar effect such as alcohol, or highly euphoric substances such as heroin or cocaine. An organism may try to directly cease the experience of the self and the associated self-evaluation processes by engaging in meditative practices.\n\nAlterative way to eliminate the negative evaluation the self may choose to terminate itself, effectively dissolving the self and evaluative processes associated with it. Although, this behavior is obviously maladaptive to the organism in most cases, especially in modern day, it may have reasonable evolutionary roots. Given that, social self is constructed based on social value, accurate self-evaluations correspond to contributing value an organism has to the survival of the group. Thus when resources are scarce, negative self-evaluations, reflect a burden on society and a risk to organisms kin and progeny. If such evaluations are correct, suicide can improve the fitness of the tribe, creating a strong selective pressure to favor groups of organisms who are willing to commit suicide when it is appropriate.\n\nFinal way to cope with stable negative self-evaluations is to transcend the self. To transcend the self as it was socially constructed. Thus organisms may for example adopt a belief of a higher power a notion of an all loving god, whereby the presumed judgment from god trumps the existing self-guides. The organism may again come to understand the illusory nature of the self and attain a sense of interconnectedness with the environment that gives different meaning to existence, perhaps highlighting the absurdity of suffering because of shortcomings in pursuits that are a construct of society.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gu5nn68", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are absolutely right.

You have to get that out of your head!\n\nYou can only follow the path of the old seers.\n\nThen the very thing that creates our reality, *intent*, will begin to select the same emanations the old seers were using.\n\nIt's a phantom copy of reality!  Not a skill you can learn to enter a trade!\n\nIt's essentially a bundle of emanations. The ones the ancient Olmecs put energy into.\n\nAnd it functions as a bundle, not as pieces.\n\nWith Tai Chi, you'll get old fart Chinese emanations, which have been used to cheat people.\n\nLook...\n\nThe wushu master of all of china lost in a fight to a  middle of the road MMA guy, in 10 seconds.  If anyone has the link, post it. Even if people have seen this before, they need to see it again.\n\nThen another famous Chinese master lost in 3 seconds.  Someone sent me that video when they heard me mention the original.\n\nVideos are easily available on Youtube for this sort of thing.\n\nAnd Tai Chi is in no way a better fighting system than Wushu.\n\nIf there was a \"master\", he'd lose in 2 seconds.\n\nAs for their philosophy, it's just Chinese garbage.\n\nThey have a 4 character poetry system, which gives you the ability to understand what \"feels wise\".\n\nThe Chinese don't fall for it. They grew up with that.\n\nJust like we don't fall for TV preachers who heal on TV.\n\nBut Koreans do. It's outside their culture, so they often copy crazy american TV preachers.\n\nAs for \"Chinese philosophy\", only westerners are that gullible.\n\nIt's just more trinkets for sale in China.\n\nBut if  people would just look around, and insist on seeing a place like this, with people actually learning, which they could see with their own eyes, they could avoid being tricked by all systems out there.\n\nDon't buy the horse until the owner parks it in front of your face.\n\nWhy shouldn't he???\n\nShouldn't Buddhists be able to teach nearly everyone, the powers the Buddha had?\n\nWhy not?  How about even 1/4th?\n\nThey can't even do that.\n\nWhen buying a horse, you don't hand the guy your money and be ok with him promising to return with your horse in a few hours!\n\nAnd without even asking the community if that guy can be trusted to deliver you a horse?\n\nI almost think no one ever actually believes in magic, and merely has sinister plans to cheat others the same way they believe their \"system\" is cheating them.\n\nThere's so many things like that in this misunderstanding of how you learn, that I can't even begin to label them all.\n\nI could try to analyze those \"systems\" and point out the flaws.\n\nBut I'd never find them all!\n\nAnd we don't have to.\n\nOur reality is made from the emanations, skimmed by intent.\n\nThere's NOTHING else.\n\nSo every bad aspect of believing you can learn sorcery using something else, is covered by simply doing your best to precisely copy the intent of the ancient seers of Mexico.\n\nIt's why Carlos repeated that over and over in his final books.\n\nYou hook to it, and it pulls you.\n\nMy success in darkroom is for no other reason than, nothing else is hooked to me.\n\nOnly that intent.\n\nI get offers to make huge amounts of money from time to time.\n\nI can only tell them, money doesn't interest me anymore.  It's too low of a payment compared to magic.\n\nLikewise, it's a horrible misunderstanding to think you can learn sorcery with power plants.\n\nIt's so clueless, I worry about someone who believes that.  Keep an eye on your wallet for starters.\n\nFirst, it doesn't agree with the books in any way.\n\nIt ignores the actual situation.\n\nLittle Smoke and Devil's Weed taught Carlos. Not the power plants.\n\nAnd as don Juan said, Little Smoke is not in the power plant.\n\nIn fact, she's only called that because of how she looks in daylight.\n\nLike a golf ball sized puff of smoke.\n\nThe power plants were just so Carlos could see her.   You have to at least be in the green zone to do that.\n\nAND, you have to have the actual entities.\n\nA random entity won't do it.  Little Smoke and Devil's weed have been teaching Olmec sorcery for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.\n\nA random IOB won't hook you to the right emanations. It's not to their advantage.\n\nAnd also the power plants were to keep Carlos distracted.  So he wouldn't notice the secret training going on in heightened awareness. That leaves time anomalies a completely sober person would notice.\n\nAnd finally, don Juan used those because Carlos asked for those for his PhD thesis.\n\nIt was the only way for don Juan to keep him around.\n\nAt the very same time,  while consuming the power plants, don Juan and Silvio Manuel were teaching him in heightened awareness.\n\nHow come fake sorcerers always forget that part?  Or ignore it.\n\nHe didn't need those power plants at all. The other apprentices got very little, to none.\n\nAnd drugs don't provide any insight into sorcery at all.\n\nWe dream each night.  That doesn't provide any insight either.\n\nSo the idea that power plants give you any help learning sorcery, is wrong on so many levels.\n\nAlso, they will get  you stuck at the bottom of the J curve.\n\nOnly perfect silence can get you to the front.  Which is where we must go.\n\nAll the magic you see in my drawings lately, is silent knowledge.\n\nDrugs can't access that at all.\n\nAnd trauma induced silence won't get you there either, like one might get from power plants.\n\nMy Facebook \"sorcerer\" liked to inform me, \"I can get silent\".\n\nOut of a clear blue sky.  Just posted it on my page.\n\nIt was so childish, I just waited to find out why he was saying that.\n\nTurns out he thought his shrooms could get him silent, the way you need to move along the J curve.\n\nBut in fact, you'll just slide more and more sideways at the bottom, on the back.\n\nYou don't \"get silent\" and then you have arrived.\n\nYou get silent so the assemblage point can drift.\n\nBut you still have to make it drift the right direction.\n\nMy Facebook guy who thinks he can use Tai Chi, only said that because I reminded him how many times Carlos said you can't learn with power plants.  He tried to justify his power plants, by claiming to be doing something else too.\n\nHe's flattered and confused himself into thinking he's a power plant sorcerer.  I suppose nothing is going to change that.  So he'll never learn sorcery.\n\nHe has some ego driven business in mind learning pretend sorcery with drugs, and then telling people his Tai Chi is the same as Tensegrity.\n\nSo he can make some money?\n\nAgain, wrong *intent*!\n\nNot only is that completely nuts, but I doubt he can get away with it much longer.\n\nThere's real magic out there now. The community is \"wising up\".\n\nInstagram in particular.  Young people there, I suppose.\n\nAnd people will soon know, Silent Knowledge can only be attained by following instructions from Carlos,  closely.\n\nWhen they see someone suggesting you can read new stuff and study with an  \"alternative teacher\", and learn that way, soon most will know that's a bad person.\n\nOnly the Spirit can teach  you sorcery.\n\nThe books only tell you how to copy the intent of the Olmecs, but you still have to do that yourself.\n\nGo take a look at what happened to crazy running man.\n\nHe's in past posts.  Maybe 6-8 months ago?\n\nTried to lie and steal from this subreddit, then got kicked out, lied to create a new pointless subreddit featuring his videos, that failed, so then he teamed up with native Americans to try to take down this sub.\n\nFailed at every turn.\n\nHe could have just put down his drugs, and put in some work.\n\nBut he was broken.   Just couldn't do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "You Can Only Learn Sorcery Through Sorcery", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"vmts31ccc8081": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 144, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb20f96f83209f85aadd94bd5f385513bdc3fc10"}, {"y": 288, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ee9285f2bc2c33469ec56647789702968e72aff"}, {"y": 426, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7063d7f3280cc6b0f4caeb69c8196d653c21f79"}, {"y": 853, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72784cbea4a73b576ac19346eb1541fdc0b09b31"}, {"y": 1280, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68c8657ff431e6613a70b03794ba4db9faea7793"}, {"y": 1440, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0573fa0af74af45bfdfc8c1f780d17d59ef5f28a"}], "s": {"y": 1600, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07089ef675da89a4909cddad4d91d62b094adc40"}, "id": "vmts31ccc8081"}}, "name": "t3_qwak4n", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/b5nB-wG5ENZ3_aaV1iFKu0sSKC_hPS3HHDx_qt7dkQ0.jpg", "edited": 1637192113.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1637187772.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=07089ef675da89a4909cddad4d91d62b094adc40\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vmts31ccc8081.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=07089ef675da89a4909cddad4d91d62b094adc40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a Tai Chi guy on Facebook claim he can do darkroom with Tai Chi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is such a fundamental misunderstanding, I&amp;#39;d better correct it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; sorcery.

Additionally, his social credit rating was lowered to the point where he could not rent, own property, stay in certain hotels, travel on high speed rail or buy plane tickets.[16][17] The restrictions were lifted after he paid US$40,000 in both legal fees and the cost of placing the apology.[18]\n\nIn May 2019, Xu defeated another martial artist; but was only able to do so wearing clown makeup to hide his face and by fighting under a pseudonym.

This was interpreted by Bloody Elbow (MMA news site) and Radii China as being in response to Xu's complaints about \"kung fu fakery\".[25][26] In December, Xiaodong defeated Chen Yong, a tai chi master who had challenged him in 2018, in only 10 seconds.[27]\n\n..........\n\nsource https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Xiaodong", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hl50tu1", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;he got his social credit so low that he cannot take the train anymore if I recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but he continues and does it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...........&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Xu was frustrated by what he saw as fraud and hypocrisy amongst martial arts practitioners, and wanted to demonstrate the superiority of modern fighting styles.[6] Some in China believe that kung fu masters have supernatural powers, and self-described masters, including Wei Lei, were known to make such claims online.[7] Xu started a dispute with Wei on social media, beginning with a demand that Wei provide evidence of his abilities, and culminating in a bare-knuckle fight in a basement in Chengdu in 2017; Xu won convincingly in less than 20 seconds.[7][8][9]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the fight went viral, there was significant blowback on social media where he was accused of disparaging Chinese culture and his family received death threats.

This was interpreted by Bloody Elbow (MMA news site) and Radii China as being in response to Xu&amp;#39;s complaints about &amp;quot;kung fu fakery&amp;quot;.[25][26] In December, Xiaodong defeated Chen Yong, a tai chi master who had challenged him in 2018, in only 10 seconds.[27]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;..........&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;source &lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Xiaodong\"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Xiaodong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qwak4n", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qwak4n/you_can_only_learn_sorcery_through_sorcery/hl50tu1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1637254045.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1637254045.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hl4wjtq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1637252354.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hl4o8mp", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "So he's become a specialist?  \"The Master Mauler\".", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hl4wjtq", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he&amp;#39;s become a specialist?  &amp;quot;The Master Mauler&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qwak4n", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qwak4n/you_can_only_learn_sorcery_through_sorcery/hl4wjtq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1637252354.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hl4o8mp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "matejthetree", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1637249009.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_qwak4n", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_ar84z8e", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&amp;search_query=xia+xiaodong\n\nxia xiaodong", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hl4o8mp", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&amp;amp;search_query=xia+xiaodong\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&amp;amp;search_query=xia+xiaodong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;xia xiaodong&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qwak4n/you_can_only_learn_sorcery_through_sorcery/hl4o8mp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1637249009.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_qwak4n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

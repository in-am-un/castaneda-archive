They can move water pretty easily, and make gurgling sounds like the teapot or the water cooler.\n\nBut other omens can come from your double itself.  I have yet to get him to do that often enough to figure out the rules.\n\nAnd then there's the implication something else might.\n\nFor that, consider Porfirio.  A Silent Knowledge Entity (SKE).\n\nOr my \"storyteller\".\n\nIn the books, Silent Knowledge is often channeled by something else.  The Devil's Weed Ally made the lizards talk. The talking was \"Silent Knowledge\", and was an attempt to discover who stole books from the library.  The Ally obviously didn't really know who did that, but he knew how to find out.  Through Silent Knowledge!\n\nWhen I get \"almost there\" trying to reach full on SK mode, an ally will occasionally show up, and offer me help to go the rest of the way.  And they can do that!\n\nIn fact, it's how the \"dreaming emissary\" comes into being.  They simply hook themselves to SK, and speak it to you.\n\nSK is a topic, which seems like many different topics. Just like \"intent\" itself has so many different forms you can consider.\n\nAnd so, these passages are hinting that SK might intervene during the day, and \"leak out\" as an \"Omen\".\n\nHinting, but they don't really say that.\n\nExcept that I've gotten a bit ill, and I had to terminate my darkroom last night just short of \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nThe odd thing is, I did reach it. And \"saw it\" up in the air.  A stream of small videos crushed together, and only in green and blue.  They were scrolling by, waiting for me to \"touch one\", like a computer display listing available movies.\n\nAll I had to do was reach up and touch one.  Even though they were on the other side of the room, and there was no way to reach that far.\n\nBut instead of doing that (you no longer care once you get there), I stopped to get out my laptop and save info I put in a post over in the advanced subreddit, on phantom realms.  Too advanced for this subreddit.\n\nWhen I was done I went back to practicing, but found I was too ill to continue.\n\nI lay down on my side.\n\nA while later I heard a voice.  It's too bad I didn't write it down!\n\nIt said, \"And then you put the blue object into the tube, and using your whole arm you...\"\n\nThat's nothing at all like what was said, but it gives the same feeling. I was  hearing a \"procedure\" that referred to some magical technique you could perform.\n\nI sat up quickly and said, \"That's Silent Knowledge!!!  But how can that possibly be?  I wasn't even practicing.\"\n\nFancy was apparently lingering around and said, \"Why not?  That's what it's like when you actually become a sorcerer.  Silent Knowledge oozes out from everything around you.\"\n\nFrom Taisha's latest book:\n\n\"How can one reestablish a link with the double?\" I asked.\n\n'By curtailing self importance. By not being concerned with the concreteness of things. By becoming abstract in one's thinking and behavior. By treating everything as manifestations of energy, and not as objective reality. Focusing on the self takes energy that one needs to act efficiently.\n\nFor example, to regret past actions or to be too involved or concerned with the outcome of anything, weight a person down so that he cannot act efficiently, spontaneously, and with the proper timing.\"\n\n\"What if you just don't know what to do or when to do it?\"I said i n a complaining tone.\n\n\"You must stop and wait, until you catch the motion of things,\" don Juan replied. \"And listen for the omens; watch the indications emitted from the world around you. They act directly on your energetic body.\n\nOf course, for that, you have to be absolutely fluid and have to reduce your desires to nothing. You must feel no hurry and have no need to control or manipulate things. Then you can listen to the world's whispers.\n\nSometimes omens tell you how to do something. As for example, which plant to pick for a particular ailment. Or they predict the outcome of a course of action. Naturally, other forces can tell you these things too.\"\n\nWhat other forces are those?\"\n\n\"The voice of seeing, for example. That comes directly from your energetic body. Or it may come from another entity that advises you. At any rate, it advises you from a place not accessible to your everyday physical body. And you have to open a channel to that place. \"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Strange Leakage of Silent Knowledge", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"09oqqgpas4v81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/09oqqgpas4v81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=812c7829092914477d1a8602e51e9d98754336f2"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/09oqqgpas4v81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd3007514475e7a24b005a388362bfc361d690e9"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/09oqqgpas4v81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2167cf38edde02daa6af355248fbcd8350f026"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/09oqqgpas4v81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b57425d76b31c6fffc81ce85ff3aee9fc5a18711"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/09oqqgpas4v81.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cfcf641d27d4abd9453c2ebe46734bcc5ad5866"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/09oqqgpas4v81.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29d2310b7d11a2374bb3a493e565edd9b4d43aac"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/09oqqgpas4v81.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd8223385b6ca7ec5a6f06017c72b405aa193a8d"}, "id": "09oqqgpas4v81"}}, "name": "t3_u9mfvb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yVg4l0EsxMncGly9rPPN1sDoBFqKNZ6_cePcSZpk0so.jpg", "edited": 1650923567.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650655242.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/09oqqgpas4v81.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bd8223385b6ca7ec5a6f06017c72b405aa193a8d\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s just ponies leaking out, not a misogynistic reference to Lidotska!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lidotska found this in Taisha&amp;#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was obvious to me what it was saying, because I&amp;#39;ve been turning part of my energy body into a phantom assistant, and it requires a &amp;quot;volunteer rogue puff&amp;quot; to work best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the energy body has to be happy with you, and offer you part of what would ordinarily become your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this sums up perfectly how you learn to get &amp;quot;rogue puffs&amp;quot; to be your friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I was a little surprised by the emphasis on Omens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of those are just your Ally playing with stuff.

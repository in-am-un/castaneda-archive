Possibly it's rather because the temporary relief from all the emotions gives some feelings of joy to which we become addicted, and then this gets interpreted as a fun time. In that case, sex would just be a vehicle that we have learned to use. In total it has become a matter of inner dialogue.\n\nMaybe someone is addicted to it without really realizing it, because sex has become something trivial in our society, but people still don't talk about it openly. It has mutated into something like kinda religious secret that's worshipped publically. The bed is the altar on which the \"religious ritual\" is performed. And if someone doesn't have a partner, then the next available computer with internet access gets converted into an altar to \"adore\" some beautiful bodies. That's what's going on nowadays.

This entire procedures require an incredible amount of attention. All this for itself would be reason enough to reduce or even stop sexual activities.

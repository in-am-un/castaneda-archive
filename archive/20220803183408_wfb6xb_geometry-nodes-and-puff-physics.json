But he won't eat donuts, so who knows.](https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=1614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dde980cc772ca6f00fbbc7d7f9a4404a3b37997)\n\nBlender, the free professional animation program, seems to have added just what we need for \"puff physics\". The first 2 minutes of his video are more than enough to get the point.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WAxMI1QJMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WAxMI1QJMQ)\n\nSo we can scan in tensegrity forms using software which converts people doing movements on video, into cartoon characters copying them, and then blender will figure out what those tensegrity moves do in darkness.\n\nIn general.\n\nThe thing about tensegrity is, it stores intent.\n\nSo it's going to \"stir\" puffs following rules we can program into a computer.\n\nBut the \"intent\" of the original form, the tie it has to the old seers, won't be in the \"puff physics\".\n\nStill, it'll take a long time for all of the tensegrity forms to be tested by people who can reach Silent Knowledge.\n\nAnd until then, it would be nice if beginners could select a form to learn, maybe one they know no one else tried, and get the carton \"Carlos\" in the virtual Dance Home reality we can create using Blender, to \"turn off the lights\" while the cartoon \"Kylie\" does the form for us.\n\nPerfectly. From multiple angles!\n\nBecause she's just duplicating what is on video. But in 3D space you can rotate at will.\n\nExcept that while doing that, the cartoon Kylie will alter the \"second attention space\" programmed into the computer by us.\n\nSo you'll see a pretty good representation of what you could see in the second attention, while doing that form.\n\nFrankly, it can't fail!\n\nThe puffs aren't random things, \"all in your head\".\n\nThose are pieces of your energy body!\n\nI hope beginners reading this understand.\n\nIf you don't actually study in here, and just came because you saw what looks like actual magic, instead of the same old pretending of all the other subreddits,  you still don't get it.\n\nYou can only learn magic in here if you work hard, and follow instructions.\n\nIf you want to make it easier, cut corners, or think it's all crap anyway, so why put much time into it, you'll just take up space on the subreddit and eventually go away.\n\nYou have to WANT real magic enough to learn what we're doing in here.\n\nWe aren't just looking for a way to stand out in magic discussion groups!\n\nNo one here cares about those anymore.\n\nWe're trying to create 10 powerful sorcerers, so that this knowledge isn't lost forever.\n\nAnd to learn it, you don't just lay on your side in bed with your eyes open, repeating your mantra or whatever you did before, looking for magical sights.\n\nSo you can \"find your greatness\" and \"tell all your friends\".\n\nI swear, that's what half the people who comment are doing.\n\nCrap.\n\nMaybe one day some of those will \"snap out of it\".  Trust me when I say, the ones in here who have learned to silence themselves and move their assemblage points, aren't fooled for a second with your comments.\n\nThey know you're likely a lost cause.  But everyone is always hopeful someone will wake up.\n\nAnd the first thing you need to realize is, you can't possibly reach the point where you can manufacture things to see in darkness.\n\nWhich I suppose, is what beginners tend to think. That this is all just \"visualization\".\n\nEven though, there's NO ONE who can do this, using visualization.\n\nMight be a crazy guy somewhere.  But not a \"system\".\n\nThe ability to manufacture phantom realms, objects, and beings, is far, far away at the end of the J curve.\n\nYou're stuck up at the top in the blue line. The river of shit.\n\nAnd up there most people can only think about other people, and how to steal attention and money from them.\n\nFrom up there, you can't created phantom stuff floating in the darkness.  At least, not sober.\n\nYou need REAL stuff to find in the darkness.  Something \"real\", but which can only be seen when your assemblage point moves.\n\nIf you force silence, you can get your assemblage point to drift around.   Maybe, a 2 inch diameter circle, around it's normal spot.\n\nUp at the blue line.  There's pretty much no where for it to go but either sideways, which will alter your mood and make you fussy, or it might go down which will tend to cause you to blank out, or fall asleep.\n\nSo you're pretty much SCREWED.\n\nEven if you manage a tiny bit of silence, removing \"most\" of your internal dialogue, there's nowhere interesting for you to go with the crummy levels of silence you can manage.\n\nIt takes 2 full hours to traverse the J curve!\n\nAnd if you're trying to find \"alternatives\" to forcing out the internal dialogue, there's 100% nowhere for you to go. Nothing to see.\n\nYou just have to accept that it's painful to remove those endless words from your mind.\n\nThat's step 1.  To accept that there's no other way.  You aren't going to find a way to \"cheat\" and become famous, with your own sorcery franchise.  With your \"easier way to do darkroom\".\n\nThere's already several people going around with that pretending.  Thankfully they either got tossed out, or left on their own.\n\nYou'll just turn dishonest, and get kicked out when we figure out you have motivations to \"teach\".  Instead of learning first.\n\nSo you have to force off the internal dialogue in perfect darkness, if you want an ideal situation.\n\nBut that's still not enough.\n\nAs I said, \"there's nothing to see here\".\n\nNot at the blue line.\n\nNot even halfway down to the green line.\n\nA few minor \"visions\" can happen at the green line, you can feel \"bliss\", but in the end you'll just be another crummy Buddha Boy down there, deluded into believing you \"have arrived\".\n\nBuddhist \"Enlightenment\" is like a 5 year old with a handful of pocket change, thinking he can buy himself a  Lamborghini.\n\n5 year olds don't understand \"money\" yet.\n\nBut the worst part is, the kid can't drive. And really doesn't know how to get anywhere, if he could.\n\nThe truth is, he just wants \"daddy to love him\".\n\nAnd daddy likes Lamborghinis.\n\nDon't be that kid.  They don't work out in this subreddit. Go over to the Buddhist subreddit if that's what you're in to.\n\nThe Dali Lama loves EVERYONE.\n\n(who has cash).\n\nAnd he'll sell you a franchise!\n\nSo if that's what you really want, you don't belong in here.\n\nWe don't have any franchises, and no one gets any cash from this.  And you won't get attention.\n\nYou'll get lynched for having real magic.\n\nBut back to the person who decides to actually follow instructions in here.\n\nBy the way, this isn't a new problem.\n\nIt's also why Carlos was unable to teach sorcery to anyone.  Not a single one!\n\nBecause they wouldn't follow instructions.\n\nTo this day, there are thousands doing tensegrity and pretending to do recap, who don't care at all about magic.  They don't really even believe that.\n\nSo if you're the guy who's really trying, what makes it not completely hopeless that you will succeed?\n\nYou do!\n\nBut not the **you**, you are thinking of.\n\nIt's your double!\n\nHE wants you to succeed.\n\nBut right now you smell like shit.  In fact, it gives him the creeps to even get within 2 feet of you. It's all the \"worry and grief\" you are drowning in.\n\nSo he's pressed against the inside of the \"egg\" shape that holds our awareness, with his nose(s) pressed against it like a window, looking out into infinity for something fun to do. Anything to get away from you.\n\nAnd he can \"project\" himself out there.  That's what you experience at night when you dream.\n\nHe's your salvation.\n\nBecause the instant you don't smell as bad, because you've reduced your internal dialogue, he notices.\n\nHe turns his nose away from being smashed up against the egg, several feet away from you, and looks back to see why you don't smell as awful anymore.\n\nYou still smell horrible!  But at least he no longer feels like vomiting.\n\nBut it's still not enough.\n\nAs it is there, you might see \"colors\" in the darkness.  Because he's \"concentrated\" a little, wherever he moved back from the window of the egg to look inside at you.\n\nIf you force silence well, you might notice some \"colors\" in the darkness.\n\nOnce you do that, you can \"lure\" him.\n\nBut it'll take forever, and you'll give up.\n\nYou really don't have forever.  Even if you are young the river of shit will suck you back, and you'll forget all about sorcery forever.\n\nWhile you are aware of it, you need to do something else. Besides just \"look for colors\".\n\nThat's what they do in the books first. BUT, they have Zuleica there.\n\nAnd like, it's her double.  Not even the real her.  Once they found colors, she told them more things to do.\n\nSo clearly, \"finding colors\" is still not enough.  You need \"outside help\".\n\nTo get that, there's 2 possibilities.\n\nIf you are lucky, the slight look you get of the \"colors\" in the darkness, which is your double turning his head to see why you don't stink as much, will be noticed by an inorganic being.\n\nMaybe your childhood, \"Monster in the closet\".\n\nThose never give up!  But they do have less and less of a connection to you over the years, until they aren't going to notice you've gotten smarter for the short time your attention span can sustain the view of the colors.\n\nBut if you get lucky, you somehow \"kept your connection\" to your childhood Ally, and he'll notice that you can now see glimpses of your energy body. Of the dreaming double.\n\nHe LOVES that. He's been messing with your dreaming double off and on for years.\n\nHe's the annoying 3rd grade teacher in your dream, who follows you around commenting on the mistakes you make, even though you're in a dream.\n\nHe's also one of the horrible monsters who scares the devil out of you, on nights where he can \"find a weakness\".\n\nPerhaps stress, slight illness, overwork.\n\nHe'll notice that in your dreams, and \"Pull on it\".\n\nSo you get a giant gorilla trying to eat you, because you saw a \"Gorilla Glue\" ad on TV that day.\n\nIt's not the ad.  It's your \"weakness\" from illness perhaps, combined with him trying to steal energy, and the only scary monster he found in your mind was from the TV commercial.\n\nIf someone had been joking at work that day about how scary clowns are, you might have gotten Pennywise from the movie \"It\".\n\nThat's how inorganic beings select images to  use. From your tonal awareness.\n\nSo the ideal \"best chance\" for you to succeed at darkroom gazing, is to \"see colors\" and then have a childhood IOB (inorganic being) notice that you're not as stupid as you used to be, and maybe he can appear for you.\n\nYou'll see a woman's face, barely.\n\nBut before you see her, you'll see \"colors\". Then learn that if you can force ever better silence, the colors don't go away just because you noticed them.\n\nAnd the colors might start to \"drift\" around.\n\nEventually your IOB notices, and makes an appearance.\n\nIt's in \"Fairy's Pass\" picture, over here:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a483c2a96563e65cffeb4ce77e023079b0eb66da](https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a483c2a96563e65cffeb4ce77e023079b0eb66da)\n\n\"Fairy\" herself made me draw that up. At 3AM she made me rush to work to my good computer, make the picture, and post it as fast as possible.\n\nFairy is the one who blackmailed me into coming here, via a roundabout road that took nearly 10 years.\n\nBut if I didn't comply, she promised to drive me mad.  With her friend Minx.\n\nBoth given to the private classes of Carlos.  It just seems that only me and Cholita learned to interact with them until this subreddit got active.\n\nBut what if you don't have an IOB?\n\nThen you need to do a song and a dance, to lure the double to come away from the walls of your egg and float around you.  Physically.\n\nMaybe you can't see him at the blue line, but he's there!\n\nAs real as you are.  These days, I have to check when I get home to make sure there's only one copy of Cholita in sight.\n\nShe can make a second one, and I can get distracted following it around thinking it's the real one.\n\nThat's how real they can get.  Including moving physical matter around, as if they were also made of physical matter.\n\nSo if you don't have a childhood monster under the bed, then you need to do a song and a dance to get the double to come closer and take a look.\n\nOddly, the double likes that kind of thing.\n\nHe likes martial arts forms too!\n\nNow I don't propose you get up and start tap dancing.\n\nI haven't tried it!\n\nBut, the sorcerers of don Juan's lineaged loved dancing.  Because they could hide \"magical movements\" in it.  Movements discovered by the old seers, thousands of years ago, and which are designed to stimulate the dreaming double from inside dreams.\n\nYou've done that too!  As a child you might have become at least a little aware you were in a dream, and you realized you can spray acid with your fingers.   To burn up attacking dream phantoms.\n\nOr you could jump up a little intending to land on a magic carpet, which you don't need to see.  And as long as you stop falling around 1 foot from the ground, and it \"feels very good\",  you can fly like that for the duration of the dream.\n\nTHOSE are the kinds of things the old seers discovered.\n\nExcept they were ALWAYS fully aware of being inside a dream.  They were raised from small children to never reject dreaming, or the monster in the closet. They grew up as \"lucid dreamers\".\n\nSo our \"new seer\" lineage knows some of their old \"dream moves\", and those are what Carlos gave us in the tensegrity.\n\nBut here's a quote from the books about one of the lineage's members liking to dance.\n\nI didn't realize Silvio did too!  I only remembered the Naguals who liked to dance.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSilvio Manuel was a magnificent dancer. His expertise in the various indigenous, sacred dances was legendary. He moved with rapturous abandon and would often ask me to dance with him. Whether it was a Venezuelan joropo, a cumbia, a samba, a tango, the twist, rock and roll, or a cheek-to-cheek bolero, he knew them all.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo if you want to get up and do a little Tango, you might indeed get the \"colors\" you saw in darkness to move closer, and then you can find the \"puffs\".\n\nBut better is to use the tensegrity moves, because those have the secrets of the old seers embedded into the moves.\n\nTango itself does not.\n\nNor does Shotokan Kata #1.\n\nYou NEED to do the tensegrity.\n\nNot because of its \"qigong goodness\".\n\nNot because \"it makes your chi rise\".\n\nIt's because, it amuses the double. So he might come up to you, and stand just a foot or two away.\n\nBut in his \"puff form\".\n\nThat's before he decides to copy your physical shape, which he probably only does when he's being \"logical and rational\", and exploring dream worlds that look a lot like our normal world.\n\nHere's what happens at first.  Remember it.  No Tensegrity, no puffs to find.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b950bfc638b42f4d7fb2e6ab13048ed833489f6\n\nBut what does this have to do with blender's \"Geometry Nodes\"?\n\nIf you can't see that, you're probably not a programmer.\n\nBut it won't stop you from learning to be a sorcerer, when you finally decide to do that for real.\n\nI should probably make this post into a cartoon that beginners watch first, so they understand what darkroom really is.\n\nThe still pictures just didn't get the job done with new people.\n\nMaybe they're used to being entertained too much?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Geometry Nodes and Puff Physics", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 58, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"a09wb5th7jf91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 44, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af67dd0af407f10a3a381ec5ddebd1e2888e6bf0"}, {"y": 88, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61b34477704de28a2522a6ff111da4d86c622823"}, {"y": 130, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e93a7b63927127fc81df5c8d3cd92d2a1fdc4b2"}, {"y": 261, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142ff675b44d34bd8560a52a50e58b977dfaa13d"}, {"y": 391, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ead2a34e18a082fbefdbd5bdce9783d533bef680"}, {"y": 440, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6c4204db5cf2e5f55cab21ddd0f9d52a932965f"}], "s": {"y": 659, "x": 1614, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=1614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dde980cc772ca6f00fbbc7d7f9a4404a3b37997"}, "id": "a09wb5th7jf91"}, "cviz2jcuzif91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=235c726b4f91825f0d6a33a839f92e4e52874bfe"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddea2869f5186a35549274ad40c856eaa342710f"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29d996a574386e61ab8a6b3933ebfdc78a1fc764"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e626db0ffbfbe884e9f447925720192cd7a8bd65"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=312b6f04c0be293cae739ef7a5e235a0a65e277c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57f0e657276ae6d8bbc17144a28aeb75b7cf2f27"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b950bfc638b42f4d7fb2e6ab13048ed833489f6"}, "id": "cviz2jcuzif91"}}, "name": "t3_wfb6xb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 27, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/L2jRwcrH7wVZNrrSESRJtToc2SKqqyCoN_rDbbkBFE0.jpg", "edited": 1659547273.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1659544448.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a09wb5th7jf91.png?width=1614&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6dde980cc772ca6f00fbbc7d7f9a4404a3b37997\"&gt;The guy looks a little high to me...

From multiple angles!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because she&amp;#39;s just duplicating what is on video. But in 3D space you can rotate at will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that while doing that, the cartoon Kylie will alter the &amp;quot;second attention space&amp;quot; programmed into the computer by us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ll see a pretty good representation of what you could see in the second attention, while doing that form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, it can&amp;#39;t fail!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs aren&amp;#39;t random things, &amp;quot;all in your head&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are pieces of your energy body!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope beginners reading this understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t actually study in here, and just came because you saw what looks like actual magic, instead of the same old pretending of all the other subreddits,  you still don&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can only learn magic in here if you work hard, and follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to make it easier, cut corners, or think it&amp;#39;s all crap anyway, so why put much time into it, you&amp;#39;ll just take up space on the subreddit and eventually go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to WANT real magic enough to learn what we&amp;#39;re doing in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t just looking for a way to stand out in magic discussion groups!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one here cares about those anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to create 10 powerful sorcerers, so that this knowledge isn&amp;#39;t lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to learn it, you don&amp;#39;t just lay on your side in bed with your eyes open, repeating your mantra or whatever you did before, looking for magical sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can &amp;quot;find your greatness&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tell all your friends&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swear, that&amp;#39;s what half the people who comment are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day some of those will &amp;quot;snap out of it&amp;quot;.  Trust me when I say, the ones in here who have learned to silence themselves and move their assemblage points, aren&amp;#39;t fooled for a second with your comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They know you&amp;#39;re likely a lost cause.  But everyone is always hopeful someone will wake up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the first thing you need to realize is, you can&amp;#39;t possibly reach the point where you can manufacture things to see in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I suppose, is what beginners tend to think. That this is all just &amp;quot;visualization&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though, there&amp;#39;s NO ONE who can do this, using visualization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might be a crazy guy somewhere.  But not a &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ability to manufacture phantom realms, objects, and beings, is far, far away at the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re stuck up at the top in the blue line. The river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And up there most people can only think about other people, and how to steal attention and money from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From up there, you can&amp;#39;t created phantom stuff floating in the darkness.  At least, not sober.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need REAL stuff to find in the darkness.  Something &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, but which can only be seen when your assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you force silence, you can get your assemblage point to drift around.   Maybe, a 2 inch diameter circle, around it&amp;#39;s normal spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up at the blue line.  There&amp;#39;s pretty much no where for it to go but either sideways, which will alter your mood and make you fussy, or it might go down which will tend to cause you to blank out, or fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re pretty much SCREWED.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you manage a tiny bit of silence, removing &amp;quot;most&amp;quot; of your internal dialogue, there&amp;#39;s nowhere interesting for you to go with the crummy levels of silence you can manage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes 2 full hours to traverse the J curve!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re trying to find &amp;quot;alternatives&amp;quot; to forcing out the internal dialogue, there&amp;#39;s 100% nowhere for you to go. Nothing to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to accept that it&amp;#39;s painful to remove those endless words from your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s step 1.  To accept that there&amp;#39;s no other way.  You aren&amp;#39;t going to find a way to &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot; and become famous, with your own sorcery franchise.  With your &amp;quot;easier way to do darkroom&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s already several people going around with that pretending.  Thankfully they either got tossed out, or left on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll just turn dishonest, and get kicked out when we figure out you have motivations to &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot;.  Instead of learning first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to force off the internal dialogue in perfect darkness, if you want an ideal situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s still not enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s nothing to see here&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not even halfway down to the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few minor &amp;quot;visions&amp;quot; can happen at the green line, you can feel &amp;quot;bliss&amp;quot;, but in the end you&amp;#39;ll just be another crummy Buddha Boy down there, deluded into believing you &amp;quot;have arrived&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhist &amp;quot;Enlightenment&amp;quot; is like a 5 year old with a handful of pocket change, thinking he can buy himself a  Lamborghini.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 year olds don&amp;#39;t understand &amp;quot;money&amp;quot; yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the worst part is, the kid can&amp;#39;t drive. And really doesn&amp;#39;t know how to get anywhere, if he could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is, he just wants &amp;quot;daddy to love him&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And daddy likes Lamborghinis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be that kid.  They don&amp;#39;t work out in this subreddit. Go over to the Buddhist subreddit if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re in to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dali Lama loves EVERYONE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(who has cash).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;ll sell you a franchise!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if that&amp;#39;s what you really want, you don&amp;#39;t belong in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have any franchises, and no one gets any cash from this.  And you won&amp;#39;t get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll get lynched for having real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to the person who decides to actually follow instructions in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, this isn&amp;#39;t a new problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also why Carlos was unable to teach sorcery to anyone.  Not a single one!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they wouldn&amp;#39;t follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this day, there are thousands doing tensegrity and pretending to do recap, who don&amp;#39;t care at all about magic.  They don&amp;#39;t really even believe that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re the guy who&amp;#39;s really trying, what makes it not completely hopeless that you will succeed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not the &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;, you are thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s your double!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HE wants you to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But right now you smell like shit.  In fact, it gives him the creeps to even get within 2 feet of you. It&amp;#39;s all the &amp;quot;worry and grief&amp;quot; you are drowning in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he&amp;#39;s pressed against the inside of the &amp;quot;egg&amp;quot; shape that holds our awareness, with his nose(s) pressed against it like a window, looking out into infinity for something fun to do. Anything to get away from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he can &amp;quot;project&amp;quot; himself out there.  That&amp;#39;s what you experience at night when you dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s your salvation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the instant you don&amp;#39;t smell as bad, because you&amp;#39;ve reduced your internal dialogue, he notices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turns his nose away from being smashed up against the egg, several feet away from you, and looks back to see why you don&amp;#39;t smell as awful anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You still smell horrible!  But at least he no longer feels like vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still not enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it is there, you might see &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; in the darkness.  Because he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;concentrated&amp;quot; a little, wherever he moved back from the window of the egg to look inside at you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you force silence well, you might notice some &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you do that, you can &amp;quot;lure&amp;quot; him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;ll take forever, and you&amp;#39;ll give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really don&amp;#39;t have forever.  Even if you are young the river of shit will suck you back, and you&amp;#39;ll forget all about sorcery forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While you are aware of it, you need to do something else. Besides just &amp;quot;look for colors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what they do in the books first. BUT, they have Zuleica there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And like, it&amp;#39;s her double.  Not even the real her.  Once they found colors, she told them more things to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So clearly, &amp;quot;finding colors&amp;quot; is still not enough.  You need &amp;quot;outside help&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get that, there&amp;#39;s 2 possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are lucky, the slight look you get of the &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; in the darkness, which is your double turning his head to see why you don&amp;#39;t stink as much, will be noticed by an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe your childhood, &amp;quot;Monster in the closet&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those never give up!  But they do have less and less of a connection to you over the years, until they aren&amp;#39;t going to notice you&amp;#39;ve gotten smarter for the short time your attention span can sustain the view of the colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you get lucky, you somehow &amp;quot;kept your connection&amp;quot; to your childhood Ally, and he&amp;#39;ll notice that you can now see glimpses of your energy body. Of the dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He LOVES that. He&amp;#39;s been messing with your dreaming double off and on for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s the annoying 3rd grade teacher in your dream, who follows you around commenting on the mistakes you make, even though you&amp;#39;re in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s also one of the horrible monsters who scares the devil out of you, on nights where he can &amp;quot;find a weakness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps stress, slight illness, overwork.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll notice that in your dreams, and &amp;quot;Pull on it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you get a giant gorilla trying to eat you, because you saw a &amp;quot;Gorilla Glue&amp;quot; ad on TV that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the ad.  It&amp;#39;s your &amp;quot;weakness&amp;quot; from illness perhaps, combined with him trying to steal energy, and the only scary monster he found in your mind was from the TV commercial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone had been joking at work that day about how scary clowns are, you might have gotten Pennywise from the movie &amp;quot;It&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how inorganic beings select images to  use. From your tonal awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the ideal &amp;quot;best chance&amp;quot; for you to succeed at darkroom gazing, is to &amp;quot;see colors&amp;quot; and then have a childhood IOB (inorganic being) notice that you&amp;#39;re not as stupid as you used to be, and maybe he can appear for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see a woman&amp;#39;s face, barely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before you see her, you&amp;#39;ll see &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot;. Then learn that if you can force ever better silence, the colors don&amp;#39;t go away just because you noticed them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the colors might start to &amp;quot;drift&amp;quot; around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually your IOB notices, and makes an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;#39;s Pass&amp;quot; picture, over here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a483c2a96563e65cffeb4ce77e023079b0eb66da\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a483c2a96563e65cffeb4ce77e023079b0eb66da&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; herself made me draw that up. At 3AM she made me rush to work to my good computer, make the picture, and post it as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy is the one who blackmailed me into coming here, via a roundabout road that took nearly 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if I didn&amp;#39;t comply, she promised to drive me mad.  With her friend Minx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both given to the private classes of Carlos.  It just seems that only me and Cholita learned to interact with them until this subreddit got active.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if you don&amp;#39;t have an IOB?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you need to do a song and a dance, to lure the double to come away from the walls of your egg and float around you.  Physically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can&amp;#39;t see him at the blue line, but he&amp;#39;s there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As real as you are.  These days, I have to check when I get home to make sure there&amp;#39;s only one copy of Cholita in sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She can make a second one, and I can get distracted following it around thinking it&amp;#39;s the real one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how real they can get.  Including moving physical matter around, as if they were also made of physical matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you don&amp;#39;t have a childhood monster under the bed, then you need to do a song and a dance to get the double to come closer and take a look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, the double likes that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He likes martial arts forms too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#39;t propose you get up and start tap dancing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t tried it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, the sorcerers of don Juan&amp;#39;s lineaged loved dancing.  Because they could hide &amp;quot;magical movements&amp;quot; in it.  Movements discovered by the old seers, thousands of years ago, and which are designed to stimulate the dreaming double from inside dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve done that too!  As a child you might have become at least a little aware you were in a dream, and you realized you can spray acid with your fingers.   To burn up attacking dream phantoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you could jump up a little intending to land on a magic carpet, which you don&amp;#39;t need to see.  And as long as you stop falling around 1 foot from the ground, and it &amp;quot;feels very good&amp;quot;,  you can fly like that for the duration of the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THOSE are the kinds of things the old seers discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except they were ALWAYS fully aware of being inside a dream.  They were raised from small children to never reject dreaming, or the monster in the closet. They grew up as &amp;quot;lucid dreamers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So our &amp;quot;new seer&amp;quot; lineage knows some of their old &amp;quot;dream moves&amp;quot;, and those are what Carlos gave us in the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s a quote from the books about one of the lineage&amp;#39;s members liking to dance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize Silvio did too!  I only remembered the Naguals who liked to dance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silvio Manuel was a magnificent dancer. His expertise in the various indigenous, sacred dances was legendary. He moved with rapturous abandon and would often ask me to dance with him. Whether it was a Venezuelan joropo, a cumbia, a samba, a tango, the twist, rock and roll, or a cheek-to-cheek bolero, he knew them all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to get up and do a little Tango, you might indeed get the &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; you saw in darkness to move closer, and then you can find the &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But better is to use the tensegrity moves, because those have the secrets of the old seers embedded into the moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tango itself does not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nor does Shotokan Kata #1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You NEED to do the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not because of its &amp;quot;qigong goodness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not because &amp;quot;it makes your chi rise&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s because, it amuses the double. So he might come up to you, and stand just a foot or two away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in his &amp;quot;puff form&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s before he decides to copy your physical shape, which he probably only does when he&amp;#39;s being &amp;quot;logical and rational&amp;quot;, and exploring dream worlds that look a lot like our normal world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what happens at first.  Remember it.  No Tensegrity, no puffs to find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b950bfc638b42f4d7fb2e6ab13048ed833489f6\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cviz2jcuzif91.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b950bfc638b42f4d7fb2e6ab13048ed833489f6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what does this have to do with blender&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Geometry Nodes&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t see that, you&amp;#39;re probably not a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it won&amp;#39;t stop you from learning to be a sorcerer, when you finally decide to do that for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should probably make this post into a cartoon that beginners watch first, so they understand what darkroom really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The still pictures just didn&amp;#39;t get the job done with new people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe they&amp;#39;re used to being entertained too much?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

Last year we brainstormed this app idea for months and he started this year on dev, while moving us through his career to a new town. Our family is becoming something else. My son is learning to astral project and claims to be taking part in some \"games with others\". \n\nMy daughter is an odd nut to crack... she is a mix between interesting parts of my partner and i... observing her has healed me as well. She connects often, the two of them together result in a giggle fit for hours if not stopped. I hate stopping her, because i think that is how i was broken down... so i try and explain that our sensitivity to noise stems from being silenced as children. Seen, never heard. Its a generational gap from our parents and their misunderstanding of life.\n\nRegarding all the shit out there... yes i see your point and i do agree. I read through years of BS to get the clear answers... but like most, i got the answers from within, forgot the magic, and went looking for confirmation online to explain what we already know through experience. Its one giant snake loop that keeps eating you up, spitting you out and doing it again and again...\n\nWhat i did learn online through \"spirituality\", was finding the Now. Mushrooms, Mescaline and LSD showed me how i could be, found out it was all impossible but yet i can't do it? Like what? I knew i was getting the results they said i couldnt get without drugs. Wish i went for a brain scan before my first awakening... so i could compare it to now. Because no one would believe how much change is possible.\n\nBefore finding this new mission, i was thinking about how i can help people get unstuck. But the more i found, the more I realized everything i like in Media has been telling me exactly this... so i thought i need to write a \"story\" mapping the choices that got me here in metaphors. I would do this as therapy for my tonal body. I am drawn to create music, to dance, to draw and to write and teach. \n\nI am still in financial slavery, and want to escape. But i received a message a while back saying that its wrong to charge money for teaching. So i won't do that. Right now, i dont know what i would teach, its all noise. What i want is to infiltrate the schools and secretly teach the children to power themselves up. Maybe that is my underlying mission. I think schools are absolutely toxic and have no idea that they are. Those people are all insane children pretending to be adults. I have taken my children out of the system and they have flourished. I have removed myself from my whole family of mad people pretending they made it.\n\nI went through that whole inflated spiritual ego trip as well, wow. It became very obvious what that was all about when i became established at the center while awake. Haha, what a fun ride its been.\n\nThis whole god confusion has been the death of millions, stop your waffling and shut the f up. Sit down. Go to silence. Find your universe and start mapping it out. Chose a cause and stick to the mission. Get yourself a daily routine of reminders. These reminders need to be mapped into your core so that you stop forgetting. Stay on that momentum and see how your world starts to blossom. If it doesnt, you are doing it wrong. Stop, go back, try again. Sounds easy, hehe, it isn't. My routine includes everything I've gathered along the way that gave me the results i was looking for... i do a lot that i don't understand all the time, but when the connection comes again i remember everything. I noticed that i feel open when I'm making the right choices and closed when i make the wrong ones... this is now easy. If i was joyful and notice i lost it, i go get it back. Then it stays. It goes away because something happened and needed me to jump and i said no... so the gate closed and my double got upset. So then i go back to silence on the inside (a few breaths with open eyes and feeling the energy swirl) and then i lose the grumpy feeling. I've had issues with \"mood swings\" my whole life, only now am i able to self regulate!\n\nEdit: i have a question... so I'm brand new to sorcery. But i noticed something when staring into the darkness. I have trouble with visualizing images in my mind. I can't \"picture\" an apple in my head just like that. What i can do is i stare into and past the puffs of smoke and then when i forget I'm \"looking\", a scene appears in the puff and plays out till i observe it closer, it disappears. I manage to keep them playing, sometimes. Last night i had a moth fly out of the one and cross to another puff before i forgot to not observe.

Last year we brainstormed this app idea for months and he started this year on dev, while moving us through his career to a new town. Our family is becoming something else. My son is learning to astral project and claims to be taking part in some &amp;quot;games with others&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My daughter is an odd nut to crack... she is a mix between interesting parts of my partner and i... observing her has healed me as well. She connects often, the two of them together result in a giggle fit for hours if not stopped. I hate stopping her, because i think that is how i was broken down... so i try and explain that our sensitivity to noise stems from being silenced as children. Seen, never heard. Its a generational gap from our parents and their misunderstanding of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding all the shit out there... yes i see your point and i do agree. I read through years of BS to get the clear answers... but like most, i got the answers from within, forgot the magic, and went looking for confirmation online to explain what we already know through experience. Its one giant snake loop that keeps eating you up, spitting you out and doing it again and again...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What i did learn online through &amp;quot;spirituality&amp;quot;, was finding the Now. Mushrooms, Mescaline and LSD showed me how i could be, found out it was all impossible but yet i can&amp;#39;t do it? Like what? I knew i was getting the results they said i couldnt get without drugs. Wish i went for a brain scan before my first awakening... so i could compare it to now. Because no one would believe how much change is possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before finding this new mission, i was thinking about how i can help people get unstuck. But the more i found, the more I realized everything i like in Media has been telling me exactly this... so i thought i need to write a &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; mapping the choices that got me here in metaphors. I would do this as therapy for my tonal body. I am drawn to create music, to dance, to draw and to write and teach. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am still in financial slavery, and want to escape. But i received a message a while back saying that its wrong to charge money for teaching. So i won&amp;#39;t do that. Right now, i dont know what i would teach, its all noise. What i want is to infiltrate the schools and secretly teach the children to power themselves up. Maybe that is my underlying mission. I think schools are absolutely toxic and have no idea that they are. Those people are all insane children pretending to be adults. I have taken my children out of the system and they have flourished. I have removed myself from my whole family of mad people pretending they made it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went through that whole inflated spiritual ego trip as well, wow. It became very obvious what that was all about when i became established at the center while awake. Haha, what a fun ride its been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole god confusion has been the death of millions, stop your waffling and shut the f up. Sit down. Go to silence. Find your universe and start mapping it out. Chose a cause and stick to the mission. Get yourself a daily routine of reminders.

I'm the person who had nothing but mental illness and then found evidence of my double and thought i had BPD and the DID... but i found spirituality and filtered through the BS and found a way to the second attention. I think it was by mistake since no one else gets these results from meditation. Maybe it was because i wasn't following their rules, i followed my intuition.\n\nMy situation has been odd since my husband is very very rational and logical and so on - but i am friends with his double, we trip together - I've realized this today. So, he is skeptical in a way that makes doing this path hard... but i know i can show him later when he is ready.\n\nMy journey to getting out of myself has been almost poetic. I have done so much work to get to here. Ive read so much nonsense to see the small sliver of Truth between the lies... i just kept building and building my new \"world view\". I had a few ego deaths that cleared out a lot of the problems. I met my pain body/wounded inner child and we became friends. I've realized the dream of life.

I have so many ideas of explaining concepts to laymen, i talk to myself in the voice of teaching others... i think we need to talk more... but let me catch up first. I tried going to the wiki but its not active anymore. I'm going to try and get all these books. I'm listening to Tales Of Power now on YT.\n\nDoes the date Nov 23 '87 mean anything here? \n\nI think I've already conceptualized the assemblage point, i need to learn more but I've seen it. I've seen the inner wall of my egg while sharing a moment on LSD... maybe I'm wrong, but i know I'm being called to this. Skyrim, the game, was the happiest time of my life and i still go there on shroom trips. I have synchronicity with almost everything I've read here.\n\nI have made a discovery about how double my actions are, like i usually experience magic only when i have taken something that can be blamed for the effects... but I'm building up enough trust in here to be shown things that don't have a \"rational\" explanation on a sober \"mind\". So my reality can start to change without logic etc... does this make sense to you?\n\nLast night i had a dream about a Moth... i am in the phase of transformation and i think you can help me and i can help you. I have a talent of translating reality into understanding. I see things very differently, but at the same time i have the experience of seeing them like others do... thats why i can translate it. I can see how a person is misunderstanding it as well as what it takes to sway that person the right way... or left.

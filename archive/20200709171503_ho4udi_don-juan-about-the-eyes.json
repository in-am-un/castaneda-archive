It had a shine to it.\n\nI thought it must be cataracts, and maybe it was.\n\nBut there's always a \"doing\" in any \"not-doing\".  The ordinary becomes the magical as the assemblage point moves deeper along the J curve.\n\nI've been told, since I've learned to manipulate intent myself, my left eye is different also.\n\nWhen you use the eyes to gaze at pure energy on any horizon (as described in \"Silent Knowledge\" publication), you can switch from left eye to right eye.\n\nI haven't been able to make that work in years. Since Downtown LA workshop.\n\nIt takes some practice.\n\nBut the energy you see with the left eye, is different from the right eye.\n\nOne is wavy, one is flat.\n\nIf you want to discover about the eyes yourself, just start with finding colors in darkness, while silent.\n\nNot only does it teach how to use the shine of the eyes to assemble other worlds, but it teaches you the importance of *intent*.\n\nImagine you're going up and down an old Kung Fu temple stairway, carrying buckets of water on your shoulders.\n\nMaster Po is being a bastard today.  He doesn't even want the water, you're being told to dump it down the other side of the hill.\n\nIf you aren't hooked to the \"Intent of the Sorcerer's of Ancient Mexico\", something Carlos emphasized over and over again in his final publications,  you'll be hauling those buckets of water until you cry.\n\nYou'll inevitably give up and leave the temple to go study something else.  Like Taoism. Or Zen.\n\nSomething mindless and easy where you don't actually have to succeed at anything.  You just get to brag to everyone about your inventory of wiseness.\n\nBut if you have *intent* on your side,  Master Po dozes off once in a while and you can stop to smell the temple flowers.", "edited": 1594310099.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fxfkyje", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You sure that&amp;#39;s in there?

If you want to do one thing, such as burn a hole in reality, the shine is concentrated and intense. It&amp;#39;s just like this, although your experience will probably be slightly different:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/s7axm5nuilw41.jpg?width=892&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e26264b081d4d872987f5a0a5525231cd532141e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/s7axm5nuilw41.jpg?width=892&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e26264b081d4d872987f5a0a5525231cd532141e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to simply see what&amp;#39;s there (view pure energy, filtered through intent),  the gaze is wider, encompassing the entire room.   You can do a huge variety of things with that kind of gaze:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=1700&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1e947bed5b9bf77310ad0ee90736a8ebcce93bd\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=1700&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1e947bed5b9bf77310ad0ee90736a8ebcce93bd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as Carlos&amp;#39; eyes, his left eye was quite different from his right eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wrote that in his books, so I certainly checked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was different.  It had a shine to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought it must be cataracts, and maybe it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s always a &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; in any &amp;quot;not-doing&amp;quot;.  The ordinary becomes the magical as the assemblage point moves deeper along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been told, since I&amp;#39;ve learned to manipulate intent myself, my left eye is different also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you use the eyes to gaze at pure energy on any horizon (as described in &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; publication), you can switch from left eye to right eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been able to make that work in years. Since Downtown LA workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes some practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the energy you see with the left eye, is different from the right eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is wavy, one is flat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to discover about the eyes yourself, just start with finding colors in darkness, while silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only does it teach how to use the shine of the eyes to assemble other worlds, but it teaches you the importance of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;#39;re going up and down an old Kung Fu temple stairway, carrying buckets of water on your shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Master Po is being a bastard today.  He doesn&amp;#39;t even want the water, you&amp;#39;re being told to dump it down the other side of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;#39;t hooked to the &amp;quot;Intent of the Sorcerer&amp;#39;s of Ancient Mexico&amp;quot;, something Carlos emphasized over and over again in his final publications,  you&amp;#39;ll be hauling those buckets of water until you cry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll inevitably give up and leave the temple to go study something else.  Like Taoism. Or Zen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something mindless and easy where you don&amp;#39;t actually have to succeed at anything.  You just get to brag to everyone about your inventory of wiseness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you have &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; on your side,  Master Po dozes off once in a while and you can stop to smell the temple flowers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false,

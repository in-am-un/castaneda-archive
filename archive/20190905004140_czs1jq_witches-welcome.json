She's hoping to get back \"the second sight\", which is another name for heightened awareness.\n\nShe's Russian.  As she told me,\n\n\"My heritage is in necromancy, so I don\u2019t think it is something I wouldn\u2019t be able to stomach *\\[the weirdness in here\\]*. If anybody tells you Russian witchcraft is anything but Black Magic and Necromancy - don\u2019t believe it. I am sure you agree - darkness is not necessary \u201cevil\u201d, and light is not necessary \u201cgood\u201d. I will do whatever it takes, as long as I can get myself back, I hope it is somehow possible.\n\nAs far as women witches tend to use craft for solving their social tasks.  It is how it has been working for centuries. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with this, on the contrary - it turns craft from a \u201chobby\u201d to a job essential for a survival. My gran grand mom did it for a living. I had always used it for solving my social tasks - and not ashamed of it. I lived it 24/7, and it was not an \u201cafter work\u201d kind of leisure activity.\"\n\nAfter a few days of advice, she's years ahead of the typical male student.\n\nThat always perplexes me.  You explain a set of arduous procedures, taking months of concentration. And then you explain what those will do, if they work very very hard.\n\nThe next day they say, \"Ok, I did that.  What's next?\"\n\nThen on top of that, and visualizing yourself in Carlos' shoes, they're really nice to look at.  And if you're Carlos, they're sure to sit a little too close, and not make sure their legs are crossed correctly.\n\nNo wonder Carlos' private classes were a chaos of young women.\n\nMy theory:  (not about the leg crossing) is that women don't have to learn to shut off the internal dialogue.\n\nI have no basis for this.  But I can't explain why they can do things, which require silence in men.\n\nSo I want to extend a welcome to any witches who stumble across this subreddit.  You don't have to be a follower of Carlos Castaneda.  You just have to want to stop pretending, and really do what you want to do.\n\nNote: It's not my subreddit. I'm just a visitor like you are.  But it's friendly in here.\n\nHere's what you might learn here:\n\n**Second Sight:**  A piece of cake for a woman.  You can even learn to see a giant eye ball when you close your eyes.  I have to keep telling that thing to get lost.  Keep in mind, *we're not pretending here*.  The advice I gave to this particular witch produces results which sort of frightened her.  Most witches are used to tame spells, and hunting down the results through great efforts.  Not so with sorcery.  Results are obvious.\n\n**Manifesting a demon**: Also a piece of cake. But it might take a lot of practice to make it look real.  And I suspect women don't have an advantage for this, over men.  That said, go read what the \"Witch of Endor\" did in the bible.  You can do that.  For real.  Will someone else see it too?  I don't know.\n\n**Finding a familiar spirit:**  Also a piece of cake.  But kind of hard to make it keep only one form.\n\n**Teleportation:** if you do, please teach me.  But I can surely advise how it's supposed to work.\n\n**Flying:** As long as you don't mind peeing on your hand, you might be able to make this work. At the very least, it'll be entertaining.  I've refused to pee, so I only get red sparks and Ghost Blonds in Sailor Suits.\n\n**Scaring people to death**:  Yep, you could learn to do that.  I'll send Cholita over to teach this one.\n\n**Seances:** Grab some cigars, a bowl of mercury, and gaze into the middle.  With some practice, a spirit will emerge from the bowl.  Will anyone else see it?  I have no idea.  But it's quite a sight to see, and being a witch doing a seance, you'll be able to find out for  all of us whether you can make someone see it.    If they don't, you can tell them they have to silence their mind.  No one can do that, so you're safe.  But if they *do* see it, wow. You're in the money.\n\n**Making someone fall in love with you:** I can't help with that one. But I can surely show you how to make it so that you don't care anymore.  We only cling to things when we're poverty stricken.\n\nMeaning, if you are changing worlds nightly, and playing with spirits, you won't care so much about the whole mating ritual thing.\n\nPlus, you can have Brad Pitt if you want (Cholita's favorite), by teaching your familiar spirit to use that shape.\n\nSize doesn't matter with familiar spirits.\n\nAnd, you can have sex with him all you want.\n\nIt'll be a little creepy and you'll probably have to go to sleep and wait for him.   But once he has you in his arms, and starts kissing, you'll have to insist to get him to let go.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Witches Welcome", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_czs1jq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1567640998.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1567636900.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got a new witch reading in here occasionally.

But they&amp;#39;re deathly afraid of falling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They need someone they can trust around, or they&amp;#39;ll stop at the first scary climb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed partly because they have periods, their assemblage points are a bit looser than men.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also because of that, they know how horrible things can get, if you get into the wrong mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That makes them more cautious than men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no wonder than that Carlos gathered women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe no wonder that this subreddit should also encourage women more than it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/czs1jq/witches_welcome/ez63127/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1567708599.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_czs1jq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_czs1jq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ezqwiul", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ezqol6e", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Exhaustion?\n\nPlus dark energy.

When you stop being afraid (get used to new positions of the assemblage point), events that might trigger a run for the bathtub are manageable, and you can just relax and trust that nothing bad can happen.\n\nDon Juan kind of explained it when he said that the ancient sorcerers who were eaten alive by competitors, cutting off their flesh in pieces using tiny knives, should have just resigned themselves to their deaths. Then they wouldn't be afraid.\n\nSo best tip: If some energetic event happens, such as an assemblage point shift, think of the fear you experience as simply being an energy release from the new position. Don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a sudden health problem. You\u2019ll relax, and the shift will slow down a bit, making it easier to follow.\n\nHowever, people who write to me and actually take my advice and practice more, seem to have run-ins with fear at least as often as I did. Some even stop practicing for years, out of fear.\n\nI don't think you can avoid it, except possibly by doing a complete recapitulation. And that's likely not possible until you find your \"usher\" event, as recently posted, so that you can literally relive the memories as you recapitulate.\n\nI've also learned recently that inorganic beings come at different energy levels, and if you learn to gaze in darkness you can prejudge how much energy they have, by how bright they look in their \"real\" form.  The form when they aren't reflecting back your own ideas on what they should look like.\n\nThe Fairy I picked up was bright enough to be obvious, but only a few speckles in her were actually bright enough to say they were \u201cburning\u201d.\n\nAnd she was sort of friendly. Very expressive, with obvious hints of emotion in her face.\n\nThe weird judge figure I picked up, and held in the air by using abstract dreaming, was quite bright. A good half of him was like an intense blue flame.\n\nThat guy was dopey. Like Zoltar, the mechanical fortune teller. You could see that his face was human, but it was devoid of any feelings.

When you stop being afraid (get used to new positions of the assemblage point), events that might trigger a run for the bathtub are manageable, and you can just relax and trust that nothing bad can happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan kind of explained it when he said that the ancient sorcerers who were eaten alive by competitors, cutting off their flesh in pieces using tiny knives, should have just resigned themselves to their deaths. Then they wouldn&amp;#39;t be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So best tip: If some energetic event happens, such as an assemblage point shift, think of the fear you experience as simply being an energy release from the new position. Don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a sudden health problem. You\u2019ll relax, and the shift will slow down a bit, making it easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, people who write to me and actually take my advice and practice more, seem to have run-ins with fear at least as often as I did. Some even stop practicing for years, out of fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think you can avoid it, except possibly by doing a complete recapitulation. And that&amp;#39;s likely not possible until you find your &amp;quot;usher&amp;quot; event, as recently posted, so that you can literally relive the memories as you recapitulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also learned recently that inorganic beings come at different energy levels, and if you learn to gaze in darkness you can prejudge how much energy they have, by how bright they look in their &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; form.  The form when they aren&amp;#39;t reflecting back your own ideas on what they should look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fairy I picked up was bright enough to be obvious, but only a few speckles in her were actually bright enough to say they were \u201cburning\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she was sort of friendly. Very expressive, with obvious hints of emotion in her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weird judge figure I picked up, and held in the air by using abstract dreaming, was quite bright. A good half of him was like an intense blue flame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That guy was dopey. Like Zoltar, the mechanical fortune teller. You could see that his face was human, but it was devoid of any feelings. It was even a little retarded looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos&amp;#39; allies burn like the sun.

Everything's so complicated and difficult. \n\nI hope I shamed a few people into being more sober, with that account. At least, please remove the Eagle feathers from your cap.  \n\nSo far Cholita has agreed to pee in her hands (God bless women!), as long as we don't fly too high when attempting La Gorda's flying technique.\n\nShe'll enter dreaming with me, but only with permission.  \n    \nAnd she'll gaze at a mirror in the fountain, but she doesn't want any mirrors in her bedroom. \n\nAs she said, \"You know about mirrors don't you???\"\n\nI suggested, you mean inorganic beings can emerge from them?\n\nNo, she said. \n\nYou mean, you get up in the morning and don't like what you see?\n\nNO!!!!!!!, she said.\n\nAnd she wouldn't explain.  That was too insulting.\n\nUnfortunately, she's filled with tidbits from the witches, and I can't unlock them.\n\nShe even had some things in her suitcases and boxes, directly from the inner circle of women.  At least 3 objects, but I don't know from how many women. \n\nI only find out about such things by accident, when she sees something similar while we're out scouting.\n\nShe's decided to take all of her stuff out, and put what she's going to keep in her pink room. \n\nShe also has a blue room that she hasn't thought about yet. It has a trap door, and there's a dirt basement under the house.  \n\nI have plans for that too.  Maybe dirt coffins?  Or bury yourself to save up energy?\n\nShe tossed the unwanted things from her suitcases,  into the garbage bin. \n\nI'm sweating whether I should remove and save them, or take her word as law.  \n\nI haven't even dared to look further down than what's obvious on the top.  I saw fur there.  \n\nThe last time I looked deep in my garbage bin, Cholita had an elaborate spell hiding down there. I barely touched it, and my hand had glitter all over it for days.  My hands and bed ended up covered in glitter also.\n\nI have until Thursday to decide. The garbage is emptied then.\n\nShe seems to be breaking all connections with Carlos' group of sorcerers.\n\nAt dinner I suggested, \"You're Florinda now, Cholita.\"\n\nShe gave me a weird look.\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1570492572.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f2yd67h", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yea, except that I&amp;#39;ve done that before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My fairy looked like that at first, when I was trying to convert her to a cat so I could jokingly call it a &amp;quot;familiar spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People react badly when you tell them you play with demons all night long.

At least, please remove the Eagle feathers from your cap.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far Cholita has agreed to pee in her hands (God bless women!), as long as we don&amp;#39;t fly too high when attempting La Gorda&amp;#39;s flying technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;ll enter dreaming with me, but only with permission.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she&amp;#39;ll gaze at a mirror in the fountain, but she doesn&amp;#39;t want any mirrors in her bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she said, &amp;quot;You know about mirrors don&amp;#39;t you???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggested, you mean inorganic beings can emerge from them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, she said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You mean, you get up in the morning and don&amp;#39;t like what you see?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NO!!!!!!!, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she wouldn&amp;#39;t explain.  That was too insulting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, she&amp;#39;s filled with tidbits from the witches, and I can&amp;#39;t unlock them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even had some things in her suitcases and boxes, directly from the inner circle of women.  At least 3 objects, but I don&amp;#39;t know from how many women. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only find out about such things by accident, when she sees something similar while we&amp;#39;re out scouting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s decided to take all of her stuff out, and put what she&amp;#39;s going to keep in her pink room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She also has a blue room that she hasn&amp;#39;t thought about yet. It has a trap door, and there&amp;#39;s a dirt basement under the house.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have plans for that too.  Maybe dirt coffins?  Or bury yourself to save up energy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tossed the unwanted things from her suitcases,  into the garbage bin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sweating whether I should remove and save them, or take her word as law.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t even dared to look further down than what&amp;#39;s obvious on the top.  I saw fur there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time I looked deep in my garbage bin, Cholita had an elaborate spell hiding down there. I barely touched it, and my hand had glitter all over it for days.  My hands and bed ended up covered in glitter also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have until Thursday to decide. The garbage is emptied then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She seems to be breaking all connections with Carlos&amp;#39; group of sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At dinner I suggested, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re Florinda now, Cholita.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gave me a weird look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_czs1jq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/czs1jq/witches_welcome/f2yd67h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1570489454.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f2xw3pf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1570483217.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_czs1jq", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "This is the stereotypical witch gloss that almost all of us are saddled with culturally:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SekmBjj5yEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsZGXss02yo) 1 min 11 sec", "edited": 1631323824.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f2xw3pf", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the stereotypical witch gloss that almost all of us are saddled with culturally:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsZGXss02yo\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SekmBjj5yEY&lt;/a&gt;

The worst outcome of the Harry Potter movies came to pass.\n\nI wish my niece would ask me again. She\u2019s old enough that I could teach her sorcery.\n\nBut she\u2019s grown up to be an angry politics person, easily offended by everything around her.\n\nSorcery would offend her too.  And if somehow she overcame that, it wouldn't matter. Angry politics uses up all of our extra energy.\n\nCholita has a theory, that it's by plan.  Some kind of hidden \"fliers\" government.  Carlos sort of talked like that in class from time to time. \n\nMyself, I don't believe in the fliers.\n\nAside from witches still being burned and tortured in places like Papua New Guinea, we have social rules designed to put an instant end to any exploration outside the bubble of the Tonal.  We don't need any fliers to keep us stupid.\n\nWorse, the rules are designed to prevent you from looking in the first place.  They\u2019ve broken our connection to *intent*.\n\nBut it won\u2019t be obvious how oppressive things are until you do something magical, an astounding feat perhaps, and find out you have no one to tell it to.\n\nInstead of \u201cOh my God, you mean that\u2019s really possible???\u201d, you get weird looks, and future whispers behind your back. If those are business associates, I hope you\u2019re the one with the money because you\u2019ve just been downgraded.\n\nAnd as they say in Russia, if you show any weakness the evil eyes will be on you.  \n\nSorcery is considered mental illness.  A weakness.  Something\u2019s broken. It needs to be fixed.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of blockage we\u2019ve absorbed into our internal dialogues. It\u2019ll actually cause you to do a \u201cdouble take\u201d and make things go away, when you first start to be able to assemble other worlds.\n\nThe oppression goes a lot further than you can guess. Even to the energetic level.\n\nOn the other hand, how cool is it to do something and no one believes it\u2019s possible!\n\nWhy be offended if someone calls your account of an event that really happened, \u201cdelusional\u201d? \n\nThe correct response should be, \u201cYou really mean that?  Thanks!  It\u2019s nice to get recognized.\u201d\n\nLast night I was trying to pull an inorganic being from some kind of geometric muck. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was an entity, or a detail on the design.\n\nIt was the only \u201cbeing\u201d I could find in the darkness. \n\nThe others are all gone.  I tried hard to find them. Nothing.\n\nThis one is pretty pathetic. Even more lifeless than Zoltar.\n\n It doesn\u2019t even animate.  \n\nBut it\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nI\u2019ve lost the ones I had as a result of Cholita.  I don\u2019t know why.  \n\nBut she\u2019s given me other more interesting things to do.  She\u2019s a huge net gain.\n\nShe\u2019s also caused me to realize, without the help of an inorganic being it\u2019s a lot more difficult to get the assemblage point to move.\n\nSo here\u2019s the situation for some of you. \n\nI mean, how I expect it to go down when you first discover I\u2019m not making things up.  This is based on the experiences of multiple people.\n\nWhen you first get fully silent, you\u2019ll be ok.  The assemblage point will eventually move and every position will be a new one for you,  releasing a tasty chunk of energy.\n\nThat\u2019ll make cool things happen. \n\nIt might take an hour of silence the first time, but eventually you\u2019ll be able to force good enough silence to get it to move in a few minutes. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten it down to as little as 30 seconds, but that was when I\u2019d been practicing hours a day, for weeks.\n\nAnd each time you make that kind of crazy effort (trying for 1 full hour of no thoughts)  your silence abilities will improve.  \n\nEven if you fail miserably.  Don\u2019t fret. No effort to get silent is a waste.  You\u2019ll see the results the next day.\n\nDoes that mean you get cooler and cooler experiences?\n\nNo, unfortunately. \n\nYou\u2019ve used up the available energy in new positions of the assemblage point which are easily accessible.  Each time you get a cool thing to happen, that energy is reduced to nearly nothing.\n\nIt\u2019ll charge back up, but not anytime soon.\n\nSo it remains the same difficulty level, just about each time.  \n\nIt will be just as hard tonight, as it was the first time.\n\nThe main thing is, now you know something will happen. \n\nIt\u2019s not quite as bad as starting all over.\n\nWhat we really need is a Nagual, to move our assemblage points for us.  \n\nCholita only refers to Carlos as \u201cthe Nagual\u201d, which was undoubtedly taught to her by the witches.\n\nThere\u2019s surely another clue about women in that fact, but I don\u2019t get it yet. Respect is part of commitment for women?\n\nUnfortunately, our Nagual that can move assemblage points is gone.  \n\n The only thing we can do is use the \u201cnagual\u201d itself.   \n\nNot the man. The second attention.\n\nLooking at **anything** coming from the second attention, while maintaining silence, will move the assemblage point.\n\nSo one way of looking at it is, we are in fact still relying on the nagual to move it. \n\nWithout the nagual, there is no game.  Maybe that ominous warning from Carlos\u2019 books has a double meaning?\n\nWe\u2019ve just had to improvise and use the impersonal version of the nagual.\n\nI should add that tensegrity is different. It pushes the assemblage point because of the way it\u2019s designed.  And it\u2019ll push it, even if you aren\u2019t aware of that.\n\nBut for gazing at colors in the darkness, as a primary way to move the assemblage point, you need the nagual. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t hurt with the tensegrity too!  But I'll wait for the experts to give advice on how to add the nagual to Tensegrity.\n\nUsing the nagual to move the assemblage point is even more effective if you have an inorganic being to help you.\n\nWithout one, it\u2019s taking me 3 times as long to get it to come loose.\n\nI suspect that the inorganic being doesn\u2019t actually move it for you, although they\u2019ve been known to swoop and strike your back.\n\nLast night I had one brushing on my right shoulder. It was as solid and real as if someone had been dragging a rag across my shoulder.  \n\n20 years ago, I would have jumped out of the bed to search for a tarantula or scorpion.  Or any insect big enough to be walking on my shoulder like that.\n\nBut now I know, it\u2019s just a visitor. \n\nIt didn\u2019t move my assemblage point, so I have no idea what that was about.\n\nThe main way inorganics help move the assemblage point is by simply being visible.\n\nYou can literally see them. \n\nThat\u2019s far more intense than a simple view of the second attention as a patch of color or a line in darkness.\n\nMaybe the inorganics are simply mesmerizing? Maybe they don\u2019t actually help move the assemblage point, most of the time.\n\nThey just give you something to watch which is easier to concentrate on.  \n\nIt\u2019s harder to think about the electric bill, with a corpse\u2019s head floating in front of your eyes.\n\nOr a cute Disney fairy.\n\nThat\u2019s why I suggest everyone here make it a hobby to find an inorganic being, once you can scoop colors.\n\nI\u2019d say, make it a priority, but no one who\u2019s written to me so far has captured an inorganic being.\n\nSo a hobby perhaps.\n\nIf you want to do that,  learn to form \u201cthe wall\u201d.\n\nFrom there, you\u2019ll figure out how to find inorganic beings. \n\nOne method is to let \u201cthe wall\u201d go 360, and surround you.  And see what shows up on the walls.\n\nYou don't have to do anything to make it go 360. Just notice it in front of you, then see if you can find details like that on the other walls of the room.  Once you have a 360 \"wall\", you'll be offered all kinds of cool things.\n\nEdited", "edited": 1571947211.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f51rxm7", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always thought that idea of normal people being dangerous to sorcerers was a bit overblown in Carlos\u2019 books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe it only seems that way because we&amp;#39;re steeped in the oppressive rules and think they&amp;#39;re normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I used to tell my little niece, who was a big Harry Potter fan and asked me about magic, \u201cThe death eaters won.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s our current situation.  The worst outcome of the Harry Potter movies came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish my niece would ask me again. She\u2019s old enough that I could teach her sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she\u2019s grown up to be an angry politics person, easily offended by everything around her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery would offend her too.  And if somehow she overcame that, it wouldn&amp;#39;t matter. Angry politics uses up all of our extra energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has a theory, that it&amp;#39;s by plan.  Some kind of hidden &amp;quot;fliers&amp;quot; government.  Carlos sort of talked like that in class from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I don&amp;#39;t believe in the fliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from witches still being burned and tortured in places like Papua New Guinea, we have social rules designed to put an instant end to any exploration outside the bubble of the Tonal.  We don&amp;#39;t need any fliers to keep us stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, the rules are designed to prevent you from looking in the first place.  They\u2019ve broken our connection to &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it won\u2019t be obvious how oppressive things are until you do something magical, an astounding feat perhaps, and find out you have no one to tell it to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of \u201cOh my God, you mean that\u2019s really possible???\u201d, you get weird looks, and future whispers behind your back. If those are business associates, I hope you\u2019re the one with the money because you\u2019ve just been downgraded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as they say in Russia, if you show any weakness the evil eyes will be on you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is considered mental illness.  A weakness.  Something\u2019s broken. It needs to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the kind of blockage we\u2019ve absorbed into our internal dialogues. It\u2019ll actually cause you to do a \u201cdouble take\u201d and make things go away, when you first start to be able to assemble other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The oppression goes a lot further than you can guess. Even to the energetic level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, how cool is it to do something and no one believes it\u2019s possible!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why be offended if someone calls your account of an event that really happened, \u201cdelusional\u201d? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The correct response should be, \u201cYou really mean that?  Thanks!  It\u2019s nice to get recognized.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I was trying to pull an inorganic being from some kind of geometric muck. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was an entity, or a detail on the design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the only \u201cbeing\u201d I could find in the darkness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The others are all gone.  I tried hard to find them. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one is pretty pathetic. Even more lifeless than Zoltar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t even animate.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve lost the ones I had as a result of Cholita.  I don\u2019t know why.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she\u2019s given me other more interesting things to do.  She\u2019s a huge net gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s also caused me to realize, without the help of an inorganic being it\u2019s a lot more difficult to get the assemblage point to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here\u2019s the situation for some of you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, how I expect it to go down when you first discover I\u2019m not making things up.  This is based on the experiences of multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you first get fully silent, you\u2019ll be ok.  The assemblage point will eventually move and every position will be a new one for you,  releasing a tasty chunk of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019ll make cool things happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might take an hour of silence the first time, but eventually you\u2019ll be able to force good enough silence to get it to move in a few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve gotten it down to as little as 30 seconds, but that was when I\u2019d been practicing hours a day, for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And each time you make that kind of crazy effort (trying for 1 full hour of no thoughts)  your silence abilities will improve.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you fail miserably.  Don\u2019t fret. No effort to get silent is a waste.  You\u2019ll see the results the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does that mean you get cooler and cooler experiences?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ve used up the available energy in new positions of the assemblage point which are easily accessible.  Each time you get a cool thing to happen, that energy is reduced to nearly nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019ll charge back up, but not anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it remains the same difficulty level, just about each time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will be just as hard tonight, as it was the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing is, now you know something will happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not quite as bad as starting all over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we really need is a Nagual, to move our assemblage points for us.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita only refers to Carlos as \u201cthe Nagual\u201d, which was undoubtedly taught to her by the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s surely another clue about women in that fact, but I don\u2019t get it yet. Respect is part of commitment for women?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our Nagual that can move assemblage points is gone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing we can do is use the \u201cnagual\u201d itself.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the man.

So you &amp;quot;accumulate&amp;quot; seconds over time, meaning you drive yourself nuts trying to shut it off, but in the long run you get the benefit of all of that effort, even if at the time it seems wasted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_czs1jq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/czs1jq/witches_welcome/ez5i7t4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1567699789.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ez5r5i8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1567703464.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ez4bsyi", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; P.S. we're all pulling for you to get better Cholita!\n\nCholita's on a mini-vacation, testing if she can live on her own without ending up in jail.\n\nI'll give her the good wishes when she calls for help.

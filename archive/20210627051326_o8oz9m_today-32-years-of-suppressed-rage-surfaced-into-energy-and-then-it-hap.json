I did last night, up to a half hour after it happened.   But it&amp;#39;s all gone now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had an unusual feature.  When in the form of a ball of light, it was brown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the darkroom they&amp;#39;re commonly pinkish when just a floating disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And outdoors in sunlight, I&amp;#39;ve only seen blue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had a brown ball following him around to private class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of exposure to that inorganic being, my silence reached a level so deep, I was watching my luminous shell for a very long time, and seeing all the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I concluded, seeming emanations is automatic with darkroom.  We&amp;#39;re just gradually notice more and move of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;#39;t see them directly, perhaps they are simply that whitish light on walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Seeing Energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as your vision gets more refined (you don&amp;#39;t choke on book deals in your mind), you see that the whitish light is not uniform, and the pieces look suspiciously like emanations that have stuck together a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if &amp;quot;microbundles&amp;quot; was a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that we reach to microbundles the same way we react to inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We supply enough intent to make it &amp;quot;look like something&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that, it&amp;#39;s not really the IOBs who try to deceive us with their appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just the emanations.  If you have a full sized bundle, you get a stable world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A single emanation can give off a &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe if  you have a  nice quantity, but not enough for a &amp;quot;bundle&amp;quot;, you fill in the details using intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not just with IOBs.  In all situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o8oz9m/today_32_years_of_suppressed_rage_surfaced_into/h3bqral/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1624891823.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_o8oz9m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h36p3mn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Famous_Department", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1624773532.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_o8oz9m", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_63zol2sm", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "what do you mean?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h36p3mn", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;what do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o8oz9m/today_32_years_of_suppressed_rage_surfaced_into/h36p3mn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1624773532.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_o8oz9m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_o8oz9m", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h379eva", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "AutoModerator", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1624792478.0, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t1_h379euj", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Your comment has been automatically removed because your account does not meet our account-age requirement of 35 days.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

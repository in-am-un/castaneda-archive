It's been a long time.  And it could have been Carol or Florinda.\n\nEither way, it seems to have been a variation on \"the wall\".  Possibly it came up, because Carlos was writing that sentence at the time, and people got advanced copies.\n\nIf anyone wonders why that would work in full daylight, looking at a blue sky, but also in complete darkness, as I've been advising,  just consider what's going on.\n\nWatching ANYTHING coming from the second attention, while you are silent, will drift the assemblage point.\n\nWhen it drifts far enough, your dreaming attention is activated at the same time as your waking attention.\n\nThe one becomes superimposed on the other.  Sort of.\n\nIt's a little more \"switchy\" than that, most of the time. Focus on one, see that, focus on the other, see that other.  It's easy to switch back and forth, so it can even feel like both are present at the same time.\n\nBut how to find something coming from the second attention, so you can gaze at it?\n\nYou can confuse the Tonal, like when Carlos saw that red rag, and thought it was a wounded animal.\n\nBelieving it was  a wounded animal set up a conflict with the Tonal, and I supposed the Nagual comes out to assist.\n\nCarlos used to talk about \"cognitive dissonance\".  Or, obviously, \"not doing\".\n\nMaybe it's sort of in that range.\n\nYou confuse the Tonal, and the second attention can come out.\n\nIt might explain why people often choose ferns to gaze at. The pattern can recombine to confuse the Tonal.\n\nWhen it's confused, it either lets the second attention out to help, or it's not blocked anymore.\n\nWho knows which.  Terrible pity no one can answer that for us yet. It's been 20 frigging years!\n\nBut you can also starve the Tonal, to lure out the second attention.\n\nGive it NOTHING.\n\nI guess it gets bored, so out comes the second attention, to play.\n\nOr, there's nothing to mask what's already there.  The second attention leaking out into what you believe to be your normal view of things becomes more obvious.\n\nWhen it's perfectly dark, you can identify it.  Anything at all, which you see, has to be from the second attention.\n\nBecause there's absolutely no light available.\n\nAt first you doubt what you see is even worth mentioning.  Don't. Keep gazing.  Even if nothing supernatural  happens, you'll suffer horribly trying to remain silent, and your \"silence muscles\" will be stronger the next day.\n\nNote the suffer horribly part...\n\nYes.  You will.  Tough luck.\n\nYou'll also be rewarded tremendously.  I just helped the Chinese bosses' son buy a car 60 miles away.\n\nIt took too long, and I ended up walking around in an empty lot next door.\n\nExcept, it wasn't empty!!!\n\nGet my drift?\n\nYou'll be rewarded for learning silence.\n\nThat's part of why, I supposed, that enlightened people aren't supposed to get bored.\n\nThe idea of enlightenment has been hyped up to agree with the Asian social hierarchy.\n\nBut it's a real experience, even if it isn't permanent.\n\nIn the case of gazing at sky, you haven't removed all the light.  But if it's perfectly smooth blue sky, you've removed all the details.\n\nIf you see ANY details, those come from the second attention.\n\nThus sky gazing to form \"the wall\", consists of watching for details in that perfectly flat blue surface.\n\nPat (probably) described seeing worm shapes.\n\nAt the time I thought the worm shapes were key to the technique.  But that's probably a lot like Carlos writing about that pomegranate dot being necessary to read off the wall.\n\nIf it is, it's hidden under the sworl I see, and  I haven't been fast enough to notice it.  Because I read off the wall anytime I want to put in the time, and don't get lured into assembling another world instead.\n\nIn general I'd say, whatever account you read in Carlos books, go ahead and look for that.\n\nBut if you find something else along the way, go with that instead.\n\nIf you want a pomegranate dot, be satisfied with Kale mush as long as it produces a cool result.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1576463418.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fb31x0n", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Such an interplay manifested itself in terms of hues that were projected  on any horizon in the world of everyday life, be it a mountain, the  sky, a wall, or simply the palms of the hands&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That explains the sky gazing technique Taisha showed to Pat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it was Pat.

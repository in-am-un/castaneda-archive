That way when we are gone the ally is free. Castaneda gives a couple of examples of working with inorganic beings, like catching an underworld being using a mirror and frame while working in a stream or when Castaneda returns to Mexico after his jump and he's trying to transfer Don Juan's ally to himself or La Gorda (I think it was La Gorda).

But the allies are more likely to hang out there, which could be good if you don\u2019t yet have one of your own.  The allies are a gigantic boost for the second attention. Their desire to interact with us automatically makes them help out if you\u2019re trying to accomplish a sorcery feat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know how to resolve that.  Is water good or bad for sorcerers?  Is the fact that its antithetical to the second attention why you plunge yourself into a bathtub when you get into trouble in the second attention?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s worth noting that towards the end of his life, Carlos was plagued by the allies trying to pull him into a watery world.  He said they find any weakness and pull on it, like a thread.   His weakness was his fatal illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_b4wayu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/b4wayu/making_an_ally/emg57ud/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1556925423.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1556925423.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "emfk36v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1556910439.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eja787y", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Allies attracted to water in Texas's \"Big Thicket\" Power Spot:\n\n\"...in 2007, one of the mysterious big cats (or alternately Sasquatch) was seen by a wildlife officer, as it drank from a small pool of water deep in the Thicket.

You could do all that.   Might be really hard to pull it off however.\n\nPeople have odd expectations of the allies. Carlos created that!  We started off with something you could only get by puffing on don Juan\u2019s clay bong, using his magical, and impossible to make, smoking mixture.\n\nThat gave people the idea that the allies are \"out there\", and have to be found and conquered.  Note:  Inorganic being != Ally.  Or /= if you prefer.\n\nBy his last books, the Allies are just something that can show up whenever you want them, and actually have no fixed appearance other than a beam of light.\n\nI deal with the allies all the time. It's horribly frightening to encounter them in the real world. I avoid it like the plague.    But finding them only in dreaming isn't very convincing.\n\nAs far as I know, despite interacting with them myself hundreds of times, they don't really exist.  It could simply be something our own mind can create, which is useful as a construct for learning sorcery.  Consider Carlos\u2019 \u201creading off the wall\u201d technique.  You watch a purple mist, and text forms!  And you can read what it says.  He gave an entire mini-lecture reading that text.\n\nBut where does the text come from?  It has to be from you.  From the conscious part of your brain, which is always thinking, even when you\u2019re obsessed with your own internal dialogue.\n\nIs the ally just a physical manifestation of Carlos\u2019 text?\n\nI would have said maybe that's so, a year ago.  But since then I've been working on techniques to allow me to interact with them anytime that I want.  Also, to allow me to share them with others, since we don't really know if you have to be introduced to them, or not.\n\nCarlos made a big deal out of introducing them to us.  But how I could introduce them to someone else, just to \"make sure\" they had the real thing, is beyond me. I tried stuffing one into an Indian basket from Morongo reservation where Carlos possibly started his search for sorcerers.   It contained a relic Carlos gave most of us in class. I thought it might help confine them.  Or even that he\u2019d passed them on to us, by asking us to polish those objects.\n\nI succeeded too.  Got one in the basket, covered it with my hand, and then saw it emerge from there, \u201cproving\u201d it was actually inside.\n\nBut their behavior changed so much after that, I had to abandon it.  I seem to have pissed them off by trying to send them somewhere else.\n\nI guess I can\u2019t mail the allies to someone.\n\nThe person I was going to mail them to was surprised when he heard I was doing that. He expected that the allies are some certain size, and the idea of holding one in your hand and stuffing it into a basket, likely seemed a little off to him.    For a few weeks that is.  He continued trying to learn to get silent, saw some hypnogogic images as a result, then understood how that technique can be done.  You aren\u2019t stuffing the ally, you\u2019re stuffing a mini-dream into which it was nice enough to make a guest appearance.\n\nI switched to just exploiting that effect.  I mean, creating self-contained mini-dreams while awake with eyes open.  I could summon them without bringing them into the real world, so I could experiment with what they can do.\n\nAnd they responded.  I get smiles, odd facial expressions, costume changes. They\u2019re highly interactive now.  Try that with your normally induced hypnogogic images. I never saw them being that interactive.\n\nBut doing that also meant, they had a presence in the real world, even if I managed to keep them on the other end of a glass wall.\n\nAs a result, instead of coming out into the real world, they\u2019ve come up with a way to manipulate it.  It\u2019s the darndest thing I ever saw.  They\u2019ll touch me on the shoulder as concretely as if a large moth or spider had landed there.  Oddly, it\u2019s not shocking. I feel it, as if someone I knew was behind me, and ran their fingers over my shoulder, affectionately.  I double check that I feel it, it\u2019s not just a muscle twitch, I check again to try to figure out what real thing it could be, look up and down for spiders or moths.  But I find nothing,  and move on.\n\nApparently, they can brush up against you in the real world. Or project that feeling.\n\nBut they can do even more than that.  I\u2019ll be in the other room, and hear something fall to the floor.  It\u2019ll turn out to be something I touched before I left the room, but the idea that I could have knocked it, so that it was very slowly slipping off the edge and would fall 30 seconds later, is hard to swallow.  I\u2019ve never seen anything that was headed for falling, moving that slowly.\n\nLast night I pulled back the shower curtain in the bathroom. I keep it closed to block light from the bathroom window, so that it can\u2019t seep down the hallway and into my darkened bedroom.  My house is very dark.  Usually I prefer feeling my way around, rather than having bright lights.\n\nJust as I pulled the curtain back, what seemed to be a very large bug quickly darted down into the bathtub. It was up at the top near the shower head, just a foot or two away from me. It seemed to be startled by the shower curtain, and jumped down. But the \u201cinsect\u201d was absolutely black.  No details of any kind.  It was like a mini-black hole in space. And it was gone when I looked down into the tub, to find out what it was.\n\nLater I returned to turn on the water in the bathtub.  The water comes out below in a faucet, but you can pull up on something to change it to shower mode (a common thing).  As I turned on the water and it began to flow, a gigantic drop, the size of a golf ball, fell from the side of the faucet, and plumped down into the bottom at an odd angle.  There was even something conscious about how it moved, like it was directing the course, and gravity couldn\u2019t stop it.  But no sound. A drop that size would have made a sound when it hit.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem possible for a ball of water to break off like that, especially in that size, and staying together like it was solid, the entire time it was falling. \b\b It maintained it\u2019s round drop shape the whole time. And how can something the size of a golf ball, assume a classic \"drop\" shape?\n\nI turned the water off and back on in various ways, but no drops ever did anything like that, and none were even 1/100th the size of that one.\n\nAll I could think about was Carlos pointing out the allies in class, and saying they liked the water cooler and tended to hang out there.\n\nI have no doubt you could learn to do what you say.  Please do, and report the techniques you used.\n\nAs for opening up a crack in the world, that\u2019s not as hard as it sounds.  I\u2019ve done it multiple ways.  The problem with it is, things can come through.  Or, they can try to convince you to come in to their side.  I once saw Carlos' 2 allies (the one in pajamas and his shy friend), just inside a tunnel of light I opened up, with silence and gazing techniques.\n\nHis mouth was moving frantically, and his fingers were curled up, while he gestured with his hands like a shady politician.  His buddy was hiding just behind him, peeking his head out at his  hip.\n\nI was fully awake, with my eyes open. I got the impression he was trying to tell me how to get back to there, because he knew the portal would not stay open much longer.  But there was no sound from his voice.\n\nEdited for errors, and to protect the innocent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "edited": 1553472482.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eja787y", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!  You could do all that.   Might be really hard to pull it off however.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People have odd expectations of the allies. Carlos created that!  We started off with something you could only get by puffing on don Juan\u2019s clay bong, using his magical, and impossible to make, smoking mixture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gave people the idea that the allies are &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot;, and have to be found and conquered.  Note:  Inorganic being != Ally.  Or /= if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By his last books, the Allies are just something that can show up whenever you want them, and actually have no fixed appearance other than a beam of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I deal with the allies all the time. It&amp;#39;s horribly frightening to encounter them in the real world. I avoid it like the plague.    But finding them only in dreaming isn&amp;#39;t very convincing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, despite interacting with them myself hundreds of times, they don&amp;#39;t really exist.  It could simply be something our own mind can create, which is useful as a construct for learning sorcery.  Consider Carlos\u2019 \u201creading off the wall\u201d technique.  You watch a purple mist, and text forms!  And you can read what it says.  He gave an entire mini-lecture reading that text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But where does the text come from?  It has to be from you.  From the conscious part of your brain, which is always thinking, even when you\u2019re obsessed with your own internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the ally just a physical manifestation of Carlos\u2019 text?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would have said maybe that&amp;#39;s so, a year ago.  But since then I&amp;#39;ve been working on techniques to allow me to interact with them anytime that I want.  Also, to allow me to share them with others, since we don&amp;#39;t really know if you have to be introduced to them, or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos made a big deal out of introducing them to us.  But how I could introduce them to someone else, just to &amp;quot;make sure&amp;quot; they had the real thing, is beyond me. I tried stuffing one into an Indian basket from Morongo reservation where Carlos possibly started his search for sorcerers.   It contained a relic Carlos gave most of us in class. I thought it might help confine them.  Or even that he\u2019d passed them on to us, by asking us to polish those objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I succeeded too.  Got one in the basket, covered it with my hand, and then saw it emerge from there, \u201cproving\u201d it was actually inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But their behavior changed so much after that, I had to abandon it.  I seem to have pissed them off by trying to send them somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I can\u2019t mail the allies to someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The person I was going to mail them to was surprised when he heard I was doing that. He expected that the allies are some certain size, and the idea of holding one in your hand and stuffing it into a basket, likely seemed a little off to him.    For a few weeks that is.  He continued trying to learn to get silent, saw some hypnogogic images as a result, then understood how that technique can be done.  You aren\u2019t stuffing the ally, you\u2019re stuffing a mini-dream into which it was nice enough to make a guest appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I switched to just exploiting that effect.  I mean, creating self-contained mini-dreams while awake with eyes open.  I could summon them without bringing them into the real world, so I could experiment with what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they responded.  I get smiles, odd facial expressions, costume changes. They\u2019re highly interactive now.  Try that with your normally induced hypnogogic images. I never saw them being that interactive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But doing that also meant, they had a presence in the real world, even if I managed to keep them on the other end of a glass wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, instead of coming out into the real world, they\u2019ve come up with a way to manipulate it.  It\u2019s the darndest thing I ever saw.  They\u2019ll touch me on the shoulder as concretely as if a large moth or spider had landed there.  Oddly, it\u2019s not shocking. I feel it, as if someone I knew was behind me, and ran their fingers over my shoulder, affectionately.  I double check that I feel it, it\u2019s not just a muscle twitch, I check again to try to figure out what real thing it could be, look up and down for spiders or moths.  But I find nothing,  and move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, they can brush up against you in the real world. Or project that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they can do even more than that.  I\u2019ll be in the other room, and hear something fall to the floor.  It\u2019ll turn out to be something I touched before I left the room, but the idea that I could have knocked it, so that it was very slowly slipping off the edge and would fall 30 seconds later, is hard to swallow.  I\u2019ve never seen anything that was headed for falling, moving that slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I pulled back the shower curtain in the bathroom. I keep it closed to block light from the bathroom window, so that it can\u2019t seep down the hallway and into my darkened bedroom.  My house is very dark.  Usually I prefer feeling my way around, rather than having bright lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as I pulled the curtain back, what seemed to be a very large bug quickly darted down into the bathtub. It was up at the top near the shower head, just a foot or two away from me. It seemed to be startled by the shower curtain, and jumped down. But the \u201cinsect\u201d was absolutely black.  No details of any kind.  It was like a mini-black hole in space. And it was gone when I looked down into the tub, to find out what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later I returned to turn on the water in the bathtub.  The water comes out below in a faucet, but you can pull up on something to change it to shower mode (a common thing).  As I turned on the water and it began to flow, a gigantic drop, the size of a golf ball, fell from the side of the faucet, and plumped down into the bottom at an odd angle.  There was even something conscious about how it moved, like it was directing the course, and gravity couldn\u2019t stop it.  But no sound. A drop that size would have made a sound when it hit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn\u2019t seem possible for a ball of water to break off like that, especially in that size, and staying together like it was solid, the entire time it was falling.

There is another mode, the one I am familiarizing you with: the act of perceiving the essence of everything, energy itself, directly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &lt;em&gt;To perceive the essence of everything will make us understand, classify, and describe the world in entirely new, more exciting, more sophisticated terms. Terms that correspond to sorcery truths, which have no rational foundation and no relation whatsoever to the facts of our daily world but which are self-evident truths for the sorcerers who perceive energy directly and see the essence of everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &lt;em&gt;For such sorcerers, the most significant act of sorcery is to see the essence of the universe. The essence of the universe resembles incandescent threads stretched into infinity in every conceivable direction, luminous filaments that are conscious of themselves in ways impossible for the human mind to comprehend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &lt;em&gt;From seeing the essence of the universe, sorcerers go on to see the energy essence of human beings and depict human beings as bright shapes that resemble giant eggs and call them luminous eggs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &lt;em&gt;When sorcerers see a human being they see a giant, luminous shape that floats, making, as it moves, a deep furrow in the energy of the earth, just as if the luminous shape had a taproot that was dragging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &lt;em&gt;The luminous ball is much larger than the human body. The spot of intense brilliance is part of this ball of energy, and it is located on a place at the height of the shoulder blades, an arm&amp;#39;s length from a person&amp;#39;s back. The old sorcerers named it the assemblage point after seeing what it does. It makes us perceive. In human beings, perception is assembled there, on that point. Seeing that all living beings have such a point of brilliance, the old sorcerers surmised that perception in general must take place on that spot, in whatever pertinent manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art Of Dreaming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/f7ayk0/tell_me_about_dreaming_the_don_juan_matus/fia2hh5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1582291194.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_f7ayk0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}]

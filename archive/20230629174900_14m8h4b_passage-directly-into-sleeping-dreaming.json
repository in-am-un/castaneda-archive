It's one of those crazy things you hear rumors of, in silent knowledge.\n\nThe sorcerer can't send his physical body back, because matter and time interact using \"rules\".\n\nBut the theory is that his double can alter events back then for weeks if it has a reason to.\n\nBut the altered events, will only be in the double of the person he's messing with.\n\nNa...\n\nThat can't be right!\n\nBut it seemed true at the time.

When they met Florida hadn't realized that 10 days had passed. She was totally confused and so did he. Neither of them remembered at the beginning what had happened these 10 days. Later Florida remembered her time with the witches. That happened in Florida's book.   Also we have Taisha's first book. While she is talking with Clara, suddenly they hear a loud scream and Clara runs towards the house with Manfred and says to Taisha not to move. Later at the end of the book Taisha is making the crossing. Before she does it, makes a loud scream and realizes it is that scream she heard that day. Her own scream! She goes inside on the other side of the house and see's Clara and Manfred coming inside running.    So we can't explain with logic how these things happen. But they do because they happen in a different reality.   Maybe that was exactly what happened with the grey cat and Cholita's old lady.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAh yes... Cholita's weird cat.  And the \"old lady\" who has the power to take away someone's allies.\n\nSo far, there's a weird cat that wants me to know Cholita put a spell under my car in the driveway.\n\nBut it's not the first cat that was obsessed with Cholita. The one before was an orange tom cat type, and literally had a war going with Cholita.\n\nWho made me steal bricks from the neighbor, to block it.  I couldn't buy them. They had to be stolen.\n\nBut the cat snuck through, and sprayed her luggage the way male cats can do.\n\nGrinning at me while he did it.  Behind Cholita's back. She was facing me.\n\nThen he died in a horrible giant truck accident, just weeks later. It was so terrible, the neighbors were laughing against their will as they described the cat tumbling down the street three times before it landed in the middle, absolutely dead.\n\nSpeaking of dead, there's\n\nA dead blue jay whose body parts end on display.  Over time.  The week before that, it had tried to warn me about Cholita, from up on the street light.  Wouldn't stop shouting at me.\n\nThe same one that got trapped in our fireplace, and I had to free it a year or two ago.\n\nThen, while looking for the cat who seems to wait for me where my car parks in the driveway, when I decide to go look for it at random, I found a baby skunk yesterday morning instead.\n\nBaby skunks tend not to spray, unless they feel threatened.\n\nWhen I got home I tried to ask Cholita about the situation with the strange animal behavior.\n\nBut I couldn't even start that sentence.  Just got 2 words out, and none of them were animal related.\n\nShe shouted,\n\n\"Quack!  Quack, quack, quack!!!\"\n\nThen waved her hand to dismiss me.", "edited": 1688061163.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jq0r3d9", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A question came up in private chat.

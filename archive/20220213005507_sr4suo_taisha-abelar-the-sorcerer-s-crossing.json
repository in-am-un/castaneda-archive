I  just get lynched.  Chi Gung = greed for money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, in Asia Chi gong isn&amp;#39;t even taken seriously. It&amp;#39;s a fun topic for morning talk shows, but in no way do Asians react to it as &amp;quot;mysterious&amp;quot; as westerners tend to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We fall for anything foreign! The same way Koreans fall for American TV preachers who heal on TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe westeners fall for things like chi gung, because they see $$$$$.  A franchise potential!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Clara&amp;#39;s passes really need one of us, someday, to see what they do in the deep orange zone.  Maybe create some &amp;quot;real chi gung&amp;quot; knowledge, so it spreads back into the asian pretend magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have too many &amp;quot;hobbies&amp;quot; in the darkroom already, so I can&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suspect it&amp;#39;ll be spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the effect is more like a multi-vitamin, meaning you just &amp;quot;feel better about yourself&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s a tragedy to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world is drowning in placebos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is the one to try that.

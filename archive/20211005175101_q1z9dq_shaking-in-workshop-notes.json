About what causes people to vibrate, shake, or move in the darkroom.\n\nIn the last week some workshop, lecture, or magazine article notes were posted, which explained why some people shake during darkroom gazing.\n\nI can't find it now!  Probably it wasn't where I thought it was, but one of you must recall it.\n\nCan anyone point it out?\n\nFor the longest time, perhaps a whole  year, we only had 1 or 2 of those.  People with significant movements during practicing.\n\nBut lately we have several.  So it would be good to add don Juan's explanation, to our:\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/misc\\_practices/ill\\_effects](https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/misc_practices/ill_effects)\n\nSo that when the next \"shaker\" comes along, we can point him to don Juan's words on the topic.\n\nI always thought it was a \"blue zone\" thing, but maybe not.\n\nIf anyone spent the time to read this post, here's some good advice.\n\nCarlos laid out the \"path\" for us here  in this subreddit,  24 years ago in private classes.\n\nHe actually did!\n\nI doubt anyone realized that at the time.\n\nBut look at this, and picture Carlos himself doing an imitation of it, eagerly:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\n(make sure to look at 5 minutes 22 seconds).\n\nSee the pink clouds in the background?  He was nearly taunting us with that video!  And look at how their head follows the \"puff\".\n\nAnd then there's this pass.  Picture Carlos himself doing it, while grinning eagerly as he compressed the \"goo\" in his hands.  He nearly winked at me.  I was only a few feet away.\n\nThere was a 2 week buildup, to him showing us this pass.  The women in class were instructed to make sure everyone knew he was going to finally show us some \"real magic\".  Wish I knew who put them up to that!\n\nCarlos wanted us to anticipate and value it. Even though when we saw it, nothing happened and everyone worried he'd lost it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9ncfxdtpnr71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508d89290a1a93ba1aca467c4d48fa0f76c246d5\n\nCholita taught me to make a dead person.   And I must admit, necromancing for real is fun!\n\nIt's \"Witch of Endor\" magic.\n\nI think Carlos was going for a Squirrel or small rodent.\n\nThose are easy with Devil's Weed entity around.  I've had to chase a few out of my home, because of Minx (the inorganic being).\n\nAnd then there's \"the whorl\".\n\nIt happens when the colors in the darkroom become so intense, there seems to be jet black pushing them around in the air, and the edges are on fire.\n\nAs Juann pointed out, it's easier to see dreaming visions on the edges of the puffs.\n\nRather than looking directly into the middle at first (you can after you find them on the edges).\n\nHere's a bad rendition of \"the whorl\". They're hard to draw!  The yin/yang thing was only because I could grab that image, with the real thing taking too long to portray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The whorl is upper right of pic, in \\\\\"The Wall\\\\\".](https://preview.redd.it/ol64yfvnpnr71.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122de589933b8ae9642499b2d3ab1d1a2bf6f35b)\n\nThere were many other cases of Carlos \"teaching\" us to do what we do here.\n\nBut you would have had to see them to understand it.  When he said he \"saturated\" us, he was hinting at that.  He said when the time came, we'd know which one to use.\n\nHe was pointing out this simple fact:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwpsdxelpnr71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deb8437791c9d696bdb5b34e2ac6ee2bc576ecf8\n\nSo, here's the point, courtesy of Fancy, my bad inorganic being.\n\nIf you want to move the assemblage point down, gaze \"overall\" at \"stuff that can't possibly be there\".\n\nIn general.   Don't fixate on one thing.  Just keep watching to see what comes along, and the assemblage point naturally moves down, if you are silent.\n\nBut if you want to move horizontally, you have to halt the downward movement, and move sideways instead.\n\nYou move sideways by  \"treating it as real\".\n\nHere's an example you can do yourself!\n\nMove down to where the purple puffs become intense.\n\nScoop up the biggest one you can find in your right hand, then scoop some more from above you down to that, and push them together to form a brighter ball.\n\nDon't compress it too much.  No smaller than 6 inches.\n\nNow \"grab\" the sides and stretch it out to a length of 2 feet.\n\nMore than just me has done this, so don't worry. It'll work.\n\nWhen it's 2 feet wide (a smear across space), step into it, so it gets a curve in the middle.  Pull it around your torso to make it longer, the torso being because the energy can sit there and retain brightness.\n\nNow stretch it across your room as a \"road\" floating waist high all across the room.\n\nIt's a path.  Gaze down it, and see what's along the side of the road.  Building, plants?\n\nHere's what that looks like, but I've done it with 2 different inorganic beings.  That one there is \"Fancy\".  Since I got \"Lily\" to drive a truck on the road, with the breaks out.  Just to watch her crash.  Don't worry, she doesn't mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7xqz69ipnr71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=306c434eda2f6d8a04848c5a6056e17707ab37cf\n\nTHAT'S a sideways shift of the assemblage point.\n\nIt's also NOT, \"ME, ME, ME\".\n\nIt's a dazzling sight  that doesn't fit with having the assemblage point focused only between the feet, on the ME spot.\n\nYou can't do this up at the top, at the blue line.\n\nBlue zone effects are tainted with ME.  That's one reason I dislike questions by people stuck at the blue line, but who still see \"things\" and ask what to do with them.  We get bad players with chips on their shoulders, posting that sort of thing.  Only here to make themselves feel good.\n\nBut mainly it's \"off path\".  That's all.    Might lead somewhere, but likely it only leads to more \"ME\".\n\nAnd we're the last refuge for magic right now.  Can't afford deviations.\n\nSo, what was the point of that above this point?\n\nThe path Carlos showed us in class, emphasized looking at the puffs as if they were real things.  Real objects. And \"doing\" things with them.\n\nYou \"found\" them with Tensegrity.\n\nI've notice, using tensegrity is vastly superior to \"dabbling\".\n\nDabbling would be, scoop a little while your sitting, wiggle the fingers a little.  Stand up, do 1 or 2 passes.\n\nBut then you start to \"play\" to see if you can \"make something happen\".\n\nThat's the \"lab experiment\" approach.\n\nIn some ways, it's a complete misunderstanding.\n\nI wish it weren't!  I'm a lab rat type myself.\n\nThe tensegrity path, is \"following intent\".\n\nWith not-doings.\n\nIt controls what you do, with rituals.\n\nBut the rituals align with the old seers. So they hook you to their intent.\n\nYou get yourself hooked to intent, and then use your eyes and behavior as I described.\n\nPlay with it to make it more real, but then when you succeed a bit, move on.  Keep looking overall, for more \"things\".\n\nIt's important to \"make it real\".  Fancy, an inorganic being, claims that shifts horizontally.\n\nYes, but that's not always bad, as long as you don't keep it up.\n\nYou're just \"tuning that one in better\".\n\nWhen it's tuned and brighter, move on to the next thing, so you don't stop moving down.\n\nThat's the path Carlos recommended.\n\nIf you want to know how you can be certain you did it right, find \"swirling\". If you get intense colors \"swirling\" around you, with jet black filling in, you did it right!  You're in very good shape for the orange zone.\n\nYou can stray from that \"recommended path\". I usually do.\n\nBut when I run out of dreaming energy too quickly, I always return to that \"ritualistic\" path again.\n\nTwo days of that, and I can experiment for 2 days without harm.\n\nBut if I go off experimenting only, never returning to the ritual, things get worse and worse.\n\nCholita used to fix that for me. If I got bogged down, she walked right through the wall, and caused me to \"move on\".\n\nBut she found another place to live.  Other protectors Carlos put her into contact with.\n\nSo I've had to stick to the path a little more closely.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked":

So it would be good to add don Juan&amp;#39;s explanation, to our:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/misc_practices/ill_effects\"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/misc_practices/ill_effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that when the next &amp;quot;shaker&amp;quot; comes along, we can point him to don Juan&amp;#39;s words on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always thought it was a &amp;quot;blue zone&amp;quot; thing, but maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone spent the time to read this post, here&amp;#39;s some good advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos laid out the &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; for us here  in this subreddit,  24 years ago in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He actually did!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt anyone realized that at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But look at this, and picture Carlos himself doing an imitation of it, eagerly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(make sure to look at 5 minutes 22 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See the pink clouds in the background?  He was nearly taunting us with that video!  And look at how their head follows the &amp;quot;puff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s this pass.  Picture Carlos himself doing it, while grinning eagerly as he compressed the &amp;quot;goo&amp;quot; in his hands.  He nearly winked at me.  I was only a few feet away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a 2 week buildup, to him showing us this pass.  The women in class were instructed to make sure everyone knew he was going to finally show us some &amp;quot;real magic&amp;quot;.  Wish I knew who put them up to that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wanted us to anticipate and value it. Even though when we saw it, nothing happened and everyone worried he&amp;#39;d lost it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k9ncfxdtpnr71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=508d89290a1a93ba1aca467c4d48fa0f76c246d5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/k9ncfxdtpnr71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=508d89290a1a93ba1aca467c4d48fa0f76c246d5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita taught me to make a dead person.   And I must admit, necromancing for real is fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Witch of Endor&amp;quot; magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Carlos was going for a Squirrel or small rodent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are easy with Devil&amp;#39;s Weed entity around.  I&amp;#39;ve had to chase a few out of my home, because of Minx (the inorganic being).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;the whorl&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It happens when the colors in the darkroom become so intense, there seems to be jet black pushing them around in the air, and the edges are on fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Juann pointed out, it&amp;#39;s easier to see dreaming visions on the edges of the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than looking directly into the middle at first (you can after you find them on the edges).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a bad rendition of &amp;quot;the whorl&amp;quot;. They&amp;#39;re hard to draw!  The yin/yang thing was only because I could grab that image, with the real thing taking too long to portray.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ol64yfvnpnr71.png?width=3840&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=122de589933b8ae9642499b2d3ab1d1a2bf6f35b\"&gt;The whorl is upper right of pic, in \\&amp;quot;The Wall\\&amp;quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were many other cases of Carlos &amp;quot;teaching&amp;quot; us to do what we do here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you would have had to see them to understand it.  When he said he &amp;quot;saturated&amp;quot; us, he was hinting at that.  He said when the time came, we&amp;#39;d know which one to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was pointing out this simple fact:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bwpsdxelpnr71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=deb8437791c9d696bdb5b34e2ac6ee2bc576ecf8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bwpsdxelpnr71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=deb8437791c9d696bdb5b34e2ac6ee2bc576ecf8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s the point, courtesy of Fancy, my bad inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to move the assemblage point down, gaze &amp;quot;overall&amp;quot; at &amp;quot;stuff that can&amp;#39;t possibly be there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general.   Don&amp;#39;t fixate on one thing.  Just keep watching to see what comes along, and the assemblage point naturally moves down, if you are silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you want to move horizontally, you have to halt the downward movement, and move sideways instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You move sideways by  &amp;quot;treating it as real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example you can do yourself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Move down to where the purple puffs become intense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scoop up the biggest one you can find in your right hand, then scoop some more from above you down to that, and push them together to form a brighter ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t compress it too much.  No smaller than 6 inches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now &amp;quot;grab&amp;quot; the sides and stretch it out to a length of 2 feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than just me has done this, so don&amp;#39;t worry. It&amp;#39;ll work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s 2 feet wide (a smear across space), step into it, so it gets a curve in the middle.  Pull it around your torso to make it longer, the torso being because the energy can sit there and retain brightness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now stretch it across your room as a &amp;quot;road&amp;quot; floating waist high all across the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a path.  Gaze down it, and see what&amp;#39;s along the side of the road.  Building, plants?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what that looks like, but I&amp;#39;ve done it with 2 different inorganic beings.  That one there is &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;.  Since I got &amp;quot;Lily&amp;quot; to drive a truck on the road, with the breaks out.  Just to watch her crash.  Don&amp;#39;t worry, she doesn&amp;#39;t mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c7xqz69ipnr71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=306c434eda2f6d8a04848c5a6056e17707ab37cf\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/c7xqz69ipnr71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=306c434eda2f6d8a04848c5a6056e17707ab37cf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S a sideways shift of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also NOT, &amp;quot;ME, ME, ME&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dazzling sight  that doesn&amp;#39;t fit with having the assemblage point focused only between the feet, on the ME spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t do this up at the top, at the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue zone effects are tainted with ME.  That&amp;#39;s one reason I dislike questions by people stuck at the blue line, but who still see &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; and ask what to do with them.  We get bad players with chips on their shoulders, posting that sort of thing.  Only here to make themselves feel good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But mainly it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;off path&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s all.    Might lead somewhere, but likely it only leads to more &amp;quot;ME&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;re the last refuge for magic right now.  Can&amp;#39;t afford deviations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what was the point of that above this point?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The path Carlos showed us in class, emphasized looking at the puffs as if they were real things.  Real objects. And &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; things with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;found&amp;quot; them with Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve notice, using tensegrity is vastly superior to &amp;quot;dabbling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dabbling would be, scoop a little while your sitting, wiggle the fingers a little.  Stand up, do 1 or 2 passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then you start to &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; to see if you can &amp;quot;make something happen&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;lab experiment&amp;quot; approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some ways, it&amp;#39;s a complete misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish it weren&amp;#39;t!  I&amp;#39;m a lab rat type myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity path, is &amp;quot;following intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With not-doings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It controls what you do, with rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the rituals align with the old seers. So they hook you to their intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get yourself hooked to intent, and then use your eyes and behavior as I described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Play with it to make it more real, but then when you succeed a bit, move on.  Keep looking overall, for more &amp;quot;things&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to &amp;quot;make it real&amp;quot;.  Fancy, an inorganic being, claims that shifts horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, but that&amp;#39;s not always bad, as long as you don&amp;#39;t keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re just &amp;quot;tuning that one in better&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s tuned and brighter, move on to the next thing, so you don&amp;#39;t stop moving down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the path Carlos recommended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to know how you can be certain you did it right, find &amp;quot;swirling&amp;quot;. If you get intense colors &amp;quot;swirling&amp;quot; around you, with jet black filling in, you did it right!  You&amp;#39;re in very good shape for the orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can stray from that &amp;quot;recommended path&amp;quot;. I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when I run out of dreaming energy too quickly, I always return to that &amp;quot;ritualistic&amp;quot; path again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days of that, and I can experiment for 2 days without harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if I go off experimenting only, never returning to the ritual, things get worse and worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita used to fix that for me. If I got bogged down, she walked right through the wall, and caused me to &amp;quot;move on&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she found another place to live.  Other protectors Carlos put her into contact with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve had to stick to the path a little more closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f79edeb57c35c261b9f0892086809d0ee7d2856b", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2562f4e90cb8b9b1343bfb633d0d54e36b73a5cb", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69d46aa151f94619fef8df683f98d420184d0684", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb58bd13fee1b5277d80dc70a957edf8269aeb4", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "_3SLIMHWFLwTypvnuOaJUYPqANWj5dR5MQLkUtw_PDI"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "q1z9dq", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "3 Times Unbending Intent Long Form", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"267\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=322&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

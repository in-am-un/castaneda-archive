I saw him for hours at a time, several times a week, for years.\n\nAttended all workshops but 1.\n\nHe offered to sell me his house.  I had a chance to join the witches when they went into hiding.\n\nGave me a very powerful witch he imported from Mexico, to protect. Still have her.\n\nSo please don't tell me that you're an expert on Carlos or DJ, and I have it wrong.\n\nIf so, then Carlos taught wrong.  Does that make any sense?\n\nYou're right, but Carlos was wrong?\n\nI'm not lying about my relationship to him. It's all over the web. Easy to verify. \n\nOr I would not be stuck doing this.  Several factors came together, and I got the unfortunate job of herding sheep.\n\nAs for your aversion to \"magic\", he titled one of his final books, \"***Magical*** passes\".\n\nAnother bad player who got tossed out of here, also for false information and useless posts designed to make himself feel good,  tried to claim the term \"magic\" was inappropriate.  \n\nSame as you are doing.\n\n\"running crazy guy\" I ended up calling him, but it's not far from his ID.\n\nAlso an inventory expert, and a groupie like you.\n\nYou're nothing new here. Every 3 weeks a new bad player.\n\nYou're just this month's \"flavor\".\n\nRunning guy also kept mentioning all the sorcerers out there, as if that proved he had some knowledge of his own.\n\nSorcerers are everywhere!  He liked to claim that.\n\nContradicting don Juan and Carlos.\n\nBut in fact, he was probably a paranoid schizophrenic. He certainly used drugs to fake sorcery, and he seems to have been taken advantage of by phony sorcerers.\n\nYou guys could be twins!\n\nI suspect you're stuck back in the old books, using them to justify ignorance.\n\nYou might want to read ALL of the books.\n\nEvery single one of them is filled with techniques which actually work.\n\nIt's astounding what's in there!\n\nAnd also, you need to read this about inorganic beings. If you expect to have any chance at all of learning the real thing.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/hsf2ns/on\\_inorganic\\_beings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/hsf2ns/on_inorganic_beings/)\n\nYou need them, or there's no sorcery!\n\nThey don't \"ride your back\", unless you want them to in dreaming.\n\nAnd staring at them is fine.   It moves the assemblage point.\n\nIf you don't stare at them, you will have a very hard time getting it to move far enough for silent knowledge.\n\nI do it all night long.  Makes you happy in fact, and you have more energy the next day.\n\nDidn't you read that the inorganic beings are given to sorcerers in case they get stuck somewhere alone, and make fabulous friends.\n\nYou pretty much fall in love with them if you learn to play each day.\n\nJuan has fairy (little smoke). I you read around, you'll see him profess his love for her.\n\nMe too. Fairy is awesome.\n\nI made her that shape so I could share  her with you guys, but some are just too angry to see when they have an offer in front of  them.\n\nFairy offered to visit, if you look around.  But you have to put in enough work to be worth a visit.\n\nAnd, maybe male.  We don't really know so far.  But she loves Juan.\n\nCarlos himself spent hundreds of hours with the dreaming emissary.  It's the normal path.\n\nIn the early books it was 90% inorganic being teaching.\n\nDidn't you notice that?  All inorganic beings.  The moth swooping over the fire was a \"formal' introduction.  Carlos did that for us too.\n\nProbably you're turning your nose up at them, because you have no actual sorcery experiences that don't come from a mushroom.\n\nIt's called, \"sour grapes\" in mythology.   \"Those grapes?

Easy to verify. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or I would not be stuck doing this.  Several factors came together, and I got the unfortunate job of herding sheep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your aversion to &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;, he titled one of his final books, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; passes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another bad player who got tossed out of here, also for false information and useless posts designed to make himself feel good,  tried to claim the term &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; was inappropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;running crazy guy&amp;quot; I ended up calling him, but it&amp;#39;s not far from his ID.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also an inventory expert, and a groupie like you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re nothing new here.

He liked to claim that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contradicting don Juan and Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, he was probably a paranoid schizophrenic. He certainly used drugs to fake sorcery, and he seems to have been taken advantage of by phony sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys could be twins!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect you&amp;#39;re stuck back in the old books, using them to justify ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might want to read ALL of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every single one of them is filled with techniques which actually work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s astounding what&amp;#39;s in there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, you need to read this about inorganic beings.

It moves the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t stare at them, you will have a very hard time getting it to move far enough for silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do it all night long.

I you read around, you&amp;#39;ll see him profess his love for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me too.

But you have to put in enough work to be worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, maybe male.  We don&amp;#39;t really know so far.  But she loves Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos himself spent hundreds of hours with the dreaming emissary.

I have been reading this sub for about two years or more and actively practicing for 18 months. I have been in contact with an IOB and have made it regularly to the red zone. Because I am a woman and we don't progress as men do in distinct stages, and I have also had the help of an IOB, I have seen things that may be considered orange zone or beyond, but I have always approached this practice with a skeptic's eye, I never claim anything I am not certain of doing or seeing myself.\n\nThose in the community who know me know that I try to be honest and helpful.\n\nSo about that post:\n\nThis is the clearest example of why Carlos, and Don Juan, Dan, and the people who practice Darkroom on this subreddit, are so militantly against mixing other systems of \"magic\" into the technology we practice here. It is no joke, and one of the things that we are warned about as humans is that we will have to conquer fear. It is one of the four challenges we face when we attempt to see the universe as energy and start interacting with the other beings out there.\n\nI came to a point in my own practice where I had a fearful experience courtesy of an IOB I was learning from, and I had to stop practicing until I cleaned up the garbage I was bringing from my socialization. This is why recapitulation is important. We have to know ourselves and our beliefs so we can discard what we end up proving is part of the Tonal, like in this case, Good and Evil.\n\nThose are part of man's definition of reality. There is no Good or Evil, or Sin, Archons, or God out there in the universe. All of those are things humans here on Earth made up. The universe does not care if you drink alcohol or (god forbid) fornicate with an unclean person!  It is all Tonal and needs to be left on the proverbial table.\n\nAnd because the man who was complaining of an attack in the original post (OP from here on) had been mixing a \"little of this\", and a \"little of that\" religious thought into the simple practice Carlos Casteneda wrote about, he had confused and scared himself silly.\n\nHe needs to calm down and lay off the meditation and \"magic ritual trip\"until he can read more from Castaneda and the Witches, and understand what he is exposing himself to better.\n\nIf the story is true, he lucked out and found an IOB that was feeding off of his fear and scaring him more because it thought that is what he wanted. He kept going back and engaging with the IOB. \n\nIOB's are really rather eager to help, but they are not human and do not think like we do. They are also much older and smarter than we are. They are curious, but losing some energy to one is not going to damage anyone in anyway unless you allow your mind to get carried away and turn this encounter into trauma.\n\nYes, the OP was giving out exactly what it wants: strong emotions. This is talked about extensively in all of the books. But IOB's do not care if it is fear, or intense love being emitted. They are attracted to the speed of our energy because they are really slow. They gain from it.\n\nThey emit Dark Energy, which we gain from. We can use to travel in the Dark Sea of Awareness. Getting energy from an IOB can pull your AP down into deeper zones than you are ready for and the experience can be frightening if you don't realize how in control you really are. \n\nIt is considered a fair exchange and is not harmful. Some people here would be so happy to have the attention of an IOB.\n\nThere are many people who do not practice who want to teach and tell people to do this and to do that and \"it will help.\" Well, look what following their twisted magic system did to the OP: he actually experienced something magical and convinced himself that he was going to be tormented until death. To the point of contemplating suicide!\n\nIt is essential that everyone understands all of the concepts of the books so you do not mix in other people's garbage into what Carlos Castaneda wrote about. This is not a religion. It is not \"Toltec Shamanism.\" \n\nThis is Technology that returns your perceptions back to the state you were born into before the people around you, like mom and dad, started socializing you and polluting you with this concept of reality with its solid objects and laws of physics.\n\nWe simply don't know enough to go far enough to really hurt ourselves yet. No one can maintain the kind of Silence of their Internal Dialogue yet to venture far enough out there that we need Don Juan to save us.\n\nDan reminds us constantly that we are crawling here and Carlos got to get into a car and speed down the road with a group of sorcerers training him and using their own energy to move his AP into higher states of consciousness. Most of what Carlos experienced in heightened awareness, he didn't even remember for years.\n\nWe have limitations because we are throwing out all of our lexicon that defines reality. It is difficult to remember things once you get into the red zone because we dont have a language to describe it.\n\nI doubt the OP went any farther than the red zone, IF he is being 100% truthful and also are remembering everything as it really happened.\n\nBut there are problems people. Questions have been politely asked and ignored by the OP from users who have experienced more than this IOB encounter. Important details that should be there are being left out.

darkroom.\n\nIt's not always inorganic beings!\n\nBut if you're in the darkness and perceive a nearly transparent humanoid figure, you'll tend to classify any you see like that as a \"spirit\".\n\nWhen it's not so at all!\n\nWhen you reach the purple zone you'll be able to describe perhaps 6 different kinds of visitors, all entirely different.\n\nInorganic beings are the most common, and have been trying to interact with us since we were born.  Don Juan nearly implied, we all get one.\n\nThe monster in the closet.\n\nThat's what you'll most likely see first during darkroom.\n\nThe next is a piece of your double, either projecting dream worlds into the air, or outright materializing as a zombie like copy of yourself.\n\nExcept it's body typically is not all clear and perceivable, so you'll just perceive a \"scary person\" standing there.\n\nAnd not for long.\n\nWe've spent our entire life blocking out any views of our dreamer, which isn't supposed to be possible when you are awake.\n\nSo we remove that sight and erase the memory.\n\nBut if it's just a \"piece\" of your double causing you to see a being, perhaps someone standing inside a dream bubble right in front of you, then the \"being\" in the dream bubble is likely a \"phantom\".\n\nThis commonly happens in a nightmare when a single \"scout\", what we call inorganic beings who invade your dreams, perhaps your very own monster in the closet from childhood, seems to belong to a little gang of tormentors.\n\nBut in fact there's only one \"real\" being in that dream lynch mob.\n\nI've seen 5 created by just 1 real entity.\n\nSo now we have 3 completely different types of visitors.\n\nInorganic beings, your double, and phantoms.\n\nI could go into details on what each is composed of, including what specifically it looks like, but that's off topic.\n\nIt's not all the same.  But we tend to lump it all into a single thing.\n\nNext is someone else's double.\n\nI'm lucky to have Cholita around, who simply materializes in the room.  Sometimes walking through a wall, sometimes she's dramatic and rises up from the floor like a ghost, or a dream bubble can form, containing her dream, and when I look inside there's Cholita.\n\nThose are \"tall\" dream bubbles. Tall enough to hold Cholita.\n\nWho always emerges once noticed,  and is \"solid\" enough to poke me with her finger.\n\nIn case I doubt what I'm seeing.\n\nThat's 4 different visitor types.\n\nThe next type of entity is a Silent Knowledge entity.\n\nThose have no real existence, and yet, those are the realest of all visitors.\n\nNestor actually became the student of one for a week or two, and went back (daily?) to learn from \"Porfirio\".\n\nBut those don't have to be teachers. Or even respectable.\n\nMy first silent knowledge entity was possibly the Wuwonians.\n\nThe kings of \"woo woo\" stuff.\n\nThey made a living from it.\n\nSo we have inorganic beings, your own double, a phantom, and someone else's double.\n\nAll different colors, intensities of glow, transparency levels, and solidity capabilities.\n\nAnd now silent knowledge entities.\n\nThose are not so much transparent, as \"elsewhere\".\n\nYou can go where they are, to perceive them as more concrete.\n\nOr stay back and view them as videos in the air.\n\nNext, possibly the last visitor type I know of, is a long gone sorcerer.\n\nThose can reach out from the past and visit you.\n\nSupposedly, they're still alive.\n\nJust not in our time zone.\n\nSo that makes 6.\n\nAnd how can you tell a fake magical system?\n\nBecause they just have a 2 or 3 kinds, and they're super concrete.\n\nAnd mostly just some permutation of us.\n\nThe universe is very human, in fake magical systems.\n\nAnd it's obsessed with humanness.  Trying to \"perfect you\".\n\nDon Juan commented on this much better, but I don't remember how he put it.\n\nHe said something about how even their afterlife is still just human inventory.\n\nThey never escape it.\n\nNaturally to sell such boring stuff they have to make up scary stories about how the supernatural can endanger your \"soul\".\n\nThey need a \"soul\" in order to threaten you to obey their ludicrous religion.\n\nIt's rather sick minded.\n\nJust because they smile a lot, especially while gathering donations or endorsements, doesn't make them honest.\n\nSome subsets:\n\nThe beings in heaven (whom you can visit as much as you like) are phantoms, but with some potential to be connected to real people.  I don't know why.  Maybe they're phantoms with some silent knowledge aspects?\n\nBut still, they're phantoms like the beings that emerge in pieces of your double, creating dream bubbles.\n\nGod is a silent knowledge entity.\n\nAngels and demons are various things, depending on the situation.\n\nBut most likely if it's vivid and you are not asleep, it's a single inorganic being playing around with you.\n\nYou can test that out, and even talk someone else into testing it out, and you'll find it works all the time.\n\nIf you locate a person being \"visited\" and they can repeat it (99% of the time they can't and are just wanting attention by pretending they can), you can talk them through figuring out what it really is, and it'll be one of those 6.\n\nBut best not to do that.\n\nIf it was a witch you were \"helping\", they won't like finding out what their \"head demon\" really is.\n\nThey had a relationship going with it, and even if they thought it was unpleasant and harmful to them, when they realize it wasn't they'll be angry with you.\n\nLikewise, you don't want to teach a Jesus freak that he's being deceived.\n\nIt might result in a suicide.", "edited": 1703001014.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ke1eb7b", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4719x5icw97c1.jpeg?width=4096&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5873b2773b72434f178362be6e6dbc3f1d3184a4\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4719x5icw97c1.jpeg?width=4096&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5873b2773b72434f178362be6e6dbc3f1d3184a4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about &amp;quot;visitors&amp;quot; during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not always inorganic beings!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re in the darkness and perceive a nearly transparent humanoid figure, you&amp;#39;ll tend to classify any you see like that as a &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s not so at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you reach the purple zone you&amp;#39;ll be able to describe perhaps 6 different kinds of visitors, all entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings are the most common, and have been trying to interact with us since we were born.  Don Juan nearly implied, we all get one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The monster in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ll most likely see first during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next is a piece of your double, either projecting dream worlds into the air, or outright materializing as a zombie like copy of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;#39;s body typically is not all clear and perceivable, so you&amp;#39;ll just perceive a &amp;quot;scary person&amp;quot; standing there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not for long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve spent our entire life blocking out any views of our dreamer, which isn&amp;#39;t supposed to be possible when you are awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we remove that sight and erase the memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;piece&amp;quot; of your double causing you to see a being, perhaps someone standing inside a dream bubble right in front of you, then the &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; in the dream bubble is likely a &amp;quot;phantom&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This commonly happens in a nightmare when a single &amp;quot;scout&amp;quot;, what we call inorganic beings who invade your dreams, perhaps your very own monster in the closet from childhood, seems to belong to a little gang of tormentors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact there&amp;#39;s only one &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; being in that dream lynch mob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen 5 created by just 1 real entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we have 3 completely different types of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings, your double, and phantoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go into details on what each is composed of, including what specifically it looks like, but that&amp;#39;s off topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not all the same.  But we tend to lump it all into a single thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next is someone else&amp;#39;s double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lucky to have Cholita around, who simply materializes in the room.  Sometimes walking through a wall, sometimes she&amp;#39;s dramatic and rises up from the floor like a ghost, or a dream bubble can form, containing her dream, and when I look inside there&amp;#39;s Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are &amp;quot;tall&amp;quot; dream bubbles. Tall enough to hold Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who always emerges once noticed,  and is &amp;quot;solid&amp;quot; enough to poke me with her finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case I doubt what I&amp;#39;m seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s 4 different visitor types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next type of entity is a Silent Knowledge entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those have no real existence, and yet, those are the realest of all visitors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nestor actually became the student of one for a week or two, and went back (daily?) to learn from &amp;quot;Porfirio&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those don&amp;#39;t have to be teachers. Or even respectable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first silent knowledge entity was possibly the Wuwonians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kings of &amp;quot;woo woo&amp;quot; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They made a living from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we have inorganic beings, your own double, a phantom, and someone else&amp;#39;s double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All different colors, intensities of glow, transparency levels, and solidity capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now silent knowledge entities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are not so much transparent, as &amp;quot;elsewhere&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can go where they are, to perceive them as more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or stay back and view them as videos in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, possibly the last visitor type I know of, is a long gone sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those can reach out from the past and visit you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supposedly, they&amp;#39;re still alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just not in our time zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that makes 6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how can you tell a fake magical system?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they just have a 2 or 3 kinds, and they&amp;#39;re super concrete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And mostly just some permutation of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The universe is very human, in fake magical systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s obsessed with humanness.

Once a finch gets scabs on its head, the other finches in the same cage can't resist pecking more to snack on the scabs, and that finch is doomed.\n\nA good reason for sorcerers to be secretive!\n\nWe're in that situation. The invention of agriculture, then money, then cities has pushed us far from the natural habitat we evolved to love, where wandering humans looking for food encountered real spirits and learned magic from them for 290,000 years before we got this messed up during the last 10,000.\n\nAnd it's only for the last 50,000 of those years that humans had even developed speech.\n\nBut got along fine before that, without the internal dialogue.\n\nYes... computers are cool.  I admit it. \n\nThe benefits of language, money, and cities.\n\nAnd someday technology will make us nearly immortal.\n\nBut that path is open to us right now, in a far less restrictive form!\n\nAs pure awareness, free to flow into the emanations.\n\nThe source of computers.\n\nFor now,  instead we have phony gurus and \"masters\" stealing from us with make believe systems which produce nothing more than self-flattering delusions such as \"Enlightenment\", and the endorsement of the head rooster.\n\nBarely a drop in the bucket of what humans are capable of, if they can move their assemblage point away from its current location up at the left shoulder blade.\n\nThere are 600 copies of ourselves out there, available for us to change over to.  \n\nWith at least 100,000 viable variations on this reality alone, plus an infinite number of new ones we can visit.\n\nCarlos wouldn't like my estimate, but it's based on him admitting how many worlds there are shifting horizontally at a given depth of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd on how many \"depths\" along that J curve shape the assemblage point projects onto our body, he decided to elaborate on for his private class.\n\nThen, there's stretching the luminous shell container our awareness is contained in, using the \"Gift to Maui\" pass.\n\nGiving us access to emanations BILLIONS of light years away.\n\nSome as far away as the other side of the universe.\n\nJust as Elias learned to explore. \n\nYou can too!  It actually works.\n\nI'll animate that pass soon.\n\nBut we're stuck in the chicken coop where the meaning of life is \"love\".\n\nTough love I suppose?\n\nWell it's a bit stifling in there, so at the very least learn to visit the other realms we've been given access to!  \n\nFor real.  \n\nThis is not done with the eyes closed, during some pathetic form of meditation.\n\nYou go bodily there, fully awake and fully sober.\n\nShirt, boots, and all as Carlos used to say.\n\nHow?  \n\nNo one knows.  \n\nIt just \"works out\".\n\nOne minute you are absolutely silent and see a little flicker of \"energy\",  gaze at it,  and a doorway to another world opens in front of you on the wall of your room.\n\nAnd you walk right in!\n\nIt happens over and over in the books, usually in response to some tensegrity move such as \"opening the sliding door\".\n\nAnd the \"Tata Kachora\" zombies out there constantly attacking our community,  insist there's no Tensegrity in the books!\n\nTotally clueless bad guys those are.  \n\nWorse, they HATE real magic because it hurts their delicious pretending. \n\nAnd their future prospects of stealing themselves, once that old con artist Kachora finally dies off.\n\nSo my addition to the chicken coop story when I get time to animate it smoothly, will be that one chicken does in fact escape but falls prey to new chicken coops, in the farmer's little village.\n\nA Buddhist chicken coop, a Taoist chicken coop, a Judeo/Christian chicken coop.\n\nEndless \"me-too\" Nagual Chicken coops to distract the escaping chicken from continuing to find its way out of the farmer's little village.\n\nMore traps to keep the chicken from escaping to actual freedom.\n\nThis is just some \"assets\" I purchased in an animation store, to see if I could toss together a quick view of what such a cartoon might look like.\n\nBut it'll be more fun when the chicken finds a new coop outside his old coop,  where the rooster is wearing the Dali Lama's \"big bird hat\".  \n\nYou know the one.  It's yellow and for \"special events\".  And so absurd, I doubt even goofy Big Bird would put that thing on.\n\nAnd yes, this animation is not smooth.   Just 15 minutes of effort using modern animation tools.  \n\nImpossible back when Carlos was with us. Or he might have gotten us involved with it.  \n\nIt's storytelling!  \n\nThat's what sorcerers do.  \n\nThey \"remake\" reality with new stories.\n\nGo listen to what Kylie said at her first workshop, about how they were dreaming a new person for her to be.\n\nBut that's hollow until you learn to do waking dreaming.  So don't pretend your sorcery, when all you have to do to make it real is truly learn to remove that internal dialogue.\n\nAt that point, you can watch cartoons from infinity, on the walls of your bedroom.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Chicken Coop", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Audiovisual"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"uav3mxg292ua1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/12n5gyk/asset/uav3mxg292ua1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718050528%2CMGFkMzQ3ZTdhNTI2YTA1ZGRhODMxOGNjNjM3Mjg4ZGM0N2IzNzg3MjQ5YzQyNmYzMDQwZjdmMjZmMjFjYmU0MA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/12n5gyk/asset/uav3mxg292ua1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718050528%2CMzE0MzRmODY0NGYzMDE1NTIyYjg5N2I4OWZlOWU0Zjg0MzgxZjcwMTIyMTQ2NjZlYTQ1MzA5YTZkNTUwYWY5OA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "uav3mxg292ua1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_12n5gyk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Audiovisual", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1681573542.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1681569856.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/12n5gyk/video/uav3mxg292ua1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/12n5gyk/video/uav3mxg292ua1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is really just the &amp;quot;chicken&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rooster&amp;quot; animation packs ($10) plus a &amp;quot;village&amp;quot; pack.

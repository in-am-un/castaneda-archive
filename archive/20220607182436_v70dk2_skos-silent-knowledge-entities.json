This picture is X rated.  But not yet XXX.  God help us when we get that far.\n\nI suppose X is good for today, because it's tiresome to argue about fake magic systems out there, like Monroe.\n\nSeriously?\n\nBesides being a bad man out to steal from the fans of the books of Carlos Castaneda, by making up things he believed were the same,  he used the ultimate trick to protect his revenue sources. His student victims.\n\nHe created an \"institute\", and managed to turn his made up magic into something seemingly reputable and \"mainstream\".\n\nIt's the same trick that keeps so many prisoner to Buddhism. The promise of \"certified attention and praise\". We lost our only double male, Tony, to that scam.\n\nUnfortunately, most \"seekers\" really don't want magic. It's attention from other humans they seek.\n\nAnd Monroe really piled it on.\n\nCheating people out of the only thing that can make humans happy.  Real magic.\n\nLike Buddhists, his followers even feel entitled to defend his crimes.  He's \"Certified by an institute and the entire University System\"!\n\nIt's odd that people who come into this subreddit haven't even read enough of the books of Carlos to realize it's a given in our system, that it's all crap out there.\n\nThat there's nothing.\n\nI guess they just want to combine things to make a new \"franchise\", like one of those Del Tacos that has a Burger King restaurant built right next to it. Two in one!\n\nThey were hoping to use the \"scientific mindedness\" of Monroe so people couldn't mock them, but then add in the pretense they have Castaneda's intense magic, so that people would both envy and fear them.\n\nSuch are most of the new people who wander in here. \n\nBut out of 500, we'll get one sorcerer in the long run.\n\nSo we do what Carlos and Cleargreen wouldn't or won't do.\n\nStreet fighting.\n\nThe good news is, what we're fighting for is AMAZING!\n\nI suppose if there's a takeaway from this post, it's that \"practical magic\" is inevitable.\n\nIt's nice to play with puffs, and even go traveling with the double once in a while.\n\nBut eventually you have to use the same strategy that darkroom employs.\n\nYou have to PROVE that your link to intent is getting cleaner each day.\n\nAnd males are such lying bastards, that PROVING IT, is mandatory.\n\nOtherwise they go astray.\n\nWitches not so much.  If you're lucky, they'll casually toss you some advanced magic.\n\nWithout even fully realizing what they did.\n\nBut we're kind of stuck with the traditional relationships.\n\nCarlos was also, but got severely criticized for making use of them to teach.\n\nYou're supposed to be \"saintly\", if you don't want to get lynched for your magic.\n\nAnd so if you need to keep up the image, rather than being saintly keep at least a few of the traditional human roles.\n\nMen should recognize the magic women do, even if the women themselves doubt it.\n\nOur social customs are to ignore it.

They saw it, but if they&amp;#39;d been talented enough to keep returning to it, they wouldn&amp;#39;t have written that nonsense in the old Testament.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The war in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get a chance to work with a woman, it&amp;#39;s quite surprising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you get over the male prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;humor&amp;quot; their interest in sorcery, and give them a task you expect they&amp;#39;ll never complete, and so they&amp;#39;ll go away and leave you alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something that would take a man weeks just to see results.  Like finding &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; in darkness, the main technique in here.  Except you can&amp;#39;t insist they force silence, so you give them another method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why weeks instead of days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They return the next day and say, &amp;quot;Ok, I did that.  What&amp;#39;s next?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the problem is, they really did!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to motivate them is next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supposedly it&amp;#39;s the only purpose of men in a &amp;quot;lineage&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To motivate the women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or organize them. I can&amp;#39;t recall the words Carol Tiggs used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, you can also evaluate all the other magical subs, based on no women participating in them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, fake magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium":

U want your attention to hook to that weirdness, so more of it will show. If u are just ignoring everything and focusing just on silence idk if ud get the best results .

Those are the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[username1] - cant argue with that . but, on the topic of monroe, if dreaming is a big part of sorcery and monroe teaches people to dream, then his teachings, at the very least, have value to the study of sorcery. You dont have to subscribe to his esoteric beliefs to see that. the thought that you have to &amp;#39;buy in&amp;#39; completely, totally, 100% to anything or anyone in an all-or-nothing fashion is the most toxic form of dogma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[whatsamattayoface] - Why not just give 100% to the study of sorcery&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[username1] - indeed, but practical information is scarce outside of castaneda&amp;#39;s books and shamanism has been coopted by the new age movement. An example of what im talking about would be therapy of repose, which performs precisely the same function as recapitulation. Do we deny the effectiveness of the practice simply because it has a different name in a different school?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[whatsamattayoface] - &lt;strong&gt;For what purpose?

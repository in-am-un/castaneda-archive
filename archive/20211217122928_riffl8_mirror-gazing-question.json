Maybe it only seems to be stable, because we put so many limits on it with our internal dialogue.\n\nI'm not sure how the awareness flowing through one emanation, might affect the adjacent ones.  But we know it does, because the 2 bands of emanatiosn adjacent to man's band, have an influence when you move closer to them. Those also \"pull\" on our skimmings.\n\nBut I do know that emanations which are still glowing a tiny bit from previous awareness, have a stronger influence than a \"cold\" one, on any new skimmings produced.\n\nEven glowing from 10,000 years ago, is stronger than nothing.\n\nSo reality might be simply endless reskimmings from *intent*.  If you looked at all the skimmings of all people at once,  as \"nets\" superimposed on  a huge hay stack, you'd see a weird sort of \"flow\", where trends and styles were some kind of transport between different islands of skimmings.\n\nEach \"net\" (an individuals selected emanations that skimmed into a world) superimposes a glow on the hay stack.\n\nNo net, it's dark there.\n\nBut the nets overlap.  1 billion people might have their net overlapping on some particular hay strands, and in fact, the \"mold of man\" has everyone making it light up.\n\nSeen from a distance, it would be quite a sight.  Some areas super bright, some rather dim.\n\nYou might be able to point to a place in the giant hay stack where it's barely rippling, and influence that.  See that awareness is now flowing over there, so you can cause it to go further at that point.  \n\nMight be possible to simulate that!  And then back off 1000 miles and look at the overall flow.  And see how you could add a tiny bit of flow to one specific emanation, and watch the entire hay stack react.\n\nAn \"intent gift\".\n\nWhich would mean \"The Eagle\" likes to watch...\n\nPervert.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hoy6gpd", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maybe I could give them energy that is created during strong emotional discharges&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the emanations that are shared need ripples of our awareness going down them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like awareness can hang the air like the smell of a good steak frying on open coals.

Maybe it only seems to be stable, because we put so many limits on it with our internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how the awareness flowing through one emanation, might affect the adjacent ones.  But we know it does, because the 2 bands of emanatiosn adjacent to man&amp;#39;s band, have an influence when you move closer to them. Those also &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; on our skimmings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I do know that emanations which are still glowing a tiny bit from previous awareness, have a stronger influence than a &amp;quot;cold&amp;quot; one, on any new skimmings produced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even glowing from 10,000 years ago, is stronger than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So reality might be simply endless reskimmings from &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.  If you looked at all the skimmings of all people at once,  as &amp;quot;nets&amp;quot; superimposed on  a huge hay stack, you&amp;#39;d see a weird sort of &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot;, where trends and styles were some kind of transport between different islands of skimmings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each &amp;quot;net&amp;quot; (an individuals selected emanations that skimmed into a world) superimposes a glow on the hay stack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No net, it&amp;#39;s dark there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the nets overlap.  1 billion people might have their net overlapping on some particular hay strands, and in fact, the &amp;quot;mold of man&amp;quot; has everyone making it light up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seen from a distance, it would be quite a sight.  Some areas super bright, some rather dim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might be able to point to a place in the giant hay stack where it&amp;#39;s barely rippling, and influence that.  See that awareness is now flowing over there, so you can cause it to go further at that point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might be possible to simulate that!  And then back off 1000 miles and look at the overall flow.  And see how you could add a tiny bit of flow to one specific emanation, and watch the entire hay stack react.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An &amp;quot;intent gift&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which would mean &amp;quot;The Eagle&amp;quot; likes to watch...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pervert.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_riffl8", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/riffl8/mirror_gazing_question/hoy6gpd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1639765464.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1639765464.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hoy3bln", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Purple_Oak", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hoxxa40", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4g2q2n4a", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;They feed on the energy of recognition.

My 3 specialties are Yang style Tai Chi Chuan and 2 authentic and complete Taoist monastic systems of martial, yogic and healing arts.  In one of them, called Tao Tan Pai (Taoist Elixir Method), after one has learned all the 5 animal kung fu forms (different from Shaolin 5 animals) and have mastered 4 increasingly powerful systems of Taoist Yoga, the 5th level meditations called the \"9 Flowers\" permanently relaxes and transforms the way that the person has been conditioned to see and uphold the consensus reality.  I will give a partial spoiler:   in the midst of this Taoist Yoga, while doing 9 exercises in front of a mirror, sooner or later, one suddenly sees one's karmic past lives change on one's face with every breath.  One also begins to see any person's karmic past lives (and sometimes even progressive lives ) change on their face with every breath.  One also is able to \"see\" the psychology of a person, and also his/her spirit.  In high-level Chinese and Indian yogas preserved in warrior and priestly traditions, one also regularly sees discorporated entities.  Yes, there are entities and there are possessions. This 9 Flowers Yoga is so power that if one were to practice it  between the hours of 5 to 7pm standard time, one will die.  Simple as that.   The part of the \"shift\" into \"seeing\" that I'm not spoiling is describing how the colors that normally sees day to day transforms when one is in the mode of \"seeing.\"\n\nAlso, btw, should one's vision ever shift to soft, gray-pink spongy finely black mottled cloud with no depth-of-field whatsoever, you are in serious trouble with organ failure having begun and will die if not treated by a great and saintly healer.

That is how, in Chinese martial arts, a striving student is subtly compassionately bush-whacked into \"using Death as an advisor.\"  Like any near-death experiencer, once one feels one organ system shut down after another...and see the lights literally slowly go out--but then is brought back by a true master's Qi and Shen, one's island of the tonal is significantly cleaned, to say the least.\n\nThe other system of Taoist hygienics I preserve (solely, btw) is called Ehrmei mountain Flying Phoenix Qigong  and it is a completely different system of hygienics with different yogic methodology.  it also induces \"seeing\" at higher levels of practice.

My 3 specialties are Yang style Tai Chi Chuan and 2 authentic and complete Taoist monastic systems of martial, yogic and healing arts.  In one of them, called Tao Tan Pai (Taoist Elixir Method), after one has learned all the 5 animal kung fu forms (different from Shaolin 5 animals) and have mastered 4 increasingly powerful systems of Taoist Yoga, the 5th level meditations called the &amp;quot;9 Flowers&amp;quot; permanently relaxes and transforms the way that the person has been conditioned to see and uphold the consensus reality.  I will give a partial spoiler:   in the midst of this Taoist Yoga, while doing 9 exercises in front of a mirror, sooner or later, one suddenly sees one&amp;#39;s karmic past lives change on one&amp;#39;s face with every breath.  One also begins to see any person&amp;#39;s karmic past lives (and sometimes even progressive lives ) change on their face with every breath.  One also is able to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; the psychology of a person, and also his/her spirit.  In high-level Chinese and Indian yogas preserved in warrior and priestly traditions, one also regularly sees discorporated entities.  Yes, there are entities and there are possessions. This 9 Flowers Yoga is so power that if one were to practice it  between the hours of 5 to 7pm standard time, one will die.  Simple as that.   The part of the &amp;quot;shift&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; that I&amp;#39;m not spoiling is describing how the colors that normally sees day to day transforms when one is in the mode of &amp;quot;seeing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, btw, should one&amp;#39;s vision ever shift to soft, gray-pink spongy finely black mottled cloud with no depth-of-field whatsoever, you are in serious trouble with organ failure having begun and will die if not treated by a great and saintly healer.

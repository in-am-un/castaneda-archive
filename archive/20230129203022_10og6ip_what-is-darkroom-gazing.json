And  then franchising it.\n\nAs all have done, since money was invented.\n\nThey get some minor sorcery effects with the weak meditation techniques they have, which we call \"green line effects\".\n\nIt's here, in this map in the upper right. That's what Buddhists do. They move from that blue station, to the green, and then stop. And declare t hemselves \"enlightened\".\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even\\_better\\_j\\_curve\\_diagram/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/)\n\nThey're stuck up there in \"bliss and visions\". Which also allows visiting god, heaven, seeing angels and demons.  It's easy to get confused by all that.\n\nBut it's so little, we commonly skip over that level to get to the fun stuff.\n\nAs you can clearly see in pictures here. So you don't have to wonder what I'm saying.\n\nIt's right there!\n\nWomen get those effects when they soothe themselves in the bathtub.\n\nSo a \"Zen Master\" is barely able to reach the level the average woman can do, in the bathtub.\n\nShinzen, while he claimed internal silence was equivalent, would be guaranteed to change his tune if you told him we do that, but he actually doesn't, and our magic kicks the buddha's scrawny butt.\n\nI did!   In different words.\n\nHe blew up. Might even have sent someone  here to try to harm this place.\n\nOf course what I said was the absolute truth, and you can look in here to learn that's so.\n\nBut the people in the other systems believe they have achieved inner silence despite not having the resulting astonishing magic which goes along with that.\n\nThey're on big ego trips.  Based on \"partial silence\".\n\nAnd stealing money from others to boot.\n\nNo one in here makes money in any way from trying to help others learn what our beloved teacher Carlos taught us before he died.\n\nHere's the J curve map.  You force off that voice in your head, in absolute darkness, and do some simple kungfu like movements designed to stimulate a type of energy humans have, which is visible as \"puffs\" of purple light.\n\nAnd play with them according to instructions, until you form a second and very real copy of yourself.\n\nWhich can interact with other people, in your place.\n\nAnd meanwhile you learn to materialize portals to other worlds on the walls of your room, and then finally learn to enter them. Breaking a few laws of physics as you do it.\n\nWe do that sort of thing daily, not once in our life so we can write our \"Autobiography of a Yogi\" book, and then steal millions and never teach any magic at all, as Yogananda did.\n\nEssentially if you want to learn magic, this is the only place you can do that.\n\nThe rest are all pretend.\n\nBut you didn't take the time to look around before you posted, so the chances you'll put in the effort to learn are next to 0.\n\nWe keep track of successes in here because we're trying to save something precious.\n\nAnd it turns out only 1 in 100 who join the subreddit, are willing to make enough effort to find \"puffs\" in darkness.\n\nAnd only 1 in 500 is likely to keep going.\n\nReal magic takes you into other realms that are not \"cozy\" like the realm you currently reside in.\n\nSo the best results we get in here, are from people who have not found normal life \"cozy\" at all. And want something better.\n\nKey points for you:\n\nNo one in here wants our money.  You can't find another place like that.\n\nThere's pictures and easy to follow instructions for real magic, in a group where people share tips and successes.\n\nThere's no place like that anywhere else.\n\nWe don't point to the top of some mountain in Tibet, when someone asks how they can be taught real magic.\n\nThe sad truth is, there's no magic at all up that mountain in Tibet.  Just con artists.\n\nSame for everywhere else.\n\nIt's all pretending elsewhere, which confuses practitioners because they can manage to get those \"green station\" effects from that map. And don't realize those green line effects are practically nothing.\n\nAs I said, any woman (all are witches if they want to be) has done that \"Enlightenment\" thing whenever she needed to soothe herself from her period.\n\nSo in  fact, women kick ass.  But never get any credit from the male oriented \"magic franchises\".  \n\nWhich is all religions currently still practiced on earth.\n\nBut if you're male, fear not.\n\nWomen don't seem very motivated to do it on their own.\n\nSo men have a slight advantage in the long run.\n\nDetermination (greed) versus raw talent.\n\nI'm afraid greed might win out in the end.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j6ejfv4", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very difficult technique which fulfills the Buddhist path to &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot; but in a very short time.

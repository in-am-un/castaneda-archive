But...

And she picked up on my desire to gain more lucid dreaming, so I could travel in my dreaming copy, instead of only in waking dreaming.\n\nIt's not the same!\n\nConsider this, which YOU will be able to do, if you don't flake out.\n\nBut to learn to do this, you have to actually put in some work...\n\nThere's where the problem comes in. We've all been brainwashed by all the fake religious and magical systems around, to believe that magic is either non-existent, or extremely rare.\n\nAnd so if you want to be a Buddhist and gain \"super powers\", you have to hear that, \"That can take several lifetimes.\"\n\nTheir highest text, the \"Fire Kasina Texts\", actually lists what the Buddha could do, like a sales brochure, but then warns that his disciples could only do 2 of those, and not the other 2.  And the even lower status ones couldn't do even that much.  But they \"all\" had magic!\n\nHappy day.\n\nI don't quite understand why people don't see through that immediately.  It's \"franchising rights\". And some have purchased \"preferred franchises\".\n\nBut NO ONE gets to be at the top, like the Buddha.\n\nNo one ever learns to do what the Buddha himself could do?  How about apprentices who exceed the master?\n\nNot possible in an Asian fake magic system.\n\nYoda may relish apprentices who grow beyond the master, saying, \"**Luke, we are what they grow beyond**. That is the true burden of all masters. \"\n\nBut in Buddha town, where everyone sits with their eyes close in superioress, and smiles like they just farted, NO ONE outdoes the Buddha.\n\nAgain, isn't that a bit transparent?\n\nI think I'll stick with Yoda (don Juan).\n\nThat way instead of several lifetimes, or even decades, you get superpowers in days if you are talented and work hard.  Weeks otherwise.  Maybe months if you are somewhat lazy, but do sincerely put in time learning to do darkroom.\n\nAnd then, you come to the point that your darkroom is like a \"Tardis\".  From Dr. Who.\n\nYou can travel to any place in time and space.\n\nLiterally!\n\nOk...  Maybe that 50\" TV wasn't as cheap as it seemed.\n\n$280.\n\nBut there's a price for watching media.  You start to see sorcery everywhere.\n\nFirst in Star Wars, but it even begins to show up in \"Minions\".\n\nAnd this picture is PERFECT for beginners. To understand our situation.\n\nIn the universe there is only the emanations, superstrings which give off feelings when \"attention\" is focused on them, and the attention itself.\n\nHumans are gifted with a blob of awareness, placed in some kind of egg.\n\nNow I know...\n\nI said only the emanations and awareness.\n\nWhat's this \"egg shell\" made out of?\n\nWe don't know.  We have no gurus in sorcery.\n\nAnd we don't know who or what created the emanations.  When seers over the thousands of years tried to figure out where the dark sea of emanations came from, which is all possible realities in superstring format, they found they could not.\n\nInstead, some sorcerer did an awful thing.\n\nHe began to get a glimpse of where the emanations came from and said,\n\n\"Looks like an eagle to me...\"\n\nAnd that was it.  He created a \"phantom construct\".\n\nAnytime a sorcerer tries to go back and see such a sight, the left over intent of that wayward seer is lingering in the dark sea.  And that's what you'll see. An eagle.\n\nCan't we fix that?\n\nBetter not try.  What if we end up with Pennywise, the clown?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d31j8klgkbg91.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1212cf15adc88ad125a1fb06fd787f8517b9eb5\n\nThat would NOT be good.  Clowns are scary...\n\nThe Eagle at least, makes a good image for episodes of \"Walker Texas Ranger\", which also has its own \"Don Juan\" character.  The kindly ancient Cherokee tribal elder, who can even take Walker back in time to re-run history.\n\nWhich by the way, we get to do also!\n\nI'd pass on the screeching Eagle myself.  It shows up to warn Walker bad guys are in the bushes.\n\nI'd get one of those new \"Gel Guns\" they banned in California and Australia, and blast that damned Eagle if I got a chance.\n\nBut it's \"sacred\" to medicine men.  They don't know why.  They forgot that part.\n\nNative American Shamanism is the \"side branch\" of our sorcery. It's NOT our sorcery. But it IS, the \"Men of Knowledge\".  That's what's left of them.\n\nNon-functional rituals, mixed with some cool visions and such.\n\nBy the way, if you ever hear that Carlos \"culturally appropriated\" Native American practices, you have a guy there completely devoid of any magical knowledge. Or even understanding of shamanism!\n\nIt comes from the Olmecs, 8000 years or more ago, and originally from proto-siberia.\n\nThe idea that you need the \"permission\" of modern native americans, is ludicrous.\n\nNot only that, but anyone who actually has magic celebrates anyone else who does.\n\nIt's so rare!  In fact, we haven't found any yet.  Just minor green zone stuff.\n\nSo if you hear that kind of talk, stay away from that person.  They believe the \"tales of power\" of shamanism is all pretending. \n\nAnd can't see the difference between, \"Hey, this stuff actually works!\", and \"This stuff is sacred.\"\n\nYou take the \"sacred\", and I'll go for what actually works.\n\nBut what Shamans do have left over from the Olmecs, is better than anything else around.\n\nAs Michael Harner, a good friend of Carlos once said, he's never seen anything in any magical or spiritual system which couldn't be more easily duplicated with shamanic drumming.\n\nAnd he's right!  All of the \"magic\" in Asia, is merely green line effects on the J curve.  To be \"permanently enlightened\" means you \"got slimed\" and pushed your assemblage point horizontally enough at the green line,  to bend yourself out of shape and get on an ego trip thinking you are \"enlightened\".\n\nYou'll feel that too, when you first pass through the green zone. But as you move further, it won't seem so \"enlightened\" anymore.\n\nAnd magic in the green zone?  \n\nNot enough to write home about.\n\nWe push further even past the \"evils\" of the red zone at the bottom of the J curve.  Past shapeshifting, temporary manufactured dream worlds, and go off into the orange zone where Heightened Awareness resides.\n\nAs don Juan said, \"Real learning takes place there.\"\n\nThat's where portals to other real worlds open up on the walls of your darkroom, you can learn to leap across the universe, and if you have enough energy you can walk right into other real worlds.  And stay there we're told!\n\nBreak the laws of physics and leave your darkroom for another place you can see visibly, on your darkroom walls.  That part we've done. Over and over again.\n\nAnd in shared dreaming too!\n\nFurther on,  you get to the purple region on that J curve where all the knowledge possible for man to know, human or non-human, floats around in the air in front of you in response to your curiosities.\n\nIt's the famous \"seeing\" from the books.  We call it, \"Silent Knowledge\", or \"SK\" for short.\n\nAnd there's where it's easy to get confused.  I suppose you get a \"fat head\" like a guru or \"Enlightened Master\" does up in the green zone.\n\nExcept you have access to all of the J curve, to all knowledge of man, and to all worlds available for humans to travel to or live in.\n\nIt's easy to get a \"fat head\" over there.\n\nThat's what my inorganic being \"Fancy\" was trying to explain to me this morning.  Somewhere in the middle of the night, when all the people sleeping near my home were unconscious.\n\nIt's much easier to view other realities when you don't have the glow of awareness of people surrounding you, focused on their worries and desires.\n\nEach and every one of your neighbors, is like Gru.\n\nFrom Minions.\n\nObsessed with taking over the world. It's an endless obsession of his.\n\nHe'd be totally useless, except he has logic and reason for an assistant.\n\nAnd that Nazi scientist guy can make great 50\" televisions, for dirt cheap!\n\nIt's rather hard to criticize the social order, when you realize it will eventually make humans immortal, with all the powers of a God.\n\nExcept, they'll still be like Gru.\n\nTheir angry internal dialogue raging away, trying to figure out how to defeat their enemies.\n\n\"Fancy\" explained to me last night, in person, that I had done a good job overcoming Gru.\n\nAt least, for short spells of a few hours, so I could play with the minions and go find out what that glowing blue stuff is that's been pushed to the outside of our \"lair\".\n\nBut what I didn't get rid of, was the Nazi Scientist.\n\nThe \"man of reason\".\n\nIn fact, I'd made him stronger.\n\nIt used to be, he only stayed in the control room.\n\nBut as I overcame Gru's bullying and ventured further into our lair, to play with the minions, I cut a path for the Nazi scientist.\n\nSo by the time I made it to the outside of the cave, to investigate the blue stuff, my energy body, I was so rational it was impossible to have any fun.\n\nAnd I had driven inorganic beings away.\n\nThey can't stand the Nazi guy.\n\nSo what I needed now, was to overcome the scientist.\n\nRationality.\n\nIn particular, I needed to stop interpreting the things you can see in the second attention fog, and just view it overall, the way a newborn baby's eyes gloss over, and it recognizes nothing but colored lights all around it.\n\nThat's the point of view of the dreamer.  Of the person who sometimes looks like you, and wanders around in dreams.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nIt's in the advanced subreddit.\n\nYou don't get to go there, until you can at least scoop some of that blue stuff off the lair walls, and hold it in your hand.  Daily.\n\nAnd we see, you aren't a bad player hoping to cash in by manipulating other people who don't know any better.\n\nLike the fake sorcery book writers.   Even the ones who managed to get themselves a \"good name\" like Armando, who merely kept his lecture notes and made up 3 books worth to pretend with them.\n\nMany others just freely gave their lecture notes, and anyone in private classes was far closer to Carlos than Armando, and heard hundreds more lectures.\n\nNone went to cash in with made up stuff like Armando did. And he still hasn't apologized.  I hear he feels badly though.  Could be, Eddy Martel has some hold over him that prevents him from confessing the crime.\n\nOr like the Castaneda fans who wear rambo headbands, change to a \"genuine shaman name\" like \"Farting Sparrow\", and try to charge middle aged women for sorcery lessons.\n\nWhen we know you're in it for the magic, and have a little of that already, someone will invite you over there. But asking ahead of time is a very bad sign, and will likely indicate you'll never get there at all.  You're likely one of the bad guys.\n\nSo Fancy showed me last night, when you overcome the Nazi scientist, the entire darkroom scene changes.\n\nI turns into \"sleeping dreaming\", instead of \"dreaming awake\".\n\nAnd the cave walls no longer stop you from walking further on into unexplored regions.\n\nFor real...  We don't make up stuff in here.\n\nIf we can't do it, we don't bother you about it.\n\nUnlike everywhere else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Just the Highlights from Fancy the IOB", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 80, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"d31j8klgkbg91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/d31j8klgkbg91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ab601f1ad83174cde65c629d4ac99902e20a43"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/d31j8klgkbg91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af98718fd51a30b12e71c63d68434a2cca78497c"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/d31j8klgkbg91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23f2470cb6d4a85de578a5c6cee354037246fbc2"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/d31j8klgkbg91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18026495cfbb503d379fec2220eeb01dc102862b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/d31j8klgkbg91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ab45146750f0c88885dc171c931793e9fcae035"}, {"y": 720, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/d31j8klgkbg91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db681b4c86d417cdd43356db33e20c8cf656558a"}], "s": {"y": 960, "x": 1440, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/d31j8klgkbg91.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1212cf15adc88ad125a1fb06fd787f8517b9eb5"}, "id": "d31j8klgkbg91"}, "l1ic9rufdbg91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 62, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l1ic9rufdbg91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=602117a539b540c40d87158b93bb631f5a306d36"}, {"y": 124, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l1ic9rufdbg91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bbfc342445ca8e6f3589ac48be50e57b8867dbb"}, {"y": 185, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l1ic9rufdbg91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac7db5fb76631c19864a9df249ce3e103cb4c161"}, {"y": 370, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l1ic9rufdbg91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d21c7bc6091130590cf1a955ddc5cf13765edc22"}, {"y": 555, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l1ic9rufdbg91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c94d5b5d53a475ee48c32425512ca8dbb3db95e"}, {"y": 624, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l1ic9rufdbg91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=410a4ae0a3a674882eea85b21c0737d5f8c78394"}], "s": {"y": 740, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l1ic9rufdbg91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e29606764704ff627241f0047e88e8eb5d042c9e"}, "id": "l1ic9rufdbg91"}}, "name": "t3_wijsv8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mS0JCaKBYzSbU6qt3P88wh9j2eiH3dwzZ4J-z9IMuXs.jpg", "edited": 1659898576.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659889908.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l1ic9rufdbg91.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e29606764704ff627241f0047e88e8eb5d042c9e\"&gt;My new 50\\&amp;quot; TV was only $280, and it gets Netflix!

They believe the &amp;quot;tales of power&amp;quot; of shamanism is all pretending. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And can&amp;#39;t see the difference between, &amp;quot;Hey, this stuff actually works!&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;This stuff is sacred.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You take the &amp;quot;sacred&amp;quot;, and I&amp;#39;ll go for what actually works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what Shamans do have left over from the Olmecs, is better than anything else around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Michael Harner, a good friend of Carlos once said, he&amp;#39;s never seen anything in any magical or spiritual system which couldn&amp;#39;t be more easily duplicated with shamanic drumming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;s right!  All of the &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; in Asia, is merely green line effects on the J curve.  To be &amp;quot;permanently enlightened&amp;quot; means you &amp;quot;got slimed&amp;quot; and pushed your assemblage point horizontally enough at the green line,  to bend yourself out of shape and get on an ego trip thinking you are &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll feel that too, when you first pass through the green zone. But as you move further, it won&amp;#39;t seem so &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And magic in the green zone?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not enough to write home about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We push further even past the &amp;quot;evils&amp;quot; of the red zone at the bottom of the J curve.  Past shapeshifting, temporary manufactured dream worlds, and go off into the orange zone where Heightened Awareness resides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan said, &amp;quot;Real learning takes place there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where portals to other real worlds open up on the walls of your darkroom, you can learn to leap across the universe, and if you have enough energy you can walk right into other real worlds.  And stay there we&amp;#39;re told!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Break the laws of physics and leave your darkroom for another place you can see visibly, on your darkroom walls.  That part we&amp;#39;ve done. Over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in shared dreaming too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further on,  you get to the purple region on that J curve where all the knowledge possible for man to know, human or non-human, floats around in the air in front of you in response to your curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the famous &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; from the books.  We call it, &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;SK&amp;quot; for short.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s easy to get confused.  I suppose you get a &amp;quot;fat head&amp;quot; like a guru or &amp;quot;Enlightened Master&amp;quot; does up in the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except you have access to all of the J curve, to all knowledge of man, and to all worlds available for humans to travel to or live in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to get a &amp;quot;fat head&amp;quot; over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what my inorganic being &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; was trying to explain to me this morning.  Somewhere in the middle of the night, when all the people sleeping near my home were unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s much easier to view other realities when you don&amp;#39;t have the glow of awareness of people surrounding you, focused on their worries and desires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each and every one of your neighbors, is like Gru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From Minions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obsessed with taking over the world. It&amp;#39;s an endless obsession of his.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d be totally useless, except he has logic and reason for an assistant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that Nazi scientist guy can make great 50&amp;quot; televisions, for dirt cheap!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s rather hard to criticize the social order, when you realize it will eventually make humans immortal, with all the powers of a God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, they&amp;#39;ll still be like Gru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their angry internal dialogue raging away, trying to figure out how to defeat their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; explained to me last night, in person, that I had done a good job overcoming Gru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, for short spells of a few hours, so I could play with the minions and go find out what that glowing blue stuff is that&amp;#39;s been pushed to the outside of our &amp;quot;lair&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what I didn&amp;#39;t get rid of, was the Nazi Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;man of reason&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I&amp;#39;d made him stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It used to be, he only stayed in the control room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I overcame Gru&amp;#39;s bullying and ventured further into our lair, to play with the minions, I cut a path for the Nazi scientist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So by the time I made it to the outside of the cave, to investigate the blue stuff, my energy body, I was so rational it was impossible to have any fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I had driven inorganic beings away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t stand the Nazi guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what I needed now, was to overcome the scientist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rationality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In particular, I needed to stop interpreting the things you can see in the second attention fog, and just view it overall, the way a newborn baby&amp;#39;s eyes gloss over, and it recognizes nothing but colored lights all around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the point of view of the dreamer.  Of the person who sometimes looks like you, and wanders around in dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in the advanced subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t get to go there, until you can at least scoop some of that blue stuff off the lair walls, and hold it in your hand.  Daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we see, you aren&amp;#39;t a bad player hoping to cash in by manipulating other people who don&amp;#39;t know any better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the fake sorcery book writers.   Even the ones who managed to get themselves a &amp;quot;good name&amp;quot; like Armando, who merely kept his lecture notes and made up 3 books worth to pretend with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many others just freely gave their lecture notes, and anyone in private classes was far closer to Carlos than Armando, and heard hundreds more lectures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None went to cash in with made up stuff like Armando did. And he still hasn&amp;#39;t apologized.  I hear he feels badly though.  Could be, Eddy Martel has some hold over him that prevents him from confessing the crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or like the Castaneda fans who wear rambo headbands, change to a &amp;quot;genuine shaman name&amp;quot; like &amp;quot;Farting Sparrow&amp;quot;, and try to charge middle aged women for sorcery lessons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we know you&amp;#39;re in it for the magic, and have a little of that already, someone will invite you over there. But asking ahead of time is a very bad sign, and will likely indicate you&amp;#39;ll never get there at all.  You&amp;#39;re likely one of the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Fancy showed me last night, when you overcome the Nazi scientist, the entire darkroom scene changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turns into &amp;quot;sleeping dreaming&amp;quot;, instead of &amp;quot;dreaming awake&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the cave walls no longer stop you from walking further on into unexplored regions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real...  We don&amp;#39;t make up stuff in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we can&amp;#39;t do it, we don&amp;#39;t bother you about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "wijsv8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wijsv8/just_the_highlights_from_fancy_the_iob/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/wijsv8/just_the_highlights_from_fancy_the_iob/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1659889908.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ijd1pjq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "KrazyTayl", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1659908079.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wijsv8", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_3i08j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Awesome as always.

I've been searching for years for a group of people who were aware of magic, real magic. I just discovered this subreddit and it gives me a-lot of hope. I don't know anything about Castaneda, but I came over from the Abramelin subreddit and saw that you had posted here, and ended up here. I wanted to share some of my experiences, in hopes to get clarity or further answers or just some way of trying to figure out reality in a new way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 14, I watched my best friend turn into a werewolf this made me realize that external reality is not at all what I thought it was. I would then go on and spend the next 7 years demon hunting and monster hunting. I've seen terrifying things from banshees to demons, to reapers, to spirits, to vampires, and skin walkers. About 2 years ago I discovered magic, I didn't really understand what it was at first. But I do recall meditating and feeling this black void coming over me and I made a rock levitate before my own eyes. I have learned how to silence my mind, though only for 30 seconds to a minute at a time, reality does start to behave in strange ways when I have quieted my mind. I can also conjure up spirits or angels with the power of intentional focused thought, though I prefer not too simply because it can be quite terrifying if I do that. I also have abilities such as being able to astral project, or see into very dull moments of dejavu into the future.  I have seen fairies   fly before my own eyes, seen werewolves walk in deep woods. Been visited by red eyed demons, encountered hindu gods. Been haunted by spirits, that could deeply impact reality, and almost died from a skin walker twice. My curiosity is, where do I begin?

They call inorganic beings which can be seen by animals, \"Greebles\".\n\nI'm not sure they realize that humans can see them too, and even enlist them as instructors.\n\nGreebles are responsible for ALL of the world's religions.  I know that's a bold claim, but Carlos assigned me the task of studying the bible, which inevitably leads to having to study all other religions, in order to come to grips with the fine points.\n\nSuch as \"demons\". Go deep into any religion, and you'll find demons justifying many of their claims.  It's sort of like this:  \"I saw a demon, so you need to believe me on this subject!\"\n\nChrist even went around casting them out in public, to prove his status.  And there are plenty of stories about the Buddha messing around with demons. Or them messing around with him.\n\nOf course Daoists love to warn the public, stay away from demons!  Meanwhile, they charge money to let themselves become possessed by demons, to get answers for people.  If the demon tries to \"take over\",  they beat themselves on the head with a nail stuck in a board, until they bleed.\n\nAnd blood sympathy tips are always welcome.\n\nThe Hindus like to tell stories of giant wars, involving demons.\n\nLook around!\n\nReligion = demon inspired.\n\nAnd \"Greebles\" are demons.  But they are also Gremlins.  And Ghosts, Angels,  Aliens, Trolls, Spirits, Fairies, and a whole host of wonderful things that people don't believe in, but can't resist hearing about in stories or watching in movies.\n\nWe can't completely ignore them as we'd like to, because we're surrounded by them.\n\nMy witch friend Cholita has dumped 5 of them in my bedroom, as a prank.   First she invited them, threw a party in Dreaming Awake, and then stuck them under my bed.\n\nI can't seem to get them out of there. At least so far that is.  I have 5 beings \"looking over my shoulder\" all night long.\n\nChildren know all about this topic.  The darkness is a dangerous place, because that's where Greebles become visible.  Try taking a 5 year old on \"Toad's Wild Ride\" at Disneyland, and watch them cling to your side, the instant it gets dark.\n\nGreebles hide in the dark.  All children know that.  They especially love the closet, and under the bed.\n\nBest thing to do with Greebles, is take advantage of them!  They love to teach you how to visit with them even longer.  Which means, they'll teach you how to travel into the other realities we have available to us.\n\nSuch as the world of Greebles, which is their home. Rumor has it that if you go there often they'll teach you to levitate small objects.\n\nThey certainly taught Cholita!  I've seen it with my own eyes.\n\nLearn to see them!  Make friends!  Don't be afraid. Yes, they are dangerous.  But so is hiking, rock climbing, sky diving, and going to Church in your car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Every culture has stories of Inorganic Beings.  These are some more persistent ones.](https://preview.redd.it/sz935oo3by961.jpg?width=903&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bff5caa54d490a649be3230d0b0584806a0f6dd2)\n\nThis subreddit is  the only place I know of to learn to perceive spirits for real, but there are Zen and Dzogchen masters who can do that and talk openly about it.\n\nTry Shinzen Young and Daniel Ingram for verification there are many ways to learn to see them. Shinzen even had a Fairy like the one in the picture, although it was a 4 inch tall male playing a little drum.  I suppose, hanging out in Taiwan too much?\n\nAs it turns out, if you find yourself having a conversation with one it's often extremely difficult to remember. And you will VERY much want to remember such a conversation!  So you'll become semi-desperate for any way to keep your memory, which is very easily lost.\n\nThat's because it happens off in a side reality, and our memory needs an unbroken chain, in order to function.\n\nOnce you venture off into \"the second attention\", that place we've all been taught to ignore, but which pops out at night, or when you have a fever or sudden fright, you are in \"broken chain\" territory.\n\nThere's no guarantee you will remember it.  Which is not so strange after all. How long can you remember a dream, after you wake from it?\n\nAnd dreaming is just a small hop from waking. The world of the greebles is a long drive.\n\nSo I use the \"thumbs up\" technique. When something really cool happens, for instance your inorganic being (Greeble) decides to show off for you, you give yourself a \"Thumbs up\" to help remember it later.\n\nTrust me when I say, they can BLOW YOUR MIND showing off.  You'll gasp, and maybe even tell them that you promise to love them forever.\n\nThe thumbs up stores in the brain much like an ordinary memory.  And it attaches information, such as if you were sitting, standing, was it cold,  was your nose stuffed up?  A whole myriad of factors get included in that \"thumbs up\", and later you can recall those, find the actual movement you did, and hopefully retrieve the memory.\n\nThe problem is, if you venture all the way into Greeble land (an inorganic being's realm), a thumbs up is too disruptive.\n\nIt also doesn't work well, because the normal \"attachments\" are gone if you don't actually have a human body when you do the thumbs up.\n\nAlso, you can switch over to your dreaming double on the way to where you are going.\n\nYou can be sure of that, if you notice yourself violating the laws of physics with your movements.\n\nIf for instance, you walk 30 feet in your room which is only 15 feet long.\n\nIn the group chat, we were discussing if there might not be another way to mark an event with less disruption.\n\nThis came up.  For newbies, \"the emissary\" is a being with no organic body.  They project an appearance of themselves during the day, often a horrible demon about to murder you, floating above your head.\n\nFor Milarepa, the Tibetan Yogi, they brought him to hell and made him watch people being tortured.\n\nBut you can also train them to be a pretty little fairy, standing on your hand.\n\nUnfortunately, in waking they \"animate\" very slowly.  They can only move 2 times a second.\n\nAs you venture further and further into dreaming awake, they speed up.\n\nFinally, once you are fully in a dream (even if you are still awake with your eyes open), they are full speed, and can even speak to you. That's when they are called, \"the emissary\".\n\nHere's that quote, on an alternative to the thumbs up. In this part of the book, \"The Art of Dreaming\", Carlos is deep in dreaming realms, being taught by one of those beings:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nOne day the emissary's voice gave me a fabulous bonus. It said that, in order to ensure the keenness and accuracy of our dreaming attention, we must bring it from behind the roof of the mouth, where an enormous reservoir of attention is located in all human beings. The emissary's specific directions were to practice and learn the discipline and control necessary to press the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth while dreaming. This task is as difficult and consuming, the emissary said, as finding one's hands in a dream. But, once it is accomplished, this task gives the most astounding results in terms of controlling the dreaming attention.\n\nI received a profusion of instructions on every conceivable subject, instructions that I promptly forgot if they were not endlessly repeated to me. I sought don Juan's advice on how to resolve this problem of forgetting.\n\nHis comment was as brief as I had expected. \"Focus only on what the emissary tells you about dreaming,\" he said.\n\nWhatever the emissary's voice repeated enough times, I grasped with tremendous interest and fervor. Faithful to don Juan's recommendation, I only followed its guidance when it referred to dreaming and I personally corroborated the value of its instruction. The most vital piece of information for me was that the dreaming attention comes from behind the roof of the mouth. It took a great deal of effort on my part to feel in dreaming that I was pressing the roof of my mouth with the tip of my tongue. Once I accomplished this, my dreaming attention took on a life of its own and became, I may say, keener than my normal attention to the daily world.\n\nIt did not take much for me to deduce how deep must have been the involvement of the old sorcerers with the inorganic beings. Don Juan's commentaries and warnings about the danger of such an involvement became more vital than ever. I tried my best to live up to his standards of self-examination with no indulgence. Thus, the emissary's voice and what it said became a superchallenge for me. I had to avoid, at all cost, succumbing to the temptation of the emissary's promise of knowledge, and I had to do this all by myself since don Juan continued to refuse to listen to my accounts.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Trouble With Greebles", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 121, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"fconuxmp6y961": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 93, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fconuxmp6y961.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa78cb4e64733e36e82a76111d4c1c0b8e625d05"}, {"y": 187, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fconuxmp6y961.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76977eecc41739ba56feda81dd3dccc907d05b31"}, {"y": 277, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fconuxmp6y961.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=619c5b4ea1f26b146e42eafafc53e4e40a17ae47"}], "s": {"y": 402, "x": 463, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fconuxmp6y961.jpg?width=463&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc193180ae55ed215e8646af467c6398d0a6450f"}, "id": "fconuxmp6y961"}, "sz935oo3by961": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 68, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sz935oo3by961.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f664e9984bb49faed85d6f55a90c8c86cd31be1"}, {"y": 136, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sz935oo3by961.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64b4cebe29dfd6da758f73c5bd81452f5c2bb395"}, {"y": 202, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sz935oo3by961.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=113d29aa82433d88010589a76f0ff1b8fc04cbbe"}, {"y": 405, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sz935oo3by961.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04e0e265a64c81d67166220534b0ed80089c0d2c"}], "s": {"y": 572, "x": 903, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sz935oo3by961.jpg?width=903&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bff5caa54d490a649be3230d0b0584806a0f6dd2"}, "id": "sz935oo3by961"}}, "name": "t3_ksievd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/eRJBaRO4XicsNrIq6aSnU9agRyXDxmXv_ABEZ3jS2Qo.jpg", "edited": 1610061605.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610041617.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fconuxmp6y961.jpg?width=463&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bc193180ae55ed215e8646af467c6398d0a6450f\"&gt;Inorganic beings are easily trained, as long as you can perceive them.

When she's here, they aren't a problem. When she leaves, they get bored or something.\n\nThey are not very helpful.\n\nSo they aren't allies.\n\nWhat can they do?\n\nAnything.\n\nThey can even transport your body, physical matter and all, to another world.\n\nI'm not sure we can do that ourselves.  It's not clear in the books.  Could be, you always need their help to do that.\n\nThey also make amazing friends.\n\nI was joking to Fancy last night. She's the IOB I found to replace Fairy.\n\nShe appeared quite vivid for a while.  I'm afraid to say, over time you might settle for them being nothing more than a presence.  Or a pink cloud.\n\nLa Gorda seemed proud to have hers be like that.\n\nBut it's not my preference.  I suppose if you have don Juan for \"your man\", and Genaro leaping over trees to show you magic, you can afford to have a boring IOB for a helper.\n\nMyself, I like Fancy with 1990s big hair, in a prom dress.  A rotting zombie would also be ok, as long as it was sort of pretty.\n\nFairy was nice, but I've already done that.  \n\nFancy obliged.  Did a mini fashion show for me, for a minute or two.\n\nSo I made a request:  Show me how to get to the world of the dreaming Emissary on demand. Anytime I like.\n\nShe didn't do anything.  Went away in fact.\n\nI returned to my night's obsession.  And last night, it was trying to figure out the difference between heightened awareness, and \"silent knowledge\".\n\nI got right on the edge of silent knowledge, when I noticed Fancy was showing me something.\n\nShe had produced a dark column of ash, or smoke.  Something black with grey highlights, and not smooth.  \n\nShe claimed it was, \"the nagual\".\n\nDidn't look like that to me, although it gave off a very creepy, but exhilarating, sensation.\n\nShe said, \"Now you need the light.\"\n\nA very wide strip of white light, with a slight  yellow tint, began to form to the left of it.\n\nShe taught me to form both, but all of  that memory is lost. It was too far on the J curve, to remember it easily.\n\nWhen I had the 2 pillars (around 7 feet high, 2 feet wide each), she ripped a passage in the middle.\n\n\"In there\", she said.\n\nUnfortunately, I'd completely forgotten having asked her to do that.  I do 1000 things a night.  It seems like I should remember one that obvious, but that's only because when I write about it, I leave out 995 things that also happened that night.\n\n\"What's in there?\" I was thinking.\n\nFancy frowned.  She started over.\n\nAfter the 20th \"start over\", I realized I was now stuck in a loop with Fancy.\n\nI suppose she decided to take advantage of the situation, once she saw how stupid I was.\n\nRealizing I was stuck in a loop, I walked away to the other side of the room.\n\nAfter that, I could feel \"the nagual\" coming out.\n\nI can't explain that.

It&amp;#39;s not clear in the books.  Could be, you always need their help to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also make amazing friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was joking to Fancy last night. She&amp;#39;s the IOB I found to replace Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She appeared quite vivid for a while.  I&amp;#39;m afraid to say, over time you might settle for them being nothing more than a presence.  Or a pink cloud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda seemed proud to have hers be like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not my preference.  I suppose if you have don Juan for &amp;quot;your man&amp;quot;, and Genaro leaping over trees to show you magic, you can afford to have a boring IOB for a helper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I like Fancy with 1990s big hair, in a prom dress.  A rotting zombie would also be ok, as long as it was sort of pretty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy was nice, but I&amp;#39;ve already done that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy obliged.  Did a mini fashion show for me, for a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I made a request:  Show me how to get to the world of the dreaming Emissary on demand. Anytime I like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t do anything.  Went away in fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I returned to my night&amp;#39;s obsession.  And last night, it was trying to figure out the difference between heightened awareness, and &amp;quot;silent knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got right on the edge of silent knowledge, when I noticed Fancy was showing me something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had produced a dark column of ash, or smoke.  Something black with grey highlights, and not smooth.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She claimed it was, &amp;quot;the nagual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t look like that to me, although it gave off a very creepy, but exhilarating, sensation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;Now you need the light.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very wide strip of white light, with a slight  yellow tint, began to form to the left of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She taught me to form both, but all of  that memory is lost. It was too far on the J curve, to remember it easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I had the 2 pillars (around 7 feet high, 2 feet wide each), she ripped a passage in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In there&amp;quot;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;d completely forgotten having asked her to do that.  I do 1000 things a night.  It seems like I should remember one that obvious, but that&amp;#39;s only because when I write about it, I leave out 995 things that also happened that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s in there?&amp;quot; I was thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy frowned.  She started over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the 20th &amp;quot;start over&amp;quot;, I realized I was now stuck in a loop with Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose she decided to take advantage of the situation, once she saw how stupid I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realizing I was stuck in a loop, I walked away to the other side of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I could feel &amp;quot;the nagual&amp;quot; coming out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t explain that. And it never produced any significant results you could describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just felt it was coming when I held a very deep level of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; what IOBs can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the  other hand, I came home last night, and Cholita was talking to herself in the kitchen.

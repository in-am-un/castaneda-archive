They didn't realize they had brought their cattle to graze on their farm lands.\n\nRuby invited me as a child to hear her tell stories around a campfire.  I didn't realize back then, it was a variety of sorcery.  Sorcery story telling.\n\nWhen the assemblage point reaches the purple zone, you can literally narrate a story in the darkness, and it appears above you as a movie.\n\nIt's quite stunning!\n\nHaving seen that, I regret not paying more attention to Ruby.\n\nIt could be why the anthropologists I grew up around told me back then that hearing  a story from Ruby was \"the chance of a lifetime\", and a great honor.\n\nBut Ruby scared the hell out of me.\n\nRuby lived in the \"mixed indian\" reservation of Morongo, which likely had as many Luiseno as anything else.\n\nThe Luiseno are the 10,000 year old inhabitants of the coast of southern California.  Relics have been dug up proving that.  It's the age that don Juan suggests for the origins of our sorcery.\n\nAn age that makes skeptics laugh.  Not realizing, it's actually the best estimate around!\n\nBut were there really men like don Juan, \"all over\" there just below Los Angeles, when the Olmecs lived in eastern mexico quite a distance away?\n\nI don't know, but someone found evidence that mesoamerica was supplying tobacco and other \"drugs\" to Egypt.\n\nAnd it's not out of the question that the Olmecs, whos sorcery figurines were found in cities dating (arguably) to around 4500 years ago, were on the supply route of the middle east.\n\nThat's why it caught my eye when I saw that article on the Miwoks.\n\nSomeone was building houses near San Francisco,  and dug up some indian bones.\n\nThey sent for the Miwoks, and it was determined the stuff was likely 4500 years old.\n\n[https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/people\\_coastmiwok.htm](https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/people_coastmiwok.htm)\n\nMeaning those native americans were up there at the same time the Olmecs were at the peak of their sorcery practices on the east coast of Mexico.  A continuous landmass to the Miwoks.\n\nAnd Ruby's Luiseno territory is closer to eastern Mexico than San Francisco.\n\nIt all \"seems to add up\".  It's very reasonable to assume some Olmec \"seers\" were living out here not far from LA.\n\nAnd that our sorcery really is Olmec,  that it's proto-siberian in origin, and that groups like AIM are at fault for accusing Carlos of \"Cultural appropriation\".\n\nFact is, they're practicing defunct Olmec \"Men of Knowledge\" sorcery.  Just plan profiteering \"shamanism\".\n\nNot \"sorcery\" as Carlos had.\n\nIt's well accepted now that the Olmecs were the mother of all mesoamerican shamanism.\n\nAnd thousands of years older than AIM has a  right to lay claim to.\n\nAlso, our sorcery works.\n\nWhile theirs....\n\nI'll let you figure that out.  But they all seem to need some \"help\" to perceive allies.  Devil's Weed for example.  And they go on \"vision quests\".\n\nYou have to wonder why you have to go on a quest, to have visions.\n\nI did that for 10 hours yesterday, in my bedroom.  Each one far beyond anything an AIM member is likely to see. Since they've never described anything that outrageious.\n\nBut the books of Carlos do!\n\nWe're just crummy europeans in here, mostly, and we don't need power plants.\n\nThat's because of Carlos.\n\nBut good luck talking to AIM, and requesting they apologize after all these years.\n\nEven though they should!\n\nWe also had the guy who deleted his post a few days ago, after trying to sell his crummy fake magazine issue about Carlos, where he just assumes it's fiction.  And does a \"thoughtful analysis\".\n\nReally, there's no reason to believe the books of Carlos are fiction!\n\nThe facts are all on the side of Carlos.\n\nIt's not our fault all the other magical systems don't work anymore.\n\nThat's what really bothers people.  It's \"too good to be true\".\n\nBut it is!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Old Seer](https://preview.redd.it/qq1faibo7m991.jpg?width=183&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b83560d1ea63677c62d249150c5d82b4f8f03648)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Old seer as Werejaguar](https://preview.redd.it/xtkbtu008m991.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=576e22565d772d902675e141b2d005d0fe4c14c9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[How to make an energy tunnel 6000 miles long](https://preview.redd.it/i7osx1u48m991.jpg?width=524&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c55415392275535c79e714eab1b7eda0ff7dffff)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Relaxing with your double \\(I've done it\\)](https://preview.redd.it/kfjtjq3a8m991.jpg?width=194&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b376a607422c77b8a1f7ad1f1d05c31fcb9c07a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Old Seer in Jaguar form, bringing his Ally along for fun](https://preview.redd.it/cvexv31h8m991.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd91e378f505bf6002a6979481b4fec4d2a94824)\n\nI nearly transformed into a werejaguar doing the Affection Tensegrity pass last week.\n\nTo be more correct, I picked up the \"feeling that the Olmecs liked\" about that, as I was finishing that form and moving in to grab the double.  \"Ravenous\" and \"Powerful\".\n\nIt was quite vivid!

Each one far beyond anything an AIM member is likely to see. Since they&amp;#39;ve never described anything that outrageious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the books of Carlos do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re just crummy europeans in here, mostly, and we don&amp;#39;t need power plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But good luck talking to AIM, and requesting they apologize after all these years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though they should!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also had the guy who deleted his post a few days ago, after trying to sell his crummy fake magazine issue about Carlos, where he just assumes it&amp;#39;s fiction.  And does a &amp;quot;thoughtful analysis&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, there&amp;#39;s no reason to believe the books of Carlos are fiction!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The facts are all on the side of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not our fault all the other magical systems don&amp;#39;t work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what really bothers people.  It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;too good to be true&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qq1faibo7m991.jpg?width=183&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b83560d1ea63677c62d249150c5d82b4f8f03648\"&gt;Old Seer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xtkbtu008m991.png?width=543&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=576e22565d772d902675e141b2d005d0fe4c14c9\"&gt;Old seer as Werejaguar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i7osx1u48m991.jpg?width=524&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c55415392275535c79e714eab1b7eda0ff7dffff\"&gt;How to make an energy tunnel 6000 miles long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kfjtjq3a8m991.jpg?width=194&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2b376a607422c77b8a1f7ad1f1d05c31fcb9c07a\"&gt;Relaxing with your double (I&amp;#39;ve done it)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cvexv31h8m991.png?width=320&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cd91e378f505bf6002a6979481b4fec4d2a94824\"&gt;Old Seer in Jaguar form, bringing his Ally along for fun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nearly transformed into a werejaguar doing the Affection Tensegrity pass last week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be more correct, I picked up the &amp;quot;feeling that the Olmecs liked&amp;quot; about that, as I was finishing that form and moving in to grab the double.  &amp;quot;Ravenous&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Powerful&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was quite vivid!

My *intent* is to give a brief recapitulation of my relationship with Castaneda and his ideas, which exists entirely through his books and whatever other sources I\u2019ve encountered related to him, both good and bad.   \n\nI *intend* is to give my \u201cbest fit\u201d take on Castaneda, good, bad, and in between.  I have gratitude and no ax to grind, am part of no faction, never met Castaneda or anyone from any faction in any manner of which I am aware, and have no interest in taking any side other than the Truth.  My \u201cbest fit\u201d is the result of my ongoing process and is constantly revised as new revelations are processed.  New information will lead me to new conclusions.\n\n**Journey to Castaneda**\n\nI encountered Castaneda and his books as part of my explorations after I had come to the conclusion that my Path no longer went through Catholic Churches every Sunday.  Those explorations went deep into the Mystic and the Esoteric, so I\u2019m at minimum conversationally familiar with most of the usually suspect areas.\n\n*Teachings of Don Juan* was a rough and uneven read for me.  I agree with the general assessment that too much focus was spent on the drugs.  The notes at the end, while very useful for me, were awkward in respect to the rest of the book.  *A Separate Reality* was where Castaneda and his ideas found traction with me in a most unexpected way.\n\nI grew up experiencing Reality in ways which didn\u2019t make sense to others.  When Castaneda described Inorganic Beings (IOBs) and Allies, I immediately recognized them as what I had been calling \u201cThings That Were Not Really Things\u201d (TTWNRTs) all my life.  At that point, Castaneda and his works took on a new significance for me through me being able to correlate my experiences with Castaneda\u2019s words and ideas.\n\nCastaneda\u2019s description of IOBs also had some discrepancies from my experiences.  In my experiences, IOBs were just a general part of Reality, they have always there for me rather than something I had to seek out.  These TTWNRTs had never been any sort of threat to me, the worst were something akin to Monsters, Inc., a bit of a scare, which they would then \u201capologize\u201d for when I called them on it.  They were more like playmates and friends than what Castaneda describes, and the thought of making them a \u201cservant\u201d was and is incomprehensible to me.  IMO most of those childhood \u201cinvisible friends\u201d people have are simply IOBs.\n\nOnce I found a functor for correspondence, I devoured the rest of Castaneda\u2019s books (*Fire From Within* was the most recent at the time).  Castaneda is a phenomenal and captivating writer, and his take on sorcery from a subjective POV I found unique and refreshing.  The sorcery of Castaneda and don Juan is an experimental science, where individuals perform the same practices and compare results, building a body of knowledge.  Most esoteric writers produce works which are more like cookbooks, assuming the reader understands a significant body of knowledge in order to comprehend the material and told in a clinically objective and cryptic manner.  Castaneda ushers his uninitiated readers through the whole process from the beginning as he encountered it.\n\nNow, I do wonder how much of this is Castaneda\u2019s *intent* and how much is don Juan\u2019s *intent*, because one thing which was clear to me is that don Juan and likely Castaneda himself understood what a truly flawed nagual Castaneda was, so he and the books were used to spread the Lineage like dandelion seeds.\n\n**The Power of Silence and The Art of Dreaming**\n\n*Power of Silence* was Castaneda\u2019s capstone for me.  This Rosetta stone of sorcery ties Castaneda\u2019s \u201cToltec wisdom\u201d directly into [Joseph Campbell\u2019s Hero\u2019s Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey), and thereby directly into [Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung).  Once I get to Jung, I can pretty much get anywhere else I need to go (ask Cholita to explain better, I\u2019m sure she can).  *Art of Dreaming* built on Castaneda\u2019s completed foundation.\n\nI gratefully incorporated Castaneda\u2019s ideas into my personal \u201cLineage\u201d alongside all the other thinkers I\u2019ve encountered over the years from the obvious like Buddha, Lao Tzu, and Jesus to the more obscure like [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander), [CS Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce), and [Nishida Kitaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitaro_Nishida) (IMO a MUST read is [The Nothingness Beyond God](https://thekyotoschoolofphilosophy.wordpress.com/god-and-nothingness-the-form-of-the-formless/), a foundational work for me).\n\n**Magical Passes And Beyond**\n\nAnd then came *Magical Passes*.\n\nThe change in style, tone, and *intent* was as obvious as the photos which suddenly populated a Castaneda book for the first time.\n\nWhile the previous books were designed to encode Castaneda\u2019s experiences and don Juan\u2019s teachings, *Magical Passes* was designed to encode Castaneda\u2019s workshops and classes.  Since I was coming from a very different POV than most who explore Castaneda\u2019s books, this book was FAR less useful for me that any of the previous books.  While the practices offered were intriguing, my primary interests lay elsewhere.\n\nI considered incorporating Tensegrity as part of my exercise regimen, but *felt* wrong when trying it so I dropped it.  I\u2019m not opposed to the concept, and certainly recommend it for anyone who finds benefit, but I need to suss out how to do it properly before I use it myself.\n\nCleargreen seemed to me like little more than a corporate shell for a money-grab/book deal sort of thang.  I seem to be not entirely off the mark with that \u201cbest fit\u201d.  The meaning of the name was clear to me from the beginning.\n\n*Wheel of Time* and *Active Side of Infinity* are books that I never bought and probably should just to complete my Castaneda collection.  I saw them as essentially reworked material from previous books and they were pieces of the evidence which help lead to my conclusions on Cleargreen.\n\n**Burnt By The Fire From Without**\n\nIMO, Castaneda was very much a phenomenon of his time.  He was part of the rising global interconnected spiritual community, but his style and methods were best suited for the pre-Internet age.  A different style of Trickster is needed these days (not that Tricksters are \u201cneeded\u201d, lol).  His death during the early Internet Age and the reaction to it demonstrates this.\n\nIn the old days, Castaneda would have simply vanished from History and everyone could just conclude that he was consumed by the \u201cFire From Within\u201d, and that would be that.  What happened instead was very different, as you well know.\n\nCastaneda was a powerful enough sorcerer to ride herd on his Lineage while he was alive, but after he was gone, his Legacy wasn\u2019t strong enough.  As soon as Castaneda didn\u2019t follow his own prophesied script for his exit, the center could no longer hold and the factions shattered, splintered, and spread across the globe.  People died; people spilled their guts; people tried to cash in and get their own \u201cbook deal\u201d; etc.  Castaneda left an HUGE vacuum to which people struggled to adjust.\n\nWhich leads us to now, with some factions idolizing Castaneda as a demigod, some trying to follow in his footsteps, some cashing in/out, some trying to build onto his Lineage, and some trying put his Legacy on the Procrustean bed of fact and truth (which produces some strange results when applied to sorcery, as you well know). \n\n**Castaneda The Trickster**\n\nThat relevant and irrelevant history out of the way, my take on Castaneda is complicated, nuanced,  and complex.  Here\u2019s my \u201cbest fit\u201d for Carlos Castaneda.\n\nFrom the beginning, Castaneda was a Trickster, a con man who played fast and loose with both the facts and his stated *intent*, which would vary depending on his circumstances and his needs.  IMO, he fled to the US to escape a situation he wished to avoid, searching for freedom and erasing his past, hustled and angled his way to his PhD, parlayed that credibility into his \u201cbook deal\u201d, and the rest is history. \n\nCastaneda the Trickster is ALSO a consummate impeccable sorcerer.  All of Castaneda\u2019s actions were inextricable part of a seamless sorcerous whole, his cons were simply an extension of his sorcery and vice versa.\n\nMany people seem to have difficulty reconciling those two truths, but I\u2019ve never had any problem doing so.  While I don\u2019t always *agree* with Castaneda\u2019s choices, that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand them and recognize them for what they are.\n\n**What Is Truth?**\n\nFrom the start, Truth is a slippery subject.  The great sorcerer G\u00f6del (IMO the connection between mathematics and sorcery needs more exploration) proved that no set of principles can ever exhaust Truth in an interesting Reality, pointing the way to the Unknowable.  Sorcery uses Truth as a doorway, and sorcerers then step through that door into the great beyond.\n\nMany people get caught up in concerns over whether don Juan and company actually existed and the events happened as Castaneda describes, but that was never my concern and ultimately does not matter.  What matters is practicality, whether a person can extract useful information from Castaneda\u2019s works and integrate that knowledge into their lives.  The \u201clived truth\u201d is the end goal, whether or not words written on a page leading to that goal happen to be true is of a much lesser concern.\n\nIMO, the events and characters in Castaneda\u2019s books are based on real events and people, but \u201cfictionalized\u201d.  Some of them like don Juan having potentially several different people going into the gestalt character.  I have no issue with Castaneda\u2019s decision to edit his Narrative in this manner because of the gains in clarity and power.\n\nLike all of us, Castaneda drew from everything he encountered, and many influences beyond simply don Juan and company went into his \u201cToltec wisdom\u201d synthesis.  This synthesis produces gains by escaping a narrow boring Tonal presentation, a necessity for even trying to discuss sorcery, but doing so leaves a certain amount of fact behind (sorcerers don\u2019t need no stinkin\u2019 facts).  While that reduces the fact value of the books, it actually INCREASES their Truth value, with the result of rendering them less useful for those reliant on facts and the validation of others (how reachable those people are under the best of circumstances is debatable).\n\n**Trickster\u2019s Journey**\n\nFrom my POV, while Castaneda started the Hero\u2019s Journey, he never completes it and never *intended* to, opting for the Trickster\u2019s Journey instead.  Since one of the *intents* of my \u201cLineage\u201d is to complete that Hero\u2019s Journey as many times as possible in as many forms as possible, not wanting to complete that Journey and opting out runs counter my fundamental nature and is near inconceivable to me.  This makes parts of Castaneda\u2019s system and approach fall into the category I call:  \u201cThat\u2019s a Feature, NOT a Bug.\u201d \n\nCastaneda connects his ideas with the Hero\u2019s Journey in *Power of Silence*, but he never completes the Hero\u2019s Journey.  Castaneda\u2019s Journey isn't the Hero\u2019s Journey, but rather the Trickster\u2019s Journey.  The two Journeys follow the same Path until right after the Prize is gained.  At that point, the Lair is exited and the Hero returns with the Prize, thereby saving the City, winning the Princess, and becoming the King.  The Trickster, OTOH, at some point skedaddles with the Prize, taking it for his own, damning the City, betraying the Princess, and becoming the Villain who moves on to the next City (fates every deserves from the Trickster\u2019s POV for trusting him in the first place). \n\nGiven Castaneda\u2019s Trickster Path, him truncating the Hero\u2019s Journey into the Trickster\u2019s Journey makes both logical and sorcerous sense, but IMO presents an incomplete and self-serving portrayal of Reality (which serves the Trickster\u2019s *intent* PERFECTLY, lol).  I\u2019ve gone down some backroads and alleyways Castaneda never mentions and which seem like they should have been included to complete an accurate portrayal of the sorcerous world.\n\n**Love**\n\nThe Trickster\u2019s Journey specifically excludes a vital component of the Hero\u2019s Journey:  Love.  \n\nThe only place Love fits in the Trickster\u2019s Journey is as a tool for enacting the Trickster\u2019s *intent*.  The Trickster never Loves, but uses Love.  OTOH, the Hero is motivated by Love and shares the Prize with all, producing synergistic gains which the Trickster could never hope to achieve with his \u201coutside in\u201d approach.  This is why Love is ultimately the most powerful force in Reality.  \n\nLove is not tactically useful for sorcerers, which is why Tricksters avoid it like a Coronavirus.  Love requires both sacrificing one\u2019s energy with only Hope that is returned eventually through roundabout ways, AND makes one vulnerable to others in order to give and receive energy.  For a Trickster, the idea making one\u2019s self vulnerable while expending energy to help others with ZERO expectation of ANY return is lunacy in its highest form, and should be rejected by everyone following the Trickster\u2019s Path.\n\n**Apprentices, Cleargreen, And Book Deals, Oh My!**\n\nThis section can be squarely placed into the \u201cThat\u2019s a Feature, NOT a Bug\u201d category, and possibly the least flattering part of my \u201cbest fit\u201d for Castaneda.\n\nCastaneda\u2019s Trickster\u2019s Path *intent* shows in the way he created his \u201cNagual\u2019s Party\u201d, his apprentices, Cleargreen, workshops, etc.  The entire enterprise was created to funnel Castaneda energy to use in his Trickster\u2019s efforts, with his final escape at the end his *intent*.  Working with others to actually build something tends to run against a Trickster\u2019s nature, and Castaneda struggled trying to balance his desire for energy and the need to use that energy to build the group around him.  He needed to teach real sorcery to apprentices for them to be able to funnel energy to him effectively, but that was designed with HIS benefit in mind, NOT theirs.  Any unnecessary benefit to someone OTHER than Castaneda, like his apprentices, was a pleasant side effect tolerated so long as it didn\u2019t cost him and might benefit him.  While Castaneda is not unusual in his *intent* and actions, those run counter my *intent* and actions, so I have trouble judging him without having my personal bias flavor that judgment.\n\nCastaneda structured things so that his apprentices were always capable of contributing their max to his energy.  He taught them to shepherd their own energy, and of course send some to him in return for his teaching.  As they gained ability and became more closely bound to him, he then tasked them to find others to grow the ranks.  This Path looks to the outside as going \u201cfull David Koresh Cult-Leader\u201d (and I\u2019ve consistently maintained that no one should EVER go \u201cfull David Koresh Cult-Leader).  The severing of outside connections, following Castaneda\u2019s seemingly arbitrary dictates, the unusual carnality, etc. all parallel the Koresh Narrative much more than I am comfortable *seeing*.  While I understand the sorcerous and energetic basis for the way Castaneda structured his Legacy and Lineage, my *intent* leads down a different Path and I find the Path he chose uncomfortable.\n\n**A Man Of Knowledge**\n\nUltimately, I think Castaneda was a Trickster trying to escape his past mistakes.  He thought that ancient Native American sorcery was a \u201cshort cut\u201d and things spiraled when that sorcery turned out to be FAR more real than he initially thought.  Castaneda shed his life in Peru like a snakeskin and came to the US with the *intent* to pursue freedom and escape the responsibilities of his past decisions.  That *intent* seems to have been sustained impeccably by Castaneda throughout his life, shedding one skin for the next when required.  The Trickster became a Teacher in order to have others able to help him in his sorcery, binding them to his *intent*, for better and for worse.  All his actions are *seen* as linked to his unbending *intent*.\n\nCastaneda was a mighty sorcerer, and opened doors into the Unknown for countless people.  I just don\u2019t always agree with how he chose to use his might.

IMO, he fled to the US to escape a situation he wished to avoid, searching for freedom and erasing his past, hustled and angled his way to his PhD, parlayed that credibility into his \u201cbook deal\u201d, and the rest is history. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda the Trickster is ALSO a consummate impeccable sorcerer.  All of Castaneda\u2019s actions were inextricable part of a seamless sorcerous whole, his cons were simply an extension of his sorcery and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people seem to have difficulty reconciling those two truths, but I\u2019ve never had any problem doing so.  While I don\u2019t always &lt;em&gt;agree&lt;/em&gt; with Castaneda\u2019s choices, that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand them and recognize them for what they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Truth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the start, Truth is a slippery subject.  The great sorcerer G\u00f6del (IMO the connection between mathematics and sorcery needs more exploration) proved that no set of principles can ever exhaust Truth in an interesting Reality, pointing the way to the Unknowable.  Sorcery uses Truth as a doorway, and sorcerers then step through that door into the great beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people get caught up in concerns over whether don Juan and company actually existed and the events happened as Castaneda describes, but that was never my concern and ultimately does not matter.  What matters is practicality, whether a person can extract useful information from Castaneda\u2019s works and integrate that knowledge into their lives.  The \u201clived truth\u201d is the end goal, whether or not words written on a page leading to that goal happen to be true is of a much lesser concern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO, the events and characters in Castaneda\u2019s books are based on real events and people, but \u201cfictionalized\u201d.  Some of them like don Juan having potentially several different people going into the gestalt character.  I have no issue with Castaneda\u2019s decision to edit his Narrative in this manner because of the gains in clarity and power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like all of us, Castaneda drew from everything he encountered, and many influences beyond simply don Juan and company went into his \u201cToltec wisdom\u201d synthesis.  This synthesis produces gains by escaping a narrow boring Tonal presentation, a necessity for even trying to discuss sorcery, but doing so leaves a certain amount of fact behind (sorcerers don\u2019t need no stinkin\u2019 facts).  While that reduces the fact value of the books, it actually INCREASES their Truth value, with the result of rendering them less useful for those reliant on facts and the validation of others (how reachable those people are under the best of circumstances is debatable).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trickster\u2019s Journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my POV, while Castaneda started the Hero\u2019s Journey, he never completes it and never &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to, opting for the Trickster\u2019s Journey instead.  Since one of the &lt;em&gt;intents&lt;/em&gt; of my \u201cLineage\u201d is to complete that Hero\u2019s Journey as many times as possible in as many forms as possible, not wanting to complete that Journey and opting out runs counter my fundamental nature and is near inconceivable to me.  This makes parts of Castaneda\u2019s system and approach fall into the category I call:  \u201cThat\u2019s a Feature, NOT a Bug.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda connects his ideas with the Hero\u2019s Journey in &lt;em&gt;Power of Silence&lt;/em&gt;, but he never completes the Hero\u2019s Journey.  Castaneda\u2019s Journey isn&amp;#39;t the Hero\u2019s Journey, but rather the Trickster\u2019s Journey.  The two Journeys follow the same Path until right after the Prize is gained.  At that point, the Lair is exited and the Hero returns with the Prize, thereby saving the City, winning the Princess, and becoming the King.  The Trickster, OTOH, at some point skedaddles with the Prize, taking it for his own, damning the City, betraying the Princess, and becoming the Villain who moves on to the next City (fates every deserves from the Trickster\u2019s POV for trusting him in the first place). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given Castaneda\u2019s Trickster Path, him truncating the Hero\u2019s Journey into the Trickster\u2019s Journey makes both logical and sorcerous sense, but IMO presents an incomplete and self-serving portrayal of Reality (which serves the Trickster\u2019s &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; PERFECTLY, lol).  I\u2019ve gone down some backroads and alleyways Castaneda never mentions and which seem like they should have been included to complete an accurate portrayal of the sorcerous world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Trickster\u2019s Journey specifically excludes a vital component of the Hero\u2019s Journey:  Love.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only place Love fits in the Trickster\u2019s Journey is as a tool for enacting the Trickster\u2019s &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.  The Trickster never Loves, but uses Love.  OTOH, the Hero is motivated by Love and shares the Prize with all, producing synergistic gains which the Trickster could never hope to achieve with his \u201coutside in\u201d approach.  This is why Love is ultimately the most powerful force in Reality.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love is not tactically useful for sorcerers, which is why Tricksters avoid it like a Coronavirus.  Love requires both sacrificing one\u2019s energy with only Hope that is returned eventually through roundabout ways, AND makes one vulnerable to others in order to give and receive energy.  For a Trickster, the idea making one\u2019s self vulnerable while expending energy to help others with ZERO expectation of ANY return is lunacy in its highest form, and should be rejected by everyone following the Trickster\u2019s Path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apprentices, Cleargreen, And Book Deals, Oh My!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This section can be squarely placed into the \u201cThat\u2019s a Feature, NOT a Bug\u201d category, and possibly the least flattering part of my \u201cbest fit\u201d for Castaneda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda\u2019s Trickster\u2019s Path &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; shows in the way he created his \u201cNagual\u2019s Party\u201d, his apprentices, Cleargreen, workshops, etc.  The entire enterprise was created to funnel Castaneda energy to use in his Trickster\u2019s efforts, with his final escape at the end his &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.  Working with others to actually build something tends to run against a Trickster\u2019s nature, and Castaneda struggled trying to balance his desire for energy and the need to use that energy to build the group around him.  He needed to teach real sorcery to apprentices for them to be able to funnel energy to him effectively, but that was designed with HIS benefit in mind, NOT theirs.  Any unnecessary benefit to someone OTHER than Castaneda, like his apprentices, was a pleasant side effect tolerated so long as it didn\u2019t cost him and might benefit him.  While Castaneda is not unusual in his &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; and actions, those run counter my &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; and actions, so I have trouble judging him without having my personal bias flavor that judgment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda structured things so that his apprentices were always capable of contributing their max to his energy.  He taught them to shepherd their own energy, and of course send some to him in return for his teaching.  As they gained ability and became more closely bound to him, he then tasked them to find others to grow the ranks.  This Path looks to the outside as going \u201cfull David Koresh Cult-Leader\u201d (and I\u2019ve consistently maintained that no one should EVER go \u201cfull David Koresh Cult-Leader).  The severing of outside connections, following Castaneda\u2019s seemingly arbitrary dictates, the unusual carnality, etc. all parallel the Koresh Narrative much more than I am comfortable &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.  While I understand the sorcerous and energetic basis for the way Castaneda structured his Legacy and Lineage, my &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; leads down a different Path and I find the Path he chose uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Man Of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think Castaneda was a Trickster trying to escape his past mistakes.  He thought that ancient Native American sorcery was a \u201cshort cut\u201d and things spiraled when that sorcery turned out to be FAR more real than he initially thought.  Castaneda shed his life in Peru like a snakeskin and came to the US with the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; to pursue freedom and escape the responsibilities of his past decisions.  That &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; seems to have been sustained impeccably by Castaneda throughout his life, shedding one skin for the next when required.  The Trickster became a Teacher in order to have others able to help him in his sorcery, binding them to his &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, for better and for worse.  All his actions are &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; as linked to his unbending &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda was a mighty sorcerer, and opened doors into the Unknown for countless people.  I just don\u2019t always agree with how he chose to use his might.  YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false,

And you're right, it's better to look at everything about Carlos openly, because that helps to repair the damage done to his reputation.\n\nThere are a couple of women from private classes who just won't come over here and write for us. Their memories are a gold mine!\n\nThey say it's because of the \"shenanigans\".\n\nBut I've never heard of any that aren't for an obvious reason.\n\nI told them to just come and put whatever's bothering them out in the open.\n\nBut don Juan's words seem in effect. If you quit the path, you join the ranks of the petty tyrants forever.\n\nThey \"won't go back\" is what they say.\n\nFortunately, Cholita is on a different trip. She says, \"I don't want to be Jesus and save all of humanity!\"\n\n(You gotta love Cholita...)\n\nAs for the trickster thing, that's automatic with sorcerers.  You have no choice.\n\nWhen Aunt Martha asks what you did the night before, and the truth is you were gathering 2 demons together to see what they'd do, you just flat can't tell her the truth.\n\nIf you say \"nothing\", she pesters you for more information on your life.  Like, \"What, no girlfriend?\"\n\nBut if you say, \"I went to this lovely church near my home\", she leaves you alone.\n\nCarlos was that kind of trickster.\n\nI'm not sure how Campbell's trickster behaves, but that seems to be someone who's made a choice to be a trickster.\n\nAnd maybe knowledge of that view has colored the chat rooms when it comes to Castaneda.\n\nIt's like me telling you guys, \"All inorganic manifestations are green\".\n\nI guarantee people will report seeing green men.\n\nThat's how *intent* works.\n\n&gt;His first act of Trickery was his move from Peru to the US, leaving behind a pregnant fiance/wife \n\nI have other Peruvian friends who have done that.    Could simply be cultural.  \n\nThere are some really unpleasant things about Peruvians.  One I know is banned from leaving Peru, for counterfeiting and hacking.  I know for a fact, he was merely curious about it, having a genius IQ.\n\nHe just had bad judgement about when to do it, and when not to.\n\nThen, leaving Peruvian men weirdness aside, in Thailand men beat their wives. \n\nIt's ok.  No one complains.  They're only 100 years away from women being sold as slaves in the market.\n\n(except they still are and it turns out, they didn't mind so much)\n\nGo to the bars in Bangkok and hang out with the young women. Ask the Mama San why they're in the bar.\n\n\"Married at 15, husband beat them, here to find foreign husband. Do what you want with them, and don't feel sorry for them.\"\n\nThat's the most common reply.\n\nIn Japan, all of the office working men are expected to womanize after work, under the subway stations.  If you're a newbie, you'll be getting a blow job while the other men watch.\n\nIf you visit, go to Kabukicho near the lovely college, find a man with curly hair standing at an intersection of walking path businesses, give him some cash, and ask him to \"show you around\".\n\nHe's yakuza.  $400 will do the job.  You'll end up in a bondage dungeon eventually.\n\nDon't even get me started about Russia...  I'll just say, it's cold there.  For everyone.\n\nYou can test that by kicking a beautiful Siberian Cat across the room.\n\nDon't hurt the poor thing.\n\nBut however you do it, it'll run back and lick your boots.\n\nCats in the  USA don't do that...\n\nRussian cats either do, or they didn't pass on their genes.\n\n&gt;He \"erased his personal history\" and made a life for himself in the US, hustling various jobs.\n\nSo this is loaded with conclusions.  And moral judgement laced idioms.\n\n&gt;when Castaneda seems to be trapped into a Path with a woman he escapes for a Bigger Better Deal. \n\nMore idioms.  \n\nAnd by the way, you capitalized one???  That doesn't make it more true!\n\nYou could say this about 1/4th of the  young men everywhere.  \n\nBut there's another factor.  *Intent* kept him able to learn sorcery.\n\nI've seen the same thing in my life.  A series of happy coincidences, allowing someone to avoid the very thing that makes it impossible to learn sorcery:  Being under the control of people who are not.\n\nYou could re-explain what you are saying with different morally loaded idioms and come to the opposite conclusion.\n\nThat despite his stupidity, *intent* had bigger plans for him.  \n\nAnd his (not uncommon) behavior was influenced by intent.\n\nAnd I sure would not like to have any exes writing about their relationships with me, especially if I became famous and had a lot of money.\n\nOh man... If Cholita writes a book, I'm screwed.  She already draws me in her cartoons, as a giant robot with a single eye, zapping everyone in his path with lightening bolts, and slicing them with his long toenails.\n\n&gt; So Castaneda received his degree, seen as unwarranted by most of the Academy.\n\nWow, what a list!\n\nThis point only shows what I learned as a child, hanging out with his contemporaries.\n\nThey were desperately jealous of Carlos.  They wanted to comment on his writings, because that's the kind of thing they were desperate to find.\n\nI hung out with Lowell Bean and Harry Lawton, who were studying the Indians at Morongo, a place Carlos also visited.\n\nOne complaint Lowell had was that \"shamans don't talk like that\".\n\nIt doesn't really make sense, once you're able to assemble other worlds, as a result of neutralizing your nasty personality through silence.\n\nI don't think the things his contemporaries had to say about him, deserve much weight.\n\nJealous. \n\nThat sums them up.  I saw it with my own eyes, over and over again.  Even at 12 years old I was often tempted to ask them why they hated Carlos so much.  \n\nThere's another side to that too.  Indians themselves eagerly gobbled up Carlos' books and tried to cash in, modifying their own practices to match what he wrote, just a little bit.\n\nAn anthropologist trying to study an unstudied tribe would find, if he could figure it out, that half the stuff they were claiming was copied from Carlos.  But when those indians were asked about Carlos, they'd put him down.\n\nThey behaved like a bunch of Ken Eaglefeathers.\n\nSo his anthropologist contemporaries' work was both destroyed by Carlos, and de-valued.  But not because of Carlos. Only because his writings were so interesting.\n\nAnd even under ideal circumstances, anthropology is dominated by the king of the hill, with anyone below him on the  hill subject to his wrath, if they didn't agree with him.\n\nMy father spent years trying to prove the Indians of Southern California were farming.  \n\nWatering crops.  \n\nHe was told they couldn't have.  \n\nThen he found corn cobs in some caves, and proceeded to try to grow a similar variety, without water.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nYears later, it turned out they'd been irrigating an entire valley, which is what attracted settlers into the region. \n\nThe lush growth, created by those Indian's management of water.\n\nAnthropologists are some of the biggest dishonest babies...\n\nAs for when he got his PhD and when the loot, seems like a non-sequitur to me.\n\nDon't argue using non-sequiturs.  They're only designed to shut down conversations, not to enhance them.\n\n&gt; He withdrew after grabbing the Academy's top prize in 1973 \n\nOk, you lost me with the loaded verbiage.\n\nIt's a cool discussion, but I don't feel like correcting verb selection.\n\nI suspect you have a little angst against Carlos, maybe because you're so talented.\n\nOr maybe it's more like a skilled Dzogchen practitioner disapproving of sorcery.\n\nSpeaking of which, you should see the discussions about Tibetan Buddhist masters.   Carlos was a saint compared to some of those guys.\n\nI believe there was a private class student who was told by a famous Tibetan sorcerer that she had to have sex with him, or he'd send her to hell.\n\nFor real.\n\nThen there was the rinpoche that Victoria found, after leaving Carlos.\n\nOr was it Virginia?", "edited": 1590512112.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_frvsfy3", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I stated, I was giving the &amp;quot;outsider&amp;quot; POV, fully acknowledging how different things are from the &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course.

Indians themselves eagerly gobbled up Carlos&amp;#39; books and tried to cash in, modifying their own practices to match what he wrote, just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An anthropologist trying to study an unstudied tribe would find, if he could figure it out, that half the stuff they were claiming was copied from Carlos.  But when those indians were asked about Carlos, they&amp;#39;d put him down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They behaved like a bunch of Ken Eaglefeathers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So his anthropologist contemporaries&amp;#39; work was both destroyed by Carlos, and de-valued.  But not because of Carlos. Only because his writings were so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even under ideal circumstances, anthropology is dominated by the king of the hill, with anyone below him on the  hill subject to his wrath, if they didn&amp;#39;t agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father spent years trying to prove the Indians of Southern California were farming.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watering crops.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was told they couldn&amp;#39;t have.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he found corn cobs in some caves, and proceeded to try to grow a similar variety, without water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Years later, it turned out they&amp;#39;d been irrigating an entire valley, which is what attracted settlers into the region. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lush growth, created by those Indian&amp;#39;s management of water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropologists are some of the biggest dishonest babies...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for when he got his PhD and when the loot, seems like a non-sequitur to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t argue using non-sequiturs.  They&amp;#39;re only designed to shut down conversations, not to enhance them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He withdrew after grabbing the Academy&amp;#39;s top prize in 1973 &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, you lost me with the loaded verbiage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a cool discussion, but I don&amp;#39;t feel like correcting verb selection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect you have a little angst against Carlos, maybe because you&amp;#39;re so talented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it&amp;#39;s more like a skilled Dzogchen practitioner disapproving of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, you should see the discussions about Tibetan Buddhist masters.   Carlos was a saint compared to some of those guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe there was a private class student who was told by a famous Tibetan sorcerer that she had to have sex with him, or he&amp;#39;d send her to hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there was the rinpoche that Victoria found, after leaving Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or was it Virginia?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id":

The Narrative I gave was one I know is incomplete (no one ever has a complete one) and which formed over decades from numerous sources.\n\nI don't envy Castaneda running herd on the crowd he did.  I can't imagine doing that.  Heck, I can't imagine teaching anyone how to get into the second attention, since I never had to learn (if you don't unlearn, you don't have to relearn, lol).\n\nEverything you say here sounds consistent with my personal POV of Castaneda.  As I stated, I was giving the \"outsider\" POV, fully acknowledging how different things are from the \"inside\" (and further giving full acknowledgement for the sorcerous sensibility of his many actions which make little sense to those without at least some knowledge in sorcery). \n\nI'll try to explain in a little more detail the source of the Trickster label.  There are two different ways that Castaneda fits a Trickster: from the standard Tonal POV; and then again from a more sorcerous Archetypal POV.\n\n**Tonal Trickster**\n\nI glossed over a lot of ugly details in my summary, as you know.  If you can, move your assemblage point back in the Tonal position and *see* the Tonal Narrative over some facts concerning Castaneda (remember, this not my POV).\n\nHis first act of Trickery was his move from Peru to the US, leaving behind a pregnant fiance/wife (neither of whom he ever did right by later, despite noises that he would).  He \"erased his personal history\" and made a life for himself in the US, hustling various jobs.  \n\nWe now have Runyan's version of their life together, working his way through UCLA, and the beginning of his sorcery apprenticeship.  Her version has Castaneda following a similar Path with her as he did his fiance/wife in Peru, when Castaneda seems to be trapped into a Path with a woman he escapes for a Bigger Better Deal.  Another life with another woman \"erased\" when that relationship became inconvenient and a better door opened.\n\nHe published his dissertation (and the next two books) to acclaim and HUGE success BEFORE he received the PhD that dissertation was supposed to support (this is viewed as Trickery by the Academy).  The books brought fame and fortune to himself and UCLA, so him not receiving a degree at that point would have been unthinkable, regardless of whether that degree was warranted or not.  So Castaneda received his degree, seen as unwarranted by most of the Academy.\n\nWhile later critical examination of Casteneda's work from the POV of the Academy left him even MORE of a Trickster in their eyes.  He played fast and loose with his sources from the Academy POV, as well chronicled by those FAR more concerned with that Procrustean bed of fact than I am (I'll take Truth every day).  He withdrew after grabbing the Academy's top prize in 1973 and getting the Time article condemned him in their eyes.\n\nThe way Castaneda set up his compound and apprentices much like an Ottoman palace with harem included only compounded his Trickster appearance by layering \"cult leader\" on top of Trickster.  His secrecy allowed those on the outside to indulge their worst conceptions (not unlike the classic horror movie sorcery of keep things off-screen to allow the audience to supply the horror themselves).\n\n*Art of Dreaming* in 1993 was a HUGE departure for Castaneda, with him going public for the first time in 20 years to promote the book and the next phase (I don't know the whole sequence of events, such as when Cleargreen got started; I'm so out of it I had to Google Howard Lee, lol).  IMO, it seems Castaneda was starting to set up things for after his exit.  *Magical Passes* continued laying the post-Castaneda foundation.  From the Tonal POV, this looks like Castaneda has taken his cult to the next level of \"book deal\" by charging money and running workshops and classes, yet more Trickery.\n\nThis new phase continued until Castaneda's final days, which you know FAR more about than I could ever imagine.  From the Tonal, this looks like a cult leader who was unable to deliver on his prophecies, and people who followed him blindly to their death as a result (unpleasantly grouping Castaneda with Jim Jones, Marshall Applewhite, David Koresh, etc.).  After that, various stories circulated about events of the previous 25 years like Amy Wallace's book, further making Castaneda look not simply like a Trickster, but a perverted evil Trickster.\n\nFrom the Tonal POV, this is a VERY compelling and fact supported Narrative.  I have real trouble faulting anyone who is firmly locked in the Tonal from accepting that Narrative as correct, can you?\n\nUnderstanding sorcery, I recognize what I just described is a derogatory Tonal Potemkin facade of Castaneda.  I don't for a minute think that is his true story.\n\n**Archetypal/Sorcerous Trickster**\n\nThis aspect of the Trickster I think Castaneda cannot avoid at least a bit.\n\nThe Trickster is very much a Shadow version of the King, to go full-Jung.  The Trickster is one of the most primordial Archetypes, and integral to Creation.  IMO, accusing Castaneda of being a Trickster in the Archetypal sense is not so much an insult as an acknowledgement of his true nature.\n\nThe whole point of the \"Toltec wisdom\" Castaneda taught was escape from this world and moving into the Beyond.  That DOES truncate the Hero's Journey into Trickster's Journey.  The sorcerer DOES harness their energy and skills in order to escape themselves, rather than use that energy to help others.\n\nYes, Castaneda certainly did the good things you mention above, but the explicit purpose of his Path was ultimately selfish:  for him to escape himself.  That was the tension in his energy use I was talking about, he had to balance helping others and saving for himself (that's ALWAYS a sorcerous challenge, as you well know).\n\nWe all embody and manifest various Archetypes in various combinations throughout our lives.  The Trickster definitely seemed like an Archetype which Castaneda regularly struggled trying to keep in balance, as it appears to be dominant at many times in his life.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_frvmudw", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your thoughtful reply.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO, this is the sort of airing which is needed to help put Castaneda in his appropriate light.

His secrecy allowed those on the outside to indulge their worst conceptions (not unlike the classic horror movie sorcery of keep things off-screen to allow the audience to supply the horror themselves).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art of Dreaming&lt;/em&gt; in 1993 was a HUGE departure for Castaneda, with him going public for the first time in 20 years to promote the book and the next phase (I don&amp;#39;t know the whole sequence of events, such as when Cleargreen got started; I&amp;#39;m so out of it I had to Google Howard Lee, lol).  IMO, it seems Castaneda was starting to set up things for after his exit.  &lt;em&gt;Magical Passes&lt;/em&gt; continued laying the post-Castaneda foundation.  From the Tonal POV, this looks like Castaneda has taken his cult to the next level of &amp;quot;book deal&amp;quot; by charging money and running workshops and classes, yet more Trickery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This new phase continued until Castaneda&amp;#39;s final days, which you know FAR more about than I could ever imagine.  From the Tonal, this looks like a cult leader who was unable to deliver on his prophecies, and people who followed him blindly to their death as a result (unpleasantly grouping Castaneda with Jim Jones, Marshall Applewhite, David Koresh, etc.).  After that, various stories circulated about events of the previous 25 years like Amy Wallace&amp;#39;s book, further making Castaneda look not simply like a Trickster, but a perverted evil Trickster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the Tonal POV, this is a VERY compelling and fact supported Narrative.  I have real trouble faulting anyone who is firmly locked in the Tonal from accepting that Narrative as correct, can you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding sorcery, I recognize what I just described is a derogatory Tonal Potemkin facade of Castaneda.  I don&amp;#39;t for a minute think that is his true story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archetypal/Sorcerous Trickster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This aspect of the Trickster I think Castaneda cannot avoid at least a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Trickster is very much a Shadow version of the King, to go full-Jung.  The Trickster is one of the most primordial Archetypes, and integral to Creation.  IMO, accusing Castaneda of being a Trickster in the Archetypal sense is not so much an insult as an acknowledgement of his true nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole point of the &amp;quot;Toltec wisdom&amp;quot; Castaneda taught was escape from this world and moving into the Beyond.  That DOES truncate the Hero&amp;#39;s Journey into Trickster&amp;#39;s Journey.  The sorcerer DOES harness their energy and skills in order to escape themselves, rather than use that energy to help others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Castaneda certainly did the good things you mention above, but the explicit purpose of his Path was ultimately selfish:  for him to escape himself.  That was the tension in his energy use I was talking about, he had to balance helping others and saving for himself (that&amp;#39;s ALWAYS a sorcerous challenge, as you well know).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all embody and manifest various Archetypes in various combinations throughout our lives.  The Trickster definitely seemed like an Archetype which Castaneda regularly struggled trying to keep in balance, as it appears to be dominant at many times in his life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_gpviug", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gpviug/castanedas_legacy_and_lineage/frvmudw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1590506702.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "frrto17", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1590418447.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gpviug", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Trickster:\n\nI thought about this.\n\nIt's a false reputation for Carlos.

You already have me, my time\u2013 you won\u2019t be able to say where you met me, nor where you saw me, nor where you found me, nor what my name is. That\u2019s\u2026 the rule regarding sorcerers. That\u2019s the rule when one wants\u2026 to know [BECOME A MAN OF KNOWLEDGE], if one\u2019s considerate.\u201d  \n  \u201cWhy is the rule like that, don Juan?\u201d  \n  \u201cIt\u2019s what the sorcerers decided. You don\u2019t tell about a sorcerer, his ways or his death, and you should never use those secrets against him. I\u2019m telling you now. Don\u2019t ever tell where you met me, when I die, so nobody may find out where my body is buried.\u201d  \n  \u201cI told him that there were many people who knew where \u2013  \n  [SHEET 2]  \n  \u2013we\u2019d met.\u201d  \n  \u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d he said assuredly.  \n  \u201cWhat about Fernando and don Nacho?\u201d I asked.  \n  \u201cThey\u2019re idiots, they don\u2019t even know where they are.\u201d  \n  \u201cAnd your daughter-in-law, don Juan?\u201d  \n  \u201cShe doesn\u2019t count. She\u2019s another idiot. But, there are other people who do count.\u201d  \n  \u201cWho, for example?\u201d  \n  \u201dYou\u2019ll know who when they ask you some day, when they ask you where my body is buried.\u201d  \n  \u201cWho\u2019s going to ask me?\u201d  \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll see. The life of a sorcerer is very strange and things happen without going in search for them or even wanting them.\u201d  \n  I asked him again why I should keep it secret.  \n  He said that when I learned more I\u2019d realise that there were certain things that could not be said, personal things that belong only to ourselves. \u201cWhen one is on the path of knowledge,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to tell anyone what one\u2019s up to.\u201d  \n  \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d I promised don Juan.  \n  \u201cYes, you will. You\u2019ve got a big mouth.\u201d  \n  \u201cWhat can I do to avoid it?\u201d  \n  \u201cNothing.\u201d  \n  I wanted to assure don Juan that I didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of giving away his secrets, and how would I be able to reveal then if I didn\u2019t even have the opportunity to do so.  \n  \u201cYou will do, and you will tell,\u201d he said with a friendly smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll say even if you don\u2019t want to. But it\u2019s not worth speaking about this.\u201d  \n  \u201cSo it\u2019s bad to bring up these things, don Juan?  \n  \u201cOf course, especially for you. You won\u2019t lack for people who want\u2013  \n  [SHEET 3]  \n  \u2013to take your power. They\u2019ll take it because speaking scares it away. Speaking robs you of power.\u201d  \n  \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want power?\u201d  \n  \u201cWhat are you learning for if you don\u2019t want power?\u201d  \n  \u201cJust to know.\u201d  \n  \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying, but you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll understand when you realise. When you know more, you\u2019ll use power one way or another.\u201d  \n  I told him that I just wanted to know, and that I wasn\u2019t really interested in living the life of a sorcerer.  \n  \u201cA man of knowledge has to use his power,\u201d he said. \u201cOr why would you want to know? What are you going to do if you get into a fix and you have to use sorcery? You don\u2019t know how it helps. Once you start, there\u2019s no way to stop.\u201d  \n  \u201cYou mean you can never leave the life of sorcery behind?\u201d  \n  \u201cNope. Unless you learn a lot, but to learn a lot you have to use the power of sorcery. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d \u201cA man of knowledge has to act sooner or later, you can\u2019t get by just by thinking. A man of knowledge has the power and know-how to do whatever he wants. You\u2019ll see there\u2019s no way to stop once you start on the path of knowledge. I\u2019m telling you. You can\u2019t stop or change tracks.\u201d \u201cA man of knowledge always becomes more mysterious than hell.\u201d \u201cNobody will be able to stop you if you become a man of knowledge.\u201d  \n  \u201cWho is a man of knowledge? Is a sorcerer a man of knowledge?\u201d I asked.  \n  \u201cA sorcerer may be, if he\u2019s followed a good rule, the path of knowledge.\u201d  \n  [SHEET 4]  \n  \u201cHow does he follow that path?\u201d  \n  \u201cOne needs to learn the hard way, without haste, but constantly, one has to go as far as possible to unravel the secrets of power and knowledge.\u201d  \n  \u201cCan any of us become a man of knowledge?\u201d  \n  \u201cNot all of us.\u201d  \n  \u201cSo who can?\u201d  \n  \u201cWhoever defies and defeats the four natural enemies. A man of knowledge has to confront his four enemies, then he must fight with them, and finally defeat them. After defeating them, he may call himself a man of knowledge.\u201d  \n  I asked him if all that was necessary was to defeat the four enemies to be a man of knowledge. He said that one could call himself a man of knowledge if one was able to defeat the four enemies, and anybody could do that.  \n  \u201cCan any of us fight the four enemies? Or are there any special requirements?\u201d I asked.  \n  \u201cThere are no requirements, any of us can try to become a man of knowledge, but very few people become one, which is natural. The enemies are formidable\u2026 in truth the four enemies are powerful, and most of us lose.\u201d  \n  \u201cWhat kind of enemies are they, don Juan?\u201d  \n  \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of talking about it? You\u2019re never going to understand. Things get twisted when they\u2019re unintelligible.\u201d  \n  \u201cBut I need to know, don Juan, even though I don\u2019t understand.\u201d  \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll know in due course, that is if you don\u2019t run off in fright. I tell you, it\u2019s not worth talking about these things. What for?\u201d  \n  \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll become a man of knowledge some day?\u201d  \n  [SHEET 5]  \n  \u201cHow am I to know? Nobody can know what will happen on the path.\u201d  \n  \u201cIs there any way of knowing?\u201d  \n  \u201cNo there isn\u2019t. I told you already, everything rests on the battle against the four enemies and whether you defeat them or they defeat you. It\u2019s not something you can know just because.\u201d  \n  \u201cCan you predict it with your powers?\u201d  \n  \u201cNo, because to become a man of knowledge is something that doesn\u2019t last long, I\u2019d say it\u2019s something very fleeting and about so big (he made a gesture of \u2018tiny\u2019 with his fingers).\u201d  \n  \u201cBut how can one be a man of knowledge if that doesn\u2019t last at all?\u201d  \n  \u201cWell, one is never completely a man of knowledge. To become one doesn\u2019t last at all. It isn\u2019t permanent. Truthfully, one never is actually a man of knowledge. What happens is that one has an instant of \u201clight\u201d, of true knowledge, after defeating the four enemies.\u201d  \n  \u201cTell me, don Juan, what kind of enemies are they?\u201d  \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not worth discussing, and we\u2019re not going to discuss it. You always want to talk and talk about everything. Don\u2019t you get tired of it? I don\u2019t have the same need. I don\u2019t like talking.\u201d  \n  I insisted that to my way of thinking, the only way to arrive at understanding was through discussion, but don Juan got serious and stopped talking. I didn\u2019t want to leave him while he was annoyed so I stayed the rest of the day.  \n  2 PM  \n  In the afternoon we got to talking about magic crystals of sorcerers. A topic I hadn\u2019t finished discussing the last time I\u2019d visited. \u201cThere are three ways to see sprits,\u201d said don Juan. \u201cThere are three kinds of spirits. Spirits that don\u2019t give anything, because they have nothing to give, and spirits that are worthwhile, because they do\u2013  \n  [SHEET 6]  \n  Sunday April 15, 1962  \n  We again came back to the conversation about the enemies of men of knowledge, and again our conversation took place at the last minute, just as I was about to leave for home. I asked him who these enemies were. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to tell me, however he explained it in detail.  \n  \u201cWhen you begin to learn,\u201d he said, \u201cyou never know what you\u2019re going to find. The path is never obvious. Your purpose is full of flaws and your intention vague. You\u2019re always confused because you expect things to happen that never will, because you don\u2019t know how difficult knowledge is, you have no idea of the work you have to put in to learn.\u201d  \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s how you learn, little by little at first, then later, more and more, and your expectations come to nothing. You learn things you\u2019d never have wanted to, and that\u2019s when you begin to get afraid. Knowledge is never what one expects, and each step is like walking in a mire, and then, for no reason, you\u2019re up to your neck in fear and it begins to squeeze it, without pity, and you can\u2019t do anything because you\u2019re in the middle of battle. And that\u2019s how you come across the first enemy, the first rival, fear. A terrible enemy, treacherous and complicated, like a burr, it\u2019s always stalking around, hidden, always hidden, in every crack, fear is always just waiting.\u201d \u201cAnd if you\u2019re overcome with terror and flee, the first enemy removes all will.\u201d  \n  \u201cWhat happens if one runs away like that?\u201d  \n  \u201cNothing, just you won\u2019t ever learn, you\u2019ll never become a man of knowledge. You may become a crook, or like any coward full of fear, a (il) man.\u201d  \n  [SHEET 7]  \n  \u201cDefeated, a man whose will has been defeated by fear.\u201d  \n  \u201cCan anything be done to defeat fear?\u201d  \n  \u201cIt can, and it\u2019s very simple. You have to defy fear, and in spite of fear keep learning. You take one step, then another, then another. You should be afraid, but even so continue, never stop, y even less flee. That\u2019s the rule! And then the time comes that the first enemy is left behind, and one begins to feel more sure and calm. Intent becomes stronger, and knowledge is no longer so terrifying. When that moment comes, you could say, like a man, that fear is being conquered and it\u2019s fading little by little, at first, until suddenly it disappears altogether.\u201d  \n  \u201cAnd they you\u2019ll never be afraid again?\u201d I asked.  \n  \u201cNope. Once you\u2019ve overcome fear, you\u2019re free for the rest of your life, because instead of fear, you have clarity. Clarity is what fades the fear. At that point you know what you want and how to get it. You can see all the different possibilities, and a sharp clarity surrounds everything. You know and feel that nothing can be hidden from you again. And then, unexpectedly, you run into the second enemy: clarity. The same clarity that dispelled fear and that\u2019s so hard to achieve also blinds you. It means you never have doubts and are always sure of yourself, that you can do whatever you want to, because you see everything with clarity. And because the clarity makes you bold, you don\u2019t stop at anything. But this clarity is a mistake, it\u2019s like you see a clear but incomplete view.  \n  [SHEET 8]  \n  \u201cIf you believe in the illusion of being able to do whatever you please, you haven\u2019t overcome the second enemy, and you\u2019ve fallen short, can\u2019t learn anymore, and knowledge is going to slip through your fingers. And because you become impatient when you should be generous, or generous when you should be impatient.\u201d \u201cKnowledge falls from your hands and you don\u2019t learn anymore.\u201d  \n  \u201cWhat happens if that enemy defeats you? Do you die?\u201d  \n  \u201cNo, you don\u2019t die, the second enemy has just put its hands on you and stopped you dead. You won\u2019t ever become a man of knowledge, you\u2019ll only be able to be a brave person, full of strength, or a very generous person, very easygoing. But even so, the clarity that you strived so hard for won\u2019t ever abandon you, and you\u2019ll never be afraid of the dark again. You\u2019ll see clearly for the rest of your life, but you won\u2019t want to learn any more, or want for anything.\u201d  \n  \u201cWhat do you have to do to defeat the second enemy?\u201d  \n  \u201cYou have to proceed in the same way as with fear, you have to face the clarity and use it only to see clearly, you have to be patient and weigh up carefully each new venture. More than anything you should consider your clarity to be an error. And then the time comes that you understand that clarity is just like a spot in front of your eyes. That\u2019s how you defeat clarity, and you reach an untouchable position, where nothing can do you harm, and it\u2019s no trick, nor a spot in front of the eyes. It\u2019s power, the next enemy, and you know at this stage that power has been pursuing you, and it\u2019s finally yours, and now you really can do what you want, at this stage you have\u2013  \n  [SHEET 9]  \n  \u2013allies at your command, and your wish is law, you see clearly and impartially everything that occurs, everything around you, but at the same time you come across the third enemy, power. It\u2019s the strongest of the enemies. And naturally it\u2019s the easiest to abandon yourself to. After all, you\u2019re really invincible, if you come across power. So you start off taking risks, calculated risks at first, but you end up making laws and rules because you\u2019re invincible, you\u2019re the master of power, and you don\u2019t even realise that the third enemy is stalking you, and all of a sudden you lose sight of it and the third enemy defeats you and you become fickle and mean.\u201d  \n  \u201cWhen a man has been defeated in this way, does he lose his power?\u201d  \n  \u201cYou never lose power or clarity.\u201d  \n  \u201cSo what\u2019s the difference between a man defeated at this stage and a man of knowledge.\u201d  \n  \u201cSomeone defeated by the third enemy will never know how to handle power, for him, power is like a curse. He has no control over his desires, and he becomes super conceited, and therefore he doesn\u2019t know when to use power or how to best employ it.\u201d  \n  I asked if this defeat is the end of the story.  \n  He didn\u2019t understand and we began to argue until I explained that what I wanted to know is if one could run away and later come back and fight after a defeat.  \n  \u201cWhen one of the enemies gets the upper hand, there\u2019s nothing to be done, and any hopes of becoming a man of knowledge are dashed. You have to resign yourself because there\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d  \n  [SHEET 10]  \n  \u201cIs it possible that after being defeated by power, that it\u2019s just a question of time? That one can recover and defeat it?\u201d  \n  \u201cIf it\u2019s a question of time, then you haven\u2019t been defeated. The battle continues as long as you continue trying to become a man of knowledge. You\u2019re only defeated when you don\u2019t care anymore, when you\u2019ve lost all hope.\u201d  \n  \u201cCan you abandon the fight for years? For example, abandon it through fear, and then come back and defeat fear?\u201d  \n  \u201cNo! That\u2019s not possible. You can\u2019t succumb to fear and then defeat it. Once you have succumbed, there\u2019s nothing else to be done. You can\u2019t learn any more because knowledge is scary and you don\u2019t do anything to learn. But on the other hand, if you strive to learn for years, in spite of fear, in the end you\u2019ll defeat it, because you haven\u2019t given up.\u201d  \n  \u201cAnd how is the third enemy defeated, don Juan?\u201d  \n  \u201cYou have to meet it head one, spur yourself on, give it your all, use all your smarts. You have to understand that the power that you seemed to have defeated was in truth never yours. Without understanding this, you\u2019re lost forever in the cracks of yourself. But if you use power in moderation, you begin to realise that there\u2019s only one way forward, to keep faithfully and respectfully to what you have learned on the path of knowledge. Only in this way can you see with clarity, and power without an understanding of what one really is, is a (il) worthless cause. If you realise that there are ways to keep patient, and in moderation, you arrive a stage in which everything, absolutely everything, is under control. At that point you know when and how to use power. And that\u2019s how you defeat the third enemy, but at that point you\u2019re at the end of your undertaking on the path of knowledge. And with no warning, you run into the last of the enemies.  \n  [SHEET 11]  \n  \u201cOld age, the cruelest of all, the enemy who\u2019ll never be defeated. The enemy that can only be kept away for a few moments. At that point there\u2019s no longer the fear that makes everything dark, or the clarity that causes impatience. By this time all one\u2019s powers are under control. But, on the other hand, there\u2019s an invincible desire to rest, and if you don\u2019t fight this adversary and the desire to (flee?) (il), if you retire into old age you lose the last (battle?) (il), and the fourth enemy turns you into a useless creature. The desire to rest and forget will dominate clarity, power and knowledge. Put if you can remain free of fatigue and live as fate determines, until your last breath, you can then call yourself a man of knowledge. Even though it\u2019s just for a few moments, when the fourth enemy has fled, the invincible enemy, those moments of clarity, power and knowledge are enough.\u201d  \n  Don Juan rested against the post of the lean-to and looked towards the hills of Bacatete in the distance.  \n  A strange melancholy took hold of me and I said, just to say something, \u201cyou can\u2019t escape old age.\u201d  \n  \u201cNo, you see? It\u2019s thrown me to the ground,\u201d said don Juan, \u201cand it\u2019s chasing me around, it gets the upper hand a lot.\u201d  \n  His voice was emphatic and serious, his manner simple but at the same time histrionic, drama wrapped in his sombre tone. A tone that made me wonder at the moment that don Juan, who seemed an immortal figure, young and eternal, was just pretending to be old.  \n  \u201cYou\u2019re a man of knowledge, don Juan,\u201d I said with sincere admiration.  \n  [SHEET 12]  \n  He looked at me with a semi-serious expression and then laughed.  \n  \"You\u2019re full of it!\u201d he said.  \n  He didn\u2019t seem sad or tired or be anything other than the don Juan that I know. However, there was something about him that had made me understand, for the first time, the intensity with which he was fighting against the final enemy, the invincible enemy.  \n    \n  END OF TRANSCRIPT  \n  II.

Observations of transcriber  \nA.\t  Many words in the source documents are almost illegible. These words are denoted with (il).  \nB.\t  Handwriting nowadays is almost in disuse, but it was used at the time of this account.  \nC.\t  It\u2019s clear the notes were written quickly, which lends them an air of field notes.  \nD.\t  Many words can almost not be understood, firstly as the ink has faded over time, and secondly because it seems that whoever wrote them was writing for their own comprehension.  \nE.\t  The words pendejo, se pela, a lo macho, a toda madre, chingada, a madres engre\u00eddo, sopet\u00f3n and others are used on occasion in Mexico between friends and accord with the meaning don Juan gives them. Some of these words can be used to offend, but in either case they\u2019re not very common.  \nF.\t  These notes are for the book The Teachings of don Juan, however the notes contain some information that does not appear in the final text of the published book.  \nG.\t  In the same way it can be seen that some parts of the text from the book, compared to the notes, show slight changes as Castaneda polished according to his own criteria some of don Juan\u2019s statements. There are only a few cases of this, and the text remains very similar to the original notes.

You already have me, my time\u2013 you won\u2019t be able to say where you met me, nor where you saw me, nor where you found me, nor what my name is. That\u2019s\u2026 the rule regarding sorcerers. That\u2019s the rule when one wants\u2026 to know [BECOME A MAN OF KNOWLEDGE], if one\u2019s considerate.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhy is the rule like that, don Juan?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cIt\u2019s what the sorcerers decided. You don\u2019t tell about a sorcerer, his ways or his death, and you should never use those secrets against him. I\u2019m telling you now. Don\u2019t ever tell where you met me, when I die, so nobody may find out where my body is buried.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cI told him that there were many people who knew where \u2013&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 2]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u2013we\u2019d met.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d he said assuredly.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat about Fernando and don Nacho?\u201d I asked.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cThey\u2019re idiots, they don\u2019t even know where they are.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cAnd your daughter-in-law, don Juan?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cShe doesn\u2019t count. She\u2019s another idiot. But, there are other people who do count.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWho, for example?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201dYou\u2019ll know who when they ask you some day, when they ask you where my body is buried.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWho\u2019s going to ask me?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou\u2019ll see. The life of a sorcerer is very strange and things happen without going in search for them or even wanting them.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  I asked him again why I should keep it secret.&lt;br/&gt;\n  He said that when I learned more I\u2019d realise that there were certain things that could not be said, personal things that belong only to ourselves. \u201cWhen one is on the path of knowledge,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to tell anyone what one\u2019s up to.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d I promised don Juan.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYes, you will. You\u2019ve got a big mouth.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat can I do to avoid it?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNothing.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  I wanted to assure don Juan that I didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of giving away his secrets, and how would I be able to reveal then if I didn\u2019t even have the opportunity to do so.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou will do, and you will tell,\u201d he said with a friendly smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll say even if you don\u2019t want to. But it\u2019s not worth speaking about this.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cSo it\u2019s bad to bring up these things, don Juan?&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cOf course, especially for you. You won\u2019t lack for people who want\u2013&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 3]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u2013to take your power. They\u2019ll take it because speaking scares it away. Speaking robs you of power.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want power?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat are you learning for if you don\u2019t want power?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cJust to know.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying, but you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll understand when you realise. When you know more, you\u2019ll use power one way or another.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  I told him that I just wanted to know, and that I wasn\u2019t really interested in living the life of a sorcerer.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cA man of knowledge has to use his power,\u201d he said. \u201cOr why would you want to know? What are you going to do if you get into a fix and you have to use sorcery? You don\u2019t know how it helps. Once you start, there\u2019s no way to stop.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou mean you can never leave the life of sorcery behind?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNope. Unless you learn a lot, but to learn a lot you have to use the power of sorcery. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d \u201cA man of knowledge has to act sooner or later, you can\u2019t get by just by thinking. A man of knowledge has the power and know-how to do whatever he wants. You\u2019ll see there\u2019s no way to stop once you start on the path of knowledge. I\u2019m telling you. You can\u2019t stop or change tracks.\u201d \u201cA man of knowledge always becomes more mysterious than hell.\u201d \u201cNobody will be able to stop you if you become a man of knowledge.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWho is a man of knowledge? Is a sorcerer a man of knowledge?\u201d I asked.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cA sorcerer may be, if he\u2019s followed a good rule, the path of knowledge.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 4]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cHow does he follow that path?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cOne needs to learn the hard way, without haste, but constantly, one has to go as far as possible to unravel the secrets of power and knowledge.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cCan any of us become a man of knowledge?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNot all of us.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cSo who can?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhoever defies and defeats the four natural enemies. A man of knowledge has to confront his four enemies, then he must fight with them, and finally defeat them. After defeating them, he may call himself a man of knowledge.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  I asked him if all that was necessary was to defeat the four enemies to be a man of knowledge. He said that one could call himself a man of knowledge if one was able to defeat the four enemies, and anybody could do that.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cCan any of us fight the four enemies? Or are there any special requirements?\u201d I asked.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cThere are no requirements, any of us can try to become a man of knowledge, but very few people become one, which is natural. The enemies are formidable\u2026 in truth the four enemies are powerful, and most of us lose.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat kind of enemies are they, don Juan?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of talking about it? You\u2019re never going to understand. Things get twisted when they\u2019re unintelligible.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cBut I need to know, don Juan, even though I don\u2019t understand.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou\u2019ll know in due course, that is if you don\u2019t run off in fright. I tell you, it\u2019s not worth talking about these things. What for?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll become a man of knowledge some day?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 5]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cHow am I to know? Nobody can know what will happen on the path.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cIs there any way of knowing?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNo there isn\u2019t. I told you already, everything rests on the battle against the four enemies and whether you defeat them or they defeat you. It\u2019s not something you can know just because.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cCan you predict it with your powers?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNo, because to become a man of knowledge is something that doesn\u2019t last long, I\u2019d say it\u2019s something very fleeting and about so big (he made a gesture of \u2018tiny\u2019 with his fingers).\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cBut how can one be a man of knowledge if that doesn\u2019t last at all?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWell, one is never completely a man of knowledge. To become one doesn\u2019t last at all. It isn\u2019t permanent. Truthfully, one never is actually a man of knowledge. What happens is that one has an instant of \u201clight\u201d, of true knowledge, after defeating the four enemies.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cTell me, don Juan, what kind of enemies are they?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cIt\u2019s not worth discussing, and we\u2019re not going to discuss it. You always want to talk and talk about everything. Don\u2019t you get tired of it? I don\u2019t have the same need. I don\u2019t like talking.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  I insisted that to my way of thinking, the only way to arrive at understanding was through discussion, but don Juan got serious and stopped talking. I didn\u2019t want to leave him while he was annoyed so I stayed the rest of the day.&lt;br/&gt;\n  2 PM&lt;br/&gt;\n  In the afternoon we got to talking about magic crystals of sorcerers. A topic I hadn\u2019t finished discussing the last time I\u2019d visited. \u201cThere are three ways to see sprits,\u201d said don Juan. \u201cThere are three kinds of spirits. Spirits that don\u2019t give anything, because they have nothing to give, and spirits that are worthwhile, because they do\u2013&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 6]&lt;br/&gt;\n  Sunday April 15, 1962&lt;br/&gt;\n  We again came back to the conversation about the enemies of men of knowledge, and again our conversation took place at the last minute, just as I was about to leave for home. I asked him who these enemies were. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to tell me, however he explained it in detail.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhen you begin to learn,\u201d he said, \u201cyou never know what you\u2019re going to find. The path is never obvious. Your purpose is full of flaws and your intention vague. You\u2019re always confused because you expect things to happen that never will, because you don\u2019t know how difficult knowledge is, you have no idea of the work you have to put in to learn.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cBut that\u2019s how you learn, little by little at first, then later, more and more, and your expectations come to nothing. You learn things you\u2019d never have wanted to, and that\u2019s when you begin to get afraid. Knowledge is never what one expects, and each step is like walking in a mire, and then, for no reason, you\u2019re up to your neck in fear and it begins to squeeze it, without pity, and you can\u2019t do anything because you\u2019re in the middle of battle. And that\u2019s how you come across the first enemy, the first rival, fear. A terrible enemy, treacherous and complicated, like a burr, it\u2019s always stalking around, hidden, always hidden, in every crack, fear is always just waiting.\u201d \u201cAnd if you\u2019re overcome with terror and flee, the first enemy removes all will.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat happens if one runs away like that?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNothing, just you won\u2019t ever learn, you\u2019ll never become a man of knowledge. You may become a crook, or like any coward full of fear, a (il) man.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 7]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cDefeated, a man whose will has been defeated by fear.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cCan anything be done to defeat fear?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cIt can, and it\u2019s very simple. You have to defy fear, and in spite of fear keep learning. You take one step, then another, then another. You should be afraid, but even so continue, never stop, y even less flee. That\u2019s the rule! And then the time comes that the first enemy is left behind, and one begins to feel more sure and calm. Intent becomes stronger, and knowledge is no longer so terrifying. When that moment comes, you could say, like a man, that fear is being conquered and it\u2019s fading little by little, at first, until suddenly it disappears altogether.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cAnd they you\u2019ll never be afraid again?\u201d I asked.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNope. Once you\u2019ve overcome fear, you\u2019re free for the rest of your life, because instead of fear, you have clarity. Clarity is what fades the fear. At that point you know what you want and how to get it. You can see all the different possibilities, and a sharp clarity surrounds everything. You know and feel that nothing can be hidden from you again. And then, unexpectedly, you run into the second enemy: clarity. The same clarity that dispelled fear and that\u2019s so hard to achieve also blinds you. It means you never have doubts and are always sure of yourself, that you can do whatever you want to, because you see everything with clarity. And because the clarity makes you bold, you don\u2019t stop at anything. But this clarity is a mistake, it\u2019s like you see a clear but incomplete view.&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 8]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cIf you believe in the illusion of being able to do whatever you please, you haven\u2019t overcome the second enemy, and you\u2019ve fallen short, can\u2019t learn anymore, and knowledge is going to slip through your fingers. And because you become impatient when you should be generous, or generous when you should be impatient.\u201d \u201cKnowledge falls from your hands and you don\u2019t learn anymore.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat happens if that enemy defeats you? Do you die?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNo, you don\u2019t die, the second enemy has just put its hands on you and stopped you dead. You won\u2019t ever become a man of knowledge, you\u2019ll only be able to be a brave person, full of strength, or a very generous person, very easygoing. But even so, the clarity that you strived so hard for won\u2019t ever abandon you, and you\u2019ll never be afraid of the dark again. You\u2019ll see clearly for the rest of your life, but you won\u2019t want to learn any more, or want for anything.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhat do you have to do to defeat the second enemy?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou have to proceed in the same way as with fear, you have to face the clarity and use it only to see clearly, you have to be patient and weigh up carefully each new venture. More than anything you should consider your clarity to be an error. And then the time comes that you understand that clarity is just like a spot in front of your eyes. That\u2019s how you defeat clarity, and you reach an untouchable position, where nothing can do you harm, and it\u2019s no trick, nor a spot in front of the eyes. It\u2019s power, the next enemy, and you know at this stage that power has been pursuing you, and it\u2019s finally yours, and now you really can do what you want, at this stage you have\u2013&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 9]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u2013allies at your command, and your wish is law, you see clearly and impartially everything that occurs, everything around you, but at the same time you come across the third enemy, power. It\u2019s the strongest of the enemies. And naturally it\u2019s the easiest to abandon yourself to. After all, you\u2019re really invincible, if you come across power. So you start off taking risks, calculated risks at first, but you end up making laws and rules because you\u2019re invincible, you\u2019re the master of power, and you don\u2019t even realise that the third enemy is stalking you, and all of a sudden you lose sight of it and the third enemy defeats you and you become fickle and mean.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhen a man has been defeated in this way, does he lose his power?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou never lose power or clarity.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cSo what\u2019s the difference between a man defeated at this stage and a man of knowledge.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cSomeone defeated by the third enemy will never know how to handle power, for him, power is like a curse. He has no control over his desires, and he becomes super conceited, and therefore he doesn\u2019t know when to use power or how to best employ it.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  I asked if this defeat is the end of the story.&lt;br/&gt;\n  He didn\u2019t understand and we began to argue until I explained that what I wanted to know is if one could run away and later come back and fight after a defeat.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cWhen one of the enemies gets the upper hand, there\u2019s nothing to be done, and any hopes of becoming a man of knowledge are dashed. You have to resign yourself because there\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 10]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cIs it possible that after being defeated by power, that it\u2019s just a question of time? That one can recover and defeat it?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cIf it\u2019s a question of time, then you haven\u2019t been defeated. The battle continues as long as you continue trying to become a man of knowledge. You\u2019re only defeated when you don\u2019t care anymore, when you\u2019ve lost all hope.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cCan you abandon the fight for years? For example, abandon it through fear, and then come back and defeat fear?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNo! That\u2019s not possible. You can\u2019t succumb to fear and then defeat it. Once you have succumbed, there\u2019s nothing else to be done. You can\u2019t learn any more because knowledge is scary and you don\u2019t do anything to learn. But on the other hand, if you strive to learn for years, in spite of fear, in the end you\u2019ll defeat it, because you haven\u2019t given up.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cAnd how is the third enemy defeated, don Juan?\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou have to meet it head one, spur yourself on, give it your all, use all your smarts. You have to understand that the power that you seemed to have defeated was in truth never yours. Without understanding this, you\u2019re lost forever in the cracks of yourself. But if you use power in moderation, you begin to realise that there\u2019s only one way forward, to keep faithfully and respectfully to what you have learned on the path of knowledge. Only in this way can you see with clarity, and power without an understanding of what one really is, is a (il) worthless cause. If you realise that there are ways to keep patient, and in moderation, you arrive a stage in which everything, absolutely everything, is under control. At that point you know when and how to use power. And that\u2019s how you defeat the third enemy, but at that point you\u2019re at the end of your undertaking on the path of knowledge. And with no warning, you run into the last of the enemies.&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 11]&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cOld age, the cruelest of all, the enemy who\u2019ll never be defeated. The enemy that can only be kept away for a few moments. At that point there\u2019s no longer the fear that makes everything dark, or the clarity that causes impatience. By this time all one\u2019s powers are under control. But, on the other hand, there\u2019s an invincible desire to rest, and if you don\u2019t fight this adversary and the desire to (flee?) (il), if you retire into old age you lose the last (battle?) (il), and the fourth enemy turns you into a useless creature. The desire to rest and forget will dominate clarity, power and knowledge. Put if you can remain free of fatigue and live as fate determines, until your last breath, you can then call yourself a man of knowledge. Even though it\u2019s just for a few moments, when the fourth enemy has fled, the invincible enemy, those moments of clarity, power and knowledge are enough.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  Don Juan rested against the post of the lean-to and looked towards the hills of Bacatete in the distance.&lt;br/&gt;\n  A strange melancholy took hold of me and I said, just to say something, \u201cyou can\u2019t escape old age.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cNo, you see? It\u2019s thrown me to the ground,\u201d said don Juan, \u201cand it\u2019s chasing me around, it gets the upper hand a lot.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n  His voice was emphatic and serious, his manner simple but at the same time histrionic, drama wrapped in his sombre tone. A tone that made me wonder at the moment that don Juan, who seemed an immortal figure, young and eternal, was just pretending to be old.&lt;br/&gt;\n  \u201cYou\u2019re a man of knowledge, don Juan,\u201d I said with sincere admiration.&lt;br/&gt;\n  [SHEET 12]&lt;br/&gt;\n  He looked at me with a semi-serious expression and then laughed.&lt;br/&gt;\n  &amp;quot;You\u2019re full of it!\u201d he said.&lt;br/&gt;\n  He didn\u2019t seem sad or tired or be anything other than the don Juan that I know. However, there was something about him that had made me understand, for the first time, the intensity with which he was fighting against the final enemy, the invincible enemy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;END OF TRANSCRIPT&lt;br/&gt;\n  II. Source documents on which the transcription was based.&lt;br/&gt;\n  Sheet #1 Sheet #2 Sheet #3 Sheet #4&lt;br/&gt;\n  Sheet #5 Sheet #6 Sheet #7 Sheet #8&lt;br/&gt;\n  Sheet #9 Sheet #10 Sheet #11 Sheet #12&lt;br/&gt;\n  [the links to these notes have expired]  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;III. Observations of transcriber&lt;br/&gt;\nA.    Many words in the source documents are almost illegible. These words are denoted with (il).&lt;br/&gt;\nB.    Handwriting nowadays is almost in disuse, but it was used at the time of this account.&lt;br/&gt;\nC.    It\u2019s clear the notes were written quickly, which lends them an air of field notes.&lt;br/&gt;\nD.    Many words can almost not be understood, firstly as the ink has faded over time, and secondly because it seems that whoever wrote them was writing for their own comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;\nE.    The words pendejo, se pela, a lo macho, a toda madre, chingada, a madres engre\u00eddo, sopet\u00f3n and others are used on occasion in Mexico between friends and accord with the meaning don Juan gives them. Some of these words can be used to offend, but in either case they\u2019re not very common.&lt;br/&gt;\nF.    These notes are for the book The Teachings of don Juan, however the notes contain some information that does not appear in the final text of the published book.&lt;br/&gt;\nG.    In the same way it can be seen that some parts of the text from the book, compared to the notes, show slight changes as Castaneda polished according to his own criteria some of don Juan\u2019s statements. There are only a few cases of this, and the text remains very similar to the original notes. But this detail makes us believe that these notes were the original document, and were used in the publication.&lt;br/&gt;\nH.    These notes contain valuable additional information for anyone interested in investigating this legacy.&lt;br/&gt;\nI.    I can assure that the transcription is 99 percent accurate to the notes. The remaining one percent is due to the words that were simply unreadable and marked (il). In some of those cases a possible word was proposed in line with the thread of the conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transcriber: owe mail: &lt;a href=\"mailto:owemx@yahoo.com.mx\"&gt;owemx@yahoo.com.mx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n  A voluntary collaboration from the transcriber to the page \u201cCarlos Castaneda and Shamanism\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "glj8li", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CruzWayne", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/glj8li/1962_field_notes_english/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/glj8li/1962_field_notes_english/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1589735899.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqydwj0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1589747016.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_glj8li", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Thanks!

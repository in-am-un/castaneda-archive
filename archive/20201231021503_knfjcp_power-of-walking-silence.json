I lyied to bed with feet together like rhombus and hands on a place 2 inches lower of the belly button. Than like came up from my self. \nThank everyone for support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/knfjcp/power_of_walking_silence/ghn71vq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1609450220.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_knfjcp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ghkhz2x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Fit_Kangaroo_8020", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1609383926.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_knfjcp", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4z70r7vw", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Thank you for your answer that's a very helpful, there were some experience to share of dreaming.

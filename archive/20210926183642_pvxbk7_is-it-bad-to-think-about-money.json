The &amp;quot;company&amp;quot; behind it, just generates them, using economic activity to limit how many get made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can&amp;#39;t just go crazy and print themselves money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;proof of work&amp;quot; generated coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that specific case, coins are only generated when someone uses the credit card for a real purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you get the coins they generated, and they get the usual 4% mastercard charge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But speculators will buy any new coins. So the worthless coins are not worthless right now.  And you can &amp;quot;unload&amp;quot; them for ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The coins they give you are worth 6% of the purchase at minimum, to become  your &amp;quot;cash back&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How you get free food at times, I don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or why anyone would pay $2400 for a chicken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;racing chickens&amp;quot;.  Will be used later at a virtual track where bets are placed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line:  Multiple new companies are &amp;quot;printing money&amp;quot;, and it actually has value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just figure out how they limit the printing of that money, and join in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;#39;s like being a day trader.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pvxbk7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pvxbk7/is_it_bad_to_think_about_money/hedxvmt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1632686253.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1632686253.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hedvuj0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SilenceisGolden29", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1632685441.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hed6448", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3b1g8h4y", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "What\u2019s the digital coin credit card, you get rewards when you buy food he\u2019ll yea", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hedvuj0", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s the digital coin credit card, you get rewards when you buy food he\u2019ll yea&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pvxbk7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pvxbk7/is_it_bad_to_think_about_money/hedvuj0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1632685441.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hed6448", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1632675187.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_pvxbk7", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Of course I'd still be on this path.

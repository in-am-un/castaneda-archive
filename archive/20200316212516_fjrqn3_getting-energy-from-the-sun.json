As a result, I realized I\u2019ve misunderstood it all along.\n\nFirst, the apprentices did a lot of waking dreaming.\n\nWhen we read that this technique gives you the energy for dreaming, it's natural to think of finding your hands more easily, or being able to get back into the dream you woke up in, or being able to hold it longer.\n\nThat kind of \"Gates of Dreaming\" thing.\n\nAnd so, if you get a little sunlight glitter into your eyes, as far as \u201clucid dreaming\u201d goes, you won't see JACK SHIT for results.\n\nSorry to curse Jack like that.\n\nBut anyone serious whose in here, has done some eyelash glitter and found the results to be dubious.\n\nDon't anyone tell me about the time you tried it, and it worked, unless you want to point out what made other times work, when you hadn't done the eyelash thing.\n\nPeople get so superstitious about how to \"get lucky\", that they were even drinking Carlos' brand of sports drink, just in case.\n\nI even had my eye on his \u201cNew Balance\u201d shoes. Always brand new, and spotless.\n\nBut let\u2019s not count meager results as success. It has to be very clear or we can\u2019t recommend improvements in practices, to help others.\n\nIf you tell someone to try something, and it doesn\u2019t actually work, you\u2019ve just hurt them.\n\nNot helped them.\n\nPhony Naguals, are you listening?\n\nIf we\u2019re honest and work together, over time we might come up with foolproof ways to speed up the process of learning.\n\nBut only if we insist on real results. Not pretend ones.\n\nFor example, how about that poptart you had before bed, and then found your hands?\n\nAre poptarts a path to sorcery?\n\nFor lucid dreaming, the eyelash trick produces pathetic results.  That's all.\n\nI've even heard this technique being used in an argument to \"debunk\" Carlos. It went something like, he\u2019s just writing esoteric porn, so he has to make up as many puzzling techniques as possible to sell new books\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. This technique works well. I don\u2019t know how many times you can use it, but certainly once or twice, learning something new each time.\n\nBack to what\u2019s meant by La Gorda\u2019s statement,  \u201cdreaming takes too much power\u201d.\n\nDidn\u2019t she pee in her hands, grab some red glowing lines, and leap into the air?\n\nShe must have practiced that over and over.\n\nThat\u2019s waking dreaming.\n\nDidn\u2019t the apprentices run around the room in a circle, until they were literally walking on the walls?\n\nThey said they\u2019d practiced that in the past, but it was never as powerful as when Carlos was around.\n\nThat was dreaming awake.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s more examples, but the point is, for waking dreaming, this technique has profound results.\n\nYesterday was overcast. The sun barely came out. I went walking around my business park, doing \u201cdust gazing\u201d. I wanted to see if I could materialize a hypnogogic head on a purple cloud again, in full sunlight.\n\nThe sun finally came out, I remembered this post, so I did this technique.\n\nAt first I didn\u2019t properly close my eyes, and the bright sun hurt them.\n\nI remembered getting up to drive Cholita to a train at 7AM, and being really annoyed with the sun shining in my eyes.\n\nCholita insisted it was not ok to use the sunshade. I had to obey, or she might have torn it off and tossed it out the window.\n\nI had to take it in the eyes like a macho.\n\nRemembering that, I realized that even if you\u2019re driving around in your car, once in a while the sun is in the perfect position to charge up a bit!\n\nSo I did that during the rest of the day,  driving around from store to store trying to find some Gatorade and double espresso shots.\n\nDreaming aids.\n\nThe virus has all store shelves in the area empty of the most popular drinkable things.\n\nAround 2AM that night, I woke up. I was feeling a bit hungover.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to get up and go do Tensegrity. Tensegrity is evolving to be the fastest way for me to move my assemblage point. It produces dazzling displays of light and color, which are as mesmerizing to watch as an inorganic being.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t want to have to walk. So I remained on the bed, gazing around the room until I saw Cholita\u2019s purple dreaming mist.\n\nI figured I could manage to move my assemblage point just using what I had in front of me. Once I was in heightened awareness, I wouldn't be tired anymore.\n\nI wiggled my fingers the way Zuleica taught Carlos. I waved my hands a bit, to test my level of silence.\n\nEnough silence to see bright colors would also mean you can see \u201cdark waves\u201d, when you wave your hand.\n\nThey were present, though faint.\n\nKeep that in mind. If you think you\u2019re silent, but don\u2019t see odd things like \u201cdark waves\u201d, you are not.\n\nIf you say something like, \"Yea, I can be silent for 2 hours.\"\n\nYou cannot.  No one who can be silent for 2 hours, is calm about it.\n\nThat's like casually saying, \"Yea, I have a 100 carat perfect emerald in my desk drawer.\"\n\nNo, you don't!\n\nDark waves are a real \u201cthing\u201d, not a position of the assemblage point. I suppose it\u2019s our eyes ability to detect motion, which is more sensitive than our ability to produce discernible images.\n\nProbably it's a protection mechanism, for when we crawl into a dark cave and can't actually see. But we can detect motion.\n\nIt might even be from IR light, just below the visible level.  Maybe the eyes can't process that into usable dots of light, but when you wave your hand, it's enough information to produce the sight of dark waves moving through the air.\n\nIt could even be sonar.  Who knows.  But it's real.\n\nWe can see them in perfect darkness, not because of sorcery or the second attention, but because we\u2019re silent enough to have super senses.\n\nIn good silence, you get super hearing, super smell, and super sight.  You stop confusing yourself with endless self-pity, and finally pay attention to what's happening right now.\n\nNot that those \"super senses\" aren't particularly useful.\n\nBut they are a gauge you can use.\n\nI had good silence, so I just sat still looking for colors that could move my assemblage point.\n\nI started to fall to sleep, so I did \u201cmashing energy\u201d, \u201crunning man\u201d style.\n\nIn other words, I just wiggled my feet.\n\nA patch of color right in front of me brightened up.  It was as if someone had used a fog machine to fill the room with a light fog, and had shined a purple light on it.  When the colors brightened up for me, it was as if they had decided to point the fog machine directly towards me.\n\nIf anyone doubts the lamest of the Tensegrity moves can redeploy energy, you simply haven't learned to be silent.\n\nI got a redeployment just by wiggling my feet.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I saw \u201cthem\u201d.\n\nThey were intensely bright little collections of dots. Red, blue, white, yellow.\n\nFour or five dots to a set, but they were close enough together that they weren\u2019t like \u201clittle galaxies\u201d.\n\nThose can be found hovering overhead, and are associated with low energy inorganic beings.  My reddit logo is like those, and there's a post about the Pandiculations of Zoltar which explains those.\n\nThese were tiny puffs of brightly colored dots.  Very tightly connected within an individual puff.\n\nThere were 4 sets of them, spaced around 2 feet apart, floating to my upper left.\n\nAt the time I didn\u2019t connect them to sunlight wiggles, but I\u2019ll just point out what I should have realized then.\n\nAt the time, I was silent enough to be \u201cinnocent\u201d.  So the obvious didn't occur to me.\n\nIn that state, you can\u2019t be thinking about book deals, or how you\u2019ll explain what you\u2019ve just done to your friends.\n\nThat\u2019s poison for the second attention!\n\nI hope you guys know now, I'm not joking when I say, \"The book deal mind\" is worse than \"the flier's mind\".\n\nAs I realized later on, the little collections of bright dots were floating at the level I\u2019d been watching, when I was gathering sunlight by looking through my eyelashes.\n\nThey were to the left, because I\u2019d only been using my left eye to do that.\n\nIt was as if the sparkle had left a mark I could pick up in darkness.  A burned in afterimage, like the Fire Kasina folks use.\n\nTheir intensity was in fact, \u201csparkle\u201d in it\u2019s most raw form. They were the \u201cessence of sparkle\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t overlook gifts when gazing in darkness, so I immediately focused on the top left one, of the 4 sets offered to me.\n\nI forced my silence deeper as I gazed at it.\n\nIt sucked me in!\n\nI almost pulled off a Josefina, and fully zipped into the lights.\n\nBut I held back, remained on the bed, and all I felt was the rapid movement of my assemblage point into nearly full heightened awareness.\n\nIn two seconds.\n\nUsually that takes 2 hours.\n\nThe after affects were like a codeine tablet kicking in.  An endorphin  overload.\n\nBliss,  Samadhi.\n\nMy breathing slowed to almost nothing, with only my stomaching moving.\n\nI was startled and backed off.\n\nAs don Juan said, \"up from your feet!\". I'd been up.  Now I went back down, to figure out what just happened.\n\nI realized, when I backed off  I had been inside a door.\n\nI had zipped into a waking dreaming doorway, then back out.\n\nI looked back to the 4 sets, and each one was like a door or window, floating in space above me.  Just watching them there produced a secondary view of dreaming.\n\nI was in  two places at once.  The lights had split me.\n\nThey were all vividly bright, and sparkling in multiple primary colors.\n\nBut they were composed only of tiny dots.\n\nDespite their brightness, they were subtle.  Just peacefully floating up there.\n\nThe images of doors and windows was a result of my second attention interpreting the dots, as being vertices on a surface.\n\nI gazed into the second one and was again rapidly moved towards heightened awareness.\n\nHere was a second attention manifestation, which needed the second attention to explain it.\n\nWatching the rest, I was pulled too fast and ended up halfway into abstract dreaming.\n\nI vaguely remember finishing the set of 4.\n\nI turned on the TV to watch Magnum PI reruns and think about how well that sunlight gathering technique works.\n\nEdited once", "edited": 1584472923.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fkrapv6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried that sunlight gathering yesterday.

Red, blue, white, yellow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four or five dots to a set, but they were close enough together that they weren\u2019t like \u201clittle galaxies\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those can be found hovering overhead, and are associated with low energy inorganic beings.  My reddit logo is like those, and there&amp;#39;s a post about the Pandiculations of Zoltar which explains those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These were tiny puffs of brightly colored dots.  Very tightly connected within an individual puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were 4 sets of them, spaced around 2 feet apart, floating to my upper left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time I didn\u2019t connect them to sunlight wiggles, but I\u2019ll just point out what I should have realized then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was silent enough to be \u201cinnocent\u201d.  So the obvious didn&amp;#39;t occur to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that state, you can\u2019t be thinking about book deals, or how you\u2019ll explain what you\u2019ve just done to your friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s poison for the second attention!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you guys know now, I&amp;#39;m not joking when I say, &amp;quot;The book deal mind&amp;quot; is worse than &amp;quot;the flier&amp;#39;s mind&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I realized later on, the little collections of bright dots were floating at the level I\u2019d been watching, when I was gathering sunlight by looking through my eyelashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were to the left, because I\u2019d only been using my left eye to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was as if the sparkle had left a mark I could pick up in darkness.  A burned in afterimage, like the Fire Kasina folks use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their intensity was in fact, \u201csparkle\u201d in it\u2019s most raw form. They were the \u201cessence of sparkle\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t overlook gifts when gazing in darkness, so I immediately focused on the top left one, of the 4 sets offered to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced my silence deeper as I gazed at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sucked me in!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I almost pulled off a Josefina, and fully zipped into the lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I held back, remained on the bed, and all I felt was the rapid movement of my assemblage point into nearly full heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually that takes 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The after affects were like a codeine tablet kicking in.  An endorphin  overload.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bliss,  Samadhi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My breathing slowed to almost nothing, with only my stomaching moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was startled and backed off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan said, &amp;quot;up from your feet!&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;d been up.  Now I went back down, to figure out what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, when I backed off  I had been inside a door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had zipped into a waking dreaming doorway, then back out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back to the 4 sets, and each one was like a door or window, floating in space above me.  Just watching them there produced a secondary view of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in  two places at once.  The lights had split me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were all vividly bright, and sparkling in multiple primary colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they were composed only of tiny dots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite their brightness, they were subtle.  Just peacefully floating up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The images of doors and windows was a result of my second attention interpreting the dots, as being vertices on a surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed into the second one and was again rapidly moved towards heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here was a second attention manifestation, which needed the second attention to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching the rest, I was pulled too fast and ended up halfway into abstract dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I vaguely remember finishing the set of 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned on the TV to watch Magnum PI reruns and think about how well that sunlight gathering technique works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited once&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fjrqn3/getting_energy_from_the_sun/fkrapv6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1584465131.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_fjrqn3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_fjrqn3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fkoqao0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_fjrqn3", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "\"Clara instructed me to face the sun with my eyes closed, and then take a deep breath through my mouth, and pull the sun's warmth and light into my stomach.\nI was to hold it there for as long as I could, then swallow, and finally, exhale any air that was left.\n\"Pretend you're a sunflower,\" she teased. \"Always keep your face toward the sun when you breathe.

So, while I wanted the 2 second assemblage point movement, instead I got what comes next.\n\nWhat happens to you guys will surely be different, but I think it's still valuable to relate how fun things can get, after you put in the hard work.\n\nBut let me warn you.  If you're afraid of mice, try something different than I did last night.\n\nDuring the day, I probably only did a total of 10 minutes of catching sunlight on my eyelashes.\n\nLikely doing it for long periods, the way La Gorda and the apprentices seem to have done, would produce even more results.\n\nBut I just caught some while walking, or driving.\n\nAnd this technique might actually help those starting out, to look for colors in the darkness.\n\nBut be warned, blobs are not the same as lines. If you do sunlight flicker gazing, you'll be propelled to notice the lines, equally to the blobs.\n\nThat should mean, you can assemble a new world faster than I learned to do that.\n\nI can see a day when practitioners can share virtual worlds, discovered with a specific move.\n\nSomeone will select their favorite Tensegrity move, use it to move their assemblage point in darkness, and the lines mixed in with the colors will spread to the walls and floor.\n\nSomewhere along the line, they'll find they're no longer doing the tensegrity in their room.\n\nThey're in a new world.\n\nHey!  I\u2019ve done it many times.\n\nDon\u2019t doubt it. The tricky part is whether you can participate in that world, instead of just view it.\n\nHow to get from there, namely seeing it only for yourself, to the causality defying practice of sharing it with others?\n\nTensegrity Facilitators.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to give those guys a Marshall\u2019s badge one day.\n\nWe might end up needing a rescue squad.\n\nEven Miles seems to have needed rescuing by Taisha, when he walked past the power spot beam in Carlos\u2019 compound.\n\nSo get to work facilitators, and stop confusing yourself with other stuff.\n\nIf you want to be a fortune teller, healer, paranoid politics fan, that's fine. You can flip hamburgers for all I care.\n\nBut keep the junk out of the sorcery.\n\nIt mostly weakens it.\n\nCholita might disagree with that, but she's not going to be helping anyone besides herself, anytime soon.\n\nLast night I went to bed very early. I wanted to be sure I woke at 2AM, so I could use up the sunlight I'd stored with my eyes.\n\nSomewhere around 1AM (no way to tell because I cover the LED digital clock too), I heard someone coughing.\n\nOr laughing. Or crying.\n\nI had no idea which it was, because it was too quiet to hear clearly.\n\nI sat up in bed, to listen closely in case Cholita was in trouble.\n\nThe laughing got louder and louder, until it made my skin crawl a little.\n\nMy assemblage point shifted, and the vague purple fog I now see in any darkness, split into fine lines.\n\nLike the sparkle on my eyelashes.\n\nThe laughing continued, and started to move around the house.  It was very loud!\n\nI couldn\u2019t hear Cholita walking around. There was no sound of creaking wooden floor boards.\n\nBut the laughter came from different parts of the house, continuously moving along like a train.\n\nI\u2019m silent enough that an image of Cholita at the front of a train actually came into my vision.  Cholita's a big fan of trains.\n\nShe kept that up, moving around the house laughing, for around 2 minutes. Then she was silent.\n\nAnother spell\u2026\n\nI decided now was as good of a time as any, and went to do a few tensegrity moves, to brighten up the colors.\n\nI was surprised to see, my normally smooth puffs of purple light now had yellow lines stuck in them.\n\nIt was like one of those cowboy movies where someone bites the dust big time, in an Indian attack.\n\nArrow after arrow is shot into their chest, until they crumble to the ground, leaning up against a tree trunk so you can see how many arrows the special effects guys managed to stuff into them.\n\nMy puffs were all shot up with golden arrows.\n\nThat was good enough for me.  I went back to the bed, sat on the pillows, and looked longingly for the \u201cthings\u201d up in the left corner of my room.\n\nI saw a pathetic little cluster of just 3 lights, too dim to be impressive. I gazed into it, and my assemblage point moved noticeably, but not enough to get to full on heightened awareness.\n\nI looked around, and the pathetic puffs were in fact all around in the room.\n\nIt's not like I saw 10 of them at once, but as I turned my head, I'd \"discover\" another one. Remember this:  The second attention is partly non-directional.\n\nProbably always.\n\nUnbending Intent long form has the advice of Carlos, in that regards.\n\nIt seemed that my concentrated sunlight \"things\" had dispersed, and mixed with the dreaming fog.\n\nI guess it's never as exciting the second time?\n\nI got up, knowing I\u2019d have to go back to using the tensegrity only.\n\nWhile walking along in the pitch black I noticed leakage of LED light from the electric heater.\n\nIt was cold last night, and I had the heater on.\n\nI\u2019d duct taped the leds, but  just the tiniest hint of blue light was leaking there.\n\nI left it as a marker, for finding my way around.\n\nAs I turned my head to the right, the tiny dot of blue sparkled.\n\nI got the strange idea that since you can use any light source, maybe the brightness only has to be relative.\n\nSo in darkness, you can use any light source.  Even dim ones.\n\nI turned my head left and right, so that the tiny sparkle would shine in all parts of my eye.\n\nIt seemed to be working, so I turned my head to try to make any light I found in the darkness, do the same sparkle.\n\nIt worked.  The fine details of the dreaming fog sparkled.\n\nIt wasn't all that powerful.  But it worked.\n\nSunlight sparkle gaze. Recapitulation. Unbending intent long form.\n\nAll use that smooth movement of the head, to produce results. \n\nIt's universal.\n\nAfter a while I resumed heading for the right side of my room. I was looking down, and noticed I could see the entire lower half of my luminous cocoon.\n\nThe sparkle had illuminated it. Or perhaps, trained me to be looking for fine lines like that.\n\nPerhaps the entire technique works by teaching us what the emanations look like?\n\nI wondered what would happen if I scooped some purple fog, and concentrated it. Would it still have those golden sparkles?\n\nIt was remarkably easy to gather a huge ball of very bright purple stuff.\n\nThat\u2019s because I\u2019ve been putting in several hours a night. It builds up.\n\nI separated my hands, knowing the purple stuff was stuck to them. It stretched into a long rope, the way dough stuck to your hands might do, and at the thinnest part in the middle I could indeed see golden lines.\n\nI got the idea that I could collect a blob, and scrape layers off the top, to see each of the fibers embedded in it.\n\nBut on the first swipe I pulled out some many dreaming objects that I had to stop.\n\nI discovered that I could scoop the purple fog into my hand, then use the other hand to smear off the top half.\n\nOut spilled little human heads, toys I couldn\u2019t recognize, and abstract geometric forms, which were actually random. But randomness itself seemed to be a pattern.\n\nI had the thought;  it makes sense. I have more energy for dreaming. And dreaming is not precisely the same thing as *seeing*.\n\nMy second attempt to pull a puff of light apart resulted in a surprise.\n\nI pulled out a small rodent, made out of blue light.\n\nHe was stuck to my hand.\n\nHe was the size of a small mouse.\n\nI\u2019d seen that kind of inorganic being before, so I just scooped it onto my stomach.\n\nBut not in the center.  \n\n\nPut it left or right as Carlos taught us.

So, while I wanted the 2 second assemblage point movement, instead I got what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happens to you guys will surely be different, but I think it&amp;#39;s still valuable to relate how fun things can get, after you put in the hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let me warn you.  If you&amp;#39;re afraid of mice, try something different than I did last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the day, I probably only did a total of 10 minutes of catching sunlight on my eyelashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likely doing it for long periods, the way La Gorda and the apprentices seem to have done, would produce even more results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I just caught some while walking, or driving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this technique might actually help those starting out, to look for colors in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But be warned, blobs are not the same as lines. If you do sunlight flicker gazing, you&amp;#39;ll be propelled to notice the lines, equally to the blobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That should mean, you can assemble a new world faster than I learned to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see a day when practitioners can share virtual worlds, discovered with a specific move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone will select their favorite Tensegrity move, use it to move their assemblage point in darkness, and the lines mixed in with the colors will spread to the walls and floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the line, they&amp;#39;ll find they&amp;#39;re no longer doing the tensegrity in their room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re in a new world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey!  I\u2019ve done it many times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t doubt it. The tricky part is whether you can participate in that world, instead of just view it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to get from there, namely seeing it only for yourself, to the causality defying practice of sharing it with others?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity Facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m going to have to give those guys a Marshall\u2019s badge one day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We might end up needing a rescue squad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Miles seems to have needed rescuing by Taisha, when he walked past the power spot beam in Carlos\u2019 compound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So get to work facilitators, and stop confusing yourself with other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a fortune teller, healer, paranoid politics fan, that&amp;#39;s fine. You can flip hamburgers for all I care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But keep the junk out of the sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It mostly weakens it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita might disagree with that, but she&amp;#39;s not going to be helping anyone besides herself, anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I went to bed very early. I wanted to be sure I woke at 2AM, so I could use up the sunlight I&amp;#39;d stored with my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around 1AM (no way to tell because I cover the LED digital clock too), I heard someone coughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or laughing. Or crying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea which it was, because it was too quiet to hear clearly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up in bed, to listen closely in case Cholita was in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The laughing got louder and louder, until it made my skin crawl a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My assemblage point shifted, and the vague purple fog I now see in any darkness, split into fine lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the sparkle on my eyelashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The laughing continued, and started to move around the house.  It was very loud!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t hear Cholita walking around. There was no sound of creaking wooden floor boards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the laughter came from different parts of the house, continuously moving along like a train.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m silent enough that an image of Cholita at the front of a train actually came into my vision.  Cholita&amp;#39;s a big fan of trains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She kept that up, moving around the house laughing, for around 2 minutes. Then she was silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another spell\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided now was as good of a time as any, and went to do a few tensegrity moves, to brighten up the colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to see, my normally smooth puffs of purple light now had yellow lines stuck in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was like one of those cowboy movies where someone bites the dust big time, in an Indian attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arrow after arrow is shot into their chest, until they crumble to the ground, leaning up against a tree trunk so you can see how many arrows the special effects guys managed to stuff into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My puffs were all shot up with golden arrows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was good enough for me.  I went back to the bed, sat on the pillows, and looked longingly for the \u201cthings\u201d up in the left corner of my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a pathetic little cluster of just 3 lights, too dim to be impressive. I gazed into it, and my assemblage point moved noticeably, but not enough to get to full on heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around, and the pathetic puffs were in fact all around in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like I saw 10 of them at once, but as I turned my head, I&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;discover&amp;quot; another one. Remember this:  The second attention is partly non-directional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably always.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unbending Intent long form has the advice of Carlos, in that regards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed that my concentrated sunlight &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; had dispersed, and mixed with the dreaming fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#39;s never as exciting the second time?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up, knowing I\u2019d have to go back to using the tensegrity only.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While walking along in the pitch black I noticed leakage of LED light from the electric heater.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was cold last night, and I had the heater on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d duct taped the leds, but  just the tiniest hint of blue light was leaking there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left it as a marker, for finding my way around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I turned my head to the right, the tiny dot of blue sparkled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the strange idea that since you can use any light source, maybe the brightness only has to be relative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in darkness, you can use any light source.  Even dim ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my head left and right, so that the tiny sparkle would shine in all parts of my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed to be working, so I turned my head to try to make any light I found in the darkness, do the same sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It worked.  The fine details of the dreaming fog sparkled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t all that powerful.  But it worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunlight sparkle gaze. Recapitulation. Unbending intent long form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All use that smooth movement of the head, to produce results. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s universal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a while I resumed heading for the right side of my room. I was looking down, and noticed I could see the entire lower half of my luminous cocoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sparkle had illuminated it. Or perhaps, trained me to be looking for fine lines like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the entire technique works by teaching us what the emanations look like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered what would happen if I scooped some purple fog, and concentrated it. Would it still have those golden sparkles?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was remarkably easy to gather a huge ball of very bright purple stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s because I\u2019ve been putting in several hours a night. It builds up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I separated my hands, knowing the purple stuff was stuck to them. It stretched into a long rope, the way dough stuck to your hands might do, and at the thinnest part in the middle I could indeed see golden lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the idea that I could collect a blob, and scrape layers off the top, to see each of the fibers embedded in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on the first swipe I pulled out some many dreaming objects that I had to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered that I could scoop the purple fog into my hand, then use the other hand to smear off the top half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out spilled little human heads, toys I couldn\u2019t recognize, and abstract geometric forms, which were actually random. But randomness itself seemed to be a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the thought;  it makes sense. I have more energy for dreaming. And dreaming is not precisely the same thing as &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My second attempt to pull a puff of light apart resulted in a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled out a small rodent, made out of blue light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was stuck to my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was the size of a small mouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d seen that kind of inorganic being before, so I just scooped it onto my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not in the center.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put it left or right as Carlos taught us.  I guess he said liver or kidney? There&amp;#39;s vortexes there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around the room for more light to play with, and saw more of the \u201cthings\u201d made from dots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They weren\u2019t strong enough to move my assemblage point rapidly, so I scooped them onto my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That caused a more rapid movement of my assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes sense.

She wasn\u2019t angry. She was fierce. Her lips were puckered, and she'd pushed her chin forward, to intensify the stare.\n\nI waited to see if she wanted to speak, but she did not.\n\nSo I walked over to see what she was doing.\n\nShe had a fabulous piece of art ($$$) centered in the bright sunbeams coming through the open back door, at the end of the day.\n\nShe lifted her tool, and glanced down at the art peacefully.

It was more fibrous, or maybe courser.\n\nThere were more details, and thus it was very easy to produce dreaming images from the pieces.\n\nBut none of those sparkly things floating above my head.\n\nI produced several dark dreaming phantoms,  necromancer style, said hello to the flat version of my little fairy, who puckered up for a kiss, and did my favorite Tensegrity to watch the fireworks show.\n\nBut what I really wanted was to discover how to move my assemblage point 2 full feet deeper into my cocoon, in 2 seconds.\n\nThat\u2019s how you burn from within.

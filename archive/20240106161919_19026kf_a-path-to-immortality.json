It's no mystery. And Darkroom practice leads directly to it. It teaches you to move your assemblage point all along the path you need to, to light up all the emanations at the same time. You just have to move from the blue line to the purple line on the J curve map, in less than 2 seconds.\n\nHowever, Carlos found another path.\n\nOne which results in immortality.\n\nThe Third Attention does not. It's only good until the earth is destroyed after our sun becomes a red giant.\n\nCarlos said that he had discovered a \"new vibratory level\" he could move his awareness to.\n\nIn fact, he left us months before his body died and you can find that mentioned in an interview in a Spanish Language publication. He said, \"I'm already gone, and I can't come back\".\n\nThat's a reference to his energy body in case it sounds puzzling. And if his energy body found a permanent dwelling in the emanations, his tonal awareness would have no problem joining later on.\n\nAs for how he found a path to immortality, we can currently only theorize. But it's possible that his cancer drove him to explore realms of reality a healthy sorcerer wouldn't notice.\n\nSilent Knowledge isn't lost because you are ill. You just \"look elsewhere\" due to how illnesses tend to push the assemblage point far sideways.\n\nLast night, with a minor cold making it very hard to get up to practice darkroom, I decided to skip directly to the end and see if I could \"see\" 10 times that night. I counted up to 3, before the alarm clock went off and I had to get up.\n\nI literally rose my fingers up on each count, which I highly recommend at first, when you reach Silent Knowledge and are capable of counting the occurrences of it.\n\nBut don't forget to follow don Juan's advice also, and look for text. Those \"videos in the air\" can be very confusing. And when ill, even more so as you can see here.\n\nTheory: The illness Carlos had, led to the discovery of immortality for \"seers\".  Marking the change from \"old seers\" who used the inorganic beings world as a container after death, to the \"new seers\" who used the Earth's cocoon, to the current kind of seer which potentially needs no container at all.\n\nIt's fascinating that the Star Wars movie franchise announced that Kwaigon found a path to immortality, just a few years after Carlos did.\n\nHere's a quote from workshop lecture notes, with Carol Tiggs speaking about Carlos having found a path to immortality:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nShe talked again about Carlos' recent breakthrough to a new vibratory level and what it meant for them. She said the implications were staggering and that they may not be able to formulate what exactly it means for some time, if ever. She said again that vibration is key to everything, and that they were learning new things about it and its relationship to everything they knew about energy and awareness.\n\nCarol then related something that Carlos said to her recently that was the most exquisite thing she had ever heard. He had grabbed her by the arm and said very movingly, \"I never thought I'd live forever . . . let's do it!\"\n\nIt has since become an axiom which guides them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Path To Immortality?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"97bnbvqy5uac1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/97bnbvqy5uac1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f83f9cf02cc0795c9b8d14881f1583c9d978b2f6"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/97bnbvqy5uac1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7ae3b991e2714456f0f282b272245811efbb922"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/97bnbvqy5uac1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c60fd0cc15c82b986caaa63b01edf08d205276da"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/97bnbvqy5uac1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c86248ea68f1afe84fa0dc78ad770a9a95dc45"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/97bnbvqy5uac1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7192b62109fa32c3d5217b3a16bcfb623acbf28b"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/97bnbvqy5uac1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f597cc88482d491b6e64af57f5925ae90d30b8ad"}, "id": "97bnbvqy5uac1"}}, "name": "t3_19026kf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zdgKoPImRvw_rpeDctug-vSBk4szLvXMGS5y-oim0r4.jpg", "edited": 1704555719.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1704554359.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/97bnbvqy5uac1.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f597cc88482d491b6e64af57f5925ae90d30b8ad\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/97bnbvqy5uac1.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f597cc88482d491b6e64af57f5925ae90d30b8ad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep using ChatGPT to make pictures, so keep in mind it&amp;#39;s quite a bit off from what I had wanted to draw.

Also around the same time i started getting into some of my moms books...including Castaneda (i think A Separate Reality is the first one i read)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/19026kf/a_path_to_immortality/kgu8hu3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1704684503.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_19026kf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kgqxvpw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kgqffm2", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Those darned blue dots!

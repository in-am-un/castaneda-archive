He said they had accomplished that feat.  They looked a little surprised to hear him make that claim, but that wouldn't be anything unusual.\n\nIt's very difficult to recall a movement like that.  You have to be able to sort of \"move back\" to even think about it.\n\nI've lost half of where my assemblage point moved last night, despite trying to mark it with a \"thumbs up!\"\n\nCarlos brought the women up to where he was standing just past the stairs in Dance Home, in Santa Monica.  He was facing around 50 people by Cholita's count.\n\nThe woman he  used in this demo was to his right.\n\nHe guided her to where he was, and turned her so that her butt faced us.\n\nThen he put his right finger on her left shoulder blade, and traced that path.\n\nThe entire time I was concerned with the most important point.\n\nWould his finger touch her butt???\n\nWhen it got to her butt and it was in fact touching, I was wondering if it would slide along her crotch.\n\nNope.\n\nOr at least, if it did, I don't recall that part.  I probably should have used a thumbs up to make sure I remembered which it was.\n\nAt the 2 marks you see in the front facing picture, the little horizontal lines, he moved his finger right, then left, when he got to those points.\n\nI greyed those a bit so you would know, those are on the back and you're looking through the front of the body, as if it were transparent.\n\nThe bright yellow on the side facing pic is that greyed path.\n\nHe lingered at those spots, then moved his finger right and left.  He moved it right, then left, at least 2 times, lecturing what would happen the whole time.\n\nBut he only moved right and left one inch!  And he moved it very slowly as he did, as if any shift there was quite noticeable.\n\nI was wondering at the time, why so little?\n\nThe Cheese diagram answers that.  Man's band is only a little of the total egg thickness. And we don't have access to 5 of those slices.  We have access to the \"band of man\", and also \"the black world\".  But not the rest.\n\nHe said one direction within man's band made you stronger, one more like an animal, and at the lower mark some insect stuff came into his lecture. Crossing Phylums.\n\nBut I  just don't remember it.  It was that finger on that girl.\n\nWhat can I say?  Carlos had made me celibate for more than a couple of years at that point.\n\nAnd Carlos was deliberately making sure we'd remember that demonstration.\n\nI doubt using Reni or Nyei for the finger demo would have rattled me that much.\n\nKylie maybe.  But that's  for a different reason.  Fear.\n\nHe even seemed to take a little glee in the whole thing.\n\nAs usual.  Carlos was indeed a bit of a trickster.\n\nIn a good way most of the time.\n\nWhen he got down to the second horizontal line he picked his finger up, knowing we were waiting to see what happens if it moves left or right there.  He grinned,  scanned the room to make sure everyone was watching, and then started over at the shoulder blade again.\n\nHe gave me quite a glance.\n\nHe knew what I was wondering.\n\nGirl.  Finger.  Public.  Social rules...  Cult figure, pretty girl???\n\nThat kind of thing.\n\nHe was enjoying it.\n\nI do seem to recall that this movement could be permanent.  If you got it to go there, it could eventually remain.\n\nI take it that's \"heightened awareness\", when you do it on your own.\n\nWhen done by a Nagual, a depression is created.\n\nJust speculation, but it gets dented into position, instead of tracing that path.\n\nBut we have no one to clarify that point these days.\n\nIn a post yesterday, someone mentioned using the gait of power to entice people's assemblage points to move left or right.\n\nThey found the quote from the book.\n\nIt was so interesting, I gave it a try last night.\n\nI can't use the gait of power, because there's no Genaro around when you need one.\n\nAnd tip toeing around on your own to see if the sound will move the assemblage point, is erratic.\n\nYes, it does.  But there's no control.\n\nLast night, with Cholita fled (leaving a particularly grisly spell in the fountain), I had more practice time than usual.\n\nSo I decided to move all the way to the furthest reaches of heightened awareness, at least as far as I can go, then see how to move the assemblage point left and right.\n\nI succeeded.\n\ncontinued...\n\nEdited\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Path of the Assemblage Point", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Illustrations"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 90, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ebfi4gp2kcz41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 69, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e8334c116890b126e919496a66d6c057059e159"}, {"y": 139, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c1d7e00422a85beed9c7eb978ef231c4c7645a4"}, {"y": 206, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=933a7d14aebb7dc5525f44061e5997fc3ddf17c9"}, {"y": 413, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2bc1a770b27f52e74aaa2e185f7b4f2efdf564"}, {"y": 620, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20d0996460dc5a0e94523182bedbbd3e3ea4273a"}, {"y": 698, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60e43ca58d87fdbbe5bf197ee4a2761f15083285"}], "s": {"y": 1046, "x": 1618, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=1618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca64eaa007b24b01a860dcc471ba2e84d3b93f2c"}, "id": "ebfi4gp2kcz41"}}, "name": "t3_glhpaa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Illustrations", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bkoJJFo8Pkn83wMTs5TBa6AV09__z-ZYCMTdD0HkUxU.jpg", "edited": 1593971025.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1589730799.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=1618&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ca64eaa007b24b01a860dcc471ba2e84d3b93f2c\"&gt;The path the assemblage point ideally moves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part 1: The Path&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around 1997, or whenever the Chacmools began to be replaced on stage by 2 other women, Carlos explained one possible (ideal) movement of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was down the back, starting from the left shoulder, over the butt, across the crotch (under the buttocks), and then back up the front, stopping just below the solar plexus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, more precisely than that I cannot recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave the demo on one of 2 new women, recently brought to private classes.

And to all of Saturday.\n\nUsually I have to hide out at work.\n\nI wandered around the yard a bit, to see what spells Cholita had left.\n\nI found a peculiar energy drink can. Aluminum, and torn to tiny pieces by hand. The lower half was still intact enough to serve as a basket for the rest of the pieces.\n\nIt was balanced on the low block wall between our home and the neighbor, where the plastic garbage bins are kept.\n\nThe neighbor lady insists the trash bins need to align, so that the ones on her side of the block wall correspond to the ones on our side.\n\nI have no doubt Cholita has had run-ins with her.  Cholita likes to pull the trashbin as close to the backyard gate as possible, so she can pull open the gate and put something in the bin, without anyone seeing her.\n\nThe torn can was a spell, or a warning, about the trash bins.\n\nElsewhere, in Cholita\u2019s fountain in the backyard, I found a mummified sparrow.\n\nIt was floating around in the water.  Or more precisely, floating around in a big circle, like a boat.  It was going around and around in the fountain at the lowest level.\n\nI checked to see if maybe it had simply died while getting a drink.\n\nCholita is too disorganized to keep things around, but when it was first installed I warned Cholita that putting the chlorine tablets in there, could make birds very sick.\n\nShe replied, \"Good!!!\"\n\nBut that was a half  year ago, with no new tablets and new water every few days.\n\nIt couldn't account for a dead sparrow.\n\nAside from the outside of its feathers, it was completely dry.\n\nIt was compact, wings perfectly folded close to it's body, and it's head was tilted down.\n\nIf I hadn't known better, I would have guessed it was a fake sparrow.  Or at least, a stuffed sparrow.\n\nBut when removed and placed on the ground, it's shiny soaked eyes told differently.\n\nThat bird was sun-baked before it got into the fountain.  And only the eyes had soaked up water so far.  They looked like green gelatin.\n\nCholita also left me messages.\n\nOne was a bank deposit slip. She had more money than I could account for.\n\nShe could stay away for months if she wanted to.\n\nAnother was a $100 bill, casually pinned to her blackboard, with other cash strewn about at least in 3 places.\n\nMessage clear:\n\nThe bird has flown and might not ever return.  It might even die this trip.\n\nHaving nothing but time, I spent 3 hours getting to heightened awareness.\n\nI finally realized I was there when I could feel my breath on my legs, several feet away from my mouth.\n\nWith a fan blowing furiously because it was hot.\n\nI was sitting up on pillows and my breathing was automatic. I was in bliss.\n\nIt was heightened awareness for sure.\n\nBut why I should be able to feel my calm breaths, all the way to my legs, through the strong breeze of the fan, was beyond me.\n\nA new thing!\n\nI commonly breathe into IOBs to make them more substantial.\n\nAnd Silvio Manuel had everyone breathe into Carlos, after draining him of life force.\n\nI guess the breath can do things like that!\n\nI looked up and noticed one of the purple puffs of color had a yellow patch.\n\nIt had started out vague,  earlier in the evening, but after several hours it was intensely bright.\n\nNewbies:  If you don't remain in the dark at least 1 hour, don't complain about the colors being too dim!\n\nI scooped it into my hand and it formed the magical crystal ball I posted about.\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ghcjoi/assembling\\_another\\_world\\_using\\_a\\_toy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ghcjoi/assembling_another_world_using_a_toy/)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as perfectly formed as the first time, but it was clearly the same thing.\n\nI thought maybe I needed my Inorganic Being, \u201cFairy\u201d, to help.\n\nI called out to her and she showed up in a second.\n\nI guess I can finally say, if you want to summon inorganic beings, the best way is to simply call out to them.\n\nDon Juan did that in a couple of places in Carlos\u2019 books. He just mentioned the inorganics to Carlos, in the course of explaining something, and they showed up walking around in the bushes.\n\nFairy was floating around in purple puffs of energy.\n\nI gazed at the tensegrity toy crystal ball in my hand, and Fairy started to expand.\n\nIt was clear she was going to take on full human size, standing in front of me on the bed.\n\nI got distracted waiting to see how solid she would become. She had expanded from 1 inch in diameter, to the size of Cholita.\n\nI began to wonder, maybe it was Cholita after all?\n\nBut, it was clearly Fairy.\n\nI lost 30 minutes.\n\nWhen I came to, or from the point I can now recall, my hand was empty and Fairy was gone.\n\nI wondered, can I just call to the crystal ball, the same way I called out to Fairy?\n\nI opened the fingers of my left had as if to make room for the ball, lifted the hand an inch and extended it, and the purple colors in the room flooded into my hand, dragging an opaque stretch of yellow.\n\nThe ball formed on demand!\n\nIf any of you is wanting to make your own power object, similar to how the old sorcerers did it, I suspect this is how.\n\nJust connect your own, \u201cmagical crystal ball\u201d, or other \"Tensegrity Toy\", to some rock you can hold in your hand.\n\nAnd have fun with it over and over in darkness, so that the rock is soaked with the *intent* of that object.\n\nIf that isn\u2019t how they did it, it won\u2019t matter.\n\nThis will work too.\n\nYou'll eventually be able to remove the rock from your pocket and have it turn into that magical object, made of light.\n\nBut I predict, by the time you can do that, you won't care.\n\nWe have too much to do.  The new sorcerers loaded us up with so many explanations, that falling into the trap of the old sorcerers is probably impossible.\n\nToo bad if you ask me.\n\nDon Juan seems like a bit of a snob.  The old sorcerers probably had more fun.\n\nExcept for the cannibalism part.\n\nBut holding the magical ball in my hand wasn\u2019t proof you could repeat this technique.\n\nI lifted it in the air 2 inches, intending to assemble another world on my bedspread.\n\nLast time, that's what it's purpose seemed to be.\n\nOne formed!\n\nIt looked like sand under the calm waters of a tide pool at Laguna Beach.\n\nExcept there was no water, and the sand was pure white.\n\nI could clearly see little waves and ripples in it, as if the sand had been moved around by gentle water flow, leaving shallow trails.\n\nBut as I gazed into the trails, something was moving down there.  On my bedspread.\n\nAnd extending to the left of the bed, far beyond the wall of my room.\n\nThe trails seemed to have been left by something crawling over the surface.\n\nI couldn\u2019t make out what was moving around.\n\nIt was transparent.  Or not even transparent.  Nearly invisible.\n\nI wondered if a lateral shift of the assemblage point might clear that up.\n\nBut how to move it?\n\nI took an inventory.\n\nI had been in near perfect silence for 3 hours, in order to get to that position of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd taking an inventory, periodically, is something we can\u2019t seem to avoid.\n\nRight on demand, I got the Eagle's command to take an inventory.\n\nIn this case I was looking at the inventory, free of any thoughts.\n\nFree even, of images in my mind.\n\nI saw a strange structure, made out of pressure.  But not in my mind. Floating in the air to the right.\n\nIt was like feelings all over your body, except they were floating in concrete shapes, interconnecting and winding among each other.\n\nI could see all of the sensations, and the pressure they exerted on each other.\n\nI examined one of them more closely than the others, to see if it was \u201cattached\u201d.\n\nIt faded away, as my gazing scan moved slightly to its right.\n\nSomething else, to the right of the entire structure, got added on as a substitute.\n\nI had a very perplexing feeling.\n\nLike a strange alien creature, or a beast.\n\nBut not the kind of thing you would imagine for a beast. It wasn't rage or anger, or aggressiveness.\n\nIt was forbidden.\n\nA forbidden state of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it was soothing.\n\nNeanderthal perhaps.\n\nNo feelings I could recognize, and yet I could feel everything more clearly than ever.\n\nI focused my gaze back to the left of the structure, and the original object returned. The feeling was more normal.\n\nI went back and forth on the right a few times, to make sure that was how to do a lateral shift.\n\nIt sure felt like a method!  Just feel things and go for the ones further right, or further towards what you want to become.\n\nYou simply take an inventory, make it visual, and scan the gaze to a new location.\n\nIf you want to become an animal, look for sensations that seem to be in that direction.\n\nI got the idea to go left.\n\nThe movement could be left or right, as demonstrated by Carlos.\n\nThe instant my gaze moved left, a crown covered in amazing jewels materialized in the air on the left.\n\nI had the weird Neanderthal structure on the right, and a shining crown of gold and jewels, on the left.\n\nI began to move my gaze further left, and the room was filled with golden light.\n\nI knew I was in trouble.\n\nI frantically gave myself a \u201cthumbs up\u201d, in hopes of remembering past that point.\n\nI even poked a hole in the golden light, using the  hand with the thumb up.\n\nOver and over.  I figured that would make such a huge hole, I'd be able to remember what happened next.\n\nI cannot.\n\nI awoke later, laying on my side, with waves of bliss streaming through me.\n\nIt was almost annoying.  Like when you are half awake in the morning, don't have to get up yet, and you get tingle after tingle of pleasure in your half asleep body.\n\nEach wave is a tiny bit jarring.  Unsettling perhaps, but still pleasurable.\n\nI opened my eyes and noticed Fairy\u2019s head was right in front of my face, just a few inches away.\n\nShe was just hanging out there, as if she\u2019d fallen asleep too.  She was around the size of a ping pong ball.   Just a pink head.\n\nEdited 4 times.", "edited": 1589831066.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fqxmpss", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Lateral shifts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Cholita run away, I had access to my entire home. And to all of Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually I have to hide out at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wandered around the yard a bit, to see what spells Cholita had left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a peculiar energy drink can. Aluminum, and torn to tiny pieces by hand. The lower half was still intact enough to serve as a basket for the rest of the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was balanced on the low block wall between our home and the neighbor, where the plastic garbage bins are kept.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The neighbor lady insists the trash bins need to align, so that the ones on her side of the block wall correspond to the ones on our side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt Cholita has had run-ins with her.  Cholita likes to pull the trashbin as close to the backyard gate as possible, so she can pull open the gate and put something in the bin, without anyone seeing her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The torn can was a spell, or a warning, about the trash bins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, in Cholita\u2019s fountain in the backyard, I found a mummified sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was floating around in the water.  Or more precisely, floating around in a big circle, like a boat.  It was going around and around in the fountain at the lowest level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked to see if maybe it had simply died while getting a drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is too disorganized to keep things around, but when it was first installed I warned Cholita that putting the chlorine tablets in there, could make birds very sick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She replied, &amp;quot;Good!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that was a half  year ago, with no new tablets and new water every few days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It couldn&amp;#39;t account for a dead sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from the outside of its feathers, it was completely dry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was compact, wings perfectly folded close to it&amp;#39;s body, and it&amp;#39;s head was tilted down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I hadn&amp;#39;t known better, I would have guessed it was a fake sparrow.  Or at least, a stuffed sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when removed and placed on the ground, it&amp;#39;s shiny soaked eyes told differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That bird was sun-baked before it got into the fountain.  And only the eyes had soaked up water so far.  They looked like green gelatin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita also left me messages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One was a bank deposit slip. She had more money than I could account for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She could stay away for months if she wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another was a $100 bill, casually pinned to her blackboard, with other cash strewn about at least in 3 places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Message clear:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bird has flown and might not ever return.  It might even die this trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having nothing but time, I spent 3 hours getting to heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally realized I was there when I could feel my breath on my legs, several feet away from my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a fan blowing furiously because it was hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sitting up on pillows and my breathing was automatic. I was in bliss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was heightened awareness for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why I should be able to feel my calm breaths, all the way to my legs, through the strong breeze of the fan, was beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A new thing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I commonly breathe into IOBs to make them more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Silvio Manuel had everyone breathe into Carlos, after draining him of life force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the breath can do things like that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked up and noticed one of the purple puffs of color had a yellow patch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had started out vague,  earlier in the evening, but after several hours it was intensely bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Newbies:  If you don&amp;#39;t remain in the dark at least 1 hour, don&amp;#39;t complain about the colors being too dim!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scooped it into my hand and it formed the magical crystal ball I posted about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ghcjoi/assembling_another_world_using_a_toy/\"&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ghcjoi/assembling_another_world_using_a_toy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t as perfectly formed as the first time, but it was clearly the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe I needed my Inorganic Being, \u201cFairy\u201d, to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called out to her and she showed up in a second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I can finally say, if you want to summon inorganic beings, the best way is to simply call out to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan did that in a couple of places in Carlos\u2019 books. He just mentioned the inorganics to Carlos, in the course of explaining something, and they showed up walking around in the bushes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy was floating around in purple puffs of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed at the tensegrity toy crystal ball in my hand, and Fairy started to expand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was clear she was going to take on full human size, standing in front of me on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got distracted waiting to see how solid she would become. She had expanded from 1 inch in diameter, to the size of Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to wonder, maybe it was Cholita after all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, it was clearly Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I came to, or from the point I can now recall, my hand was empty and Fairy was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered, can I just call to the crystal ball, the same way I called out to Fairy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the fingers of my left had as if to make room for the ball, lifted the hand an inch and extended it, and the purple colors in the room flooded into my hand, dragging an opaque stretch of yellow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ball formed on demand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of you is wanting to make your own power object, similar to how the old sorcerers did it, I suspect this is how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just connect your own, \u201cmagical crystal ball\u201d, or other &amp;quot;Tensegrity Toy&amp;quot;, to some rock you can hold in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And have fun with it over and over in darkness, so that the rock is soaked with the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of that object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that isn\u2019t how they did it, it won\u2019t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will work too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll eventually be able to remove the rock from your pocket and have it turn into that magical object, made of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I predict, by the time you can do that, you won&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have too much to do.  The new sorcerers loaded us up with so many explanations, that falling into the trap of the old sorcerers is probably impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too bad if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan seems like a bit of a snob.  The old sorcerers probably had more fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except for the cannibalism part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But holding the magical ball in my hand wasn\u2019t proof you could repeat this technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lifted it in the air 2 inches, intending to assemble another world on my bedspread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last time, that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s purpose seemed to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One formed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looked like sand under the calm waters of a tide pool at Laguna Beach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except there was no water, and the sand was pure white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could clearly see little waves and ripples in it, as if the sand had been moved around by gentle water flow, leaving shallow trails.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I gazed into the trails, something was moving down there.  On my bedspread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And extending to the left of the bed, far beyond the wall of my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trails seemed to have been left by something crawling over the surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t make out what was moving around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was transparent.  Or not even transparent.  Nearly invisible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered if a lateral shift of the assemblage point might clear that up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how to move it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took an inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been in near perfect silence for 3 hours, in order to get to that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And taking an inventory, periodically, is something we can\u2019t seem to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right on demand, I got the Eagle&amp;#39;s command to take an inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case I was looking at the inventory, free of any thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Free even, of images in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a strange structure, made out of pressure.

Carlos drew it himself, with his right forefinger.\n\nIt's not the \"only\" path the assemblage point can take.\n\nCarlos did in fact give us a lecture on that topic, and I got the impression that lateral shifts from our normal position, at the shoulders, were a bit unpleasant.

You get to the next point through silence.\n\n1). Frigging A!  There's no damned colors in here. What's that guy going on about?\n\n2). Is that slightly lighter than it was before?   Can I see some edges?\n\n3). Hey!  That's got a pink tint to it!\n\n4). That one is moving. It's sliding along in space on a predictable path!\n\n5). I can in fact put my hand next to it, and pretend to be pushing it.\n\n6). It's getting brighter when I push on it!!!!   Wait.  It went away.  I got excited. Darn.\n\n7). If I put my hand right under it, I can lower it to my stomach as I turn my head!  Who said you have to scoop them!?  You can just guide them!\n\n8). They don't stick so well to the stomach if you guide them. I guess I'll smash this one.\n\n9). What's that bright blue dot that just appeared???\n\n10). There are a lot of those light puffs in the room!   I never noticed that.  But they're so vague, they don't have definable edges.\n\n11). That one looks like a smiley face!\n\n12). Shit!!!!!!  What the hell was that head?  A corpse?  A zombie?\n\n13). Another head!  With it's mouth open like a scream!\n\n14). What the hell just zipped past me?  It seemed like a dark moth or huge black bumblebee.\n\n15). That blob of color has super sharp edges!  I'll grab that one and play with it in my hand.\n\n16). I can swoosh it with the other hand, and it seems to remain between my hands!  It even stretches.\n\n17).  That purple blob up in the air above me is rotating slowly!  It's edges are so bright, they look like they're on fire.  And how come that black keeps eating up the light?\n\n18). Something just floated off that spinney thing!   But I can't recall what it was. Was it a word? Or was it a dream? I just can't remember, even though it was only 2 seconds ago.\n\n19). What are those faint lines on the walls and floor?  How come I can't figure out where they are, and yet I can see them?  Wait, I can see the whole room, vaguely!\n\n(Tingle up spine at many of these transitions).\n\n20). My breathing is getting very calm.  I'm not even having to think about the next breath.\n\n21). Let's get serious and deposit this colored light all over my torso.  It seems to stay now.\n\n22). That guy said you can smear it.  Wait, it works!   It gets brighter as you smear!  The faster the better.  And now it's on my hands too.\n\n23). If I hold up my glowing hands, that floating head thing keeps returning.\n\n24). What the hell were those guys??!!  Like white phantoms.  Did I really see them run across the room?\n\nNaaa....\n\n25). I'll just sit down and scoop like Zuleica showed us.  Maybe I can see that luminous body.\n\n26). If I look straight forward while wiggling my fingers, I can vaguely see that my torso is glowing yellowish white.  But I have to look down with my eyes while facing ahead.\n\n27). Are those faint dark lines in that glow?  They seem to be flowing out from my waist.\n\n28). What was that I just felt?   Let me use the edge of my hand. Yes, there's cobwebs around that place Zuleica told us to scoop!\n\n29). That cobweb produces a sensation on the side of my ankle.  Let me try it again.  Yes, it does.  Not always, but every time I'm mentally calm.\n\n30). My hearing and smell are super powerful right now.  And the colors in the room are fizzing, like bubbles of some kind.\n\n31). If I concentrate my gaze, I can make the fizzing colors sink.\n\n32). I just forced a dreaming scene to appear!  What was I doing?  Oh yes, gazing.  I forgot that what I was doing is in fact gazing.\n\n33).  Oops. Don't get excited or you won't get dreaming scenes that last!\n\n34). What's that on the walls?  It's those lines.  But they look more like trees, or bushes.  I'll stand up and walk around to see.\n\n35). Yep, that's a window to another world on my walls!  True, it's very vague.  But, there's no frigging light in this room!   There's nothing to make those vague trees and distant hills!  It's a real world. I just assembled another world!\n\n36). There's that floating head again.  He's above a window.  Yes, it's a window!  I can see through it.    And there's no glass.\n\n37). I think I could jump into there!\n\n38). Gone from room.\n\n39).  What time is it?  Wait!!!  How did I get back in bed?\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1590256315.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_frkfwp5", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 3: Things to look for&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re sort of all trained, by the sorcery police, not to get specific about experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;#39;s to hide the fact that the sorcery police actually have no knowledge at all, but want you to think they do, because they have a giant inventory of facts about sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll go against the sorcery police, although you can see that it&amp;#39;s not even safe in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But probably not as nasty as the Zen police.

My hearing and smell are super powerful right now.  And the colors in the room are fizzing, like bubbles of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;31). If I concentrate my gaze, I can make the fizzing colors sink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;32). I just forced a dreaming scene to appear!  What was I doing?  Oh yes, gazing.  I forgot that what I was doing is in fact gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;33).  Oops. Don&amp;#39;t get excited or you won&amp;#39;t get dreaming scenes that last!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;34). What&amp;#39;s that on the walls?  It&amp;#39;s those lines.  But they look more like trees, or bushes.  I&amp;#39;ll stand up and walk around to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;35). Yep, that&amp;#39;s a window to another world on my walls!  True, it&amp;#39;s very vague.  But, there&amp;#39;s no frigging light in this room!   There&amp;#39;s nothing to make those vague trees and distant hills!  It&amp;#39;s a real world. I just assembled another world!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;36). There&amp;#39;s that floating head again.  He&amp;#39;s above a window.  Yes, it&amp;#39;s a window!  I can see through it.    And there&amp;#39;s no glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;37). I think I could jump into there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;38). Gone from room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;39).  What time is it?  Wait!!!  How did I get back in bed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied":

If we do, the black world is the only one we can fully assemble, and it's a \"dreadful place\" because it ages you.\n\n&gt;He's talking about using the force of alignment of the other bands, not going there.\n\nThe thing is if you read the whole book, and what is meant there, is that we only can assemble another great band when the assemblage point moves deep enough in the man's band. This man's band is not equal to current or other great band, It is an area in the cocoon where coherent perception is possible, beyond it everything is just lateral shifts, but great bands, this of ours and others are assembled within the man's band.\n\nAnd in the book, assembling the black world, bodily with all physicality was an ultimate exercise for Carlos. Which is a necessary step towards the third attention. And Carlos has accomplished it there, with don Juan and alone.\n\nIt would be hard to quote all necessary places, you would need to read the whole \"The Fire from Within\". But there it is clearly stated, that one of the milestones is exactly to learn assembling other great bands of emanations, without any shifting to the sides, just deeper into the man's band.\n\nBut they key phrase was here, as I pointed already:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He said that a true change of worlds happens only when the assemblage point moves into\r\nman's band, deep enough to reach a crucial threshold, at which stage the assemblage point can use\r\nanother of the great bands.\n\nAnd some more relevant stuff:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I heard then the voice of seeing. It said that my assemblage point had assembled a total world\r\nwith other great bands of emanations: a black world.\r\nI wanted to absorb every word I was hearing; in order to do that I had to split my\r\nconcentration. The voice stopped; my eyes became focused again. I was standing with don Juan\r\njust a few blocks away from the square.\r\nI instantly felt that I had no time to rest, that it would be useless to indulge in being shocked. I\r\nrallied all my strength and asked don Juan if I had done what he had expected.\r\n\"You did exactly what you were expected to do,\" he said reassuringly. \"Let's go back to the\r\nsquare and stroll around it one more time, for the last time in this world.\"\r\nI refused to think about don Juan's leaving, so I asked him about the black world. I had vague\r\nrecollections of having seen it before.\r\n\"It's the easiest world to assemble,\" he said. \"And of all you've experienced, only the black\r\nworld is worth considering. It is the only true alignment of another great band you have ever\r\nmade. Everything else has been a lateral shift along man's band, but still within the same great\r\nband. The wall of fog, the plain with yellow dunes, the world of the apparitions - all are lateral\r\nalignments that our assemblage points make as they approach a crucial position.\"\n\n One more quote:\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We stopped walking, and don Juan said that it was time for me to go.\r\n\"I want you to bypass all lateral shifts,\" he said, \"and go directly to the next total world: the\r\nblack world. In a couple of days you'll have to do the same thing by yourself. You won't have\r\ntime to piddle around. You'll have to do it in order to escape death.\"\r\nHe said that breaking the barrier of perception is the culmination of everything seers do. From\r\nthe moment that barrier is broken, man and his fate take on a different meaning for warriors.\r\nBecause of the transcendental importance of breaking that barrier, the new seers use the act of\r\nbreaking it as a final test. The test consists of jumping from a mountaintop into an abyss while in\r\na state of normal awareness. If the warrior jumping into the abyss does not erase the daily world\r\nand assemble another one before he reaches bottom, he dies.\r\n\"What you are going to do is to make this world vanish,\" he went on, \"but you are going to\r\nremain somewhat yourself. This is the ultimate bastion of awareness, the one the new seers count\r\non. They know that after they burn with consciousness, they somewhat retain the sense of being\r\nthemselves.\"\r\nHe smiled and pointed to a street that we could see from where we were standing - the street\r\nwhere Genaro had shown me the mysteries of alignment.\r\n\"That street, like any other, leads to eternity,\" he said. \"All you have to do is follow it in total\r\nsilence. It's time. Go now! Go!\"\r\nHe turned around and walked away from me. Genaro was waiting for him at the corner.\r\nGenaro waved at me and then made a gesture of urging me to come on. Don Juan kept on walking\r\nwithout turning to look. Genaro joined him. I started to follow them, but I knew that it was\r\nwrong. Instead, I went in the opposite direction. The street was dark, lonely, and bleak. I did not\r\nindulge in feelings of failure or inadequacy. I walked in inner silence. My assemblage point was\r\nmoving at great speed. I saw the three allies. The line of their middle made them look as if they\r\nwere smiling sideways. I felt that I was being frivolous. And then a windlike force blew the world\r\naway.\r\n\n    And some more:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\"We've come to the end of my explanation of awareness,\" he said. \"And today, you are going\r\nto assemble another world by yourself and leave all doubts aside forever.\r\n\"There must be no mistake about what you are going to do. Today, from the vantage point of\r\nheightened awareness, you are going to make your assemblage point move and in one instant you\r\nare going to align the emanations of another world.\r\n\"In a few days, when Genaro and I meet you on a mountaintop, you are going to do the same\r\nfrom the disadvantage of normal awareness. You will have to align the emanations of another\r\nworld on a moment's notice; if you don't you will die the death of an average man who falls from\r\na precipice.\"\r\nHe was alluding to an act that he would have me perform as the last of his teachings for the\r\nright side: the act of jumping from a mountaintop into an abyss.\r\nDon Juan stated that warriors ended their training when they were capable of breaking the\r\nbarrier of perception, unaided, starting from a normal state of awareness. The nagual led warriors\r\nto that threshold, but success was up to the individual. The nagual merely tested them by\r\ncontinually pushing them to fend for themselves.\r\n\"The only force that can temporarily cancel out alignment is alignment,\" he continued. \"You\r\nwill have to cancel the alignment that keeps you perceiving the world of daily affairs. By\r\nintending a new position for your assemblage point and by intending to keep it fixed there long\r\nenough, you will assemble another world and escape this one.\r\n\"The old seers are still defying death, to this day, by doing just that, intending their\r\nassemblage points to remain fixed on positions that place them in any of the seven worlds.\"\r\n\"What will happen if I succeed in aligning another world?\" I asked.\r\n\"You will go to it,\" he replied. \"As Genaro did, one night in this very place when he was\r\nshowing you the mystery of alignment.\"\r\n\"Where will I be, don Juan?\"\r\n\"In another world, of course. Where else?\"\r\n\"What about the people around me, and the buildings, and the mountains, and everything\r\nelse?\"\r\n\"You'll be separated from all that by the very barrier that you have broken: the barrier of\r\nperception. And just like the seers who have buried themselves to defy death, you won't be in this\r\nworld.\"\r\nThere was a battle raging inside me as I heard his statements. Some part of me clamored that\r\ndon Juan's position was untenable, while another part knew beyond any question that he was\r\nright.\r\nI asked him what would happen if I moved my assemblage point while I was in the street, in\r\nthe middle of traffic in Los Angeles.\r\n\"Los Angeles will vanish, like a puff of air,\" he replied with a serious expression. \"But you\r\nwill remain.\r\n\"That is the mystery I've been trying to explain to you. You've experienced it, but you haven't\r\nunderstood it yet, and today you will.\"\n\n  Please, look into those passages, it seems very important..\n\nAnd of course I agree about the me-too guys, you are right as usual.", "edited": 1598377757.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g2tfkj7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We never leave man&amp;#39;s band.

By\nintending a new position for your assemblage point and by intending to keep it fixed there long\nenough, you will assemble another world and escape this one.\n&amp;quot;The old seers are still defying death, to this day, by doing just that, intending their\nassemblage points to remain fixed on positions that place them in any of the seven worlds.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;What will happen if I succeed in aligning another world?&amp;quot; I asked.\n&amp;quot;You will go to it,&amp;quot; he replied. &amp;quot;As Genaro did, one night in this very place when he was\nshowing you the mystery of alignment.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Where will I be, don Juan?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;In another world, of course. Where else?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;What about the people around me, and the buildings, and the mountains, and everything\nelse?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll be separated from all that by the very barrier that you have broken: the barrier of\nperception. And just like the seers who have buried themselves to defy death, you won&amp;#39;t be in this\nworld.&amp;quot;\nThere was a battle raging inside me as I heard his statements. Some part of me clamored that\ndon Juan&amp;#39;s position was untenable, while another part knew beyond any question that he was\nright.\nI asked him what would happen if I moved my assemblage point while I was in the street, in\nthe middle of traffic in Los Angeles.\n&amp;quot;Los Angeles will vanish, like a puff of air,&amp;quot; he replied with a serious expression. &amp;quot;But you\nwill remain.\n&amp;quot;That is the mystery I&amp;#39;ve been trying to explain to you. You&amp;#39;ve experienced it, but you haven&amp;#39;t\nunderstood it yet, and today you will.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please, look into those passages, it seems very important..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course I agree about the me-too guys, you are right as usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_glhpaa", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/glhpaa/the_path_of_the_assemblage_point/g2tfkj7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1598373805.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1598373805.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g2teow4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g2s0bns", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; Shifts that are induced by practice occur along the midsection of man's band and are not coupled with slumber, yet a dreamer is asleep.\n\nThat's why I say, the assemblage point best moves down the middle, while going along the J curve.

It's like a round slice of cheese, stuck to 6 other round slices.\n\nBut we DON'T have a nagual to give us that push.\n\nThat push creates a dent. If you find the other half of this egg diagram, Carlos showed what it looks like with the deformation.\n\nHe strikes you on the back, and the assemblage point goes straight through the chest, towards the stomach.\n\nIt never drops at all, the way it does on the J curve.\n\nNow keep in mind, we aren't talking about the other 6 bands.\n\nWe can only access one of those, the black world.\n\nAnd Carlos left no instructions for how to do that.\n\nHe even added a warning, not to do that.\n\nIt ages the body.\n\nBut, somewhere shortly after he knew he was dying, and could not remain around to help us, he discovered something.\n\nHe had 2 new (very beautiful) young women.\n\nYou saw them on stage, in sunglasses!\n\nAnd as I recall it, black spandex.\n\nBut I have a poor memory.\n\nThey manged to move their assemblage points all the way to the good place (heightened awareness), doing just Tensegrity.\n\nOr maybe, Carlos had them doing something else.  God only knows.\n\nThe point is, they moved it on their own!\n\nI'm sure if you ask them, they'll be in doubt about it.\n\nThat's normal. If you learn to move it, you'll forget most of what happens.\n\nBut we can remember more than Carlos did, because we're doing it ourselves.\n\nAnd can sort of \"intuit\" that movement, so as to recall what we did the night before, when it moved very far.\n\nNot all of it. So give yourself that \"thumbs up\", to leave some emanations in both locations glowing together.\n\nA sign post to find at least part of the memories.\n\nPutting that aside, the fact that heightened awareness always comes with a memory lapse, we still need to clarify this J curve movement.\n\nYou're cheating!!!  That's what's happening.\n\nIt's great!\n\nCarlos found out, you can't move it yourself right through the middle.\n\nBut you can sneak it around on the outside.\n\nImagine a slice of mozzarella.  Perfectly round, and about 2 inches thick.\n\nI'm saying that, remembering his finger moving down the back of that hot young woman, as he stared at me with a grin.\n\nCarlos was demonstrating that just for me, specifically.\n\nHe kept looking at me, to see if I was getting worried about his finger, and her butt.\n\nWell, maybe not for me specifically.\n\nPerhaps he was just amused at my prudishness.\n\nBut I could easily have reached out my hand, and touched her butt myself.\n\nAnd it's a big classroom. Cholita says, 50 people there.\n\nSo back to the mozzarella slice analogy.\n\nLet's say you had a spot of mold on it.\n\nThe spot of mold was located where your left shoulder blade was.\n\nBut remember, that slice is sandwiched inside the full cocoon.\n\nIt's as if there's a slice of sharp cheddar to the left, completely smashed up against the mozzarella slice.\n\nAnd on the right, some kind of aged, dark smelly cheese of an entirely different type.\n\nYou surely don't want to taste that stuff.\n\nAll stuck together without mixing.  No air space.\n\nWhat do you suppose the chance is, of that mold spot growing right through the middle of the slice, to end up on the other side?\n\nZero!\n\nThe only way that mold could go directly through the middle to the other side, is if you took a small metal rod and pushed it through.\n\nThat's the Nagual's blow. It pushes the mold right through the center, and it ends up on the other side.  Near the navel.\n\nIt's a drastic maneuver! That's why all the heavy breathing and big fuss Carlos described.\n\nWe can't do that.\n\nInstead, we have a trick.\n\nWe've got purple mold enhancer.  A spray bottle that makes it grow faster.\n\nAnd a clear mold poison. Which silences it (kills it).\n\nWe spray a little purple  below it, and it grows down.\n\nAnd we spray the silence poison where it was, so that part dies.\n\nThe mold grows on the outside of that slice, moving down because we're controlling it.\n\nIt might move left or right a bit, in that slice.\n\nBut let's pretend, it can't grow into the adjacent slices.\n\nThat mold doesn't like cheddar, or the dark aged smelly slice on the right.\n\nWe keep slowly encourage it to grow downwards, until we reach the bottom of the slice.\n\nThere's no where to go but back up the other side.\n\nIt moves around the OUTSIDE of the slice. Not through the middle.\n\nWe can't spray inside the cheese!\n\nWhen it gets to the bottom (literally,  in that girly picture), it moves under, and comes up the front, on the far side of the round slice.\n\nStill on the outside.

It's tiny little legs give you shivers up the spine.\n\nWhen it gets to your butt, Fancy giggles and starts over.  She shines the light at your shoulder blade again, and the roach runs back up.\n\n(Carlos did that with his finger.)\n\nThe next time she moves it down to the shoulder blades, and uses the purple dot to make the insect move left 1 inch, then right 1 inch.\n\nThat's how far you can move it laterally. It's the thickness of that particular slice of cheese.\n\nShe continues making it move along that J curve, always on the outside of the slice.\n\nNever going through the middle.  That's impossible.\n\nWhen it gets to your butt, Fancy teases.  She shines the light in your eyes, to let you know, it's not going to end.\n\nCarlos did that too, grinning as he saw me wondering, would his finger actually touch her crotch when it came back up the other side?\n\nNope.\n\nAnd Fancy has more class than that too.\n\nShe walks around the other side, and shines the light way below your belly button, near the crotch.\n\nThe roach sees it, and runs under and back up the front.\n\nIt's now changed sides from back to front.\n\nFinally, she shines the led purple laser spot on the point of your second attention, and the roach finally ends up there, where she leaves it.\n\nThat's heightened awareness.\n\nIt's the same as the Nagual's blow, but without the dent.", "edited": 1598307556.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g2qdyzt", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 4: Clarifications&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought this diagram was self-explanatory, but it turns out some were confused by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, the naguals blow pushes the assemblage point right through Man&amp;#39;s band.  It&amp;#39;s like a round slice of cheese, stuck to 6 other round slices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we DON&amp;#39;T have a nagual to give us that push.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That push creates a dent. If you find the other half of this egg diagram, Carlos showed what it looks like with the deformation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He strikes you on the back, and the assemblage point goes straight through the chest, towards the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It never drops at all, the way it does on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now keep in mind, we aren&amp;#39;t talking about the other 6 bands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can only access one of those, the black world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carlos left no instructions for how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He even added a warning, not to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It ages the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, somewhere shortly after he knew he was dying, and could not remain around to help us, he discovered something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had 2 new (very beautiful) young women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You saw them on stage, in sunglasses!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as I recall it, black spandex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I have a poor memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They manged to move their assemblage points all the way to the good place (heightened awareness), doing just Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe, Carlos had them doing something else.  God only knows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is, they moved it on their own!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure if you ask them, they&amp;#39;ll be in doubt about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s normal. If you learn to move it, you&amp;#39;ll forget most of what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can remember more than Carlos did, because we&amp;#39;re doing it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And can sort of &amp;quot;intuit&amp;quot; that movement, so as to recall what we did the night before, when it moved very far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all of it. So give yourself that &amp;quot;thumbs up&amp;quot;, to leave some emanations in both locations glowing together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sign post to find at least part of the memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Putting that aside, the fact that heightened awareness always comes with a memory lapse, we still need to clarify this J curve movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re cheating!!!  That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s great!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos found out, you can&amp;#39;t move it yourself right through the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can sneak it around on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a slice of mozzarella.  Perfectly round, and about 2 inches thick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m saying that, remembering his finger moving down the back of that hot young woman, as he stared at me with a grin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was demonstrating that just for me, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kept looking at me, to see if I was getting worried about his finger, and her butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not for me specifically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he was just amused at my prudishness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I could easily have reached out my hand, and touched her butt myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a big classroom. Cholita says, 50 people there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So back to the mozzarella slice analogy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you had a spot of mold on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The spot of mold was located where your left shoulder blade was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But remember, that slice is sandwiched inside the full cocoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as if there&amp;#39;s a slice of sharp cheddar to the left, completely smashed up against the mozzarella slice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And on the right, some kind of aged, dark smelly cheese of an entirely different type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You surely don&amp;#39;t want to taste that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All stuck together without mixing.  No air space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you suppose the chance is, of that mold spot growing right through the middle of the slice, to end up on the other side?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zero!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way that mold could go directly through the middle to the other side, is if you took a small metal rod and pushed it through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow. It pushes the mold right through the center, and it ends up on the other side.  Near the navel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a drastic maneuver! That&amp;#39;s why all the heavy breathing and big fuss Carlos described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, we have a trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got purple mold enhancer.  A spray bottle that makes it grow faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a clear mold poison. Which silences it (kills it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spray a little purple  below it, and it grows down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we spray the silence poison where it was, so that part dies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mold grows on the outside of that slice, moving down because we&amp;#39;re controlling it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might move left or right a bit, in that slice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s pretend, it can&amp;#39;t grow into the adjacent slices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That mold doesn&amp;#39;t like cheddar, or the dark aged smelly slice on the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We keep slowly encourage it to grow downwards, until we reach the bottom of the slice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no where to go but back up the other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It moves around the OUTSIDE of the slice. Not through the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t spray inside the cheese!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it gets to the bottom (literally,  in that girly picture), it moves under, and comes up the front, on the far side of the round slice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still on the outside.  It never goes into the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;#39;re done, it&amp;#39;s in the same spot, as if the nagual&amp;#39;s blow were used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in the same spot as it might have been, if we pushed it through with a sharp metal rod.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, we leave no deformation doing that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is in fact, SUPERIOR to the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No damage to the cheese in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a little spot of mold that was on the upper back of the slice, but is now in the front, just below the mid point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this isn&amp;#39;t clear, I&amp;#39;ll take a Que from Fancy, my inorganic being who likes bondage imagery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably from watching too many superman re-runs with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used a pretty girl, in a tight outfit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a sexy analogy might work better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re tied up with arms stretched out, legs can&amp;#39;t move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy the IOB is going to torture you a little, to steal your energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your arms and legs are all extended out, to show the entire range of the luminous shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a Da-Vinci picture of man inside that circle diagram.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re a ball of energy, the size of your outstretched arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your tormentor, Fancy the inorganic being, puts a cockroach on your upper left shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You start to shiver and scream, GET IT OFF ME,  you little bitch!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has no intention of doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she has a little purple laser pointer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unknown to most, cockroaches &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; purple!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She shines the light under the roach, and it scurries down towards the purple dot of laser light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Fancy sees you are suffering even more, she keeps it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always pointing the little purple dot of light further down, making that cockroach crawl down your back.

How far forward it\u2019s fallen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please re-ask this question, if I didn\u2019t hit the right points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s critical, and very good that you asked it just this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good for &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_glhpaa", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/glhpaa/the_path_of_the_assemblage_point/fr1e69g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1589818146.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fr2zdq0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1589846853.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqyyana", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I knew I missed something.\n\nYes, I can see the assemblage point.\n\nIt really does exist.\n\nBut the only views I have of it are my own second attention's assemblage point, and I'm looking down at it.\n\nNot straight on.\n\nAnd I've only seen it on the only person I have around enough to get a chance.\n\nI can't yet sustain seeing all day long.\n\nI've seen it on Cholita, at an angle.\n\nEverything looks pretty much like Carlos described.\n\nCould be why it does.

To show they were \"wise to him all along\".\n\nThey ignored completely the explanation Carlos gave for not having enough energy to beat his cancer, due to having helped so many try to learn sorcery.\n\nWith none succeeding due to universal laziness and self-indulgence.\n\nThey decided that if Carlos couldn't force them to learn, as the \"masters\" of other systems claimed they could do if you just stuck with them and gave constant donations of time and money,  the flaw was with Carlos.\n\nThey had dutifully \"put in their time\" just by attending classes, and it was the fault of Carlos that it hadn't worked.\n\nAnd they'd better start coming up with explanations if they were to \"save face\" with their friends waiting back at home to ridicule them for even thinking they could escape their \"real life\".\n\nThis will happen to you over and over, as you learn sorcery.  It's not easy to see when you're a beginner, but the words of don Juan will echo back at you if you were fortunate enough to have read all of the books.\n\nEven if you go so far as to overcome fear, then overcome clarity, than overcome power, you'll still find yourself not quite free from second guessing and glossing over the obvious.\n\nThat only comes when you completely stop trying to change anything around you, and just look at what's really there.\n\nAn impossibility for non-seers.\n\nWhile \"seers\" eventually discover that nothing matters. And yet everything matters.\n\nI'm afraid to say that to perceive the whole truth of that,  requires silent knowledge.\n\nSilent knowledge is perfect for \"putting together the pieces\", to see the obvious fundamental construction of something.   What it's really made of.\n\nIt's a perfect flow of \"ideas\", with no effort.\n\nThe ideas don't come from your own mind.  Rather you just hold all the pieces of information you have available in your hands, and in silent knowledge they float out into the room and rearrange all by themselves, and you get to see what they really are once they finish assembling.\n\nBut it's not such a mysterious thing.  Computer programmers will tell you, if you just study all the issues of a problematic algorithm, then \"go out for coffee\", almost the instant you step out into the parking lot headed for your car, an idea will commonly pop into your mind.\n\nThe solution.\n\nBecause the fact is, we don't cause solutions to build piece by piece with our words in our mind.\n\nIdeas just pop in and no one can really tell where they came from.\n\nWe just need to clarify the issues involved in the problem, and that summons the answer.\n\nIt only seems otherwise because of our \"shields\".\n\nOf how we gloss over things.  Think \"we're in charge\", and \"above it all\".\n\nSo while it might be useless for me to describe the \"attitude adjustment\" I'm proposing in this post, you might be able to make and thus learn faster.\n\nI can summarize it as \"don't ignore your little toe\". Hopefully by the end of this, that won't sound so crazy.\n\nIt's unknown at this point if it's possible to convey this message, but I'm going to try.\n\nEven knowing, my attempt is a lot like don Juan's story about how each Nagual tries to teach his apprentices to avoid the mistakes he himself made in his own process of learning.\n\nBut that eventually,  don Juan realized his efforts to do that for his apprentices were a mistake.\n\nAnd people just had to suffer and struggle, in the process of learning.  It couldn't be avoided.\n\nI believe that story from the books was related to how cruel his own teacher, Julian, could be at times while teaching don Juan.\n\nKind of like, 'The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei\" from kill bill.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VtfqAym5sQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VtfqAym5sQ)\n\nIf you were taught kung fu by Pai Mei, at the end of the apprenticeship you were next to a \"God of movement\".  Balancing on the tip of a sword while living 400 years to perfect your skills even futher.  \n\nYou could punch through a solid oak plank 3 inches thick, with punches started just 1 inch from the board.\n\nBut it came at a price.  You might have your eye plucked out on a whim, by the cruel Pai Mei.  Who was sincerely doing that for your own benefit.  To adjust your thinking, so it would be possible to learn.\n\nPai Mei, who single handedly destroyed the monk inhabitants of the Shaolin temple. All because of a social slight by just one of them along the road down the hill as they momentarily crossed paths going in opposite directions.\n\nA slight which only a Chinese man could perceive.  \n\nThe monk didn't acknowledge an almost imperceptible nod of Pai Mei's head, recognizing the monk's existence as worth noting.\n\nPai Mei wouldn't have gotten along well working a normal job in the USA where slighting each other at work is a fun pastime for those trapped at that particular job.\n\nEspecially those from south american cultures where \"macho\" and \"caballero\" are real things, and the pecking order at work needs to be firmly established to fulfill those ideals of behavior.\n\nOur minds are filled with the horrors of our upbringing, where we are literally \"hazed\" into a specific mold of behavior.\n\nLeaving us traumatized by the time we reach our mid 20s.\n\nCarlos called it \"senile\".  He said the average person was already senile by age 22.\n\nBut, this is a complex topic.\n\nLet's just say that their \"shields\" are in place.\n\nTheir glossing.  To hide the onslaught of the unknown,  constantly attempting to intrude into our \"orderly\" lives.\n\n\"The Spirit\" is always trying to get our attention.  But nearly everyone manages to ignore it their entire life.\n\nSorcery is the process of removing that glossing, lowering your shields, so that you can take an honest look at yourself.  And notice what's coming to you from the outside.\n\nStop pretending that having a missing arm is just a flesh wound and notice that your worthy opponent Knight is giving you a reward for your noble efforts.\n\nTeachers who might help you learn to do that come in various types.\n\nSome of them being as cruel a Pai Mei or the Nagual Julian.\n\nAbove most other considerations that come up in teaching, Don Juan wanted to avoid coercing and bullying Carlos to learn as Julian had done to him.  \n\nHe saw it as a big mistake.  I might add, Julian's use of inorganic beings led to don Juan's distaste for them, and for the problem we have in our own community of people falsely claiming their too dangerous. \n\nWhen in fact, you can't escape the need for their help.\n\nBefore I forget, I'll need to make an \"inorganic beings are fun\" cartoon.  I have plenty of stories in that regards.\n\nI suppose don Juan's dread of the teaching methods of Julian might largely be because Julian experimented on him using \"intending\", and tossed him into a raging river to drown.  \n\nHis only protection being a spell Julian put on him, as he was flying through the air to his inevitable death by drowning.\n\nJulian chanted, \"For heaven's sake, don't hate the river!\"\n\nAnd certainly in large part it's also because Julian tricked him into being a slave working in a random home, often dressed as a woman, through the use of Julian's ally who manifested as a horrible monster under the direction of Julian.\n\nA \"monster\" who was supposedly  the slave driver that was keeping don Juan prisoner through fear of horrible death.\n\nWhich might even have been our friend \"little smoke\" the ally, misbehaving on command.\n\nShe did that to me from time to time.\n\nDon Juan felt both of those situations were a little harsh, and wanted to avoid that teaching method.\n\nWhen in fact, it assumes people are paying attention most of the time, if you treat them like friends.\n\nBut as socialized humans, we never look at the most obvious things in front of us.\n\nWe're forced to \"gloss\" over reality, in order to create the blur that allows us to pretend that our living situation fits the hype, and \"we're doing fine\".\n\nWhen we aren't.\n\nIt's very much like living in an ugly cult where everyone has to pretend to be \"on the path to God\" while wearing highly conservative black and white clothes designed in the 1800s,  riding around in horse drawn wagons.\n\nLet me back off, for those who believe in \"soul mates\".\n\nThose are the toughest ones to deal with, if you're stuck trying to help people learn sorcery.\n\nOur natural setting, the one we evolved into, is to live in the wild in temporary settlements, hunting and gathering for our livelihood, with plenty of freedom.\n\nHaving sex at the drop of a hat with whoever is around,  or in exchange for half a dead squirrel.\n\nIn that environment, even granny's moral standards are surprisingly low.\n\nNo complicated socialized behavior,  because such absurdities can only exist inside cities where your food comes from \"the store\", and you acquire it by obeying someone else so they'll give you money.\n\nYou become manipulative, but obedient.\n\nIn the wild, not at all.  If you had to put up with a tribe member as crazy as our average modern man, you'll just pack it up and go live on the other side of the lake.  It's nicer over there anyway.\n\nOr move to another tribe that's less fussy.\n\nAnd while living in the wild you'd run into spirits, and learn about them.\n\nThey're very real, and all over the place.\n\nAnd they like to \"blow your mind\" with magic.\n\nTeaching magic is their best way to interact with us, since it's only \"magic\" that allows us to perceive them in the first place.\n\nIt's not surprising.  Children love to learn from adults, and adults actually love to teach very small children, who just readily accept what you have to teach no matter how simplistic, and they do it without second guessing.\n\nIf you repeat the same teachings over and over, so much the better for very small children.\n\nTo the vast intelligence of inorganic beings, we're very much toddlers.\n\nIn the wild, there are also no \"Euro-Buddhists\" who studied Husserl and admire the writings of Nietzsche.\n\nPeople who go around with their nose upturned, as if smelling shit everywhere.\n\nCarlos had to deal with that constantly.\n\nWith his first attempts to teach sorcery for free in public parks back in the 80s, failing miserably.\n\nHe couldn't teach freely because he had hecklers in the audience, who's motivation for being there was not to learn from Carlos.\n\nBut to establish themselves among that random group as \"also having magical knowledge\".\n\nWe see that endlessly in the subreddit.\n\nAs I said, it's a result of socialization which creates ugly messes in every single person in the population.\n\nWith everyone hopping around on one leg claiming \"it's only a flesh wound\".\n\nDon Juan said he later realized that Julian's cruel Pai Mei approach to teaching was correct, and his own was wrong.\n\nNaturally, any apprentice would prefer don Juan's approach of explaining things, rather than coercing apprentices to learn.\n\nJust as children prefer hippy parents who want to treat kids as friends.  Equals.\n\nWhich is something even in our current socialization, people have universally figured out does not produce good results.\n\nIt only produces spoiled kids who can't cope with the world around them.\n\nBut reading this, you won't understand.\n\nYou're still glossing.\n\nWhat's hidden in this, is better shown in that picture from Monty Python of the man so anxious to fight an honorable battle against a competing knight, that he won't accept anything but victory.\n\nEven when the attacking knight concedes he's done well and it's ok to end the battle.  Seeing as how he has no arms and only one leg left.\n\nLet me go back to private classes at the end.\n\nPreparing for what they'd tell their friends, who would inevitably laugh and trash Carlos after he was dead, which is absolutely what we saw, private class members began to nitpick even the techniques he taught.\n\nSome of those final magical passes were so amazing, because they so simple, that it's hard to even fathom how human beings ignore such things.\n\nAs the effects those produce.\n\nRunning man series, \"the Wrestler\" not doing.  \"The Live Saver Pass\".\n\nAll obvious nonsense if you want to learn \"magic\".\n\nMaybe magic should involve monks chanting and banging gongs, or adults dressing up like Junior High School students playing dungeons and dragons.\n\nMaybe if you look as flamboyant as Aleister Crowley,  and then THAT'S \"real magic\".\n\nAttention seeking.\n\nHow can it be magic to rotate your foot?\n\nA \"wise\" student of magic would even tell you, your entire leg can be missing and \"It's only a flesh wound\".\n\nIf you're a \"superior being\".\n\nBut the truth is, if you reach the deep red zone on the J curve and then sit up on pillows on the bed to enjoy just gazing around the darkness of your practice room with your assemblage point that low on your back, the movement of even a little finger can send ripples of visible pink light waves across the room.\n\nIlluminating hidden things.  \n\nAn amazing supernatural being can even materialize right in front of you, to see why you decided to move your little finger while in such a state of stillness.\n\nSpirits and scenes of alien worlds can appear and disappear, in response to the smallest change  in your own body.\n\nBecause in fact, we aren't what we believe ourselves to be.\n\nA tiny motion of the body can shift half our energy of awareness, the half we've ignored all of our life.\n\nAnd when that comes \"into play\", it changes everything.\n\nIt's odd that it's so difficult to get to that state.\n\nWe'd rather sit with our eyes closed in mediation mostly dozing off out of boredom, while repeating some silly name for a God who never existed.\n\nCalling it a \"mantra\".\n\nOr pondering some supposedly wise and mysterious saying, which is actually a total misunderstanding of reality and was designed to confuse people so that someone else could steal money from them.\n\nThat causes us to reduce our internal dialogue a tiny bit, while \"sitting in meditation\" allows your flesh body to drift off into partial sleep, where you can then gloss away everything even further while pretending \"It's all just a flesh wound.\"\n\nOOOOMMMM.\n\nBut it works!  At least, if you're living the hellish life of a chimp in a cage, crammed in there with other Chimps who have also gone stir crazy, with your only hope being to find your \"soulmate\" among the prison population.\n\nTurning your back on it all in sitting closed eye meditation can be as soothing as  a hot bath surrounded by smelly flowers and candles.\n\nYou can drift off into half asleep states, and pretend everything is fine.\n\nWhich brings true relief to your body!\n\nI don't mean to belittle taking a break from being constantly besieged by your own grief and worry.  All \"tied up in knotts\".  So you can drift off into mild states of perception of the second attention.\n\nBut that is in no way a path to becoming a sorcerer.\n\nExcept for witches, if they systematically exploit that.\n\nSorcerers can't ignore the obvious. \n\nThat's where the real battle resides.\n\nThey aren't allowed to gloss over their problems.\n\nThat's for chimps stuck in cages with nothing they can do about it.\n\nBut humans evolved to be free. To explore the wilds and make friends with spirits. So they grow in magical knowledge.\n\nNot in how to become easily offended, so they can protect their corner in the chimp cage.\n\nCarlos liked to use the analogy of a chicken coop.\n\nWe're food for something else.  And the chicken coop doesn't really need \"Farmer John\" to guard the chickens.\n\nThey do that themselves. If any dares to stick a toe outside the coop in hopes of escaping, the other chickens begin to peck on its head until scabs form, and then they keep feasting on the scabs until it's dead.\n\nTheir peace in life requires pretending \"everything is fine\", and that anyone who wants to escape is broken.  In the wrong.\n\nPreparing for shame and ridicule, and to protect themselves from being pecked on the head after Carlos died, private class members began to be \"experts\" on what was reasonable, and what magic ought to look like.\n\nThey were second guessing Carlos at every move.\n\nSome ultimately became involved in trying to make a name for themselves, going on tour saying \"Carlos went bad\".\n\nTo explain that they weren't fools, and didn't deserve being pecked on the head for sticking a toe out in that direction of thinking they could escape.\n\nIt was just that Carlos wasn't strong enough to resist making mistakes.\n\nSo \"follow them\" now.\n\nThey've discovered \"hindu secrets\" that will short cut the path for you.\n\nOr, they have \"new Yoga Tensegrity moves\" which will do the trick.\n\nComplete your jedi training, because Carlos went bad and couldn't finish.\n\nThey bank on people assuming something was missing, and that's why no one can actually do any sorcery.\n\nBut the truth is closer to, no one noticed that moving even a little finger sends ripples of visible results through reality, potentially changing everything.\n\nYou can only notice that if you are absolutely silent, so that you stop ignoring the obvious all around you.\n\nStop pretending you aren't missing an arm and that the battle is going just fine.\n\nTensegrity is designed to make the truth of our situation and our inner workings more and more obvious, until finally you realize that the absurd stories Carlos told us to go with each long form, are literally true.\n\nYou can literally turn into an insect and fly away, at the end of forms which explore that type of energy in our luminous shell.\n\nOr you can literally form a perfect copy of yourself using the Affection for the Energy Body pass, a copy which could even leave your practice room and go out and get a second job.\n\nFrom the point of view of our normal life and our normal socialization, the notion is so absurd no one even dares think such a thing.\n\nSo instead they second guess why Carlos would make such a claim,  not even attempting to sincerely just follow his instructions.\n\nBut your little finger knows better.\n\nIf,  you can sit in absolute silence and gaze off into perfect darkness to see \"what's really going on\".\n\nWithout all the glossing and pretending and quest for honor.\n\nWhen you finally \"empty\" yourself enough, and I loath to use that word because it's been hijacked by pretend magical systems as an attention seeking claim, you start to see what's actually going on.\n\nAnd the Tensegrity is filled with observations you can make on your own, in a complete \"system\" to show you precisely what's \"happening\" all around you.\n\nWhere something as lame as the \"running man series\" produces astonishing (but basic)  magic at your feet.\n\nSo you stop believing \"it's only a flesh wound\".", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "It's Only A Flesh Wound!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"fdo9gjim6g3a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fdo9gjim6g3a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cd3ddf9a266c3e49a40f20c18639bd53817ab81"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fdo9gjim6g3a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de33c3264ff0fbc22d036dda4e95e30c6bf8b0b4"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fdo9gjim6g3a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fe516e78478e7c6d2c3a75e7466cfaa6df3bfd5"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fdo9gjim6g3a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac7e98f963f060455d053ffe78ab0e3e7c4dcf23"}, {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fdo9gjim6g3a1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d65c55516949203bb0c7cb8709cdcab69597b39"}, {"y": 810, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fdo9gjim6g3a1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b586f1b9f6409a939fbcc1ad72e0f9e0df0b8b3"}], "s": {"y": 900, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fdo9gjim6g3a1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3914f9cd0ed3b42810651e182f6c22d8bc75997"}, "id": "fdo9gjim6g3a1"}}, "name": "t3_zaj5it", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 33, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VtfqAym5sQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

for having been taken in by what was likely to be called a fraud, after he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They began to &amp;quot;nitpick&amp;quot; the tensegrity movements he created.  To show they were &amp;quot;wise to him all along&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ignored completely the explanation Carlos gave for not having enough energy to beat his cancer, due to having helped so many try to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With none succeeding due to universal laziness and self-indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They decided that if Carlos couldn&amp;#39;t force them to learn, as the &amp;quot;masters&amp;quot; of other systems claimed they could do if you just stuck with them and gave constant donations of time and money,  the flaw was with Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had dutifully &amp;quot;put in their time&amp;quot; just by attending classes, and it was the fault of Carlos that it hadn&amp;#39;t worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#39;d better start coming up with explanations if they were to &amp;quot;save face&amp;quot; with their friends waiting back at home to ridicule them for even thinking they could escape their &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will happen to you over and over, as you learn sorcery.  It&amp;#39;s not easy to see when you&amp;#39;re a beginner, but the words of don Juan will echo back at you if you were fortunate enough to have read all of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you go so far as to overcome fear, then overcome clarity, than overcome power, you&amp;#39;ll still find yourself not quite free from second guessing and glossing over the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That only comes when you completely stop trying to change anything around you, and just look at what&amp;#39;s really there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An impossibility for non-seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While &amp;quot;seers&amp;quot; eventually discover that nothing matters. And yet everything matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid to say that to perceive the whole truth of that,  requires silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent knowledge is perfect for &amp;quot;putting together the pieces&amp;quot;, to see the obvious fundamental construction of something.   What it&amp;#39;s really made of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a perfect flow of &amp;quot;ideas&amp;quot;, with no effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ideas don&amp;#39;t come from your own mind.  Rather you just hold all the pieces of information you have available in your hands, and in silent knowledge they float out into the room and rearrange all by themselves, and you get to see what they really are once they finish assembling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not such a mysterious thing.  Computer programmers will tell you, if you just study all the issues of a problematic algorithm, then &amp;quot;go out for coffee&amp;quot;, almost the instant you step out into the parking lot headed for your car, an idea will commonly pop into your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the fact is, we don&amp;#39;t cause solutions to build piece by piece with our words in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideas just pop in and no one can really tell where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just need to clarify the issues involved in the problem, and that summons the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only seems otherwise because of our &amp;quot;shields&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of how we gloss over things.  Think &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re in charge&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;above it all&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while it might be useless for me to describe the &amp;quot;attitude adjustment&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m proposing in this post, you might be able to make and thus learn faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can summarize it as &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t ignore your little toe&amp;quot;. Hopefully by the end of this, that won&amp;#39;t sound so crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unknown at this point if it&amp;#39;s possible to convey this message, but I&amp;#39;m going to try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even knowing, my attempt is a lot like don Juan&amp;#39;s story about how each Nagual tries to teach his apprentices to avoid the mistakes he himself made in his own process of learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that eventually,  don Juan realized his efforts to do that for his apprentices were a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And people just had to suffer and struggle, in the process of learning.  It couldn&amp;#39;t be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that story from the books was related to how cruel his own teacher, Julian, could be at times while teaching don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of like, &amp;#39;The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei&amp;quot; from kill bill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VtfqAym5sQ\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VtfqAym5sQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were taught kung fu by Pai Mei, at the end of the apprenticeship you were next to a &amp;quot;God of movement&amp;quot;.  Balancing on the tip of a sword while living 400 years to perfect your skills even futher.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could punch through a solid oak plank 3 inches thick, with punches started just 1 inch from the board.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it came at a price.  You might have your eye plucked out on a whim, by the cruel Pai Mei.  Who was sincerely doing that for your own benefit.  To adjust your thinking, so it would be possible to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pai Mei, who single handedly destroyed the monk inhabitants of the Shaolin temple. All because of a social slight by just one of them along the road down the hill as they momentarily crossed paths going in opposite directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A slight which only a Chinese man could perceive.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The monk didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge an almost imperceptible nod of Pai Mei&amp;#39;s head, recognizing the monk&amp;#39;s existence as worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pai Mei wouldn&amp;#39;t have gotten along well working a normal job in the USA where slighting each other at work is a fun pastime for those trapped at that particular job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially those from south american cultures where &amp;quot;macho&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;caballero&amp;quot; are real things, and the pecking order at work needs to be firmly established to fulfill those ideals of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our minds are filled with the horrors of our upbringing, where we are literally &amp;quot;hazed&amp;quot; into a specific mold of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leaving us traumatized by the time we reach our mid 20s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos called it &amp;quot;senile&amp;quot;.  He said the average person was already senile by age 22.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, this is a complex topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just say that their &amp;quot;shields&amp;quot; are in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their glossing.  To hide the onslaught of the unknown,  constantly attempting to intrude into our &amp;quot;orderly&amp;quot; lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Spirit&amp;quot; is always trying to get our attention.  But nearly everyone manages to ignore it their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is the process of removing that glossing, lowering your shields, so that you can take an honest look at yourself.  And notice what&amp;#39;s coming to you from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop pretending that having a missing arm is just a flesh wound and notice that your worthy opponent Knight is giving you a reward for your noble efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teachers who might help you learn to do that come in various types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of them being as cruel a Pai Mei or the Nagual Julian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Above most other considerations that come up in teaching, Don Juan wanted to avoid coercing and bullying Carlos to learn as Julian had done to him.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He saw it as a big mistake.  I might add, Julian&amp;#39;s use of inorganic beings led to don Juan&amp;#39;s distaste for them, and for the problem we have in our own community of people falsely claiming their too dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact, you can&amp;#39;t escape the need for their help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I forget, I&amp;#39;ll need to make an &amp;quot;inorganic beings are fun&amp;quot; cartoon.  I have plenty of stories in that regards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose don Juan&amp;#39;s dread of the teaching methods of Julian might largely be because Julian experimented on him using &amp;quot;intending&amp;quot;, and tossed him into a raging river to drown.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His only protection being a spell Julian put on him, as he was flying through the air to his inevitable death by drowning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julian chanted, &amp;quot;For heaven&amp;#39;s sake, don&amp;#39;t hate the river!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And certainly in large part it&amp;#39;s also because Julian tricked him into being a slave working in a random home, often dressed as a woman, through the use of Julian&amp;#39;s ally who manifested as a horrible monster under the direction of Julian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;monster&amp;quot; who was supposedly  the slave driver that was keeping don Juan prisoner through fear of horrible death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which might even have been our friend &amp;quot;little smoke&amp;quot; the ally, misbehaving on command.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did that to me from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan felt both of those situations were a little harsh, and wanted to avoid that teaching method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact, it assumes people are paying attention most of the time, if you treat them like friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as socialized humans, we never look at the most obvious things in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re forced to &amp;quot;gloss&amp;quot; over reality, in order to create the blur that allows us to pretend that our living situation fits the hype, and &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re doing fine&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very much like living in an ugly cult where everyone has to pretend to be &amp;quot;on the path to God&amp;quot; while wearing highly conservative black and white clothes designed in the 1800s,  riding around in horse drawn wagons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me back off, for those who believe in &amp;quot;soul mates&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the toughest ones to deal with, if you&amp;#39;re stuck trying to help people learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our natural setting, the one we evolved into, is to live in the wild in temporary settlements, hunting and gathering for our livelihood, with plenty of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having sex at the drop of a hat with whoever is around,  or in exchange for half a dead squirrel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that environment, even granny&amp;#39;s moral standards are surprisingly low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No complicated socialized behavior,  because such absurdities can only exist inside cities where your food comes from &amp;quot;the store&amp;quot;, and you acquire it by obeying someone else so they&amp;#39;ll give you money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You become manipulative, but obedient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the wild, not at all.  If you had to put up with a tribe member as crazy as our average modern man, you&amp;#39;ll just pack it up and go live on the other side of the lake.  It&amp;#39;s nicer over there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or move to another tribe that&amp;#39;s less fussy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while living in the wild you&amp;#39;d run into spirits, and learn about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re very real, and all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they like to &amp;quot;blow your mind&amp;quot; with magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teaching magic is their best way to interact with us, since it&amp;#39;s only &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; that allows us to perceive them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not surprising.  Children love to learn from adults, and adults actually love to teach very small children, who just readily accept what you have to teach no matter how simplistic, and they do it without second guessing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you repeat the same teachings over and over, so much the better for very small children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the vast intelligence of inorganic beings, we&amp;#39;re very much toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the wild, there are also no &amp;quot;Euro-Buddhists&amp;quot; who studied Husserl and admire the writings of Nietzsche.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who go around with their nose upturned, as if smelling shit everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had to deal with that constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With his first attempts to teach sorcery for free in public parks back in the 80s, failing miserably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t teach freely because he had hecklers in the audience, who&amp;#39;s motivation for being there was not to learn from Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to establish themselves among that random group as &amp;quot;also having magical knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We see that endlessly in the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, it&amp;#39;s a result of socialization which creates ugly messes in every single person in the population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With everyone hopping around on one leg claiming &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s only a flesh wound&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said he later realized that Julian&amp;#39;s cruel Pai Mei approach to teaching was correct, and his own was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, any apprentice would prefer don Juan&amp;#39;s approach of explaining things, rather than coercing apprentices to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as children prefer hippy parents who want to treat kids as friends.  Equals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is something even in our current socialization, people have universally figured out does not produce good results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only produces spoiled kids who can&amp;#39;t cope with the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But reading this, you won&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re still glossing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s hidden in this, is better shown in that picture from Monty Python of the man so anxious to fight an honorable battle against a competing knight, that he won&amp;#39;t accept anything but victory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even when the attacking knight concedes he&amp;#39;s done well and it&amp;#39;s ok to end the battle.  Seeing as how he has no arms and only one leg left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me go back to private classes at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preparing for what they&amp;#39;d tell their friends, who would inevitably laugh and trash Carlos after he was dead, which is absolutely what we saw, private class members began to nitpick even the techniques he taught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of those final magical passes were so amazing, because they so simple, that it&amp;#39;s hard to even fathom how human beings ignore such things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the effects those produce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Running man series, &amp;quot;the Wrestler&amp;quot; not doing.  &amp;quot;The Live Saver Pass&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All obvious nonsense if you want to learn &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe magic should involve monks chanting and banging gongs, or adults dressing up like Junior High School students playing dungeons and dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe if you look as flamboyant as Aleister Crowley,  and then THAT&amp;#39;S &amp;quot;real magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can it be magic to rotate your foot?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;wise&amp;quot; student of magic would even tell you, your entire leg can be missing and &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s only a flesh wound&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;superior being&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, if you reach the deep red zone on the J curve and then sit up on pillows on the bed to enjoy just gazing around the darkness of your practice room with your assemblage point that low on your back, the movement of even a little finger can send ripples of visible pink light waves across the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Illuminating hidden things.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An amazing supernatural being can even materialize right in front of you, to see why you decided to move your little finger while in such a state of stillness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spirits and scenes of alien worlds can appear and disappear, in response to the smallest change  in your own body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in fact, we aren&amp;#39;t what we believe ourselves to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tiny motion of the body can shift half our energy of awareness, the half we&amp;#39;ve ignored all of our life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when that comes &amp;quot;into play&amp;quot;, it changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s odd that it&amp;#39;s so difficult to get to that state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d rather sit with our eyes closed in mediation mostly dozing off out of boredom, while repeating some silly name for a God who never existed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calling it a &amp;quot;mantra&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or pondering some supposedly wise and mysterious saying, which is actually a total misunderstanding of reality and was designed to confuse people so that someone else could steal money from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That causes us to reduce our internal dialogue a tiny bit, while &amp;quot;sitting in meditation&amp;quot; allows your flesh body to drift off into partial sleep, where you can then gloss away everything even further while pretending &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all just a flesh wound.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OOOOMMMM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it works!  At least, if you&amp;#39;re living the hellish life of a chimp in a cage, crammed in there with other Chimps who have also gone stir crazy, with your only hope being to find your &amp;quot;soulmate&amp;quot; among the prison population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turning your back on it all in sitting closed eye meditation can be as soothing as  a hot bath surrounded by smelly flowers and candles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can drift off into half asleep states, and pretend everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings true relief to your body!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean to belittle taking a break from being constantly besieged by your own grief and worry.  All &amp;quot;tied up in knotts&amp;quot;.  So you can drift off into mild states of perception of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that is in no way a path to becoming a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except for witches, if they systematically exploit that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers can&amp;#39;t ignore the obvious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where the real battle resides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t allowed to gloss over their problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s for chimps stuck in cages with nothing they can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But humans evolved to be free. To explore the wilds and make friends with spirits. So they grow in magical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not in how to become easily offended, so they can protect their corner in the chimp cage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos liked to use the analogy of a chicken coop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re food for something else.  And the chicken coop doesn&amp;#39;t really need &amp;quot;Farmer John&amp;quot; to guard the chickens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They do that themselves. If any dares to stick a toe outside the coop in hopes of escaping, the other chickens begin to peck on its head until scabs form, and then they keep feasting on the scabs until it&amp;#39;s dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their peace in life requires pretending &amp;quot;everything is fine&amp;quot;, and that anyone who wants to escape is broken.  In the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preparing for shame and ridicule, and to protect themselves from being pecked on the head after Carlos died, private class members began to be &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; on what was reasonable, and what magic ought to look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were second guessing Carlos at every move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some ultimately became involved in trying to make a name for themselves, going on tour saying &amp;quot;Carlos went bad&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To explain that they weren&amp;#39;t fools, and didn&amp;#39;t deserve being pecked on the head for sticking a toe out in that direction of thinking they could escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just that Carlos wasn&amp;#39;t strong enough to resist making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;follow them&amp;quot; now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve discovered &amp;quot;hindu secrets&amp;quot; that will short cut the path for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, they have &amp;quot;new Yoga Tensegrity moves&amp;quot; which will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Complete your jedi training, because Carlos went bad and couldn&amp;#39;t finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They bank on people assuming something was missing, and that&amp;#39;s why no one can actually do any sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is closer to, no one noticed that moving even a little finger sends ripples of visible results through reality, potentially changing everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can only notice that if you are absolutely silent, so that you stop ignoring the obvious all around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop pretending you aren&amp;#39;t missing an arm and that the battle is going just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity is designed to make the truth of our situation and our inner workings more and more obvious, until finally you realize that the absurd stories Carlos told us to go with each long form, are literally true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally turn into an insect and fly away, at the end of forms which explore that type of energy in our luminous shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can literally form a perfect copy of yourself using the Affection for the Energy Body pass, a copy which could even leave your practice room and go out and get a second job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of our normal life and our normal socialization, the notion is so absurd no one even dares think such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead they second guess why Carlos would make such a claim,  not even attempting to sincerely just follow his instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your little finger knows better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If,  you can sit in absolute silence and gaze off into perfect darkness to see &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s really going on&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without all the glossing and pretending and quest for honor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you finally &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot;

Stretchy for no reason other than it makes the pink and purple colors in the second attention fog &amp;quot;swirl&amp;quot; better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The form starts to be modified, for the purpose of pleasing the second attention more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if the second attention were a tired dog you were trying to encourage to jump up and play like it  used to do when  young.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To explain how far that can go, if I lean over slightly during the day to reach for something,  the bones in my neck and spike click one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as we read of don Juan cracking his back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re loose from me bending and leaning at angles during tensegrity, which might be impossible if I had the lights on and realized how ludicrous those positions were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes even perhaps &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also nearly pass out doing Stellar Hatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a good night, I&amp;#39;m forced to sit down or fall to the ground and bump my head while stretching to look up into space as far as I can get the ball of energy to travel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s induced by stretching and inhaling deeply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, once induced it happens just because you look up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you realize, it&amp;#39;s not actually &amp;quot;excessive or interrupted blood flow to the brain&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;something else&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_zaj5it", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zaj5it/its_only_a_flesh_wound/iymy8hj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1669998322.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iyn41wf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Fluffy_visuals", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iymx6x9", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_to6hu0gf", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Right I think its a needy behaviour in-order to avert practicing (more).

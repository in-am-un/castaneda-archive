And be amazed.\n\nWe had some idiot yesterday do a hit and run on the subreddit, posting that Tensegrity was made up, or nonsense, or something like that.  He just didn't like it, mostly.\n\nProbably pointed us to a quote by Victor Sanchez, a huge fraud who pretended to know sorcery so he could steal from us, and claimed he was in the room when Carlos \"made up tensegrity\".\n\nPeople who are \"first 3 books\" impeccable warrior types don't like Tensegrity.  And never read the rest of the books, because the fantasy of the first 3 is what appealed to their lazy natures.\n\nEat some shrooms, pretend to be impeccable, and lord it over your friends.\n\nThat's what they're after.  The same kind of pretend magic Buddhists and Yogi types are after.  Or Daoists for that matter.  Who ChatGPT will tell you, are obsessed with phony longevity potions and techniques, like Howard Lee.\n\nCarlos got his lawyers to write a letter saying there was no association between Victor Sanchez and him, meaning if Victor was in the room he was simply spying at a workshop.\n\nThat's nothing new.  Ken Eagle Feather even tried to recruit students for himself, from a workshop.\n\nAnd Merilyn Tunneshende caused trouble at one. She claimed to be Carlos' lover and an apprentice of don Juan.\n\nAll the fake sorcery teacher types likely snuck into a workshop or two back then.\n\nAnd yes, of course Carlos did in fact \"make them up\"!\n\nIt's old seer magic, from the death defier.\n\nAnd all over in the books. The last time some man said they were made up, we found close to 15 in the books, and stopped there because it was pointless to look further.\n\nThey were simply old seer magic, and stuff the lineages knew on their own.\n\nBut the lineages and old seers weren't trying to teach a legion of people at workshops.  So they just taught them as very simple movements, used when needed.\n\nAnd our leaders, namely Carlos, Taisha, Florinda, and Carol Tiggs loved martial arts all along.\n\nI was even in Karate classes with Taisha and Florinda, back in the 70s.  Went on the airplane to the Budokan with Taisha, and probably was looking somewhere else at young Japanese women, when she got angry and rang the gong.\n\nIt was the UC system. They had several martial arts.  Shotokan was one of them.\n\nUnder that bastard woman hater, Nishiyama.\n\nBut so was Aikido taught in the UC system, under \"Hawaii Harry\". Which I studied also.\n\nAnd one magazine article says Carlos did too. Had a black belt according to one woman.\n\nThen our leaders took a fancy to Howard Lee,  who taught the most popular Kungfu style in southern China.  Choi Lai Fut.\n\nMostly because he was a healer and Carlos has always had health problems. It's mentioned in the books when La Gorda calls him, \"The Nagual who got sick\".\n\nCarlos probably figured, maybe Howard has mastered intending people to get well.  And since he taught Kungfu, why not give it a try?\n\nBut even with his cancer, Carlos outlived the average lifespan for Peruvians born in his year, by at least 30 years!  You can look up the stats.\n\nSo Carlos got the idea to use martial arts as the format to pass on the old seer technology, and then when it  wasn't working very well in private classes he got the idea to copy the \"katas\",  or long forms of the Japanese martial arts world, so that people were doing sustained tensegrity longer and had to concentrate on remembering the moves instead of fantasizing about the butt of the person in front of them in class.\n\nBut that still didn't work.\n\nTwenty years went by after his death, with no one learning any actual sorcery.\n\nUnless they kept that secret up in Cleargreen because they were told not to change anything Carlos did.\n\nAt which point, meaning 15 or so years after everything was slowly failing and the reputation of Carlos was in the toilet, the Allies of Carlos got tired of waiting.\n\nOr maybe they had instructions, and blackmailed me to come here (eventually after a mistaken attempt to teach individuals).\n\nAnd now we have this bizarre path known as \"Darkroom\", invented by Little Smoke.\n\nThe Ally of Carlos.\n\nOr at least, that seems to be who she is. She follows Cholita around as a golf ball sized puff of pure white smoke, with a very few intense yellow fibers embedded in the middle. Radiating out like they were growing from the center.\n\nThat ball once flew under a little dim sum plate in a Chinese restaurant, because Cholita got angry with this subreddit and decided to show how primitive we all were.  She gazed at the plate, little smoke visibly flew under, and it bumped up into the air by an inch or two.\n\nI was shocked.\n\nI exclaimed, \"Cholita!!!  Did you see that???!\"\n\nShe didn't say anything.\n\nI said, \"That's what I was just explaining. How if you play with the allies over and over, eventually you can command them to move stuff for you.\"\n\nShe became even more angry, saying \"Like this?\", and gazed down with a fierce stare.\n\nAnd the little plate slid an inch to her left. But so slowly and smoothly, no human could have made it move like that.  Only a machine, or a spirit could do that.\n\nAnd it's not like Cholita were capable of keeping a device in her purse to do it!\n\nBack then it took us 4 attempts and 6 hours, just to deposit a check she got from one of the customers Carlos gave her.  She was so confused, she believed the bank was loaded with chinese spies trying to steal her money.\n\nThat plate moved because Little Smoke was told to move it.\n\nI was dumbfounded.\n\nI had a good relationship with Little Smoke, but all she did for me was bend water to flow sideways in the shower, make drops from the water faucet grow as big as a large gumball before falling, and play tricks with my stuff.\n\nShe especially liked chap sticks because they were easy to roll on a flat surface and had a water content.\n\nThey like water.\n\nCholita figured, the cat was out of the bag so she looked down one more time at the dim sum plate,  and made it slide 4 inches to the right. Absolutely smoothly, with no start jerk or stop jerk, taking around 2 seconds to travel 4 inches.\n\nThe waitress soon came along and picked it up, since Cholita had finished the egg rolls.  Half an eggroll at a time, unless she got angry and stuffed a whole one in her mouth with a sly smile.\n\nAnd as I was saying, Little Smoke designed darkroom to prevent men from lying about their imaginary experiences, to get attention.\n\nIt's \"lie proof\".\n\nPeople try, weekly, but they get tossed out by the good mods of this subreddit.\n\nWithout whom we'd lose this magic. It would be buried alive in outsiders invading to get attention.\n\nAs they've done with all magic, since money and cities were invented.\n\nAnd all \"darkroom\" is, is Tensegrity in the dark with emphasis on silence and looking for your energy body.\n\nThe very thing the Tensegrity moves manipulate!\n\nThis one however, DOES NOT manipulate the energy body.\n\nIt manipulates an energy center sorcerers can visibly see, in the throat area.\n\nThe one for making decisions.\n\nBut also, the one for deciding if the changing reality you are perceiving is \"done\".\n\nThere's a ludicrous idea in Shamanism, of \"vision questing\".\n\nIt's so utterly pointless, I can't imagine people fall for it.\n\nIf they can pull it off, then more power to them.\n\nBut in a closed room you can not only have visions with your eyes open, but summon alternate reality after alternate reality, and then walk right through a solid wall to go \"vision questing\" on another planet outside this galaxy.\n\nThe idea of making a big attention seeking show out of going into the mountains to \"look for visions\" is pretty awful.\n\nIt's just \"product\" sold by bad men. Even if they claim to be shamans.\n\nThe kind of men who come here and claim, Tensegrity is nonsense.\n\nYou won't think it's nonsense when this particular pass makes it possible for you to remote view back in time 8000 years into eastern mexico.\n\nI was doing that last night. After a huge struggle to keep practicing when I was very tired.\n\nIt turns out, the more horrible it is to keep practicing, the more you are rewarded by the spirit.\n\nI saw only trees this time, but there were lots of them.\n\nI didn't find any ruins.\n\nAll of the tensegrity passes have hidden old seer technology, and are precious.\n\nHere's of the tree types I was remote viewing from 8000 years ago, although mine were much taller and more sparse.  They looked to be very old trees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cuyx7tb8cnlb1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33f3fb563ac925c9819205912417e3d1d2b2618b", "edited": 1693575984.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jynxeyb", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I updated the facebook link.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll likely end up on instagram if no one says not to today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#39;s the point of this pass?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You all have NO IDEA what Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someday you&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; it.

Did you see that???!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what I was just explaining. How if you play with the allies over and over, eventually you can command them to move stuff for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She became even more angry, saying &amp;quot;Like this?&amp;quot;, and gazed down with a fierce stare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the little plate slid an inch to her left. But so slowly and smoothly, no human could have made it move like that.  Only a machine, or a spirit could do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not like Cholita were capable of keeping a device in her purse to do it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then it took us 4 attempts and 6 hours, just to deposit a check she got from one of the customers Carlos gave her.  She was so confused, she believed the bank was loaded with chinese spies trying to steal her money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That plate moved because Little Smoke was told to move it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was dumbfounded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a good relationship with Little Smoke, but all she did for me was bend water to flow sideways in the shower, make drops from the water faucet grow as big as a large gumball before falling, and play tricks with my stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She especially liked chap sticks because they were easy to roll on a flat surface and had a water content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They like water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita figured, the cat was out of the bag so she looked down one more time at the dim sum plate,  and made it slide 4 inches to the right. Absolutely smoothly, with no start jerk or stop jerk, taking around 2 seconds to travel 4 inches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The waitress soon came along and picked it up, since Cholita had finished the egg rolls.  Half an eggroll at a time, unless she got angry and stuffed a whole one in her mouth with a sly smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as I was saying, Little Smoke designed darkroom to prevent men from lying about their imaginary experiences, to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;lie proof&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People try, weekly, but they get tossed out by the good mods of this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without whom we&amp;#39;d lose this magic. It would be buried alive in outsiders invading to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As they&amp;#39;ve done with all magic, since money and cities were invented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all &amp;quot;darkroom&amp;quot; is, is Tensegrity in the dark with emphasis on silence and looking for your energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The very thing the Tensegrity moves manipulate!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one however, DOES NOT manipulate the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It manipulates an energy center sorcerers can visibly see, in the throat area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one for making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also, the one for deciding if the changing reality you are perceiving is &amp;quot;done&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a ludicrous idea in Shamanism, of &amp;quot;vision questing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so utterly pointless, I can&amp;#39;t imagine people fall for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they can pull it off, then more power to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in a closed room you can not only have visions with your eyes open, but summon alternate reality after alternate reality, and then walk right through a solid wall to go &amp;quot;vision questing&amp;quot; on another planet outside this galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of making a big attention seeking show out of going into the mountains to &amp;quot;look for visions&amp;quot; is pretty awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; sold by bad men. Even if they claim to be shamans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kind of men who come here and claim, Tensegrity is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s nonsense when this particular pass makes it possible for you to remote view back in time 8000 years into eastern mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was doing that last night. After a huge struggle to keep practicing when I was very tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the more horrible it is to keep practicing, the more you are rewarded by the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw only trees this time, but there were lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t find any ruins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the tensegrity passes have hidden old seer technology, and are precious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s of the tree types I was remote viewing from 8000 years ago, although mine were much taller and more sparse.  They looked to be very old trees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

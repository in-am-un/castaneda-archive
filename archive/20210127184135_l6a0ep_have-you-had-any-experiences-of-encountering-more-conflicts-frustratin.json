Luckily, she agrees 100% with that and she also finds my point of view helping her because she has encountered these phenomenons a lot (She said that anytime she feels things are good then bad things come). \n\nWith the discussion, both of us all feel easier and relieved and find it interesting that the recent hardships/challenges mostly made by our deep subconscious. For me, I find it easy to solve the problem with the current conflict when I realize that this is just my subconscious created all the stuff or Shadow work like Carl Jung. I've decided to lower my expectation a little bit, changed my way of discussing, and let the team have more voice, etc. I have posted the question to this sub in the morning, discussed it with my wife at lunch, and in the afternoon, I had a call with one of the most conflict members with the new approach. The discussion went well. At that time, I've also played with the Psi Wheel (I practice Telekinesis) and it spun more than usual. :D\n\nRegarding the Shadow work of Carl Jung, by the time I read that, I was quite positive and believed that I don't really need to work on the shadow (I thought I'm good enough :D). But the subconscious doesn't think so. With the recent conflict, I have been stress for a while and then while browsing Reddit, I have seen this post-[https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/l5srqd/practice\\_looking\\_back\\_after\\_se/](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/l5srqd/practice_looking_back_after_se/) \\- it reminded me of the concept of The Dark Night of the Soul, and then I post the question to this group asking you. It is interesting to see that subconscious created the challenge and showed you a \"hint\".\n\nSo, my observation is that my subconscious found that I need to work on my shadows stuff (I am too meticulous in work and I have a tendency to oppress others' opinions) and it has created this conflict as a mirror for me to reflect. If I do not work directly with that conflict, to encompass the opposite/my shadow and choose another solution like firing the team then I think that shadow will come back in the future. \n\nI just want to update the status for you guys. Nothing is permanent and it means I still need to observe that Mr. DoubleTaker/Ego/Shadows carefully and deal with them. \n\nThank you!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gl4av53", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After asking you guys, I have shared my thought with my wife regarding the current conflict in my work is because of my &amp;quot;subconscious&amp;quot; or Mr. DoubleTaker as Dan mentioned. Luckily, she agrees 100% with that and she also finds my point of view helping her because she has encountered these phenomenons a lot (She said that anytime she feels things are good then bad things come). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the discussion, both of us all feel easier and relieved and find it interesting that the recent hardships/challenges mostly made by our deep subconscious. For me, I find it easy to solve the problem with the current conflict when I realize that this is just my subconscious created all the stuff or Shadow work like Carl Jung. I&amp;#39;ve decided to lower my expectation a little bit, changed my way of discussing, and let the team have more voice, etc. I have posted the question to this sub in the morning, discussed it with my wife at lunch, and in the afternoon, I had a call with one of the most conflict members with the new approach. The discussion went well.

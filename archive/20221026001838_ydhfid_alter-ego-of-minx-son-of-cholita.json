Vicente's 3 allies given to Carlos by handing him some plants to put into the ground and water, showed up with a broken down car.  Carlos couldn't tell them from real people.\n\nDon Juan also gives the story of allies riding on busses.  And normal people don't realize what they are.\n\nI find that story hard to swallow, but what can I say?\n\nI didn't realize Minx was an inorganic being at the time.\n\nThat's the good thing about Cholita.\n\nI was practicing darkroom, and at some point I left, and walked through the door in the hallway outside my bedroom.\n\nInto the living room.\n\nThere was a very large lizard, with 1 inch long toenails walking across the wooden floor.  Making scratching noises.\n\nNow, you might do a double take, but it's Cholita!\n\nI have literally come home to find an annoying baby blue jay trapped in our fireplace.\n\nI once came home and saw all the neighbors gathered around looking down the street at a dead cat.\n\nIt was the one who had a feud going with Cholita.\n\nCholita kept telling me the cat had it in for her, but I didn't believe it.\n\nUNTIL she had the door open and I went inside her studio, watching her from the other side.\n\nI saw the cat sneak in, give me a look like, \"You won't tell will you?\"\n\nAnd then it sprayed her luggage.\n\nWell, that's the cat that was dead down the street.\n\nI asked what happened, saying I kind of liked that cat.\n\nThe guy answered, \"It was the strangest thing.  We don't get speeding trucks on this street, as far back as I can remember.  But one came hauling around the corner down there, at top speed, and hit the cat smack dab in the middle. It tumbled 2 or 3 times as it landed 50 feet away in the middle of the road, dead.\n\nSo finding that Cholita has a new pet lizard, or at least she's kidnapped on, is no mystery.\n\nI walked around the lizard to the side yard where Cholita has a garden.\n\nI said, \"Do you always have to leave all the windows and doors open?  Look what's gotten inside now.\"\n\nI glanced back, and the lizard was gone.\n\nIt was Minx the squirrel.  Begging like a little lap dog, standing on his back paws.\n\nI started to realize something wasn't right, but the room was perfectly real.\n\nI turned to walk back the way I came, and a little Irish boy ran out of the bathroom.\n\nI didn't think to turn around and check what happened to the squirrel.\n\nI went into the bathroom only to find he'd taken a sledge hammer to the tile walls.\n\nHe had 2 bizarre \"assistants\".\n\nCholita walked over and stood next to Minx, the little Irish boy with a sledge hammer.\n\nHe looked up at Cholita, and then at me and said, \"I only obey her.\"\n\nAt least that's the best I can remember it after all this time. It's posted way back in this subreddit.\n\nI suppose I would have left this version of Minx out of the cartoons, but Fancy, my own ally, didn't see it that way.\n\nSo she told on me...\n\nI'd put this up on instagram, where the grisly animation of Minx in squirrel form got 167 likes in the time period most posts only get 20.\n\nBut it's just too weird to be believed.\n\nUnless you read all of the books of Carlos.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Alter Ego of Minx: Son of Cholita", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"drk8xp1td1w91": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/ydhfid/asset/drk8xp1td1w91/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718049928%2CZWRiNzliZDI5NDM5YTI1Yjc3YzBjOWE2MWYxNmNlYjhlZWQyMzJmMzI3MDVmNzNkNGE5NWMxZTE5OTRhNWI1YQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 470, "y": 480, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/ydhfid/asset/drk8xp1td1w91/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718049928%2CM2JmNzk3NWIzOGY2MWQ4ZmYxZDI2MTRhZDAwMGI0MWUyZTZlOTVhOGMzYjJkZTdiZDczYmZhZDk4NWQyZWZmMg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "drk8xp1td1w91", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_ydhfid", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vAT4xn5_vPLnkpUOebG5b-lsmtf_1B6Kj9f5HW0Bs0c.jpg", "edited": 1666740534.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666736318.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/ydhfid/video/drk8xp1td1w91/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/ydhfid/video/drk8xp1td1w91/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t do sleeping sorcery.

There's a level of deep relaxation of \"caring\" or \"watching\" which allows it.\n\nI realized that...\n\nBut couldn't do it more than 10%.   If you reduced the opaqueness of a computer picture in half, you'd be able to see it over other pictures.  In computer graphics that is.\n\nSo reduce that to 10%, a very pathetic \"ghost\" view of the picture, and it's VERY easy to learn to create those on the fly.\n\nIn a dark room.\n\nYou'll see why when you begin to clean your link to intent.  Which sort of just means, get all ideas of gain or running to show your mom out of your mind.\n\nIf you are doing sorcery for any reason other than you love the results, you will fail.\n\nYou can't learn it in order to write your first book so you can help \"teach\" others.\n\nYou can't even learn it to do something as \"noble\" as help the police solve crimes.\n\nYou can't learn it to prove to your annoying siblings that you didn't waste your time all those  years with Sai Baba. \n\nYou can't learn it so that you can have a \"spiritual\" relationship with your lover, and hopefully pin him down so he can't dump you like the last one.\n\nForget it!   You ACTUALLY have to WANT magic.\n\nIf it's anything else, you're screwed.\n\nFor now that is.  I guess if we get energetic mass, that could change.\n\nSo it's easy to make \"10% Phantom Rooms\".\n\nThat's your own \"intending\".\n\nThe resulting phantom view of something calls to you, with just the awareness of yourself.\n\nThere's an alternative to that.  Obviously making your own phantom room violates the \"book deal mind\" rule at least by 10% itself.\n\nYou aren't just taking what comes along.  You're forcing it.\n\nSo you're messing with magic for the sake of something else.  Even if you can't define why you are motivated to rush things, just so you can see a giant cave with storage shelves carved into the dirt.\n\nThat's one of the 10 sights I \"intend\" in order to build my phantom room \"Dream Bubble Station\".\n\nUsing tensegrity in a series of long forms I intend all the pieces of a whole phantom reality, and at the end if I had  good night those phantom views are glowing enough to assemble into a whole.\n\nThe full view of dream bubble station.  Which includes a lot more variety than you'd expect. It even has a \"power object vending machine\" now.\n\nSo at 10% it's pretty lame.  But if done every night you have the latent glow from the last time. It builds up over time and you can intend your own 50% phantom room.\n\nStill not enough?\n\nAll you have to do at that point is \"treat it as real\" and the assemblage point shifts horizontally to make it so.\n\nSo beginners should be aware, there are 3 different principles going on here and I'm about to add what will likely be two more.\n\nNext factor to help you create 50% phantom rooms is someone else's awareness.\n\nThe awareness of me, Cholita, and Minx, created an entire phantom city.\n\nI'm going to divide that next factor into the awareness of people, and the awareness of inorganic beings.\n\nThey have different effects, but both are \"help\".\n\nNow the second of these 2 new effects.\n\nActual energy.  Something with real energy behind it.\n\nHumans have the ability to live in two kinds of realities.  A \"real\" one that has actual energy of its own, and one that's just a phantom construct and does not. \n\nLike the death defier's village in Tula.\n\nBy the way, if the death defier had no body left after 7000 years in the inorganic beings world, perhaps he actually only existed in his phantom copy of Tula?   And needed Carol to escape that?\n\nSo that when the naguals of don Juan's lineage met him, it was actually the him who is in Tula as a phantom occupant?\n\nDid the Nagual Sebastian (1723) work there as a bishop?  That city has roots from 1000 AD.\n\nWe don't have enough info on that, but it's amusing.\n\nLet me go back and summarize before we get to Mescalito.\n\nYou can intend a 10% real looking phantom room all by  yourself.  Once you clean your link to intent a bit.\n\nIf you make that part of a routine, it gets stronger and stronger due to latent awareness from the times before, and you can get that up to 50% if you can keep \"clean intent\".  A \"ritual\" makes  it stronger.  Rituals also help clean the link to intent because you \"get over\" bad motivations.\n\nYou can use the awareness of other beings to make Phantom rooms stronger.  If they'll agree it exists.  The other beings can even be inorganic. \n\nAnd finally there can be \"real energy\" behind something , in which case we're talking about a different thing.  \n\nOne you'll get to do yourself if you work hard!\n\nYou just sit in the darkness, and see what \"offers\" itself to you.\n\nWhat catches your attention.\n\nAnywhere in the universe, or in the past too.\n\nLikely into the future also, but the future might be just as Yoda said, \"always in flux\".\n\nWhy do I believe you can see into the future, besides Yoda's words?\n\nBecause don Juan said if there was a man waiting for him with a high power rifle, something his vast sorcery skills can't overcome (Carlos was theorizing), then \"I just won't come around!\"\n\nMeaning, he saw into the future a bit.\n\nIf Soledad did cause that movie, then we should heed that the Jedi seemed to have super reflexes because they saw into the future a few seconds, all the time.  Using that, they could block bullets with their lightsaber.\n\nVery much like don Juan's method of dodging bullets from rifles with telescopic sights?\n\nThe two second warning?\n\nI believe we get that too, and could even use it for fighting some day.\n\nSo what about Mescalito?\n\nFirst let's talk about \"God\".  You can see him, mystics see him, the old seers saw him, but only the new seers kept going back until they figured out, he's a phantom being.\n\nNot \"real\" at all.  That doesn't mean he can't respond. And doesn't give off a feeling of godliness when you are in front of him.\n\nThe problem is, he's the total of all the awareness of other people who pray to him several times a day.  They're making their 10% phantom thing, but with their eyes closed.\n\nWith billions of people wishing up the same thing, namely a \"protector\".  God is literally available for daily chats if you like to do that sort of thing.\n\nYou won't get to do anything else if you pursue that, so forget that bad idea if it's echoing in your mind!\n\nI can see it now.  Your new book.   \"How to REALLY know God.   In person!\"\n\nWe should hope it turns out to be Morgan Friedman.  Just don't talk politics with him.\n\nThat book title worked for Patanjali's bad player translator.  I honestly think that guy is responsible for Gurus who teach \"Siddhis\", and that it's not actually anything they would have thought to charge $3000 for to na\u00efve westerners, if some bad guy hadn't written that book to cash in on westerners with an obscure indian text.\n\nThat's the extent of the Yoga \"Siddhi Powers\".\n\nJust crummy green line effects on the J curve.\n\nSo God is out there but he's an \"SKE\" or \"Silent Knowledge Entity\".\n\nBut let's talk about Talking Lizards.  And by implication, those mushroom shapes of men you request to \"see\" while using the smoking mixture.\n\nThose are both created by a \"ritual\", which means latent awareness has been stored into it through repetition, the ritual was practiced by perhaps hundreds of the old \"men of knowledge\" over thousands of years, and so what might have originally been only a 10% phantom construct can become 100% real for a lame man of knowledge type.\n\nWho can't create 10% anything on his own.\n\nBut by combining those things I listed, can produce a very profitable magical ceremony.\n\nI'd even pay to see talking lizards!\n\nI've seen that lizard. Carlos introduced our class to it.\n\nBut it didn't talk.\n\nBecause it was still the ally. Not the SKE.\n\nNow I have to talk about \"only the first four books\" types who invade here.  Looking to bully their way to crummy status for fake sorcery knowledge.\n\nThey pick up all sorts of garbage, like the belief that the Devil's Weed plant contains the Ally.\n\nShamanistic delusions designed to con other humans into giving them more stuff.\n\nOr these invaders believe that the mushroom entity is contained in the mushrooms, and doesn't actually come from the center of the universe as Carlos told us.  Even though don Juan specifically corrected him on that point, and said it was called \"Little Smoke\" for reasons other than being contained in the smoking mixture.\n\nI've seen that entity.  It used to follow Cholita as a little puff of white smoke with bright yellow lines in it.  It would even push on objects for Cholita.  Or make gurgling sounds with water.\n\nThe crummy \"first 4 book\" people  block out all chances to learn, just to keep their ugly book deal fantasies going.\n\nAnd they add confusion to our community so that obvious things like, \"Who is Mescalito?\" seem impossible for us to figure out.\n\nSo put that aside.\n\nThe Devil's Weed plant, or the mushrooms, are only used in those rituals because the Men of Knowledge needed to sell stuff.  They couldn't expect the customers of their rituals to learn to get silent and move their own assemblage point!\n\nSo they moved the assemblage points with those power plants.\n\nThen they had the ritual.   But also the latent awareness of all those in the past who used this technique.\n\nThey have at least 3 of those things going for them, to make their phantom reality of talking lizards or human mushrooms.\n\nBut what is the talking lizard anyway?\n\nI suppose we don't worry about the mushroom shapes of people.   We kind of know those are just presentation methods to show you what you wanted to know about that person.\n\nThose are the presentation method for silent knowledge.  The topic is the person in question.\n\nThat's just a silent knowledge ritual!   You use the ritual of preparing the smoking mixture to connect you to past events of this same thing, to get the extra boost from both.  The smoking mixture moves the assemblage  point, but then you have an Ally helping out too.\n\nYou're set!  It's our friend Little Smoke the moth, insuring success.\n\nBut in fact, it's the same for the talking lizards.\n\nThose are just the same as the mushroom shapes.\n\nDid you really think don Juan would sew a lizard's mouth or eyes shut?\n\nThat was just the Devil's Weed ally.\n\nMinx in my opinion.\n\nCholita's ally.\n\nWhen I want to do something physical, he shows up and lets me experiment on him.\n\nHe'll sit there and let you do anything you like to him, because that's what inorganic beings want.  The energy they gain from interacting with us.\n\nSo sorry DeMille.  The first \"Carlos Debunker\".\n\nIt doesn't matter if only a skilled surgeon can sew the eyes of a lizard shut!\n\nWhat a \"genius\" DeMille was.\n\nIt was a TALKING lizard!\n\nBut he complained Carlos didn't have the skill to sew it's eyes shut???\n\nScientologist thinking...   I mean, \"SCIENCEtology\"?\n\nAnd DeMille fell for that?\n\nBut Carlos was a fraud?\n\nThat's like the Buddhist Tony Lama accusing Carlos of treating women badly.\n\nA Buddhist, whose church runs most prostitution in many asian countries?\n\nHere's a hint: Sorcerers use sex for \"assemblage point matching\".  Even the witches offered sex to people they believed it could help learn sorcery.\n\nI got offered.\n\nSo DeMille used \"common sense\" to prove it?  That you can't sew a talking lizards mouth shut, to get it to stop talking.\n\nJust a tip.  If you run into a talking lizard you can pretty much do whatever you like.\n\nI used to make my ally \"Fancy\" plunge to her death over freeway overpasses.\n\nThe talking lizards were just SKEs. The same old thing.\n\nBoth rituals the same.\n\nNow, what if you didn't have an Ally to help?\n\nThose rituals needed,\n\n1   Ritual\n\n2   Power plant\n\n3  Ally\n\n4  Past latent awareness of those who used this ritual before\n\nWhat if you only had 3?\n\nCould you \"change the balance\"?\n\nNo ally.  That's the one you can leave out.\n\nThen you only have 3, so how do you increase the strength of one of the others?\n\nIt's #4 you can alter.\n\nHave other people in the ceremony.\n\nDo it in a group, around a campfire.\n\nLike the peyote sessions.\n\nIn fact, it's ideal for small groups.\n\nI believe it was Vicente and Juan Tuma who ran that ceremony, but I could be wrong.\n\nIt was a magical ritual that did not need an Ally.\n\nMescalito is NOT an ally as we know them.\n\nDon Juan even said he was a \"something else\".\n\nBut he didn't tell us what!\n\nSo I'm proposing, it's just a Silent Knowledge Entity.\n\nLike God.\n\nThat ritual increases the awareness of organic beings present to help, so that you don't need an Ally.\n\nSummoning a being who is much like \"God\".\n\nThe visual appearance of which is likely not consistent.\n\nBut neither do mystics who visit God see the same thing.\n\nIf that's not convincing, consider that don Juan said the old seers got confused and believed that \"God\" was a protector.\n\nIt was only the new seers who realized, he's just latent awareness.\n\nAnd with billions of people praying to God, that's a LOT of help from organic beings.  To create that 50% real phantom view.  Which by treating it as real, becomes 100% real due to horizontal assemblage point shifting.\n\nIn the case of Mescalito, we just get a campfire worth of people to help.\n\nBut the ritual seems to also include at least 2 real sorcerers.\n\nSo there's no need for any Allies, and Mescalito is just a Silent Knowledge entity.\n\nSame as the talking lizards.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I'll buy someone lizard stew.  They serve that somewhere.\n\nDon't tell Minx.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Truth About Mescalito?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 120, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"joup0eqwlgka1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 93, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa1758eb573b2113655d314c6fdc83d72d958add"}, {"y": 186, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5def2afd6b69751a11b117427641a513332c70cd"}, {"y": 275, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff1aa927218de953948081bc8c024826ecccaddb"}, {"y": 551, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e142308e03c14fc1db500c1992049e35850c21de"}, {"y": 826, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e14070e324920c637764557ca4c1007a9e02273e"}, {"y": 930, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e8a7a2c87fd28e17975ea2a0c958bc1a7383656"}], "s": {"y": 2090, "x": 2427, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=2427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91b049c59bd8e1efe5c4f2e06820dbb1b946560"}, "id": "joup0eqwlgka1"}}, "name": "t3_11c55y1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YY-yDIqzxEjDSE5rjX8xOXuje-8baaGjJE_7NOckF0k.jpg", "edited": 1677423626.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1677385289.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=2427&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c91b049c59bd8e1efe5c4f2e06820dbb1b946560\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/joup0eqwlgka1.png?width=2427&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c91b049c59bd8e1efe5c4f2e06820dbb1b946560&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was practicing darkroom just now, and realized that it&amp;#39;s actually very easy to manifest phantom rooms, phantom walls, and phantom views of alien landscapes.

Using that, they could block bullets with their lightsaber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very much like don Juan&amp;#39;s method of dodging bullets from rifles with telescopic sights?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two second warning?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe we get that too, and could even use it for fighting some day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what about Mescalito?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First let&amp;#39;s talk about &amp;quot;God&amp;quot;.  You can see him, mystics see him, the old seers saw him, but only the new seers kept going back until they figured out, he&amp;#39;s a phantom being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; at all.  That doesn&amp;#39;t mean he can&amp;#39;t respond. And doesn&amp;#39;t give off a feeling of godliness when you are in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, he&amp;#39;s the total of all the awareness of other people who pray to him several times a day.  They&amp;#39;re making their 10% phantom thing, but with their eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With billions of people wishing up the same thing, namely a &amp;quot;protector&amp;quot;.  God is literally available for daily chats if you like to do that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t get to do anything else if you pursue that, so forget that bad idea if it&amp;#39;s echoing in your mind!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see it now.  Your new book.   &amp;quot;How to REALLY know God.   In person!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should hope it turns out to be Morgan Friedman.  Just don&amp;#39;t talk politics with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That book title worked for Patanjali&amp;#39;s bad player translator.  I honestly think that guy is responsible for Gurus who teach &amp;quot;Siddhis&amp;quot;, and that it&amp;#39;s not actually anything they would have thought to charge $3000 for to na\u00efve westerners, if some bad guy hadn&amp;#39;t written that book to cash in on westerners with an obscure indian text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the extent of the Yoga &amp;quot;Siddhi Powers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just crummy green line effects on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So God is out there but he&amp;#39;s an &amp;quot;SKE&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Entity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s talk about Talking Lizards.  And by implication, those mushroom shapes of men you request to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; while using the smoking mixture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are both created by a &amp;quot;ritual&amp;quot;, which means latent awareness has been stored into it through repetition, the ritual was practiced by perhaps hundreds of the old &amp;quot;men of knowledge&amp;quot; over thousands of years, and so what might have originally been only a 10% phantom construct can become 100% real for a lame man of knowledge type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who can&amp;#39;t create 10% anything on his own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by combining those things I listed, can produce a very profitable magical ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d even pay to see talking lizards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen that lizard. Carlos introduced our class to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it didn&amp;#39;t talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it was still the ally. Not the SKE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I have to talk about &amp;quot;only the first four books&amp;quot; types who invade here.  Looking to bully their way to crummy status for fake sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They pick up all sorts of garbage, like the belief that the Devil&amp;#39;s Weed plant contains the Ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shamanistic delusions designed to con other humans into giving them more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or these invaders believe that the mushroom entity is contained in the mushrooms, and doesn&amp;#39;t actually come from the center of the universe as Carlos told us.  Even though don Juan specifically corrected him on that point, and said it was called &amp;quot;Little Smoke&amp;quot; for reasons other than being contained in the smoking mixture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen that entity.  It used to follow Cholita as a little puff of white smoke with bright yellow lines in it.  It would even push on objects for Cholita.  Or make gurgling sounds with water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crummy &amp;quot;first 4 book&amp;quot; people  block out all chances to learn, just to keep their ugly book deal fantasies going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they add confusion to our community so that obvious things like, &amp;quot;Who is Mescalito?&amp;quot; seem impossible for us to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So put that aside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Devil&amp;#39;s Weed plant, or the mushrooms, are only used in those rituals because the Men of Knowledge needed to sell stuff.  They couldn&amp;#39;t expect the customers of their rituals to learn to get silent and move their own assemblage point!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they moved the assemblage points with those power plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they had the ritual.   But also the latent awareness of all those in the past who used this technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have at least 3 of those things going for them, to make their phantom reality of talking lizards or human mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what is the talking lizard anyway?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose we don&amp;#39;t worry about the mushroom shapes of people.   We kind of know those are just presentation methods to show you what you wanted to know about that person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the presentation method for silent knowledge.  The topic is the person in question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just a silent knowledge ritual!   You use the ritual of preparing the smoking mixture to connect you to past events of this same thing, to get the extra boost from both.  The smoking mixture moves the assemblage  point, but then you have an Ally helping out too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re set!  It&amp;#39;s our friend Little Smoke the moth, insuring success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, it&amp;#39;s the same for the talking lizards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are just the same as the mushroom shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you really think don Juan would sew a lizard&amp;#39;s mouth or eyes shut?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was just the Devil&amp;#39;s Weed ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I want to do something physical, he shows up and lets me experiment on him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll sit there and let you do anything you like to him, because that&amp;#39;s what inorganic beings want.  The energy they gain from interacting with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So sorry DeMille.  The first &amp;quot;Carlos Debunker&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if only a skilled surgeon can sew the eyes of a lizard shut!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a &amp;quot;genius&amp;quot; DeMille was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a TALKING lizard!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he complained Carlos didn&amp;#39;t have the skill to sew it&amp;#39;s eyes shut???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scientologist thinking...   I mean, &amp;quot;SCIENCEtology&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And DeMille fell for that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos was a fraud?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s like the Buddhist Tony Lama accusing Carlos of treating women badly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Buddhist, whose church runs most prostitution in many asian countries?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a hint: Sorcerers use sex for &amp;quot;assemblage point matching&amp;quot;.  Even the witches offered sex to people they believed it could help learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got offered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So DeMille used &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; to prove it?  That you can&amp;#39;t sew a talking lizards mouth shut, to get it to stop talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a tip.  If you run into a talking lizard you can pretty much do whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to make my ally &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; plunge to her death over freeway overpasses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The talking lizards were just SKEs. The same old thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both rituals the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, what if you didn&amp;#39;t have an Ally to help?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those rituals needed,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1   Ritual&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2   Power plant&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3  Ally&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4  Past latent awareness of those who used this ritual before&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if you only had 3?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could you &amp;quot;change the balance&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No ally.  That&amp;#39;s the one you can leave out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you only have 3, so how do you increase the strength of one of the others?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s #4 you can alter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have other people in the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do it in a group, around a campfire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the peyote sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s ideal for small groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe it was Vicente and Juan Tuma who ran that ceremony, but I could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a magical ritual that did not need an Ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mescalito is NOT an ally as we know them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan even said he was a &amp;quot;something else&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he didn&amp;#39;t tell us what!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m proposing, it&amp;#39;s just a Silent Knowledge Entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That ritual increases the awareness of organic beings present to help, so that you don&amp;#39;t need an Ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summoning a being who is much like &amp;quot;God&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The visual appearance of which is likely not consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But neither do mystics who visit God see the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;#39;s not convincing, consider that don Juan said the old seers got confused and believed that &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; was a protector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was only the new seers who realized, he&amp;#39;s just latent awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with billions of people praying to God, that&amp;#39;s a LOT of help from organic beings.  To create that 50% real phantom view.  Which by treating it as real, becomes 100% real due to horizontal assemblage point shifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of Mescalito, we just get a campfire worth of people to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the ritual seems to also include at least 2 real sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s no need for any Allies, and Mescalito is just a Silent Knowledge entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as the talking lizards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m wrong, I&amp;#39;ll buy someone lizard stew.  They serve that somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t tell Minx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,

Advanced in here, but maybe even just beginner to a Silvio Manuel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what happened was, I have a fluid assemblage point and a single &amp;quot;idea&amp;quot; from Jadey, caused my assemblage point to shift sideways so far that I ended up stuck in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s sort of the bad effect the &amp;quot;clarification&amp;quot; Carlos put in there, could have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe part of why Carlos told us to stop reading his books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obsessions have physical results in sorcery!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is part of what makes new people in the subreddit so tiring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re a mountain of sorcery obsessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuck with no hope of extricating themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We end up having to do what Carlos did in this case.  Ask them the right question, to activate enough reason in them, to free them from their obsessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, &amp;quot;The 3rd attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common obsession among new people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good cartoon will fix that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_11c55y1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11c55y1/the_truth_about_mescalito/ja75mqw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677492067.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1677492067.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ja516hf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ja4sqnk", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "There's a bunch of structured info in that addendum.

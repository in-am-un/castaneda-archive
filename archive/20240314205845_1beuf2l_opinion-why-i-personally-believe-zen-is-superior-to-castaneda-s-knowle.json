It&amp;#39;s all there for you to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why this is true is also obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything created after money was invented, was only made for stealing money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda&amp;#39;s sorcery is Olmec. From before written languages, before cities, before money, and even before agriculture. It&amp;#39;s Beringian in origin, from 10,000+ years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the members of Carlos&amp;#39; group is already 8000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before money and cities and writing systems, there was no motivation at all to make up stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was also practiced and improved over THOUSANDS of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike delusional Buddhism which claims a single man created it, from what we all know are worn out, make believe Hindu closed eye meditation techniques which produce dismal results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing any Zen person does, that anyone in here would be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s too primitive. And their &amp;quot;higher states&amp;quot; of consciousness don&amp;#39;t even match those of a mediocre witch in a nice soothing bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try actually looking around?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should be warned: mindfulness is the worst thing you can practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a prison to keep you sending cash to some evil Buddhist organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild":

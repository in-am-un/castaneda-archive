Since this, I have traveled The Worlds a multitude of times (especially since the passing of my beloved) and have spent upwards of months within The Worlds. That alone may seem impossible, but believe me, it is just as much real as The World you exist in now. Now let us recall.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[BEGIN RECALL\\]**\n\nHey all,This is another long post, but I\u2019m sure many of you will like it because I tell the story of how I literally \u200b**INSTANTLY** \u200bmanifested my reality.\n\nSome of you may have known my desire to reach the ability Neville had of \u201centering into a world just like this\u201d among his many other mystical experiences.\n\nLast night I told myself to enter into another world by proclaiming to myself: \u201cYou will enter a world that is entirely under your control, and you will stay there until you desire to leave\u201d.\n\nMind you, for the past two weeks or so, I have been trying this but have yet to be successful.\n\nLast night was the first success I had when attempting this and may I tell you, it was literally \u201cout of this world\u201d!\n\nNow, I\u2019ve experienced both astral projection and lucid dreaming. Both were incredibly different from this experience.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever experienced astral projecting, you know that everything is a bit disconnected as in people not being \u201calive.\u201d\n\nNot to mention knowing that you\u2019re astral projecting. The same goes for lucid dreaming. You know you\u2019re dreaming, and you\u2019re also easily awoken.\n\nThis experience was unlike either of them, but more importantly, my experience was exactly as Neville explained his experience.\n\nIt\u2019ll seem completely crazy, and in a sense, it is.\n\nAs a preface, this was all in \u200b**ONE** \u200bnight of \u201cearth time\u201d, last night, the 28th of March.\n\nWhile in this other world, I had experienced it for \u200b**3 DAYS, YES!**\n\nThree freaking days!\n\nAlso as another preface, I have never done any form of \u201cdrugs\u201d (even marijuana) nor have I ever had alcohol, so this wasn\u2019t some intense trip. ***\\*personal note: I still have never used drugs to initiate any of my experiences so I cannot comment on their effectiveness nor possible inhibitions. I do however, believe that we are able to affect change in our body and create the same feelings of euphoria or joy that people typically use recreational drugs to achieve.***\n\nI had been in this world for \u200b**3 ACTUAL DAYS**\u200b, such as I fell asleep in that world and promptly woke up in that same world and it was morning!\n\nNow, this wasn\u2019t like a \u201cWow I am here for 3 days\u201d but instead; I was conscious that **ENTIRE** \u200btime I was in this new world for the full three days (obviously minus the sleeping).\n\nThe way I entered this world was strange, after falling asleep telling myself that I will enter this new world, I woke up normally.\n\nLike the past 2 or so weeks, (exactly, I think I started trying this out on the 15th of this month) I woke up normally and went about my day.\n\nNot until I thought about breakfast did I notice I was in this new world.... that\u2019s how real this was.\n\nUpon leaving my room, I went to the kitchen, only to see a platter of fruit and my favorite Chicago Raw acai bowl on the counter... huh?\n\nWalked back into my room to hug my boyfriend for getting breakfast for me (he had done this before, so I wasn\u2019t completely surprised that breakfast had already been prepared).\n\nHe was still groggy, so I kissed him and thanked him for breakfast... \u201cHuh? babe what do you mean?\u201dI replied: \u201cThe fruit and acai bowl, you didn\u2019t get that?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me like I was crazy and said: \u201cWasn\u2019t me. You just woke me up.\u201d Right then I knew I had done it.\n\nNow I won\u2019t write the entire account of my 3 days in this world, but the entire time everything was so completely real.\n\nEven the people I knew were completely oblivious to the fact the I was dropped off in a Rolls Royce by my new driver.\n\nNow I didn\u2019t go buck wild with creating things since I was a little afraid I would wake up and notice that it was all a dream.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so much me creating things out of thin air, but more me going along my regular day and then decide to leave class in a Bentley until my third day.\n\nI decided to travel to Shanghai.\n\nMy father regularly goes there for business, but I have yet to tag along.\n\nGuys, I don\u2019t know how to explain this in any other way than Neville explained it.\n\nPeople were going along in their regular lives, like each individual person on this Earth! ***\\*personal note: I still don't fully comprehend the reality of this. To the best of my knowledge, every being within The Worlds is a conscious being, yet during my travels through The Worlds, I have gained a new level of control over others (though, not to the same degree within my First World) so I still am confused on the reality of consciousness and how The Worlds come into play regarding the conscious decisions and lives individuals lead.***\n\nThe city was beautiful.\n\nNow, if things weren\u2019t crazy already, they were about to be.\n\nI had never looked at pictures of Shanghai before this, but somehow my mind entirely filled up the city with seemingly accurate detail.\n\nNow, if you astral project or lucid dream, you notice that your mind makes up the locations based off of memory or preconceived ideas.\n\nBut just before I wrote this post, I looked at pictures on google and I am not lying when I say this... it was 1:1.\n\nNow here\u2019s the crazier part:\n\nI was in this building that had like pentagonal shaped windows looking down at the city.As I researched more, I was witnessing in full detail \u200b**AND ACCURACY**\u200b the Shanghai World Financial Center Observation Deck! ***\\*personal note: I've been to Shanghai twice since I experienced this!***\n\nI am still \u200b**COMPLETELY** \u200bblown away as I write this!!!\n\nIsn\u2019t this the most peculiar thing?\n\nI finally left Shanghai on Saturday, my final day in this new world.\n\nIn total, I did this for 3 days and 2 nights and finally decided to go back to \u201cearth\u201d.\n\nSo, I sat down on a park bench in Shanghai, closed my eyes, and imagined myself back into my bed. ***\\*personal note: The only reason I knew to do this is because Neville talked about imagining himself in his bed to leave The World he was in when experiencing the same phenomenon.***\n\nNext thing I know, I wake up at 4:00 in the morning \u200b**TODAY** \u200bnext to my boyfriend!I woke him up and told him to remind me in the morning that \u201cit wasn\u2019t just a dream\u201d.\n\nBeing the good boyfriend that he is, he reluctantly opened the note app on his iPhone and wrote it down.\n\nI kissed him and told him to get some rest (and promise I make it up to him tomorrow lol sorry, naughty, I know).\n\nAdditionally, I opened my dream journal and also wrote down \u201cIt was not just a dream\u201d and headed off to sleep.\n\nNow here I am, 5 hours later typing this up still completely dumbstruck.\n\nIt hadn\u2019t even been a full 7 hours in \u201cearth time\u201d when I had just lived 3 full days in this brand-new world that I had control over. ***\\*personal note: I have now spent upwards of a few months within The Worlds and returned to my First World with little to no difference in time. There have been a few times where I slept an entire 24 hours and I can't account for that day, but nothing more than that.***\n\nNow, unlike Neville, I was unable to stop time or control others, \u200b**BUT**\u200b I was able to close my eyes and \u201csee\u201d a car or what have you and when I opened my eyes, it be right there, as a physical reality.\n\nI have just completely shattered my idea of the world as if Neville hadn\u2019t already done that with the technique I have been using these past few months.I literally don\u2019t even know what to say, how to interpret this, or if I should ever try it again (heaven forbid I get stuck in a world like that and leave my boyfriend and family behind in this one!) ***\\*personal note: I have never been stuck within another World. I have, however, had extreme emotional \"breaks\" within a World that have been hard to recover from.***\n\nIf anyone has had any similar experience to this or any ideas on what the frick this means please tell me!\n\nI can\u2019t even begin to comprehend what this means about this world. Are we just puppets for someone else in the world we are in right now?\n\nAre we all currently in a matrix type world and have the ability to leave this \u201cmain\u201d world and enter our own that we control? ***\\*personal note:  The answer is yes. The World you are currently conscious in is your First World, is OUR First World, The Worlds within Our World contain infinite realities. There are Worlds above ours, but those are for higher purposes, mainly pertaining to The Promise.***\n\nMy mind is operating at a trillion miles a second and I have my stats class at 10:00! Good Lord!  Trying to crunch averaging algorithms after I just experienced this?Yeah right!\n\nI honestly don\u2019t even know what to think anymore lol\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[ORION\\]\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*personal note: Please let me know what you think of these Archived Recalls! I think it would be good to let those who are new read my past experiences and allow those who have read this another chance to. If the majority of people don't like them, I'll only post new content. Like I said, I didn't want to just post my old writings so I thought adding personal notes would add something new instead of just filling up this subreddit with unnecessary posts.

The World you are currently conscious in is your First World, is OUR First World, The Worlds within Our World contain infinite realities. There are Worlds above ours, but those are for higher purposes, mainly pertaining to The Promise.&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mind is operating at a trillion miles a second and I have my stats class at 10:00! Good Lord!  Trying to crunch averaging algorithms after I just experienced this?Yeah right!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly don\u2019t even know what to think anymore lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[ORION]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;personal note: Please let me know what you think of these Archived Recalls! I think it would be good to let those who are new read my past experiences and allow those who have read this another chance to. If the majority of people don&amp;#39;t like them, I&amp;#39;ll only post new content. Like I said, I didn&amp;#39;t want to just post my old writings so I thought adding personal notes would add something new instead of just filling up this subreddit with unnecessary posts. Let me know what you think, please! Much love!&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_3h5d7", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "hwx30o", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OrionDirectorate", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 156, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/hwx30o/orion_archive_personal_notes_i_was_quite/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/hwx30o/orion_archive_personal_notes_i_was_quite/", "subreddit_subscribers": 170190, "created_utc": 1595573589.0, "num_crossposts": 11, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}], "created": 1612538854.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.NevilleGoddard", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/hwx30o/orion_archive_personal_notes_i_was_quite/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ld9i4e", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gnos_Yidari", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_hwx30o", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ld9i4e/orion_archive_personal_notes_i_was_quite/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/hwx30o/orion_archive_personal_notes_i_was_quite/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1612538854.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [], "before": null}}]

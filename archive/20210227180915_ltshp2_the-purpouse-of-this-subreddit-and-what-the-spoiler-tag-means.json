There is an entire sub, &lt;a href=\"/r/LucidDreaming\"&gt;r/LucidDreaming&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to this with thousands of members. We are &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; hostile to dreaming! But overly-obsessing on standard lucid dreaming, or even 4 Gates Dreaming, takes energy away from other efforts. 4 Gates Dreaming (as presented in the book &lt;em&gt;The Art of Dreaming&lt;/em&gt;) should not be a replacement for the more challenging practices, but a companion to them; and it should never be one&amp;#39;s exclusive focus. The acceptable exceptions are when you learn something repeatable or significant to someone other than yourself from your sleeping dreaming, or you reach &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; directly after diligently practicing &lt;em&gt;waking dreaming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited 3/29/2022&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ltshp2/the_purpouse_of_this_subreddit_and_what_the/gp6ipc2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1614526363.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ltshp2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ltshp2", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gpbhu9t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gp8joae", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Are you kidding???\n\nI LOVE to talk about Cholita.

Carlos gave it to her, as a joke.  \n\nIt's like saying she's a \"mini-me\" to a real powerful woman.  A very long time, actual friend of Carlos.\n\nI asked her if she wanted me to use her real name, and she said, \"NO!!!\".\n\nThen later, \"Who cares???\"\n\nBut, she could be put into danger if too much info about her got out.  Crazy men are common in the Castaneda community.\n\nThere's a \"Cholita\" link in the wiki.  With Cholita stories.\n\nI try to give her equal time, because it's just her and me left from private classes. Everyone else is gone.\n\nAnd she's too crazy to post in here on her own. So I try to add her into each post I make.\n\nPlus, she's amusing!  She's working on a \"butter spell\" against me. I still don't know what happens at the end of the spell. Or even if it really was a spell, or just looked like other spells she's used.\n\nBut it's never good for me either way.  Her dreaming double is even aware of it this time.

I suggested she could call him \"Carlos\" like I did, and she became angry.\n\nBut the impeccability thing did in fact work for Cholita.  The behavior modifications were just what she needed.\n\nMaybe those are mostly for women, and not as much for the pathetic men who crave attention and can easily misuse \"impeccable warrior\" to their own harm?\n\nOn being impeccable, the women behave better.

I only realize how short she is, when she's up on a barstool.  Which is not often enough for my taste.\n\nIn her youth, she was so beautiful that she could find a man to take her in and keep her, in 10 minutes while visiting any large city.\n\nCarlos took her, and had her cut her hair very short in order to \"de-claw\" her.  He made her stop smoking too.  Cholita was a bit of a party girl, south American style.\n\nHe seems to have set up business enterprises Cholita could not resist, and then got her employment in one of them.\n\nBut he kept his hands off her.  He once told Cholita, \"I will be intimate with you one way or the other.\"\n\nAnd then, he didn't touch her.  Cholita was obviously disappointed.  She was used to taking men away from the other women around her.\n\nThe shape of her ears is not a positive up north, so removing the hair took her down a notch.  She has \"Buddha\" big ears, which indicate wealth and luck. An Olmec trait.\n\nCholita said she was amazed at how well cutting her hair worked.  Instantly, no men were whistling as she walked down the street.\n\nHer father was pure blood Olmec Indian, the source of our sorcery.  Her mother, 100% Spanish.

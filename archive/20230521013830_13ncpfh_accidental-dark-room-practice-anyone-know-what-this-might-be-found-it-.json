When I open mine there was a sort of black velvet section on the left of the room and what looked like a huge being, like a big Pok\u00e9mon I can't think of it's name.\n\nThere was a small pinhole of a light coming out of a power strip that the TV was plugged into. It looked blue when you looked at it but shined ectoplasm green on the ceiling in an egg shape. When I closed and opened my eyes again it wad projected on the wall. But then quickly went back to ceiling.

It showed this guy walking down a small group of steps and fall flat on his back, then disintegrated into a mucky substance. And then one soul went out of him going left and several, like ten, souls went out of him going right. Then the video panned around the area.bit looked like a park or something.\n\nDuring this time I tried to wake my bf up but he wouldn't. When it was over he finally got up. I told him what happened and we fooled around(were really hot for each other, like 24/7). Anyway, the women room filled up with green fog. Then we both fell back asleep. Me, with the covers over my head woke up, some time later, to a bright uv type purple light penetrating my cover.\n\nI tried to wake him up repeatedly but no luck. I look out and the lights projected on the wall again, and there another video playing. This time with a coven of witches. In the shot there's a bed levitating and someone sleeping in the bed. I'm trying desperately to wake him, but he won't wake up. And as I'm watching I realize that they are now starting to watch me too. I had this feeling like oh shot they're gonna do somethingTheyre gonna come here. \n\nAnd the video stopped, light went back on ceiling. Then to my left, black shadows started billowing into the room. They had very pointed features like almost cat like pointy ears. A whole bunch of them piled in, like maybe 8-10. I tried to focus on my energy protecting the whole bed and got it going as big as I could and then kind of exploded it out towards them and they turned to a weird dust mist that fell to the floor.\n\nThen he finally woke up. I told him about what happened, we did it again and then I was just laying in bed staring at the ceiling. All of a sudden the stucco started clumping together. And I was like wtf. I looked away like thinking ok enough. But when I looked back it was right where it left off waiting for me. And the stucco clumped together jnto the shape of several circles of women all waving and looking very inviting, like were cool...

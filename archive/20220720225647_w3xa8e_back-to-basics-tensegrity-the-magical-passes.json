That's not the only pass that strengthens the cloak of confidence, but it certainly directly works on the cloak of confidence!\n\nTensegrity/Magical Passes provide the most benefit when practiced every day, using the visual feedback dark room provides!\n\nPlease feel free to discuss the Tensegrity you practice below!\n\nGood-Bye\n\n[A Gift to You from Silence](https://preview.redd.it/r1zikjcgesc91.jpg?width=4406&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b72f91fafde678adfd2f555aaba25f9b6f38bf31)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Back to Basics - Tensegrity &amp;

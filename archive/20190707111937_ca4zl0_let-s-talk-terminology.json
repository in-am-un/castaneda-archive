While projecting, are you in \"second attention\", or \"heightened awareness\"? Did you \"stop the world\"? Also, is this \"dreaming\"? Are you using your \"double\" while you're projecting?\n\n2. Same goes for **non-breakthrough psilocybin mushroom trip**. *Non-breakthrough* in the sense that you're still, perceptually, anchored in your physical body, but your perception is dramatically altered.  You're seeing surfaces breathe, you're seeing energy, lights, perhaps even some beings (inorganics?) darting around.\n\n   Again: Did your assemblage point move? While tripping, are you in \"second attention\", or \"heightened awareness\"? Did the event of \"stopping the world\" take place?\n\n3. Let's do it one more time, with a **break-through DMT trip** (you could get there with psilocybin as well, if you can tolerate eating a heck of a lot of mushrooms). *Break-through* meaning, you are not perceptually anchored in your physical body. You are in a different place, a different reality, or perhaps even experiencing a completely different mode of perception - that is, something other than 3 spatial dimensions + time.

The first time, you\u2019ll be floating or suspended somewhere for a while before you even notice it.  When you do, what you see can vary.  Sometimes I find myself in the yellow sand dune place Carlos mentioned often.  It\u2019s like a waiting room for other worlds.  I LOVE that place.

I\u2019ve perceived both at the same time, and still wouldn\u2019t call the second \u201cme\u201d a double.\n\nPlus (as we all know), people exaggerate astral travel a whole bunch.

And you\u2019ll possibly be cursed with abstract dreaming instead of gazing normally at colors in the darkness.  Abstract dreaming can be depressing.

For something like Kratom or Betel Nuts, both farmer\u2019s drugs, there may be no intoxicant load.  Just let it wear off.   But not good for your teeth.  For nicotene:  we went to the moon on nicotene.  Keep that in mind.\n\nHypnogogic images from any intoxicant are just a distraction. I wouldn\u2019t pursue those.

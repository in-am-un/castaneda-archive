They'll just become grumpy and dull?\n\nCholita and her double, are entirely different beings.  Her double is wonderful. Cholita is...\n\nCholita. I still can't believe someone has taken her in for a full 6 weeks now.   I would have given it 1 week, tops.\n\nDid don Juan take all of Carol Tiggs, or only her double?  \n\nSince Carlos interreacted with her only in HA, taking the double would be the same as taking all of Carol Tiggs, as far as Carlos was concerned.\n\nDo the sorcerers who turn themselves into trees, do that so they can go live in the IOB world?\n\nAnd that's how they \"protect\" the flesh.

But only the story towards the end, as I recall. If anyone saw that in stuff earlier than 96, I'd love to hear it.\n\nBut what does it mean???\n\nHow can we have existed far before birth, then got trapped here to be born, when we might have been able to get trapped somewhere else?\n\nHow did our being becoming trapped, cause the mom to conceive, if the mom and dad are the ones who \"bestow\" awareness.\n\nWe just don't know...\n\nWhen a Nagual, \"burns from within\", body and all, why would the lesser members of his party even be able to do that?\n\nIf Carlos had burned from within, who would expect Bruce to be able to do that, seeing as how Bruce admitted he couldn't manage any *dreaming*?\n\nBut we do know, once born you have to die.

As long as we keep drifting, we're \"free\".\n\nBut if we sprout in the soil, we have to die.\n\nWe're not probes!  We're seeds.\n\nAnyway, the story of the priest who got kidnapped by the fairies, in a tunnel of all places, is consistent with what we know about IOBs.\n\nHe warns them he's going to manage to escape and will seem to rise from the dead.\n\nI'm not sure why, but it happens on the day he's to be buried, and people can view his body.\n\nMaybe he could sense his body was on display, and being a sorcerer, could manage to return for an instant, as long as they didn't let the IOBs come after him again.\n\nHe told them they have to throw a blanket over him, to protect him from the fairies taking him back.\n\nHe rises up, but everyone is so surprised no one tosses a blanket over him.\n\nSo he drops dead again.\n\nThe time period for that story always made me wonder if that wasn't a crummy lineage, in Ireland.  \n\nI believe you can align it to Sebastian relatively closely.\n\nThey had a lot of actual magic there in Ireland, which was based on *seeing*.  They called it, \"the second sight\".\n\nAnd as you might expect, there were more women who could *see*, than men.\n\nIf you didn't have formal training available, that seems logical.\n\nWomen can learn magic just by finding out it's possible.  They sort of  have no choice. \n\nIt's their period.  Their assemblage points shift sideways, and women try to figure out how to sooth themselves.\n\nWhich means, they learn how to move their assemblage points!\n\nIf while doing that they're aware of \"the second sight\",  they might associate it with visons, which is correct, and learn to get more, without needing their period.\n\nA woman could easily learn to do that, all by herself.\n\nShe wouldn't understand what was going on, but that's an advantage.\n\nThe understanding you'd get from Buddhism, Hinduism, or Daoism, would cripple her and keep her from learning.\n\nSo women will always learn some \"real\" magic, even if it's misunderstood.\n\nMen have to be beaten night and day to get them to give up their greed, and work hard.  \n\nSo typically they go for the phony kind, and try to bully anyone who points out they are faking it.\n\nWe've seen that in here...", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hk0dgj6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the book which has the story of the Catholic priest kidnapped by inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Might have been Protestant since the story seems to be in Ireland or Scotland.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They take only his double, because his body is still around to be buried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is consistent with what we know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone keep in mind, we still don&amp;#39;t know why sorcerers bury themselves, or even why don Juan told Carlos not to ever reveal where a sorcerer is buried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do they bury themselves so they can go live in the IOB world, and for whatever reason need to do something about the organic material they picked up while here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does their tonal keep going in the flesh, while their double is &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, even if someone is kidnapped, maybe their friends won&amp;#39;t know it.

They called it, &amp;quot;the second sight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as you might expect, there were more women who could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, than men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t have formal training available, that seems logical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women can learn magic just by finding out it&amp;#39;s possible.  They sort of  have no choice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s their period.  Their assemblage points shift sideways, and women try to figure out how to sooth themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, they learn how to move their assemblage points!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If while doing that they&amp;#39;re aware of &amp;quot;the second sight&amp;quot;,  they might associate it with visons, which is correct, and learn to get more, without needing their period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman could easily learn to do that, all by herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wouldn&amp;#39;t understand what was going on, but that&amp;#39;s an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The understanding you&amp;#39;d get from Buddhism, Hinduism, or Daoism, would cripple her and keep her from learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So women will always learn some &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; magic, even if it&amp;#39;s misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men have to be beaten night and day to get them to give up their greed, and work hard.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So typically they go for the phony kind, and try to bully anyone who points out they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve seen that in here...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qqg0o5/fairies_werent_always_cute_they_used_to_drink/hk0dgj6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1636506227.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_qqg0o5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_qqg0o5", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hk0bive", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_qqg0o5", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "If anyone has ever researched or heard tales about the fae they would know this to be most definitly true, the vast majority of faefolk arent the hollywood-ized version you commonly see.

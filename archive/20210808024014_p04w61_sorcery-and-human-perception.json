you something specifically or they don't get credit, here's a \"rule\" anyone can use, and not be criticized.\n\nI'm sure Carlos would not like it much, but he would understand how tricky discussing that topic can be.\n\nFor example, I just saw a series of floating windows with possible outcomes in them.   Meaning, when I glanced at one, it was almost like a monitor floating by, and I could see a scene, and I thought, \"yea that could happen too\".\n\nOne was Juan's diagram, which I didn't even know existed, not having gone to look in here.  But now I see it does exist.\n\nLike Dr. Strange I suppose, although I didn't realize what I was looking at, while it was happening.\n\nI suppose I was seeing the \"intent\" of what we are trying to do. And it's possible directions.  Like skimming time perhaps, the way you can skim emanations to see phantom realities.\n\nThat's actually where the Emissary likes to teach.  In the realm of skimmed realities at multi-level times.\n\nWhere she can simply enhance some emanations you have inside, and make you \"notice\" some fact about sorcery, in the flow of cool things to look at.\n\nIt's nice when she talks but even when she doesn't, you learn a heck of a lot more when her little head is floating nearby, watching.\n\nAnd, for her to be real looking and solid, and speak out loud, is dreaming stuff.  That's dreaming scout level.  Not middle of the cheese slice.\n\nAnd we're awake in the darkroom, where we hover in the middle naturally. If we don't, we'll lose lucidity, even though we are not asleep.  Far lateral shifts cause lucidity issues.  Probably because the cheese slice adjacent to our band, is not perfectly compatible with being human. And its emanations pull on us, when we get closer to that side,\n\nSo it takes a deep lateral shift for our emissary to please us that way, and it's not only a waste of energy for both parties, but it makes vertical movement sluggish.  Lateral shifts come at a price for beginners like us.\n\nBut if you want to get an IOB face to show up as early as possible, especially on the green line, you need to \"look for them\" on the puffs. That sets up the intent, and then believing they ride on the puffs like an amusement park rid, causes the horizontal shift.\n\nSometimes the emissary's teaching requires red zone and orange zone to both be visible.  So she can't afford to make it too hard to move up and down, by moving us sideways more than a bit.\n\nSeems unrelated, but it's not.  Carlos had to plan that out when designing long forms.  Probably wasn't too hard for him, but tensegrity does cause lateral movements as you do it.  Those make it more vivid once you can see the energy visibly.\n\nSo here's the rule you can use, and blame it on me if a more a powerful sorcerer comes along to criticize us.  If Silvio materializes and starts criticizing you, send him to me.  (Please!)\n\nIf you could see your ally in any form, even a mostly transparent tiny head, and it's been less than 10 minutes, she gets credit for any \"revelations\".  I suppose it's like rolling enough 7s in dice game to hit the jackpot.  If your ally is standing next to you in a prom dress, she deserves credit even if she didn't roll the dice.  She sort of blew on them the first time you saw her around.\n\nIf she hasn't been visible for longer than 10 minutes, you have to look at whether the new realization is connected to something else she properly gets credit for in prior sessions.  It's now her \"topic\", and if she's been around at all that night, she gets credit for more information about that topic.\n\nI guarantee you, the account Carlos gave of her teaching too fast, and him wanting to make notes, didn't have her talking the whole time.  He just didn't think it was useful to try to explain that, since none of us could even perceive an emissary yet.\n\nThat would be like warning a little kid that ice cream cones have their potential worries and dangers.\n\nBefore it ever tried one.", "edited": 1628434580.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h85etvt", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for whether the dreaming emissary needs to speak out loud, or even tell you something specifically or they don&amp;#39;t get credit, here&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; anyone can use, and not be criticized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure Carlos would not like it much, but he would understand how tricky discussing that topic can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I just saw a series of floating windows with possible outcomes in them.

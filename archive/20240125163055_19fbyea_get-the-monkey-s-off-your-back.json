This sort of thing is all throughout the books. It's just been sanitized.\n\nI was offered to be Florinda's lover, when they were about to ditch Cleargreen on the death of Carlos.\n\nSame thing I suspect.\n\nThe private class was told to \"walk to San Diego\".  Right after that very class!  We later found out, even waiting until the next day was too late.  But it was 110 miles, and no one was prepared to do that.\n\nBy the way, 4 women were willing, once I held up my charge card.\n\nBut couldn't because their \"lover\" would throw them out into the street if they disappeared that long.\n\nYou have to understand, that the blue line on that J curve diagram is holding us PRISONER.\n\nIt's every single thought you have in words, and every fantasy.  Those are the prison keepers.\n\nThinking those are \"private\" and can't matter, is a complete misunderstanding of reality.\n\nWhich won't be corrected for you, until you completely remove that internal dialogue, then use Tensegrity to lure your double out (it likes that sort of thing), coax it to surround your torso with a fully visible intense blue ball of light, and then finally manage to guide your assemblage point into alignment with that of your \"double\".\n\nWiggling on that spot with your fingers can help, and it's FULLY that visible. I don't exaggerate in my pictures, other than to show a \"good day\" most of the time.\n\nCarlos preferred the \"bad days\" somewhat, saying it was a waste to insist things had to be so \"concrete\".\n\nYou'll understand that in silent knowledge!\n\nMyself, I fully agree with the old seers that concreteness is super cool!\n\nI even practiced making sleeping dreams fully concrete, for hours last night, using the \"twin positions\".\n\nSo you get to do that too, but later on.  Only silent knowledge can get you past the 3rd gate! You use it for entry to sleeping dreams, but directly from awake. And then lay down in the same position you used on the bed, when you summoned silent knowledge to give you passage into the sleeping dreaming realm.  you only go to sleep, inside the dream.\n\nThat produces stunning \"concreteness\".  You can stay in those dreams for weeks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7854gjsslec1.png?width=3475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f219ec22aae59f2838e0485a0887e25b26ca456b\n\nOnce you get your \"physical body\" assemblage point into alignment with that blue ball of energy you build (restore) using Tensegrity, it will allow you to \"shrink the tonal\" and go off in it.\n\nIt's the sorcerer's jet plane according to don Juan!  You could instantly travel to Japan if you had a reason.\n\nBut more likely is that you'll shapeshift in it, walk through a wall, leap into outer space, or get a visit from unknown humans from the distant past, who can reach through time if they notice another seer has become active.\n\nWe're quite rare!\n\nBut the pull of that fantasy and grief filled blue line, your normal world, REQUIRES your assemblage point to remain up there on your shoulder blades. Or else it makes no sense what you are fantasizing.\n\nSo even a tiny fantasy will prevent magic because it pulls your assemblage point back to it's normal \"magic free\" location.\n\nBut you can overcome that.  That's the \"work like a dog\" part. The good news is, you'll quickly understand where you are going wrong.  There's no mysteries in sorcery.\n\nYou clearly know what you have to do. And if you do it, you inherit ALL THE ANSWERS.\n\nEverything every sorcerer ever discovered, will be there floating in the air for you to find.\n\nDon Juan suggested that Carlos ought to \"read\" it, instead of viewing videos in the air.\n\nBut in our case, why fantasize about what part of the huge Las Vegas All you can eat buffet you're going to try first?\n\nIt's pointless.\n\nYes, I'm partial to those little cakes...\n\nBut wait till you get there before you start planning how much fun it will be.\n\nAnd once you do, you'll get daily lectures on why you can't bring your friends along.\n\nIn detail!  I get amazing lectures on why it's so hard for people in this subreddit.\n\nThe latest is that they just don't try.\n\nThey make minimum effort, thinking if it works at all, then a minimum effort ought to work enough for them to prove to themselves it's worth it, at which time they'll REALLY get to work.\n\nSo, they never learn.\n\nSorcery isn't house painting.\n\nYou can't try painting one wall, to see how you'll like it.\n\nIt's magic.\n\nUnless you make a huge effort, you'll never escape the ordinary swamp we were born into.\n\nThus in the lineages, people were asked to do something big to prove they were serious.\n\nCarlos called it \"Jumping\".\n\nBut sex?...\n\nYuck.  I'll let you guys wallow in that.\n\nYour big effort should be to pick one of the \"complete paths\" discussed in this subreddit, and REALLY do it.\n\nI don't want to criticize this too much, because we don't really know how many \"paths\" are possible.\n\nWe know what's in the books.\n\nBut not whether someone will discover an easier one somewhat based on the harder ones.\n\nStill, if you make a crappy effort I'm pretty certain it won't be enough to see anything that motivates you to go on.\n\nI won't name names.  You know who you are!\n\nMeanwhile, please don't POISON yourself with anything outside this system.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing that's going to help you, coming from the usual garbage dumps.\n\nYour \"Yogi wisdom\" is worse than nothing. It's actually very harmful. Fatal even.\n\nJust look at Yogis!\n\nIt's so obvious.\n\nUnless your real goal is your own little throne to sit on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Get The Monkey's Off Your Back!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"31ibpkjvrlec1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d66dd9b471186ee6549a216f39a3fb1ad2d8c22"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cb321d580748de2214f905fec93cf157bf85f7b"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cbfb4fd37e5aab7c29c022eb9db2c76a34490dc"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8060428dee07735250f234310e4018b7b9d7157b"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecb8ed18e67719a172321deefc7dcee1ac9ef945"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87af23abad1b9015014eb4c9aa205a5474956f39"}], "s": {"y": 3592, "x": 3592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da11f15b95d761fd6e1039944d187e0209ffed7d"}, "id": "31ibpkjvrlec1"}, "g7854gjsslec1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 48, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g7854gjsslec1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=607f4b6a0c39fdd7d086ddff9e7a4bc6381dd92f"}, {"y": 96, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g7854gjsslec1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bba8888513132bc1c2b043235da956f7125f2531"}, {"y": 143, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g7854gjsslec1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd3a8f83ea973bf5fb64c12f33276afb14a7f4ce"}, {"y": 286, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g7854gjsslec1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9268548455360151983e16f9abcc0e611370afd2"}, {"y": 429, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g7854gjsslec1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c51cb0f03171a13f591faac4023f7768a7422c57"}, {"y": 482, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g7854gjsslec1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a3fe7380e3f9c4262e6d85da0c0aebfcf72798a"}], "s": {"y": 1553, "x": 3475, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g7854gjsslec1.png?width=3475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f219ec22aae59f2838e0485a0887e25b26ca456b"}, "id": "g7854gjsslec1"}}, "name": "t3_19fbyea", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 31, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/lp5l_04A2zIkHusLupBxELKU-cTNf-ZRm3iU_UpmJ_c.jpg", "edited": 1706201698.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1706196655.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=da11f15b95d761fd6e1039944d187e0209ffed7d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/31ibpkjvrlec1.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=da11f15b95d761fd6e1039944d187e0209ffed7d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you really want to learn sorcery, you MUST &amp;quot;make a real effort&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, it&amp;#39;s how &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll give some HORRIBLE examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tony Karim, if he wanted to learn, had to have sex with Carol Tiggs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shocked?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;#39;t be.

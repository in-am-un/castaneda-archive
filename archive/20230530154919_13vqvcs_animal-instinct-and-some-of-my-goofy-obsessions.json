And this dog goes FERAL. I'll feel it very uncomfortably in my body, like my body is being warped and contained and just like disguised by shit and nonsense. And this dog HATES it. \n\nLast night our goats were having babies, and we were all around their pen. The family was eventually leaving the pen, and I was like \"I'm gonna hang out with bunker\" (the dog) after looking in his eyes and just simply wanting to. I go in there as they go out, and me and him have a \"moment\". Really feeling each other and what was like being very tender and loving. He put his paw gently on me and we put our heads together and just like explored a connection or something. It felt like a waterfall between us. Like rain or like seeing each other. The family was watching us heartfelt, and I could feel the barrier in that kind of behavior being focused on and intended towards. It was like \"he can have this, but not forever, it's not always this good\" or \"they're just cuddling a little bit, it's just the visual\" or something like that. Like I was being focused on in an extraordinary way when that behavior should just be normal, or that the meaning in the energy exchange should have been felt by them more???.. They took a picture of us and pointed it out \"look at thaaaat\", and I was holding onto the consideration of both realities. Like I can sit here and love this dog how I want to love everything, but only momentarily, because it'll change things too quickly, it'll make them feel things that are just too much. I can't really dance and live with this dog because it'll be utterly shocking how we can relate. How I can relate even to a fucking chicken. But all I want is to be able to sit here and live those feelings. To just let the feelings and sense of desired connections guide me and to have miraculous things between me and the animals and hopefully the people. \n\nI can just feel a good feeling towards an animal, something like love or the exploration of something more meaningful and creative, which coincides with the arrival of things that feel utterly right within me, and their entire behavior towards me immediately shifts. The same thing happens with people, it's just that a whole bunch of shitty drama comes with it. It's fucking extremely sad. It reminds me of the end of the third book. I had to go cry in the forest for hours after Carlos committed to not wanting to know about Don Juan while they were talking about Don Janero. To somehow want to control reality. To limit its uptake. To not be aware of both of them at once or something. Put beautiful Don Juan in the mentor box. It hurts so fucking bad. It's like the reality of me and everyone Is constantly being turned into shadows and amnesia and unbelievable weights of lies and misapplied focus. Our own stories rather than all of them intermingling exactly how they would naturally. I keep feeling a world where people don't have to control things and just lived like reality, lived naturally but I have no fucking idea how that will work when our minds are so thouroughly disguised and jumbled up, and hate and unevenness is so thouroughly explored. Fear of death and being an outcast is given so credende. And other very very bad realities I can't even describe because I don't have words. Something like people making themselves prostitutes. Sacrificing themselves in horribly stupid ways. Being afraid of the most beautiful and loving things it Inspires this sad and loving force in me that I can't control and that I'm afraid is going to hurt people by wanting to shift things towards that so incredibly quickly. Like if I showed people magic they would die, or something else I'm utterly afraid of. Maybe they'll immediately fear and try to kill me or worship me or hate themselves or what, idk.\n\nI just can't keep doing it. I've seen it and wanted it so many times that it feels like I can't breath when I'm only thinking and operating as expexted. It feels like a dense blackness wrapping my life and separating me from reality. Not moving. Just being my stupid fucking personality. It absolutely fucking blows. And there is this mental pain associated with me somehow lying or controlling and it feels like being killed or somehow shut off. Not being able to move right.. Fuck no it sucks. I get scared at night because I don't feel like I have control over my energy field when I'm believing many of the things I find myself believing. Like anything at all will take me out of it, all I have to do is doubt or fear and then my brain will shut me out or some shit. It's like being killed in a way or not allowed to exist more likely. Affects what my awareness is aware of. Idk.... \n\nDo yall have hope we can do something like restore the glowing coat around a significant chunk of the population? Where we can look in each other's eyes and really see what's there? Reliably? Have our own space where magic is reliable and we can just be? Live adventurously and magically and that be a thing in the world that is witnessed and given the Reverence it truly deserves in this western society? People will have to come to themselves so many times and there's so much confusion and pain and very very weird conclusions and behaviors. And it's SO BELIEVABLE. So many times I forget that I'm even capable of moving with the things around me and feeling the life in them. I lie about that and what's in its place is a lie anyway. And I'm left with vague nothing. Massive gaps in me deeply experiencing anything at all. Very soon I think I'm just going to be tested and something extremely real will bring the totality of me to bare. I just really hope I don't die.\n\nAm I just indulging in these hopes and dreams, and whatever possibility I'm latching onto? I want to live in that kind of world without being afraid of hateful and confused people. It weirds me out so bad when I'm not thinking like they are. And it's like I absolutely cannot do both at the same time. One is innocent and true and God awfully impactful and the other is fucking nothing. Just random \"this is how it is\" kinda whateverness. I wish all of our totals were more real and close. This human journey is constantly being shit all over. \n\nJust venting I guess. Idk who else to talk like this with. The level of energy and awareness in most conversations is very surface level and in the mind and its so utterly unreliable for what I care about. But occasionally I see a person's deeper meaning and its always so damn beautiful. I want to stay there and take action from there. But again, it's like climbing a 100 foot wall and jumping off into something utterly unknown. I don't even know whats going to happen in the next moment. I don't want to die and I definitely don't want to kill anybody or ruin things in this regard. I absolutely despise when I hate. It's like the most unfair and bullshit thing ever. I want to be powerful without controlling things and without hurting things. But then I'm deathly afraid of losing it. More afraid of that than remaining depressed and just dying stupidly one day.

Instead of only in private chat.\n\nA few years back, I came home to find a baby blue Jay trapped in our fire place.\n\nCholita likes to use it for spells.\n\nLast time I checked, she had a picture of me at the bottom of the ashes in there.\n\nFrom when I was in elementary school. She found in the house while throwing out all of my belongings without permission.    And used that picture as a backup plan, in case she needed to curse me in a hurry.\n\nHer curses work!  I suppose it's like don Juan telling Carlos he should intend the basement to be flooded, in his apartment in Arizona. Where I presume he was playing Joe Cordoba.  Is that the right name?  And was it Arizona?\n\nIt's in the notes and lectures.\n\nHe was the  fry cook expert on eggs!  Bragged about it in private classes a couple of times, saying,  \"I ***KNOW*** eggs.\"\n\nMaking fun of Zen I suspect.  Zen people often like to brag about flipping hamburgers while enlightened.\n\nI'm not sure why... But maybe that's the best they can come up with for \"magic\".\n\nSo Cholita had me ready to burn in case of emergency, but there it sat for what might be 2 years now, untouched.\n\nAnd I came home one day to find a baby blue Jay trapped in there.\n\nBy the steel covering to catch sparks and such when you had a fire in there.\n\nI took it off, but the blue Jay was terrified, and wouldn't fly out the side door into Cholita's garden.\n\nI literally had to chase it and force it to go out there.\n\nI saw that blue jay a few weeks later, up on the power lines looking down at me.  It swooped towards me, as if to say thank you.\n\nBut then last week, or maybe 2 weeks ago, I came home to find it fully grown, and up on the street light shouting at me.\n\nWhistling, but it was an urgent sound.  It repeated it over and over, looking down at me.\n\nI asked it if it was in a fight with Cholita again, and it glanced back at the house.\n\nIt had good reason to worry.  Cholita put a curse on the neighbor's tom cat, because it kept fighting with her.  On purpose!  I even saw it behind Cholita's back one time, looking at me like, \"Are you going to rat on me or not?\"\n\nAnd then it sprayed her luggage.\n\nWhile Cholita was right there, but looking in the wrong direction.\n\nAnd later on, sure enough a huge truck came speeding around the corner, a very unusual thing in our quiet neighborhood, and hit the cat right in the middle. It flew 50 feet, and tumbled several times, finally landing almost precisely in the middle of the road as the neighbors watched in horror.\n\nI just missed it apparently, because when I got home it was still in the street, and the neighbors were deciding if it was ok to move it.  They didn't own it.\n\nI asked what happened, and apparently it was so HORRIBLE they couldn't help but laugh a bit.\n\nSo Cholita is not all that good if you're wildlife in the neighborhood.\n\nI've found 2 petrified sparrows in the yard.  Never saw one of those before Cholita came to live with me.  How does a sparrow even petrify in the first place?  It was practically like a fake stuffed sparrow.\n\nOne of them was on display in our large fountain, positioned so that it span around and around. Possibly as a warning to other birds to keep away.\n\nI took it out, to see how wet it was.\n\nPerfectly dry.  Despite being in the water, at least as long as it took me to discover it.\n\nSo when I got into the living room and found Cholita in her side yard,  after encountering the same blue jay on the street light, trying to warn people, I called out to ask Cholita why the Blue Jay was so alarmed?\n\nCholita pretended not to know what I was talking about.\n\nThen  yesterday I came home, not more than a week after it sounded the alarm, and found it dead right near our front door, on the grass.\n\nSomething had ripped a wing off.  Didn't seem to be any other injuries, but the wing was ripped off at the shoulder.  So it must have bled to death or died of shock.\n\nJust thought I'd share that, so it's not lost.\n\nAnd also because I'm recreating something Cholita did years ago, just to test out more animation functions I don't understand well yet.\n\nHere's a still from the unfinished video.\n\nCholita was obsessed with suicide for a month or two, and her double would visit me to act out what she was thinking about.\n\nThe day after this, she made sure I saw pictures like that on her cellphone.  She was reenacting one of them with that pose.\n\nOtherwise, I suppose despite it clearly being Cholita's double, as visible as that in my darkroom, I would have doubted it.\n\nExcept, the next day she let me see her photos of dead people.\n\nAnd I hadn't mentioned her visiting with a hooded Zombie the night before.\n\nTurns out, hooded zombies are only $3.50 on CGTrader.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5xwmuzn333b1.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6372440503b370f52610fe7abb8a6423e6a0d584\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I posted this, I went for a walk outside.\n\nBut I couldn't open the door.\n\nThere was a bird perched on the handle, frantically trying to get inside.\n\nThe receptionist was alarmed, and jumped up to see why the poor bird was trying to get inside our door.\n\nI asked it what it wanted, from the other side of the glass.\n\nAnd it flew away.\n\nWe went outside to see where it had gone, and it was violently swooping outside our door back and forth, finally landing on a tree far away.\n\nI work with Asians.\n\nSo the explanation they came up with was, \"Must be bird flu!\"\n\nThey were worried about another plague coming.", "edited": 1685487697.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jm9etrq", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;#39;ll put a Cholita story here.

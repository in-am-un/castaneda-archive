I just work here.  You get what you get.\n\nSo I found that Olmec statue to justify what I saw.\n\nThere's a several week old lesson from Lily on how they manifest.\n\nBut it was at the FAR orange zone.  Very far.\n\nIn that range, they can barely show up.  Because you \"see through them\".\n\nStill, she managed to demonstrate, with explanation too.\n\nThey're like a cloud of awareness.\n\nThey \"push\" on the emanations you are facing.\n\nIt makes a ripple.\n\nIntent has to \"reskim\" that.\n\nSo they get added to your view.\n\nWhat they look like, is your fault.\n\nMostly...\n\nBut certainly not entirely, or I wouldn't be able to draw it and post on Facebook. I'd get banned.\n\nIt would look like, \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\".\n\nWithout the men.\n\nHere's a question:  What do you do if a black hole forms in your room, and it's sucking up a cloud of brilliant blue gnats, who just happened to decide to swarm there in the middle of the night?\n\nDo you leap into the hole?\n\nI was gazing into it for a long time, wondering what to do.  Several minutes, which is indeed a long time for something that vivid.\n\nAnd I even became curious, could this be from doing 3 times as much \"sunlight glitter\" during the days?\n\nDoes that charge you up enough to have that much effect?\n\nThe spinning black hole, which was actually blue, sparkled with sunlight glitter.\n\nIt seemed to be saying, \"yes\".\n\nBut in fact, gazing at it just because it was vivid was  a mistake.\n\nI burned off my dreaming energy.\n\nI got a little feeling of disappointment from an inorganic being to my right.  Could have been Lily.  When she showed me the entrance to the world of the Brujos,  *seen* as an amusement park entrance, she warned me not to look at things like that for more than a glance.\n\nAnd avoid the clowns, as I recall.\n\nI had to lay down after that.  I don't like to run out of energy 100%, because if you lay on your side and still have 10%, it goes very far.\n\nI was still awake, laying on my side, hoping to recharge.\n\nSuddenly I was standing in an office.  It looked like the owner was either a fan of Zen, or Ikea.\n\nFancy was there.  She grinned so I'd \"know\" it was  her.\n\nI can't explain how a simple grin caused me to know it was her.\n\nBut I even exclaimed, \"Fancy!  I haven't seen you looking this real for a long time.\"\n\nShe said, \"I've wanted to do this for a long time, just like you.\"\n\nShe reached out, put a hand on either side of my head, and pulled my face to within 3 inches of hers.\n\nFortunately, that's all I'd wanted.\n\nThey don't seem to have any motivations of  their own.

It&amp;#39;s the supernatural, for real!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;#39;t want to see that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s the rule.  The first enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also show up on &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; when turning it into a portal. I suppose that&amp;#39;s hard enough for them, that you can see past the illusion and at the real thing in their home world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the whitish light used to see energy on a horizon, and manifest amazing videos in the sky, like on the cover of Wheel of Time, can also open a doorway through which you can walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So an IOB is needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OR, you have to shift your assemblage point so far, you&amp;#39;re irrational, and the double switches places with you,  to go into that scene you are viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the IOB opens the portal, you are still just you, ignoring the danger of entering a portal that can&amp;#39;t lead anywhere real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to what they really look like: They&amp;#39;re triangular bars that glow.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose they live in holes in the walls of caves and tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen that too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy is a wild inorganic being. I got her when Little Smoke went to live with Juann, at her own request to be available to others using her locator spell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted one that was completely untrained, so I could prove they weren&amp;#39;t dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was wrong.  They are.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just seem to have enough energy to avoid being trapped, probably because my recapitulation put enough energy into my dreaming body, to give me some common sense when they try to trap me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed have been passed down though the lineage for no one knows how long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe 10,000 years!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I believe they are completely dedicated to teaching apprentices.  And completely safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They got used to it or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for their origins, it was likely billions of years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think anyone knows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx is still available, but he hasn&amp;#39;t told me how to let someone take him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe he&amp;#39;s still supposed to belong to Cholita. She&amp;#39;s younger than I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He makes noises every single night lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some make my skin crawl, and  then I realize it&amp;#39;s just Minx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I caught him sneaking around my room two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was watching TV, with bright lights on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was such a startling sight to see an impossible thing in full lighting, I immediately turned my head away, and my eyes blinked a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve learned how to remove such things from our sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized my mistake and tried to bring it back, but I could not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qw7izp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qw7izp/lilys_demo_of_how_they_manifest/hlb9t7h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1637360131.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hlb26sj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SilenceisGolden29", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1637357025.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_qw7izp", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3b1g8h4y", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "What are they exactly, what is their origin.  \n\nDid fancy and little smoke used to be human beings?

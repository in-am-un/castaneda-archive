comments he already made.\n\nI'm responding to one he made about how the Cleargreen discussion group might be better than watching me masturbate in here.\n\nDoesn't care at all and hasn't noticed even a little, that the books of Carlos and his reputation had been trashed all over the net, and we were in danger of losing it all.\n\nHe didn't notice.  Carlos isn't important enough for him to even have paid attention until he decided to try to shoplift in our subreddit.\n\nBut he's a perfect example for beginners of why Astral Travel people are hopeless.  How it ruins them. And we really shouldn't pity them at all when they come to us.  Because they won't reciprocate and try to fit in and learn.\n\nI'll go over the (obvious) points you could have noticed if you read and thought about it.\n\nUnfortunately, he'll delete the post.  When he realizes his shame.\n\nTechno even feels bad for that, because some other bad players find deleted posts and blame us for it.  Not realizing, they're the very people who post and delete it.\n\nIf they cared at all about others they'd leave even their mistakes up, for people to learn from.\n\nPoint #1:  There's no way to tell what he was doing before, because we don't really keep track of posts by new people.  It's impossible. But I'm going to assume he's an Astral Traveler who came over here, because he mentioned that he didn't do that when he had his \"potential experience in the double\".\n\nExcept it's clear he tried to turn what we do, into Astral Travel.  Because he wasn't following instructions at all, and was in fact doing what we warn against.\n\nAt the end he does a little whine about how what he's doing is \"valid\".\n\nThere you go!  That's the Monroe delusion.  Monroe created \"Astral Travel\" (based on Yogi/Christian make believe) as a substitute for Carlos.  So he could steal from Castaneda fans. And then he billed it as a scientific (\"Non-dogmatic\") approach to such things in general.  As a \"More intelligent\" alternative to magic born of religious systems.\n\nDidn't notice that what Carlos had, is no religion.  And that if there's any \"dogma\" in the Castaneda world, it's from people trying to fight back against religious delusions.\n\nThat's not dogma!  That's anti-dogma.  Sorcery is 100% anti-dogma.\n\nBut Monroe  gave followers the belief that what they are learning is a substitute for everything else out there.\n\nSo this poster came in, lied about finding puffs (or he wouldn't have blown them off as uninteresting) so we couldn't accuse him of what he actually was going to do, and then tried to substitute Astral travel for what's in here. So he could get attention.\n\nProbably the very thing he was warned about before, which hurt his feelings.\n\nHe's really an \"Archetype\" as Cholita likes to call it, for the delusional Astral Traveler.  You couldn't find a more perfect example.\n\nDid the absolute opposite of what the instructions in here say.\n\nHe  went closed eye on the bed and misrepresented a dream as what's done here. Without helping us out with the details, because he knew those wouldn't go over well.\n\nWe do what he mistakenly confuses for astral travel.   Even though the difference is OBVIOUS.\n\nFully awake, eyes open, we DAILY travel into other worlds.  Stable ones, where you can remain for hours if you get lucky.\n\nSeemingly in our physical body, because you just walk through the solid wall. There's no sleeping, no being in a dream, no \"astral\" body.\n\nBut he didn't bother to study here at all, because what he does is \"valid too\". His words.\n\nNonsense!  You don't go to pastry school and cook up a big pot of chili, telling  them \"Chili is valid too!\"\n\nYou're in the wrong place.\n\nBut Monroe people have been brainwashed to believe theirs is a substitute for everything.  Because Monroe was ignorant, lazy, and greedy.\n\nI really don't see why Monroe got away with it, other than people were so anxious to learn from Carlos, that he got lucky.\n\nPoint #2: This man has absolutely no knowledge of the troubles involved in trying to teach real magic.\n\nDay in and day out attacks by people trying to steal attention, most mentally ill.  And endless misrepresentations of what they're practicing, which pretty much doesn't even make sense if you analyze it.\n\nThis man is unaware of that problem.  Because in fact, he's never been serious about learning magic at all or he would have realized it.  And been a little more understanding about why he got fried for trying to substitute different magic.\n\nHe's not even sincere!\n\nImagine you were learning to play baseball on little league teams.\n\nIf you did that for real, wouldn't you be very familiar with the ins and outs of joining random games?  The nuts and bolts of all the problems you can have with people  not being serious, trying to take over the team, or even not showing up?\n\nMagic is no different.  Everything is like that! If you really do it, you learn that the world is not an \"ideal\" place.\n\nBut his head exploded anyway when that topic was explained to him, to try to get him to think of the community a bit.\n\nPoint #3: He doesn't see any difference between doing something once in a while, and doing it daily.  And also doesn't understand how ordinary dreams get misrepresented by bad players, to match the magic they claim to be learning.   He doesn't even understand why messing with such types of magic (closed eye where you can fall asleep) is even a risk.\n\nJust blew over that point.\n\nWhich means, he DOES NOT do what he says, with any regularity. He isn't familiar with magic at all, and the illusory nature of it.\n\nI can't repeat this enough.  He doesn't even do,  what he claims to do.  Regardless of whether it's \"valid\".\n\nHe isn't even doing it!\n\nOr he would have realized, if you meet \"Lucifer\" using your amazing magical powers, it's not really Lucifer.\n\nIt's just some spirit messing with you.  And the only way you learn that, is by doing it every single day, until you realize Lucifer has mutated over time and is now that woman from the Progressive insurance commercials.\n\nIn the \"Astral Travel\" business there would be plenty of such similar discoveries, on the flakey nature of lucid dreaming.  Which is pretty much what they do.\n\nI've run the whole range of lucid dreaming, putting in intense efforts 4 hours a day to set it up, and even succeeding in traveling using lucid dreaming, 12 hours in a row on a single night.\n\nInto Lucid dreams on average 4 times a night, at my peak.\n\nIt's it's FLAKEY stuff.  That's the nature of that aspect of reality, controlled by our double who has very few logical concerns.\n\nBut this man has no such knowledge.  Which means, he isn't even doing what he claims.\n\nNo one in the astral travel subreddit is!\n\nIt just produces self-entitled angry men who believe what they do is \"valid\", and will go around trying to get attention (from us especially),  but with absolutely no interest at all in learning.\n\nIt's the worst kind of bad guy.\n\nThere's knife murderers out there, and there's pin prick murderers.\n\n\"Death by a thousand cuts\".\n\nAt least if you have the stab you in the heart kind of murderer, you have a chance to avoid him and make sure he's gone away for good.\n\nBut the guy who hangs around sneaking a little cut onto you when you don't notice,  so you bleed just a bit more, is like this man.\n\nAnd others who try to come here and \"set up shop\".\n\nWe get 10 of those hanging around, and it's all over for us.\n\nI almost prefer the mega bad players like Mikhail, running crazy guy, or spooge engine.\n\nAt least they don't have the self-control to hang around and pretend to be helping.\n\nWhen really, they're poking holes in your veins.\n\nSo learn while it's still here, because it's 80% he'll delete the post and maybe even the user name.  \n\nI can say that, only because of the 3 year history of this place.", "edited": 1667661164.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iv5s5n7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This man is now lashing out and then deleting comments he already made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m responding to one he made about how the Cleargreen discussion group might be better than watching me masturbate in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t care at all and hasn&amp;#39;t noticed even a little, that the books of Carlos and his reputation had been trashed all over the net, and we were in danger of losing it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t notice.

Even \"proof\" what he is, in that dream.  You should see what he can do in silent knowledge, materializing video after video for you to answer questions you have!\n\nHe's the half of your awareness that didn't take a birth.  While your other half, is stuck in that organic body we all have.\n\nWhich means, he never got his finger smashed. His older brother never stole his hot chocolate.\n\nThe cute girl next door, never turned him down for a date he barely got up the nerve to ask for.\n\nYour double gets all the hot chocolate, all the girls, and he can smash his finger all day long, and it won't matter a few seconds later.\n\nHe's got NO REASON, to reason.\n\nSo I'd tell you how to tell.  BUT, you'd add it to your dream.\n\nSo it would become useless.\n\nOn the other hand, if you discover it on your own you'll never forget it!\n\nBest solution here is, do it as often as you can, and don't be like the Astral Travel people, exaggerating your successes to get attention.\n\nThat's how we got all the phony religions the world is saddled with.\n\nPeople didn't do what they claim they can do, more than a couple of times. Before they went out to cash in.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that nothing in sorcery is ever \"proven\" to your satisfaction.\n\nI can surely attest to that!\n\nBecause \"doubts\" are not a feature of the real you.\n\nDoubts are a feature of the blue line version of yourself.\n\nThey can never be removed because the blue line protects itself, and anything that would cause you to try to climb out of that crappy river, to the dry land of sorcerers, is an enemy to blue line \"coziness\".\n\nIt'll be doubted forever.\n\nYou have to get onto dry land on the shore and look back into the river of shit, to figure out what's \"true\" and what's not.\n\nBut to be specific, Cholita one day tapped me on the shoulder as I lay in bed sleeping.\n\nI turned around to see what was going on, and it was Cholita alright.\n\nExcept she was glowing in blue!  Like some kind of supernatural alien woman.\n\nShe rotated back and fell onto a wooden plank, dead.\n\nAnd topless I might add...\n\nShe had my interest.\n\nI was fully awake.  It wasn't a dream.\n\nYet right next to my bed, putting on a show, was dead Cholita. All posed in a way I could never forget.\n\nA zombie materialized next to her in a black hoodie. I couldn't see his face, but it felt like \"death\" from movies, come to claim it's next victim.\n\nI got the unforgettable feeling of being in the double but aware of it with my tonal reasoning.\n\nAnd yet, I was in my physical body at the same time!  Goosebumps are a sign of that condition.\n\nCholita tends to be a bit dramatic.  And the double doesn't have to run off and be by himself.  He can be right on top of our physical body, \"assisting\".\n\nCholita started to move to the right of the bed, carried by the Zombie on some kind of platform.  And I looked to see where they might be going.\n\nIt was \"the road to hell\", from a twilight zone episode.\n\nI recognized it!\n\nIt was in a rural area, pastures with old horses, oak trees, short old weathered wooden fences along a dirt road.\n\nLovely!

Like some kind of supernatural alien woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She rotated back and fell onto a wooden plank, dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And topless I might add...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had my interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was fully awake.  It wasn&amp;#39;t a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet right next to my bed, putting on a show, was dead Cholita. All posed in a way I could never forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A zombie materialized next to her in a black hoodie. I couldn&amp;#39;t see his face, but it felt like &amp;quot;death&amp;quot; from movies, come to claim it&amp;#39;s next victim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the unforgettable feeling of being in the double but aware of it with my tonal reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, I was in my physical body at the same time!  Goosebumps are a sign of that condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita tends to be a bit dramatic.  And the double doesn&amp;#39;t have to run off and be by himself.  He can be right on top of our physical body, &amp;quot;assisting&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita started to move to the right of the bed, carried by the Zombie on some kind of platform.  And I looked to see where they might be going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was &amp;quot;the road to hell&amp;quot;, from a twilight zone episode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recognized it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was in a rural area, pastures with old horses, oak trees, short old weathered wooden fences along a dirt road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lovely! But it curved off to the left in the distance, and I realized Cholita was being taken into hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A day or two later I was driving with Cholita, and wanted to ask her if she was aware she had done that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t uncommon, but that particular event was super cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to start the conversation, but Cholita despises me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was furiously swiping pictures on her cell phone so I would leave her alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she noticed I was looking to see them, she swiped back the other way a few, and held the phone up so I could look at the picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was exactly what I had seen her do the night before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, it was a suicide.

And it smarted for decades.\n\nBut actually the truth is, Carlos simply told her the literal truth about her experience.

Who\u2019s going to grow the crops, build the roads, knit the clothing etc. for all the people (some historical cabal of women wanted) to populate the Earth\u2026if too many are off exploring the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is after all, far more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So our current human condition required shifting that sustained effort into matter, instead of \u2018spirit.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when that became habit we became miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we do have smartphones\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/104vPBH8buV9vy\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/24g4zhmfJ4ZXPKQXBf6k-Xqt6L_qolhkSVb-HoHhdCU.gif?width=317&amp;height=200&amp;s=b2f6d2bd99d87fd64f57b9e6e5805dc9e543cdd1\" width=\"317\" height=\"200\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ylwwpj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ylwwpj/deleted_by_user/iv10aj6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1667570705.0, "media_metadata": {"giphy|104vPBH8buV9vy": {"status": "valid", "e": "AnimatedImage", "m": "image/gif", "ext": "https://giphy.com/gifs/104vPBH8buV9vy", "p": [{"y": 88, "x": 140, "u": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Tj_rNk8z9HT0_6OQfOfWMcOhjnFj3RWF_dix54F8Jb4.jpg"}], "s": {"y": 200, "gif": "https://external-preview.redd.it/24g4zhmfJ4ZXPKQXBf6k-Xqt6L_qolhkSVb-HoHhdCU.gif?width=317&amp;height=200&amp;s=b2f6d2bd99d87fd64f57b9e6e5805dc9e543cdd1", "mp4": "https://external-preview.redd.it/24g4zhmfJ4ZXPKQXBf6k-Xqt6L_qolhkSVb-HoHhdCU.gif?width=317&amp;height=200&amp;format=mp4&amp;s=0e2a2b4d828c4f599cee258bdebae6268364bea4", "x": 317}, "t": "giphy", "id": "giphy|104vPBH8buV9vy"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1667570705.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iv0pfhz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1667565696.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iv0ncpz", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "I just don\u2019t (didn\u2019t) really have the vocabulary to communicate my experience. \u201castral projection\u201d was the closest thing in my lexicon.

Not Fancy!](https://preview.redd.it/r1wzy7stfjo51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8014377a5946f34e58c7727a7ada8dbaf3632887)\n\nJD posted some amazing quotes from the books in the last couple of days.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find them all. There\u2019s too much activity in here. But essentially the follow was indicated:\n\nThe inorganic beings teach. In fact, they taught the old sorcerers just about everything they needed to go on, with no help.\n\nThat verifies what I\u2019ve seen with Fairy and Fancy!\n\nThey do teach. You just have to learn their \u201cstyle\u201d, and not ignore odd thoughts which pop into your head, when you weren\u2019t thinking about that at all.\n\nAlso included was, even new sorcerers need to learn the techniques of the old sorcerers. But then at a certain point, they deviate.\n\nWell, we aren\u2019t anywhere near being knowledgeable enough to deviate!!!\n\nSo you deviants out there who hate the old sorcerers, cut it out please. Give me a break.\n\nWhen you have something to deviate, then come complain.\n\nAlso posted was that Men of Knowledge were more like sorcery guild members, who made a living from it. Cooking, rituals, healing.\n\nBut they could not *see*!\n\nIn other words, men of knowledge are BORING. Impotent even?\n\nThe main complaint seems to be that *seeing* gives you too much power, and you can go off the deep end.\n\nBut we live in this horrible social structure. And as Cholita has taught me, a little bit of evil won\u2019t hurt anything. It\u2019s even more fun.\n\nWe\u2019re already civilized enough.\n\nSo let\u2019s go ahead and do what the new sorcerers did. What Carlos did.\n\nLet\u2019s learn what the old sorcerers were up to.\n\nFortunately, we have Fancy now. My new inorganic being.\n\nShe\u2019s a teaching machine!\n\nJust for fun, I tried to talk her into being a sexy teacher, outfit and all.\n\nShe didn\u2019t understand. But she tried her best.\n\nI was gazing at energy on the wall, thinking about the possible uses and what I want to try next.\n\nI had a sudden very strong thought. It was of the old sorcerers, pacing back and forth at the big flat rock.\n\nThey had \u201cburied\u201d themselves, and converted their luminous bodies nearly into inorganic beings, so they could extend their lifespan. And they had 12 inorganic beings with them, to use to frighten people to death.\n\nBut why were they pacing back and forth?\n\nFancy was right next to me.  I asked her, \u201cWho thought that?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t reply.\n\nSo I tried it out. I had the entire north wall facing me, covered in very smooth white light.\n\nI began to pace left and right. Except that, the wooden floor creeks. And Cholita starts to imagine monsters are after her. She\u2019s so obsessed with that possibility that the house has bricks sealing up any dirt which might dig through into her stronghold, her she-shed in the garage.\n\nI could only do a couple of passes. But that\u2019s all it took.\n\nI realized that I was glancing out of the side of my eye at the energy on the wall, and when I turned around to go the other direction, I had to switch eyes.\n\nAfter just a few passes, the entire wall switched over to \u201cdark energy\u201d.\n\nI know dark energy well. Cholita brought it to me. She even let me play with it in my hands, and she used it to make my hair blow.\n\nThere was my wall, covered only in dark energy.\n\nI was \u201cseeing dark energy on the horizon\u201d.\n\nI was out of Carlos territory. And in to old sorcerer magic.\n\nFancy was pleased. She drifted slowly to the right, calling my attention to the east wall.\n\nThe east wall was also covered in light, although I must admit, I failed to check the color.\n\nThe entire room had changed. All the normal colors were messed up, and I had no idea what to do with them.\n\nBut there on the east wall, next to Fancy, was a golden glitter. Just a tiny little flicker of golden yellow light.\n\nAn *intent* disruption!\n\nI gazed towards it, then turned my head right to look at Fancy, to see what she had in mind.\n\nShe looked away from me.  I was on my own.\n\nI turned my head back, and realized I had just switched eyes.\n\nI wanted to pace back and forth, but I still had the problem of Cholita.\n\nSo I leaned at an angle looking only with the right eye, then leaned back the other direction, as if I had just walked by. I was both switching eyes, and moving my head.  And my torso, which has become very flexible from darkroom gazing.\n\nThe bones in my neck crack one after the other, smoothly, if I lean far to the left or right.\n\nNo wonder don  Juan's bones cracked! \n\nIt's a natural result of sorcery practice.\n\nI was simulating the kind of gaze you\u2019d have if you were pacing back and forth. But without the actual pacing.\n\nThe sparkle on the wall started to form a goblet made of light. Each turn of the head caused it to pop out a bit from the wall.\n\nInstead of remaining there as a flat vision, which is what I normally see, it lifted out and began to fall to the floor.\n\nI turned to Fancy and commented, \u201cHorizontal shift, right?\u201d\n\nShe floated away.   Towards the south wall.\n\nI still wanted her to be a \u201chot school teacher\u201d, so I scooped up a bunch of the weird light floating around me.\n\nIt was definitely different.  I suppose, the \u201cdark energy content\u201d was higher.\n\nFancy flew over, and I gave her the energy.\n\nShe actually consumed it and got brighter.   There was only a 1 or 2 second delay from giving her the blob of light, and her getting brighter and more solid.\n\nI began to feel sick.\n\nNausea is common when moving the assemblage point, but I was going to hurl pretty soon.\n\nI kept trying to turn Fancy into a teacher, but my final scoop had her head on top of it, and it was rather \u201cpompous\u201d looking.\n\n An elaborate puff structure, with her head in the middle.  A truly \"grand\" thing, is what I felt.\n\nI suppose that's how she interpreted being a teacher?\n\nI was going to correct her, and point out that wasn't what I was after.  I had mini-skirt in mind.\n\nBut I  had to stop or I would have vomited in less than a minute.\n\nI considered that I should keep going to see if I actually did throw up, but Cholita owns the bathroom at night. I never go near there, to make her feel safe to use it in her night clothes.\n\nI sat on pillows on the bed, waiting to see if I would end up throwing up in the trash bin.\n\nThe weird dark energy on the walls began to fade, and the white light returned.\n\nMy nausea went away, and was replaced by bliss.\n\nThat\u2019s why that picture has less fun things going on.\n\nI had to abort.\n\nShifts to the right are a little rough.\n\nEdited once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Seeing Dark Energy on the Horizon",

Or perhaps it's the 2 smallest fingers. The fiber seems to come from the middle of both, but more from the little one.\n\nSince I could actually *see* what she was talking about, unlike the men of knowledge who had to imagine, I figured out how to cast it out like a fishing line, and hook her with it.\n\nShe didn't mind. Her appearance was only a projection anyway.\n\nBut it was fun to realize my little finger could cause changes in her just by flicking it towards her gently.

It took all of 5 seconds to give us access to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No year long Man of Knowledge ritual to prepare a badly designed shroom delivery medium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was no where as strong as just eating the shrooms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was designed to invoke the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of the ritual, because they couldn&amp;#39;t do that themselves using &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were such pests to society that they had to get a license from the Olmec government to practice, and then engaged in many activities.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Baker, mask maker, dancer, healer.  Probably football maker too! And those weird helmets they wore?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But due to laziness, they never learned to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had to use power plants and rituals, and didn&amp;#39;t really understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their real goal was money, or barter,  since back then there wasn&amp;#39;t any coinage to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to be &lt;em&gt;seers&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not Men of Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, as Techno has pointed out, don Juan gets loose with that term &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; in the later books, probably because anyone who becomes a seer starts out using rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, you can actually design the rituals yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s called, &amp;quot;knowing the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of a thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance Fancy, my &amp;quot;bad girl&amp;quot; Ally, was teaching me about how to use those cobwebs Carlos taught us to feel.  Just two nights ago in fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t include it in my post, because it was &amp;quot;way out there&amp;quot; on the J curve.  It required continuous &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; to even perceive it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the Men of Knowledge would be completely unable to perceive or use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was pointing out that the cobwebs you can feel in the air, are deeply connected to the lines in the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In particular, there are weak lines in the hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And very specifically, the little finger can cast one out.  Or perhaps it&amp;#39;s the 2 smallest fingers. The fiber seems to come from the middle of both, but more from the little one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I could actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what she was talking about, unlike the men of knowledge who had to imagine, I figured out how to cast it out like a fishing line, and hook her with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t mind. Her appearance was only a projection anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was fun to realize my little finger could cause changes in her just by flicking it towards her gently. It was like having a cat on a leash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t tug on a cat&amp;#39;s leash, or they won&amp;#39;t play anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can give it a gentle &amp;quot;flick&amp;quot;, and they&amp;#39;ll start walking with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/r7yije/man_of_knowledge/hn3doc9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1638554015.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_r7yije", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_r7yije", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hn5z50j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1638597601.0, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t1_hn5z4zj", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Your comment has been automatically removed because your account does not meet our account-age requirement of 10 days.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But I've only seen that in darkness.\n\nAnd that lets you \"treat it as real\", so you get both the vertical shift along the J curve but also the super cool horizontal shifts.\n\nAt the very least, try go lure the double out later when you aren't doing the tensegrity, by doing simple tensegrity scooping movements, or claw hand, or something where you can observe any visible effects of the hand or feet movements.\n\nWiggle the fingers on the second attention point and try to see sparkles or feel solidity.\n\nBut can't you get a big fan?  Just blast your head!\n\nIn the summer I'm locked in a very hot room for fear of Cholita, with no air conditioning.  So I have a GIANT fan.  It's like a hurricane in there.\n\nI used to  hear coyote sounds coming from the fan. It was the inorganic beings figuring out some way to change the noises and communicate.\n\n\\&gt; Anyways is there any particular pass which would make it possible to contact it,\n\nFind a pass which treats something impossible as \"real\".\n\nAn example is the Affection for the energy body pass.\n\nYou scoop the purple stuff into a blob in front of you, and then start shaping it into a humanoid figure!\n\nYou're \"treating it as real\", and so the assemblage point shifts sideways to make it so.\n\nAs long as you are forcing silence, it will keep moving down.\n\nBut when the assemblage point is shifted sideways,  you are one step more into actual dreaming, where the IOBs can change from just a face, to Cinderella.\n\nBad choice there.  \n\nCinderella sucks.  \n\nShe's obsessed with men and happily ever afters.  A very poor witch she was.\n\nMaybe Tinkerbell. \n\nShe hangs out with little boys, so she can't get too obsessed.  That would be weird.\n\n\\&gt;When colors are talked about are they just referring to the smaller puffs?\n\nZuleica never really defined it. Sorcerers like to keep things vague, so people don't toss out things they saw that were magical, but no one else did.\n\nSo any colors at all!  Later you get a \"haze\" of color, which is called the \"second attention fog\".\n\nUsing Pandora's box pass, you can make it crystalize.\n\n\"Puffs\" are pieces of either your energy body, or of an inorganic being.\n\n\"Fog\" is closer to \"seeing energy\",  but in a beginner's form.\n\nNaturally if you just add these \"facts\" to your mental inventory, you are never going to learn.  You only use the \"facts\" to examine things more closely, once you really see them.\n\nThe facts cause you to treat them as real, and the assemblage point shifts sideways to make it more real.\n\nSo \"facts\" are good, but not the way most beginners try to collect them as a substitute for practicing the real thing.\n\n\\&gt; Can the false room which is created after doing unbending intent be made more accurate and detailed somehow\n\nHell yea!  One day you won't realize it's phantom, and  you'll walk right into it to see what's going on over there.  And in so doing, violate space by passing through solid walls.\n\nThat's another horizontal shift.\n\nRemember, in sleeping dreams things can be VERY real.\n\nIt's no different during darkroom.  If you want that of realness, you have to learn to shift horizontally.\n\nAt first that's \"hit or miss\", and people will try stretching the puffs and foming objects, to get the assemblage point to shift sideways.\n\nCarlos put all sorts of silly poking with fingers, scooping with hands, or even \"roping\" energy like a cowboy.\n\nThose were the horizontal shifting aspect of the Tensegrity moves.\n\nBut everyone just did them like it was a morning exercise class with Jack La Lane.\n\nSo it largely failed to work.\n\nWitches are different. I'm sure there's all sorts of \"Cleargreen purist\" women who get \"weird\" sensations.\n\nBut who doesn't want to be Dr. Strange???!!\n\nAnd he's a total asshole to boot!  Which is even better.

But I&amp;#39;ve only seen that in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that lets you &amp;quot;treat it as real&amp;quot;, so you get both the vertical shift along the J curve but also the super cool horizontal shifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the very least, try go lure the double out later when you aren&amp;#39;t doing the tensegrity, by doing simple tensegrity scooping movements, or claw hand, or something where you can observe any visible effects of the hand or feet movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wiggle the fingers on the second attention point and try to see sparkles or feel solidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But can&amp;#39;t you get a big fan?  Just blast your head!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the summer I&amp;#39;m locked in a very hot room for fear of Cholita, with no air conditioning.  So I have a GIANT fan.  It&amp;#39;s like a hurricane in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to  hear coyote sounds coming from the fan. It was the inorganic beings figuring out some way to change the noises and communicate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Anyways is there any particular pass which would make it possible to contact it,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find a pass which treats something impossible as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example is the Affection for the energy body pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You scoop the purple stuff into a blob in front of you, and then start shaping it into a humanoid figure!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;treating it as real&amp;quot;, and so the assemblage point shifts sideways to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as you are forcing silence, it will keep moving down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when the assemblage point is shifted sideways,  you are one step more into actual dreaming, where the IOBs can change from just a face, to Cinderella.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad choice there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cinderella sucks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s obsessed with men and happily ever afters.  A very poor witch she was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe Tinkerbell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She hangs out with little boys, so she can&amp;#39;t get too obsessed.  That would be weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;When colors are talked about are they just referring to the smaller puffs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica never really defined it. Sorcerers like to keep things vague, so people don&amp;#39;t toss out things they saw that were magical, but no one else did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So any colors at all!  Later you get a &amp;quot;haze&amp;quot; of color, which is called the &amp;quot;second attention fog&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using Pandora&amp;#39;s box pass, you can make it crystalize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Puffs&amp;quot; are pieces of either your energy body, or of an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fog&amp;quot; is closer to &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot;,  but in a beginner&amp;#39;s form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally if you just add these &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; to your mental inventory, you are never going to learn.  You only use the &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; to examine things more closely, once you really see them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The facts cause you to treat them as real, and the assemblage point shifts sideways to make it more real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; are good, but not the way most beginners try to collect them as a substitute for practicing the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Can the false room which is created after doing unbending intent be made more accurate and detailed somehow&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hell yea!  One day you won&amp;#39;t realize it&amp;#39;s phantom, and  you&amp;#39;ll walk right into it to see what&amp;#39;s going on over there.  And in so doing, violate space by passing through solid walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s another horizontal shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, in sleeping dreams things can be VERY real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no different during darkroom.  If you want that of realness, you have to learn to shift horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;hit or miss&amp;quot;, and people will try stretching the puffs and foming objects, to get the assemblage point to shift sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos put all sorts of silly poking with fingers, scooping with hands, or even &amp;quot;roping&amp;quot; energy like a cowboy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those were the horizontal shifting aspect of the Tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But everyone just did them like it was a morning exercise class with Jack La Lane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it largely failed to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Witches are different. I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s all sorts of &amp;quot;Cleargreen purist&amp;quot; women who get &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; sensations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But who doesn&amp;#39;t want to be Dr. Strange???!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;s a total asshole to boot!  Which is even better.

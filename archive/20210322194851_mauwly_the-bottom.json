Insisted it wasn&amp;#39;t for sale, but I heard otherwise elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hint:  If your head explodes when questioned, you can&amp;#39;t get silent!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s sort of like a beggar who has no food, getting angry when someone suggests he might get some food at the homeless shelter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying, &amp;quot;I have plenty of food, you bastard!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he actually has food, and is chomping on a giant turkey drumstick, with a mango in the other hand, he&amp;#39;s not going to get angry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just curious why you&amp;#39;d insist he has none.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second attention effects, puffs of color primarilty, when used to assist in finding silence help make the &amp;quot;loop&amp;quot; less important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They shift the assemblage point a tiny bit, and it becomes a tiny bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if there&amp;#39;s no colors?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(sounds, smells, feelings, weird thoughts would work too, to get things started).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;#39;t heard much about people who try and find nothing, because it usually comes out as a complaint, and if you explore why, the guy turns out to be a little wacky or needy or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t believe what they say anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like our guy who, with his friend, could both get fully silent, both were &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot;, and yet, neither could see colors in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And who flew into a huge rage if you tried to private chat that it made no sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe we&amp;#39;ll never get a lab squirrel into a cage, to figure out what to do when there&amp;#39;s no colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, you never know if the person is hugely exaggerating how much effort they put into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dare to say, some will only try 20 minutes before it seems like an outrageous effort. But they won&amp;#39;t admit that in public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reni, Nyei, Miles, and Aerin are all guilty of exaggerating how much effort they put into sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be asking them for &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s next&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were given this task.

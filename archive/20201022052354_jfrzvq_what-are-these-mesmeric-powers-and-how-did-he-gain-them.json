by Elisabeth Haich. Somewhere she talks about thought transference and perceiving will. Don't know if it is what is meant by mesmeric powers, but it is interesting. I found the passage online: \n\nI imagined that for successful thought transference my husband would think about something and his thought would, in some way or other, appear in my mind. I was thus expecting a thought that would not be coming from me. (At that time I had never realized that we do not actually know the source of the thoughts we believe to be our own!) To my great amazement something quite different happened, something for which I was truly not prepared. As I stood there with my husband and waited to receive a thought from him, I felt very distinctly\u2014and even 'saw'\u2014that a stream of force about three to four 75 inches thick flowed out of his solar plexus area, surrounding my body like a lasso, also at about the height of the solar plexus. \n\nI felt this flow of force as distinctly as if it had been material\u2014very fine, like a dense mist but nevertheless material. After this flow of force surrounded me, it pulled me unmistakably in a definite direction so that I had to take a step. Then it pulled me on and on. Whenever I took a step in the wrong direction, it very distinctly pulled me back into the right direction. In this way we reached the window where the materialized will of my husband left me standing. Then came a new surprise. My left arm which was hanging down at my side as usual, suddenly rose in the air, becoming weightless! Until then I had never realized that my arms hung downward because of the gravitational attraction of the earth. One hears about gravitation in school, but I had never before been conscious of the fact that my own arm hung downward because of this force. There in front of the window, however, I was able to experience for myself the fact that my arm lost its weight and rose up in the air when the earth's gravitational pull ceased. As my arm moved upward, it also raised the curtain. I had not moved a single muscle, so it seemed. It was as if a mass flowing out from my husband's solar plexus was supporting my arm. Then this mass pushed my head forward until my nose touched the window pane. At this moment, the mass left my body\u2014my arm and my head\u2014and I was able to move again freely. \n\nWe looked at each other and were both very excited. **I was thrilled by the new experience, the fact that the human will flows out of the solar plexus, literally reaching another person, embracing him like an octopus, and even cancelling out the effect of gravity.** This 'material' seemed as if it consisted of myriads of little droplets of mist, somewhat like the milky way appears in the sky at night. It was as if these droplets of mist were all closely related to each other and all flowing in one direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never finished the book, now I'm thinking maybe I should..", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g9oczt4", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made me think about a book I have &amp;#39;Initiation&amp;#39; by Elisabeth Haich.

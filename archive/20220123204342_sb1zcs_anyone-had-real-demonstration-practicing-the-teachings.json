Maybe there is something about that city.  Someone I met mentioned I was living on the same street that Carlos Castaneda referenced in his book on dreams,  and since I had been having crazy dreams,  I found that coincidental, so I went and bought Art of Dreaming.  It blew my fucking mind and I went to work practicing. \n\nI loved the techniques, and had hundreds of lucid dreams and travels in my energy body.  But for me, it was all the other books, the beauty of the whole entire system, that spoke to my soul. I honestly felt like I had lived my life up to that point exactly how Don Juan had laid it out, or at least tried to.  So please, as Dan and others will point out, if you're in this just for the 'supernatural' highlights, you're not really seeing the forest from the trees.  You WON'T become a talented dreamer by obsessing about dreaming/magic.  In fact, you'll find that only when you have stalked yourself, lightened your baggage, and created a trim, organized, 'lite' version of your life, will the dreams come.  There is no dreaming without stalking.\n\nAnyway, since you want proof of how far it goes, I'll share this:\n\nOne night, in dreaming, I became aware I was in the body of a Tiger, racing around the streets of Westwood Village.  I remember everything like it was yesterday.  My point of view low to the ground, the thrill of my haunches going over my ears, and the speed.  The incredible speed.  When I  woke up, it felt like my heart rate was over 200 - it felt like a hummingbird in my chest. A few nights later, it happened again, woke up in the body of a Tiger in my dreams, this time in a Pre-historic version of Westwood.\n\nIt's been 25+ years since those 2 AP shifts, and they remain defining moments in my life, even if they were only intent gifts, and not self induced, it was still shape-shifting.  \n\nI practiced a lot back then.  I wound up reading all the book in just a few months, and even tracked down the Cleargreen center and did a few courses there.  I can also verify seeing the double one night after these courses, falling asleep and seeing an 'thermal' man right in front of me, showing me magical passes.  \n\nI also did the secret of the twin positions.  While dreaming one night, I laid down on a bed inside the dream and tried to fall asleep.   It worked.  My AP went somewhere entirely new, I knew instantly I had left the dream, and was in another world. \n\nAs mentioned, I also traveled in the energy body - I guess this is what other systems call Astral Projection -using the entire process Carlos descries in Fire From Within.  I would wake up in complete blackness, and I would feel my body rolled up tight like a cigar, then I would roll right out of my body and fall into the alley beside my bed.  I then leapt through the wall and moved about my town.  I did this dozens of times. \n\nI'll also tell you what I couldn't do:\n\n\\-I never was able to remote view, no matter how many times I tried it.\n\n\\-I was never able to enter any one else's dreams.\n\nJust please remember: what I practiced was called 4th gate dreaming, essentially.  I got extremely good and 'intending' to wake up in dreaming.  Dan and this sub in general do not recommend this path and I agree with them.  It's very hit or miss.  For me, back then, it just 'felt right', and there was no internet group talking about Darkroom practice (There was a sight called sustained action, but it wasn't easy to navigate, and wasn't 1/1000th of what this sub is); but the truth is, looking back, 4th gate dreaming is a very inconsistent process.  The holy grail would be mastering gazing, being able to start dreaming WITHOUT falling asleep.\n\nIn this, I failed.  It remains my goal, and I still practice, but not nearly with the freedom of my 20s; and more importantly, with the pandemic, the state of the world, etc. etc., I've just been too burdened recently to be any good at dreaming.  As I said, I can tell you right now one secret, at least for me:  your mood MUST be light to dream consistently.  You can't be weigh downed.  You must tie up the loose strings of your life, make peace with others, and yourself, let it all go, recap the fuck out of your life, and stalk yourself, and then do it more and more until you're as light as DJ and Genaro seemed when teaching Carlos - light, with laughter, but also with seriousness and focus - if you can achieve this 'mood', then it all becomes very natural.  It becomes, as it should be, a way of life.  A path. \n\nIf I was young, and starting out again, I would treasure this fucking subreddit and I would 100% be attempting to master Darkroom.  And remember, this doesn't mean you wont' ALSO get intent gifts in your dreams at night, or become talented at intending waking dreaming most nights, the way I did.  I believe you can 'have it all'.  I believe there are people out there practicing at this level. \n\nI hope some of this 'proof' helps you in the way you are seeking; it's all subjective of course, but it's all real.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_htxqbuc", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can speak to this, if it&amp;#39;s important to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went extremely far on the path when I was practicing intently, with hundreds of controlled dreams.

As I said, I can tell you right now one secret, at least for me:  your mood MUST be light to dream consistently.  You can&amp;#39;t be weigh downed.  You must tie up the loose strings of your life, make peace with others, and yourself, let it all go, recap the fuck out of your life, and stalk yourself, and then do it more and more until you&amp;#39;re as light as DJ and Genaro seemed when teaching Carlos - light, with laughter, but also with seriousness and focus - if you can achieve this &amp;#39;mood&amp;#39;, then it all becomes very natural.  It becomes, as it should be, a way of life.  A path. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I was young, and starting out again, I would treasure this fucking subreddit and I would 100% be attempting to master Darkroom.  And remember, this doesn&amp;#39;t mean you wont&amp;#39; ALSO get intent gifts in your dreams at night, or become talented at intending waking dreaming most nights, the way I did.  I believe you can &amp;#39;have it all&amp;#39;.  I believe there are people out there practicing at this level. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope some of this &amp;#39;proof&amp;#39; helps you in the way you are seeking; it&amp;#39;s all subjective of course, but it&amp;#39;s all real.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sb1zcs/anyone_had_real_demonstration_practicing_the/htxqbuc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1642975858.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_sb1zcs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "htxntgz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "matejthetree", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1642974885.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_sb1zcs", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_ar84z8e", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "this is actually a real sober question, one that everyone should be asking.\n\nI'm sure the answers will be great.\n\ni had the stuff happening to me while following darkroom and daylight gazing predictably whilst I only had them sporadically before. like seeing other beings and being transported to other worlds that felt so real that it took me a while to crack the fear barrier. definitely works.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_htxntgz", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;this is actually a real sober question, one that everyone should be asking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure the answers will be great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i had the stuff happening to me while following darkroom and daylight gazing predictably whilst I only had them sporadically before. like seeing other beings and being transported to other worlds that felt so real that it took me a while to crack the fear barrier. definitely works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sb1zcs/anyone_had_real_demonstration_practicing_the/htxntgz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1642974885.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_sb1zcs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "htxl01u", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "theseekingcycle", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1642973785.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_sb1zcs", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_4hy361st", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I do not practice any of the teachings, but Castaneda is the only person I've ever read to describe something I used to encounter a lot as a kid, and I mean a lot a lot.

Post a picture putting down drug sorcerers, and they crawl out of their holes.\n\nI'm not sure what they're doing wandering in here, but they do.\n\nIn some ways, you can't criticize them.  EVEYONE is cheating others, the Buddhists not the least of  them.\n\nSo how come they get a free pass?\n\nI have no idea...  It's the strangest thing, but Buddhism gives off a \"protective shield\", the same way Christianity does.\n\nThey're both total bunk, and it's easy to see if you stop glossing over reality, and look around.\n\nBut in the case of Christianity, if you insult it you start looking over your shoulder for lightening bolts.\n\nI suppose if you diss Buddhism, you're worried about gangs of roving monks, ready to beat you to death for blasphemy.\n\nBut those aren't our enemy.\n\nThey look down on sorcery.  So if you want to practice that, they'll leave you alone.  Practicing sorcery makes you just another of the deluded hoards of doomed people, who don't have \"the truth\".\n\nThey are after all, religions.  No one will take what you say seriously, if you point out they're fraudulent religions based on delusions.  Mass delusions are hard to stop.\n\nBut the real threat to this subreddit, are the drug sorcerers.\n\nThe people who feel \"entitled\" to respect, based on getting high alone.\n\nIf they come here, it's because the pictures worry them.  And you can almost always see instantly, they didn't even bother to look around.\n\nBecause they don't want to learn.  This place and the knowledge in it, are a threat to their livelihood.\n\nGiving them instructions is like handing a stranger from the road an axe so he can help you chop wood, after which you'll go in your cabin and get him some money.\n\nIf you don't think they'll turn that axe into a deadly weapon, you almost deserve what happens next.\n\nSo what's the cure, as far as \"instructions\" goes. I mean, should we make better instructions, when the entire place itself is nothing but instructions?  Boil it all down to a single thing?\n\nNo, absolutely not.\n\nWe should only show maps. The Map Carlos gave us.\n\nCarlos himself didn't give instructions in class. When people asked him for more, he never gave it.  He even looked pained they'd ask for that!\n\nBut maps are good.  Maps he gave.\n\nAnd, \"stories\".  He gave us new stories, whenever he thought it wasn't going well.\n\nTo change the mood.\n\nIf you want to \"update\" the mood, that's called, \"stalking\".\n\nApprentices always get stalked by their teachers.\n\nSo a \"new mood\" based on video games, or Las Vegas, or dating rituals of the cute British hedgehog in springtime, are fine.\n\nThose are stories.  Not instructions.\n\nMaps are ok, and stories are mandatory.  In fact, we all learn through the Abstract Cores.\n\nThey will literally reveal themselves in the darkroom, but you won't realize that  until much later.\n\nAnd when you do, you'll agree with don Juan.\n\nThe abstract cores are in fact nothing more than ***idiotic*** stories.  Here's the truth of the matter, in don Juan's words, regarding the abstract cores.\n\n\"This second abstract core could be a story in itself. The story says that after the spirit had manifested itself to that man we have talked about and had gotten no response, the spirit laid a trap for the man. It was a final subterfuge, not because the man was special, but because the incomprehensible chain of events of the spirit made that man available at the very moment that the spirit knocked on the door.\n\nIt goes without saying that whatever the spirit revealed to that man made no sense to him. In fact, it went against everything the man knew; everything he was. The man of course- in no uncertain terms- refused on the spot to have anything to do with the spirit. He wasn't going to fall for such preposterous nonsense. He knew better. The result was a total stalemate.\n\nI can say that **this is an idiotic story,**\" he continued. \"I can say that what I've given you is the pacifier for those who are uncomfortable with the silence of the abstract.\"\n\nThat's why were here!\n\nTo learn the abstract cores, for ourselves.\n\nWhen you realize why the abstract cores are indeed idiotic stories, you'll be making real progress to learning sorcery.\n\n\"Instructions\" can never teach the abstract cores.\n\nThose who haven't had much success finding puffs, should remember that enlightenment is nothing more than removing the internal dialogue.  It's the only \"real\" definition out there. The rest are all monks trying to make themselves feel special.\n\nHere's Shinzen Young on this topic.  It replaced my pic, so you'll have to put it back together:\n\nhttp  s://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nSo, now you know, reaching silence is a worthy goal.\n\nWasn't just our obsession!\n\nAnd you've seen the J curve.\n\nAnd you know the first stop on the J curve, where colors and puffs become readily visible, is the green line.\n\nGo use something else to get to the green line, then come back.\n\nYou have the advantage now, of having learned to tell real from pretend.  Use that knowledge, for the first time in your life, to judge what you seek.  So you don't get stuck in something pretend, like everyone else.\n\nFind Shamanic drumming, which is known to produce visions (a good teacher).  I hear Nyei does some of that!\n\nFind a form of meditation which produces bliss, and also visions.\n\nFind a \"real\" shaman, with a decent reputation, and (I hate to say it), not a white guy in shorts with a pony tail and a headband.\n\nMaybe a real native American, or Siberian Shaman who's actually Siberian and doesn't live in Hollywood?\n\nYou'll figure it out.\n\nI'd recommend TM, but they're so greedy they charge more than $1000.\n\nOnce you get to the green line (look at the map to see what that means), come back again!\n\nBut don't lurk where you are not succeeding.\n\nNever practice failure!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Brujos Love Ikea", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"8zbhnuznve181": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8zbhnuznve181.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=103d5d4602116cc4890c6ba4a166d5fad174aba8"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8zbhnuznve181.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3245b77354588802184af1485551b0b7242d6ada"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8zbhnuznve181.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40c421c99d2518eb0042b1dbfbd9e5037e147ca9"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8zbhnuznve181.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12544aacc8509c77dfe5d29fed3e41241f67fabd"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8zbhnuznve181.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccdd567146e7ab15fb293388ca63041f00e6292b"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8zbhnuznve181.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3983839a4bc6beaff5edea628cc86b3bd0a31a17"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8zbhnuznve181.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d77b163a4a866ee6df4ab7da301c999e702eba88"}, "id": "8zbhnuznve181"}}, "name": "t3_r0lqys", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3dt74hSi_OUB9xsiLTJmFW1Q1yFJFx50qNJJ4up4nC0.jpg", "edited": 1637702119.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1637697517.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8zbhnuznve181.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d77b163a4a866ee6df4ab7da301c999e702eba88\"&gt;The result of 2 hours of seeing.

Try just reading a while, before you show us what's in your wagon.\n\nThat's especially true if you have a Toltec Sorcerer in there,  a wise Chinese sage,  a Buddhist master, or even a crazy Hindu guru.\n\nIf you have Merilyn, I supposed it's ok to show us that.  But it won't do you any good in the long run.\n\nBesides, you can't compete with an inorganic being who wants to be attractive.\n\nI suppose this is a good place to explain something Carlos got attacked for, after he died.\n\nI believe it was Corey's notes that created the attack.  Corey took good notes, but he left an air of, \"What the hell?\" in some of them.\n\nHe never got it.  For an instant there, he almost did.  You can find that in notes too.\n\nIn this particular incident, there was gossip going around.  How come Miles gets to have  a wife (Aerin), but we're supposed to be celibate?\n\nNow keep in mind, no one but me was stupid enough to obey Carlos.  And in my case, only because I'm Autistic, and we have to live by rules or we stick out even more.\n\nThe rest were all in heat if they were of the right age for that type of activity. If not, they were still in lust.\n\nOk, me too...  You can't imagine the little herd of 5 young beautiful women I had following me around because of private classes.\n\nBut still, don't touch.  That was the rule.\n\nAt the time, Carlos was being held together by  a female doctor who had even cut  her hair to look like the rest of the inner circle women.  She gave him advice on how to make his cancer situation at least a tiny bit better, which included not using deodorants which contained aluminum. He even held up \"Tom's\" deodorant in class, to tell us that product line was not so bad.\n\nBut in terms of help to fight liver cancer, it wasn't much. What Carlos needed was \"energetic mass\".\n\nA mass of people actually learning sorcery, like we have in here now.   With it, he could have \"jumped grooves\" and avoided his death for now.\n\nHe never got that, but he did appreciate the help from the doctor woman.\n\nCarlos gave her open credit in class for making his illness more tolerable.  It was a sign he had hopes for her to learn sorcery.  He'd often praise someone he thought could use a boost.\n\nIf he made fun of you, that meant he had confidence in you.\n\nAlso in private classes, which were attended by the \"Doctor\" only infrequently, were 2 very **luscious** Canadian brothers.\n\nAt least, Cholita tells it like that.   I never heard a man called \"Luscious\" before Cholita the witch came along.\n\nAs she told me, \"Steal my energy with sex?  It'll steal all of theirs instead!!!\"\n\nBut I suppose it was true.  All the women wanted either of them.  They must have been somewhat luscious.\n\nBut rules is rules.  No boyfriends.\n\nThe reason is obvious!  If any of you don't get it yet, please do some work and go read in the wiki.\n\nI'll sum it up. We all live in a false myth.  It's the myth created by agriculture.\n\nWe evolved to be hunters/gatherers. Hunter gatherer tribes are swimming in magic.\n\nWe call it, \"Shamanism\", but in fact, roaming around in the wild all alone, not stuck behind 4 walls most of the day, opens you up to spirits.\n\nInorganic beings.\n\nNot to mention, when you run across the colorful red mushroom while hunting and gathering food, and take a bite to see if it's edible, you get a little \"help\" in noticing spirits.\n\nIf you notice them, they **really** notice you!  And they proceed to make it easier for you to notice (interact) with them even more.\n\nThey'll also teach you everything we now know about sorcery.\n\nThe darker stuff too, I might add.\n\n\"Fancy\", my inorganic being, is all about old sorcerer things.  She claims they're more fun.\n\nIf some of your hunter/gatherer tribe are dull, one of them won't be.  He'll try the shrooms, or the plant with bell shaped white flowers, and learn from the spirits.\n\nAnd he'll become tribal shaman, introducing everyone else to magic.\n\nBut when you learn agriculture, you become a slave to the plants.  And your domistacated plants will teach you, \"Don't eat the wild plants!!!!  They might be poison!\"\n\nThe brainwashing is complete, when you believe only the mushrooms in Campbell's soup are safe.\n\nAt any rate, agriculture reduces experimentation, which eliminates power plants from the accidental diet.  Magic isn't useful for watering and plowing the fields.\n\nThe bible is essentially the story of how mankind became slave to the plants.  Adam and Eve were placed in a fruit orchard, and given domesticated farm animals.\n\nElsewhere, people were created as hunters and fishers.\n\nOnly the \"garden\" was called \"Paradise\".\n\nAs agriculture rose in power, magic was officially banished.  A huge flood wiped out the descendants of the \"fish people\",  a truly magical society,  and it was written in stone that, \"Thou shall not suffer a witch to live.\"\n\nBut the women went underground to gain back power. Once the plants keep the men in permanent settlements, the women can take over.\n\nNo more roaming men.  Just reproductive tasks.\n\nThat's the false myth we now live  under.  \"Find a Girl, Settle Down, if you want you can marry.  Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.\"\n\n[Father and Son (lyrics) - Cat Stevens - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCQVnSOFqfM)\n\nIt's a false myth. The old guy is miserable, like everyone else. But he's decided there's no such thing as magic, nothing new to explore, and so you just have to pretend everything is fine. And brainwash the next generation of free farm labor, so they stick around to keep you company, as you slowly die in pain and remorse.\n\nCat Stevens tries to escape in the song, but his father feels compelled to stop him in the name of wisdom.\n\nNow, we don't all live on farms anymore.   When I say \"Agriculture Myth\", I mean the origins.\n\nIt's unnatural for the young men to hang around, worrying about Granny forever.   It's not their problem if Granny is so senile she's eating cat food instead of the cheaper alternative, tortillas and beans.\n\nThe men are supposed to go start another tribe, elsewhere, taking the most eligible (hot) women with them if they choose to leave the tribe.\n\nWe're essentially Chimpanzees.\n\nThey don't even remember who their mom is.  It's not important for anyone's survival.  Even Granny.\n\nThat's the fabrication: \"Family is everything!\"\n\nGranny is supposed to develop her own value, beyond reproduction.  Make baskets, pots, tell the stories of the past.  Babysit for the tribe, so the young women can find seeds and berries and get in a little fishing.\n\nGranny should teach the younger women how to use the medicinal plants.\n\nHave enough value, and learn where to gather food for herself easily, so that she doesn't have to cling to her descendants like a festering boil.\n\nBut it's gotten even worse now.  We're even divorced from the land.  At least in an agricultural society we got some fresh air and looked at the stars once in a while.\n\nNow we live inside \"Rooms\", in huge collections of  unhappy people (cities), all trying to follow the same false myth.\n\nA myth that never makes anyone happy, except for brief moments that are almost tolerable.\n\nCarlos was at war with that myth, as we all must be if we want to learn sorcery.\n\nSo when it turned out that the entire female population of private classes knew that the \"Doctor\" was secretly planning to marry one of the Canadian brothers, and no one had warned Carlos, he  called it an \"attack\".\n\nHe said, \"We're under attack!\"\n\nAnd we were.\n\nBut to clueless followers of the \"Free Labor\" myth, it seemed delusional.  Even the gay ones had fashioned themselves a cozy myth somewhat the same as the non-gay version.  Cling to people for happiness.  That's all there is.  Attention from each other.\n\nAfter all, what could be more natural than finding yourself a true love, so you can live happily ever after?\n\nOdd no one notices, that never works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Facebook Feed", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xc96ywbtv7261": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xc96ywbtv7261.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ade87405f0943056333763e3c715c05759dbab"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xc96ywbtv7261.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed4af1c64cab502e6b381e5a0e0d9820ddc3a307"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xc96ywbtv7261.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef2fba1a7604bde966bf46aa53aac2922176e514"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xc96ywbtv7261.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4219f395811b0597ad29f27ecaade4ef03517e5"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xc96ywbtv7261.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b146315576224231624911f875b377b9bdaa819"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xc96ywbtv7261.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75525072234bed2ab0876d5e764f36765a6dbf67"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xc96ywbtv7261.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66efb02decd54d8e478ae34a6c6ba6f2c7e6237"}, "id": "xc96ywbtv7261"}}, "name": "t3_k3dra1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 21, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCQVnSOFqfM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 459, "scrolling": false, "height": 344}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "Father and Son (lyrics) - Cat Stevens", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCQVnSOFqfM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 344, "width": 459, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "jennys YT", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JCQVnSOFqfM/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/GirlzRockerz"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCQVnSOFqfM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 459, "scrolling": false, "media_domain_url": "https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/k3dra1", "height": 344}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-Bo3GzgGBbEICEOZExGAFQn05NmrmDhQvgQaXWhc1co.jpg", "edited": 1606771885.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1606672281.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xc96ywbtv7261.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e66efb02decd54d8e478ae34a6c6ba6f2c7e6237\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s not an exaggeration.

Attention from each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, what could be more natural than finding yourself a true love, so you can live happily ever after?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Odd no one notices, that never works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/VdFn7QSTdwpjng8JTBEuvPLznnm4yDkg3zoaswRR6a4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ed4fc80f39bf8380d03ba7408c3963b21699a3fa", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/VdFn7QSTdwpjng8JTBEuvPLznnm4yDkg3zoaswRR6a4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e98d18273f59f07395260ca7c4987e020508cbf8", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/VdFn7QSTdwpjng8JTBEuvPLznnm4yDkg3zoaswRR6a4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28b72ba88ae9b60195e0d0dc5989864fe60fe0f0", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/VdFn7QSTdwpjng8JTBEuvPLznnm4yDkg3zoaswRR6a4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=708cde1334f6efe71cc49baf6e2ad03b402a84f5", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "rV3LdGtJLjv1-9nH4wVPs7OPI4OB60Qpo_IUPFQyx8w"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "k3dra1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "Father and Son (lyrics) - Cat Stevens", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCQVnSOFqfM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 344, "width": 459, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "jennys YT", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JCQVnSOFqfM/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/GirlzRockerz"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/k3dra1/facebook_feed/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/k3dra1/facebook_feed/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1606672281.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_k3dra1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ge5um7q", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1606754782.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ge4dx8x", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I copy Carlos.

Even in Daoism or Buddhism, you can't find such a place.\n\nDoesn't matter.

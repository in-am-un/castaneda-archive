They bounce off his head, and give an extra sheen to the silver hair with its curls drawn back across his scalp. I stop on my walk ---- not because he looks at me, because he doesn't. He has never seen me before, yet he yells my name out loud against the thunderclaps as he looks up at the naked body of the crucified Christ.\n\n\"Martin!\"\n\nIt's a cry for help. I do nothing but remain where I am as the rain falls.\n\n\"Come here and look at this!\"\n\nI step up to his side, and we both raise our heads toward the face of Jesus.\n\n\"Tell me what's wrong about this, and what's right.\"\n\n\"Is it a riddle?\" I ask.\n\n\"The only riddle is why I am asking you, and not telling you.\"\n\n\"It's wrong that Jesus was killed?\" I suggest.\n\n\"You have a simple mind. Maybe that's a virtue in you. Can you absorb all that I am going to tell you? We'll see. First I will tell you what is wrong about this statue. It is pathetic that this crucifix is here. People paid good money to have this piece of wood carved, painted, and erected. What purpose does it serve? Every time they come and go along this road, they are faced with death. Christ is not about dying. He is about eternal life. Not death, but resurrection. If people want a symbol by the side of the road, then let them build an empty tomb. At least such a structure could shelter passersby from the rain...\n\n\"...This morbid fascination with death kills the spirit. But tell me, what is good about it?\"\n\n\"The craftsmanship?\"\n\n\"Nonsense. You go past this statue on your walk, every day. Do you ever stop and stare at it as I was doing?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. Not for so long.\"\n\n\"That's fine, as it happens. There is not so much to see. I am a sculptor myself, so you can take my word for the quality of the piece. But you can never know this much for yourself, not about sculpture or anything, any work of man or nature, unless you spend time staring into it. Tune yourself to where you're looking, Martin. Open wide and see if there is a message for you there. If there is, you will know it from your eyes. They will vibrate. You will take in the energy of its creator. If you stare at a tree or flower, you take in the energy of the universe. Stare at a statue, and you take in the energy of the sculptor. The devotion in that sculptor was slight. There is little that is universal there. But there was some care as he formed this image of the male human body. You can see he ran his hands over the wooden skin. What value there is in this sculpture is in the surface alone. The statue had painted flesh but no heart, no guts. Still it's a body, nonetheless. That's our goodness, Martin.\"\n\n\"The body is our goodness?\"\n\n\"Perfect. You're learning. My time may not be wasted. Yes, the joy of being human is living in a body. It's fine to have a body as an emblem of religion, even if it is a dead one...\"\n\n\"...There's some work you can't do outside of a body. If people could just get a hint of that, they'd thrill to being alive.\"\n\nWe reach the steps that lead up to my house and he trots up them, as though leading me to his own home. The door is unlocked. He kicks off his shoes in the entryway and steps inside.\n\n\"Welcome,\" he says and spreads his arms wide to hug me as I step inside to join him. The hug squeezes my arms to my sides and leaves me breathless. He holds me longer than is right. It feels like he is taking and impression of my body into the flesh of his own...\"\n\n...\"I come like this, like this storm in your life, but it is necessary. I blow in, I make things fresh and clear for you, then I blow out again. Things can grow after a storm like the one I bring. You need new growth, yes, Martin?\"\n\nI'm too numb to nod my head, so I just stare at him.\n\n\"It is so. You were dead, and now you are alive. You have many years ahead of you. Me, I have this short reprieve. Just a brief while longer to jump around in my own body. I share what I can with you before I go. And now I give you what makes my body still work as it does. I give you my name.\"\n\nHe holds out his hand. I take it in mine and we shake.\n\n\"Carlos,\" he says. \"Carlos Castaneda.\"\n\nThere was a power in the handshake, like a whiteout that left my mind blank. I don't know how it worked. I can only say I felt more drained than charged as a result.\n\n\"*The* Carlos Castaneda?\" I ask at last.\n\nHe grins, lifts his hands in the air, and spins around on his right foot before clicking his heels at a standstill again to present himself.\n\n\"But you can't be... you're dead.\"\n\nThe smile goes from his face and he flashes into anger. \"Who told you so?\"\n\n\"It was reported.

A very powerful sorceress.   I believe she was battling with the Gods.\n\nTaiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Malaysia is where Asian sorcerers fled to, when the communists took over.\n\nBut that huge Island of Taiwan, easily visible from the shores of south China, was always attractive to recluses.\n\nNot to mention, the natives will offer you a granddaughter.  Dutch sailors used to travel there just for that purpose (and to  hunt their unique deer).\n\nI was offered one (sort of).\n\nI had a reputation as a drunken computer sorcerer looking for a far too young mate.    \n\nPossibly that was from bringing 2 such women up to the saunas and getting drunk with them half the night.\n\nWhen I checked into the hotel resort on Mt. Ali, they knew all the westerner alcohol would be gone in 2 days.\n\nThey didn't keep much. I was likely the first white person ever seen by any children under 18, living up there.\n\nThe girl I was sort of offered was the granddaughter of a tea farm owner on Mt. Ali.  The tea farm owner also owned half the resort.\n\nOr maybe it was the granddaughter of his assistant, who was the old woman who brought her out while I sat with the tea farm owner in his office.\n\nHe'd previously been trying to set the Taiwanese Bosses' son up with his daughter, but that didn't work out.\n\nI had plans for him to marry Jenna, the double woman.\n\nI guess the tea farm owner was still in matchmaking mode, having failed with the first match.\n\nThe girl was stunning.  Chinese, but with the larger features of natives. I doubt her hair had ever been cut.\n\nShe looked 19 and had a T shirt reading, \"I Love Jakarta!\"\n\nJakarta is an Islamic hellhole.

A very powerful sorceress.

Dutch sailors used to travel there just for that purpose (and to  hunt their unique deer).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was offered one (sort of).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a reputation as a drunken computer sorcerer looking for a far too young mate.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly that was from bringing 2 such women up to the saunas and getting drunk with them half the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I checked into the hotel resort on Mt. Ali, they knew all the westerner alcohol would be gone in 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t keep much. I was likely the first white person ever seen by any children under 18, living up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl I was sort of offered was the granddaughter of a tea farm owner on Mt. Ali.  The tea farm owner also owned half the resort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it was the granddaughter of his assistant, who was the old woman who brought her out while I sat with the tea farm owner in his office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d previously been trying to set the Taiwanese Bosses&amp;#39; son up with his daughter, but that didn&amp;#39;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had plans for him to marry Jenna, the double woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the tea farm owner was still in matchmaking mode, having failed with the first match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl was stunning.  Chinese, but with the larger features of natives. I doubt her hair had ever been cut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked 19 and had a T shirt reading, &amp;quot;I Love Jakarta!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jakarta is an Islamic hellhole.

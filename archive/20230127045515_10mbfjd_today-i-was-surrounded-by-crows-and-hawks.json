It's on a very precarious of highway right in the middle of a freeway interchange and it would have been hard by myself. So we get bundled up and head out the door, hit our first errand stop not even 5 minutes away from the house and I am overcome with nausea.

My nausea turned into full vertigo and I tried to walk it off in the cold so I sent my partner on the rest of his errands while I cooled down. I was dragging myself to some trees in a field behind the road we were on and on my path in front of me was a mug that said \"circle of life\" on it.

I cannot mess with the circle of life. \n\nWell there were other plans for me. We had to go home as I was throwing up and became violently ill. It was miserable. As I was calming down, I laid in bed and put on Carlos' book I've been listening to. I was almost asleep and it came to this part where Don Juan was taking Carlos up to spend the night on a hill. When he told him his intention, a Crow flew overhead and he immediately changed his mind. That snapped me out of my stupor very fast.

I started chuckling as I was justifying my actions of getting this bird off the freeway by saying that I would return it to a more natural spot away from the road into trees with other animals. I cannot mess with the circle of life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well there were other plans for me. We had to go home as I was throwing up and became violently ill. It was miserable. As I was calming down, I laid in bed and put on Carlos&amp;#39; book I&amp;#39;ve been listening to. I was almost asleep and it came to this part where Don Juan was taking Carlos up to spend the night on a hill. When he told him his intention, a Crow flew overhead and he immediately changed his mind. That snapped me out of my stupor very fast. I spent the rest of the evening doing dark room practice and it was great. I do feel I&amp;#39;ve learned my lessons on my connections with the crows. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, This is something I need to ask but don&amp;#39;t want to make a full post on..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was scanning, I was going back into some of my happy memories and it pulled me into the memory of this fellow who called himself a &amp;quot;Shaman&amp;quot; but had nefarious purposes with me. I didn&amp;#39;t have a good experience with him. As I was pondering on him, I heard a voice say &amp;quot;he is a Dark Initiator.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve never heard that term before, but I&amp;#39;m pretty confident I know what it is. Have you had any experiences with that or any knowledge? My 2 minute Google search was a bit scary and not necessarily the path I&amp;#39;m comfortable to go on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_10mbfjd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10mbfjd/today_i_was_surrounded_by_crows_and_hawks/j6i5li2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1675089519.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j63qxyp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1674830239.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10mbfjd", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Read about \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nThat's the basis of \"omens\".\n\nIt's not obvious in the books, but the connection to \"seeing' is pretty clear.\n\nAnd SK is merely a new name for seeing that Carlos gave us.

I thought that I would have to fight tooth and nail to quiet the internal dialog, which I knew would be a journey for me because my brain is constantly busy needing a song or thought or several conversations at once just to feel relaxed. I have ADHD among other things. I became intune to the chaos, and it felt like peace. Or, it felt like the only thing I've known. Throughout my childhood my story is basically the same. Bad home, chaos, constantly on edge to stay safe. As a kid whenever I would relax is when things would get bad again, so maybe I learned never to relax or feel at peace. I've been in therapy, working on why and how I cope. Long story short, that's a bit about who I am. I grew up with spiritual experiences I couldn't explain, and nobody around me knew what to do. I wasn't allowed to talk about it. I found this community after years of researching various religions, practices, cultures, just trying to find answers. In each religion there were some similarities, in each practice there was some truth, and in each culture there were some shared experiences. But in each of these there were more pieces missing than ones that connected. \n\nThis community was a shock to me, and it took me reading several posts before I could understand terminology to be honest, but I remember thinking to myself \"I found it\", because finally all the pieces fit together and my experience wasn't alone and I understood where I was. I read through the wiki, I read post after post, I researched in the community and searched through posts from several years ago and kept up to date with current ones. I was finally able to move forward with my learning and progress instead of just scrounging around to find a baseline for my understanding.\n\nWhile there are many different things in this community to learn, one thing that keeps coming back is that silence is the key. The journey to Silent Knowledge starts at a base of internal silence. The Darkroom, Tensegrity, Passes and Dream work all seem to be tools to move the process forward but they won't work without silence. I remembered a while ago that in therapy we would use this device for biofeedback, it was basically just a head monitor that would sense your brain patterns and respond with audio to help you learn to focus and calm down. I remembered that when using the device, each time I had a thought I would hear the rain get louder (or ocean waves..) and each time I was calm, and quiet, I would hear birds chirping. I thought for sure I discovered something and so I bought the device from my savings, and as soon as it arrived at the end of June I began to use it to research my own brain. The device is called \"MUSE 2: The Brain Sensing Headband\" for anyone interested, it has a mobile app that it connects to through bluetooth. I'll go over my findings next. \n\nFor the 1st week or 2 I established basic use of the app and its functions, -what stressors or environments change or affect the readings-, and I found its a very steady program. In the quiet of my own home, at a friend's house, and in public, it seemed to read solely on my own responses. It reads physical movements, mental activity/thought pressure, and heart rate. I would start at sessions of 20-30 minutes, but as I was learning the app I would sometimes practice for an hour or more. Once I was used to the device I would experiment with different types of thoughts, memories, emotional concepts, to see just how much it picks up and of what kind. \n\nI've experimented now with the concept of nothingness. I've heard silence described as calm, bliss, peace, and so I would use keywords to try and find what responses the device gave, how deep of calm I could go. \n\nI would give myself a pretty active brainwave with busy thoughts for the machine to calibrate, that way the range I could get into the calm state was average. As I progressed in the experience I would start sessions in a calm state (as the machine is calibrating I would set calm as the average) and so I could test and go deeper. I started 10 minute sessions of deep breathing and using one word, and repeated the trail if I was interrupted or got distracted so that each trial was given equal chance. 10 minutes, deep breath in, deep breath out, think of the word, deep breath in.\n\nSilence is deeper than repeating a mantra, but I was trying to find the correct mental state and less of the correct words, I was just using the words as a step to invoke the right response. \n\n'Calm' \n'Bliss' \n'Peace' \n\nBut I experimented with a new word and found even better results. 'Nothing'. But even more important, the concept of Nothing. \n\nThis sounds very technical and I guess it is, but the word 'nothing' is still something. It's letters, 'n.o.t.h.i.n.g' combined together and given meaning. Nothing equals empty, equals zero, equals open space. The best way to describe internal silence is the gap between thoughts, the 'nothing'. So I experimented in two different ways; I did several sessions focusing on the word \"nothing\", and several sessions on the feeling \"nothing\". Both had induced an extremely deep state of being, of silence. On the chart it showed going from near the top neutral state swan diving down to the lower calm. I felt deeply relaxed and warm/soft like you feel before you fall asleep, but I was fully aware and clear minded. I spent 20 minutes easily in this state, it went by incredibly fast, and I held it comfortably. I didn't have to fight any thoughts, it felt natural. That's because it is. The ego / our internal dialogue, fills us with information and traps to catch our attention but we don't need it. We exist outside our internal dialogue, we always have. \n\nSince I've discovered and experienced this myself, I've noticed a higher awareness in my waking state. I can sit comfortably with myself. Meditation is also easier now that I know the feeling of nothingness. I've never had this before. I can settle, and hold this state, and every now and then a stray thought may start up but it's actually rare now, and to dismiss it all I have to do is 'huh,' and let it drift off or remind myself 'there is nothing I need to think about'. I think the most important part is to give yourself time, set aside 30 minutes to start if you want, but allow yourself to try. It's easy to try and meditate from a state of avoidance because you fear change, I guess I did this for a while. I would medicate and fight with my thoughts and give up because 'maybe I'm not good enough, I'm doing it wrong, I tried I guess it just doesn't work'.\n\nSilence always works.

You'll feel it's a waste of time.\n\nI could go into the reasons.\n\nBut just know, forget it. No one ever made that work, and there are lecture notes where Carlos explains clearly why. And if you ran into someone who claims they made it work, keep running.\n\nIt's hopeless for the men.\n\nFor the women it might be possible, but it won't contain the kind of motivations that keep them going.\n\nThey probably need some positive comments along the way, despite their amazing talent.\n\nAnd no one likes real magic. No one.\n\nSo don't expect any compliments, even if you're a super talented woman.\n\nYou'll only get crap over it.\n\nBut if you combine a man who can do waking dreaming, and a woman who can get lucid in sleeping dreaming, you can have all kinds of fun.\n\nYou must be patient though.\n\nThe most important picture of all didn't fit on that page.\n\nSo I'll just describe it.\n\nYou can see the man trying to lead the woman out of some kind of dark tunnel, into his own darkroom.\n\nShe's 6000 miles away.\n\nActually that was me.\n\nI couldn't feel her arm, and  yet I did feel \"something\".\n\nNot that I needed to. She was as clear as you see there.\n\nIt was even a tiny bit frightening.  It's an absolutely dark room!  There should not be any \"witches\" walking towards you, from a dark tunnel.\n\nTo the left, I could see the other end of the tunnel.  But I could only make out plants in the distance.\n\nThe witch didn't respond to me telling her the way was open, and she should just start walking forward.\n\nSo I tried to walk to her side of the tunnel.\n\nBut as soon as I entered, I lost sight of everyone but some trees. I was trying to walk into an area you couldn't even enter on foot, without a machete.\n\nSo I backed out, and returned to my darkroom.\n\nThe witch noticed. Or got tired of waiting. She started to walk towards me.\n\nI thought, \"This is great!!! Finally. And what can go wrong now?\"\n\nI could clearly see the woman was walking directly towards me, but when she got to \"my side of the tunnel\", it turned out she was walking at an angle.\n\nShe walked at a 45 degree angle relative to me, going right past me on the right.\n\nTowards Cholita's territory.\n\nIt was as if her \"dream\" was not properly aligned to my \"dream\", so that they were at an angle to each other.\n\nThere was simply no way for her to walk into mine.\n\nShe was in another \"physical space\".\n\nI couldn't warn her.  Even though I heard sounds coming from the tunnel.\n\nSome blood curdling.  People shouting, a dog barking.  Maybe.\n\nStuff bumping into other stuff.\n\nBut all \"submerged\". So that I couldn't tell which side of the tunnel it came from.\n\nFor a while I was worried it was Cholita.\n\nShe seems to have set up an \"attention trap\" of some kind.\n\nShe's aware of the witch lately.\n\nNo way to know for sure if she has plans to capture the witch.\n\nBut it was quiet on Cholita's side of the house.  Didn't seem to be any threat coming from there.\n\nI remembered the sounds.  The blood curdling ones. But which were so soft, you couldn't really get frightened.  You just knew \"you ought to be\".\n\nI used to hear those as a very small child.\n\nThey're \"the sounds you can always hear\".\n\nSo the witch walked towards my darkroom, but kept going. She never arrived.\n\nLater I was doing Tensegrity, and found she was floating around me curling in and out of the arm movements, like they created a wind that sucked her over there.\n\nI gazed at her to see if she was flying, but it looked like she was simply in a dream.  And unaware of following my movements.\n\nIt wasn't until 2 hours later that I finally saw her, in my darkroom.\n\nI was viewing silent knowledge, sitting on the bed on pillows.\n\nI saw her to my right.\n\nShe was walking in from Cholita's side of the house.  In fact, Cholita most often entered from there when she  used to visit me at night in her double.\n\nThe witch's double was as clear as the real thing standing right there next to my bed, except she was all blue. And glowing.\n\nCholita has never been that color in her double. She's either black and white, which can be amazingly bright like an angel, or she's green.\n\nI don't know what that means, but it was nice to see a witch's double in my room again.\n\nCholita hasn't done that in more than a year.\n\nCholita switched to remote viewing.  After she caught me remote viewing her, and blocked it.\n\nI suppose I \"showed her how\".  And that caused me to get less visits from her double.\n\nAs you see \"the witch of the tunnel\" doing in that picture.  In the upper left picture. The pink woman.  That's what a remote viewing witch can look like.\n\nIs that the same being as the double?  Or as the dreaming phantom swirling around Kylie in that picture.\n\nLast night it was me she was swirling around.\n\nI have no idea...\n\nIn fact, there could be 3 different beings in that picture.\n\nBest thing you can do is stop caring about that, and just be grateful to see such amazing sights!\n\nIt's done sober, fully awake, eyes open.\n\nNo one does that but *seers*.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Manifestations of Shared Dreaming", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"7kjunmly15f91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7kjunmly15f91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=342361128e791e0689845d79eea87d2dc66726fe"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7kjunmly15f91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd479c21dad33928c07a53b0d34b9127e4b719cb"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7kjunmly15f91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5555c4de7623769e155d5665b2f9b496fe233c3"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7kjunmly15f91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3de9d099b7bfa4d586fe0b5ae87fe0438ff4e78c"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7kjunmly15f91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8fc07072ca1af60692eb15ec7c727d01c11aeb7"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7kjunmly15f91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6504fbe13d14f984402c86b8b9b31d003c160f28"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7kjunmly15f91.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8c38ad1a18e3b245c995cd409f1b3b5b851b1f4"}, "id": "7kjunmly15f91"}}, "name": "t3_wdocdg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BLy8h5EDKbDQBB-H-5N7n66mFRWNak4JIJYXkHCsqhs.jpg", "edited": 1659379062.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659377763.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7kjunmly15f91.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c8c38ad1a18e3b245c995cd409f1b3b5b851b1f4\"&gt;Only a fraction of what I did last night.

The double surely remembers being that age too!\n\nAnd in ordinary dreams, the double can even \"watch\" like an audience.  So it has no need for a \"body\".\n\nNormally the double wanders around infinity,  lost.\n\nWhich is not useful for teaching an apprentice.\n\nAn apprentice like Cholita has a double which comes visit all by itself.  It's visiting Cholita.\n\nThat's not always the case. It's perhaps only 1 in 200 who have a double that \"comes around\".\n\nWhich as Carlos said,  makes such a person valuable because it \"Gives a sorcerer access\" to the apprentice's double.\n\nBut what if Grant (a male from the inner circle) having to be \"Naked Guy #2\" in infinity theater, caused his double to show up.\n\nOr to begin hanging out around Carlos, to figure out if that was going to happen again in the next infinity theater.\n\n\"Got the double worried\".\n\nHere's another possibility.\n\nOur modern obsession with mating relationships and rules uses up most of our energy.\n\nDidn't the witches say, our only source of dreaming energy is sexual?\n\nIt's NOT normal for humans to be obsessed with such tight mating relationships.\n\nIt's part of agriculture, and it's very messed up.  Unnatural.\n\nChimps don't get married.\n\nAnd the female chips would probably not like that idea at all.  They get \"offers\" constantly.\n\nEven the \"grandma\" chimps have young suitors.\n\nWho offer them half a squirrel (not the tail half if she's still a good looking chimp).\n\nHumans are in fact, \"totally screwed up\", with mating rituals and rules.\n\nSo maybe, one of the women Carlos was trying to teach who was let \"into the inner circle\" had a much better chance if she thought she'd \"ruined\" her ability to follow the mating rules of exclusivity.\n\nIf she literally slept with Carlos, she was now \"his woman\".\n\nLa Gorda said as much.\n\nAnd maybe that has an immediate effect on the double's behavior.\n\nWe have a tool now!

The double surely remembers being that age too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in ordinary dreams, the double can even &amp;quot;watch&amp;quot; like an audience.  So it has no need for a &amp;quot;body&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally the double wanders around infinity,  lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is not useful for teaching an apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An apprentice like Cholita has a double which comes visit all by itself.

It&amp;#39;s perhaps only 1 in 200 who have a double that &amp;quot;comes around&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which as Carlos said,  makes such a person valuable because it &amp;quot;Gives a sorcerer access&amp;quot; to the apprentice&amp;#39;s double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if Grant (a male from the inner circle) having to be &amp;quot;Naked Guy #2&amp;quot; in infinity theater, caused his double to show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to begin hanging out around Carlos, to figure out if that was going to happen again in the next infinity theater.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Got the double worried&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another possibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our modern obsession with mating relationships and rules uses up most of our energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t the witches say, our only source of dreaming energy is sexual?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s NOT normal for humans to be obsessed with such tight mating relationships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s part of agriculture, and it&amp;#39;s very messed up.  Unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chimps don&amp;#39;t get married.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the female chips would probably not like that idea at all.

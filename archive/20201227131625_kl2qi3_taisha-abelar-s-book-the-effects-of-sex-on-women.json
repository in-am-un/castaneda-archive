It requires daytime full-on heightened awareness, which is a tall order.    If you don't see fairies flying around in the air calling to the angels to come play, you won't be able to see those \"worms\".\n\nAnd it's hard to pay attention to Fairies, when there's a Cinnabon store staring you in the face, right next to a Ma Bo Tofu restaurant.\n\nBesides, if someone told me men leave their car keys inside women, and not worms,  I might have seen those instead.\n\nBut in fact, I could even describe them.  They looked a bit violent to me.  Vibrating, changing locations by just a tiny bit, as if they could not be located in any specific place.\n\nAnd they were brilliant primary colors.  Red, blue, and maybe green. It's been 10 years, so hard to remember.  They were not very long.  Around 2 or 3 feet long, but curved in on themselves.  \n\nIf you see half a worm dried up on the sidewalk from the last rain, and it's not stretched out, it's curvy instead, they looked like someone painted a few of those with fluorescent primary paint.  And spaced them in the torso area, so that they weren't in any danger of touching.\n\nHowever, Cholita insists she takes more energy from men than they do from her.  So if those worms are implanted, she doesn't seem concerned.\n\nActually she said, she takes more energy from \"luscious men\".  \n\nSo maybe that wouldn't cover me.  According to Cholita, I've gone to pot since Carlos died.\n\nAnd Cholita kicks butt. \n\nShe's crazy, but that double of hers is very powerful.  I have no doubt, in sex Cholita comes out on top.\n\nWait...  \n\nOne time we were driving in the darkness.  I was enjoying her dark energy while  Cholita was quiet for at least 30 minutes.\n\nAnd then out of nowhere she mumbled, \"I have to be on top.\"\n\nAll I could say was, \"What? What did you say Cholita????\"\n\nAlso, Carlos told me to be celibate, so I did.\n\nBut then I was invited to be lovers with Florinda.  By Corey of all people.  \n\nSend the lawyer? Is that the plan?\n\nAnd according to Pat and Linda,  Cleargreen had \"orgies\" going on.  \n\nMy opinion: If you get sucked into the \"happily ever after\" preproduction myth, you'll suffer endlessly. \n\nAnd you won't be able to escape, as long as you still believe in that.\n\nBecause, it takes a lot of time to escape.  In the books, people commonly spent weeks at don Juan's compound, practicing things.  Carlos must have 200-800 hours in finger wiggling alone.\n\nThe people in here are finding it difficult to come up with 3 hours a day.   Probably they figure they'll lie, do only 2 hours, and then as it turns out, 1 hour is all they actually do.\n\nWell...  Maybe 45 minutes.\n\nBad men!!! \n\n(Doesn't matter with women).\n\n If you're going to do that at least admit it, so we don't build up the idea you can put in your 3 hours, and it isn't effective.\n\nDon't lie if it harms others.\n\nAnd some find it impossible to make a dark room.\n\nThat's a family problem.  If you are alone, or with an angry witch who wants to murder you as I am,  making a dark room is easy.\n\nIf you got sucked into the myth, your family won't like you sitting in the dark talking to demons.\n\nHere's the deal: This is VERY hard!  \n\nWhy do you think it's all fake out there?  Fake yogis, fake Buddhist, fake Daoists.\n\nIf you haven't figured out it's all fake, you probably just aren't old enough.\n\nIt's all fake our there, because the real thing takes real work.  \n\nBut to pretend you have the real thing takes almost no work.\n\nAnd that gives most people all they really wanted. Attention.\n\nSo, just give it a try, and if something seems to be stopping it from working, then figure that out.  \n\nWhen you get there.\n\nIf you try to fix everything first you might feel satisfied, and not get around to actually doing some work.\n\nLet's take Reni's fixation with sugar. That was her helpful Covid announcement: \n\nCut back on sugar, so your immune system is stronger.\n\nMyself, I recommend either eat sugar as you like, until you have a problem with it hurting your sorcery, or, and this is the preferred method, get yourself a 5 pound box of Sees Candy, skip breakfast and lunch, and \"test it out\" one night.\n\nIn the darkroom.\n\nPractice until you see puffs of color, then pick a candy at random.\n\nSee if the fruit ones have a worse effect than the caramel.\n\nPlease invite me for that one.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gh7kbuk", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s never a good idea to be too sure about something you only saw on just one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw it on multiple women going by on an airport people conveyor belt, in Bangkok airport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since then I have not tried to see it.

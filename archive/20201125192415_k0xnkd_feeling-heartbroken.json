You can't really understand that book until you are good at darkroom gazing, which might be why it was lost.\n\nCholita had a copy all this time, and Carlos arranged for Cholita to come to me now.  But she didn't do her job and bring the book. She only brought the knowledge of it to me.\n\nWhich is good!  We had to discover everything in there ourselves. That's always nice, when you discover some magic all by yourself, and then read about it in one of the books. It's like a \"verification\" you are doing it right.\n\nDidn't you ever see don Juan's, \"River of Filth\" story?\n\nCholita made a picture of it to share, but it's sort of buried in everything.\n\nI'll tell it.  We were born into a prison.  A chicken coop. We're all food for something else.\n\nIf a chicken tries to escape, even sticking just a single toe through the fence of the chicken coop, the other chickens begin to peck his head.\n\nThat chicken begins to bleed on his head, and the other chickens will pick on his scalp to eat his blood, until it dies.\n\nBut if it returns into the chicken coop and hides, they leave it alone.\n\nThat's the \"simple\" explanation of our situation. The one given openly.\n\nThe \"River of Filth\" is too much for most to take, so it didn't come up much in workshops or classes.\n\nIt is as you found, a little shocking. And rude.\n\nWe all live in a river of filth.\n\nIt's so thick, you can hardly breath.\n\nSome sink all the way to the bottom of the river of filth, and you can barely see a few bubbles coming up once in a while.\n\nInside the river of filth, it's \"cozy\".  Warm, like a mud bath.\n\nOutside the river, on the shore, it's cold.  Not cozy at all.\n\nWhile in the river, we piss and poop on each other all day long.\n\nIf you watch, you'll realize that's true.\n\nIt's our idea of \"self\".  We pretend to be something we are not.  And if another says, \"You're not all that!\", we attack.\n\nWe attack so quickly, everyone in the river has learned not to tell the truth about those around them.  You'll be punished.\n\nSo everyone can behave as badly as they like, as long as they allow everyone else to behave badly.\n\nBut, they're all very unhappy people, so they take pleasure in spreading their suffering.\n\nYou must have read something by a person like that. Harming others with his word about Castaneda.  Pissing and pooping on them.  Each successive statement in what you read, is like the guy shaking his dick to dribble more urine onto your feet.  \"Finish you off\" is what he's thinking.\n\nYou can see that in subreddits, where people argue viciously and there are even \"trolls\", who only want to hurt others.\n\nWe piss and poop all over each other, constantly.\n\nThere are sorcerers waiting on the shore.  If you climb out, they'll wash you off.\n\nAnd when people get out, they take a look around. They realize it's magical!\n\nBut it's cold.  It's not cozy.  Even the sorcerers around them are not cozy.  They're as cold as it is outside the river.    Empty.\n\nSo most go back to the river.  If they plan on staying in the river, they never return to the shore.\n\nWorse, they'll try even harder to stop others from leaving.\n\nWe've had a few in here. Former private class mates of mine, who didn't like to hear that it's working for so many people.\n\nBefore this subreddit, they told everyone Carlos was a fake.  They even made web pages to attack him, such as sustained action.\n\nAnd there are angry men out there, who believe they can get some attention inside the river of filth, by pretending to be outside it at the same time.\n\nThose come  here to attack also.\n\nThat's why you were accused of having bad *intent*.\n\nYou sounded like another self-absorbed angry male who won't ever actually learn.\n\nBut so did 1 or 2 others in here, who now are very skilled darkroom gazers.\n\nThey got out of the river of filth a little, and realized there's no point in pissing and pooping on other people.", "edited": 1606421831.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gdp4eia", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you did read all of them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; book is also excellent, but it&amp;#39;s more advanced.

It&amp;#39;s like a &amp;quot;verification&amp;quot; you are doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t you ever see don Juan&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;River of Filth&amp;quot; story?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita made a picture of it to share, but it&amp;#39;s sort of buried in everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll tell it.  We were born into a prison.  A chicken coop. We&amp;#39;re all food for something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a chicken tries to escape, even sticking just a single toe through the fence of the chicken coop, the other chickens begin to peck his head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That chicken begins to bleed on his head, and the other chickens will pick on his scalp to eat his blood, until it dies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it returns into the chicken coop and hides, they leave it alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; explanation of our situation. The one given openly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;River of Filth&amp;quot; is too much for most to take, so it didn&amp;#39;t come up much in workshops or classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is as you found, a little shocking. And rude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all live in a river of filth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so thick, you can hardly breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some sink all the way to the bottom of the river of filth, and you can barely see a few bubbles coming up once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the river of filth, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot;.  Warm, like a mud bath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside the river, on the shore, it&amp;#39;s cold.  Not cozy at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in the river, we piss and poop on each other all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you watch, you&amp;#39;ll realize that&amp;#39;s true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s our idea of &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;.  We pretend to be something we are not.  And if another says, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not all that!&amp;quot;, we attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We attack so quickly, everyone in the river has learned not to tell the truth about those around them.  You&amp;#39;ll be punished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So everyone can behave as badly as they like, as long as they allow everyone else to behave badly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, they&amp;#39;re all very unhappy people, so they take pleasure in spreading their suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must have read something by a person like that. Harming others with his word about Castaneda.  Pissing and pooping on them.  Each successive statement in what you read, is like the guy shaking his dick to dribble more urine onto your feet.  &amp;quot;Finish you off&amp;quot; is what he&amp;#39;s thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see that in subreddits, where people argue viciously and there are even &amp;quot;trolls&amp;quot;, who only want to hurt others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We piss and poop all over each other, constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are sorcerers waiting on the shore.  If you climb out, they&amp;#39;ll wash you off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when people get out, they take a look around. They realize it&amp;#39;s magical!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s cold.  It&amp;#39;s not cozy.  Even the sorcerers around them are not cozy.  They&amp;#39;re as cold as it is outside the river.    Empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So most go back to the river.  If they plan on staying in the river, they never return to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, they&amp;#39;ll try even harder to stop others from leaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve had a few in here. Former private class mates of mine, who didn&amp;#39;t like to hear that it&amp;#39;s working for so many people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before this subreddit, they told everyone Carlos was a fake.  They even made web pages to attack him, such as sustained action.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are angry men out there, who believe they can get some attention inside the river of filth, by pretending to be outside it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those come  here to attack also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why you were accused of having bad &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You sounded like another self-absorbed angry male who won&amp;#39;t ever actually learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But so did 1 or 2 others in here, who now are very skilled darkroom gazers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They got out of the river of filth a little, and realized there&amp;#39;s no point in pissing and pooping on other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_k0xnkd", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/k0xnkd/feeling_heartbroken/gdp4eia/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1606421540.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1606421540.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gdom8fa", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "blec_efron", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gdokx8x", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_12ywct", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I could only give faith these credits and indirectly to my uncle.

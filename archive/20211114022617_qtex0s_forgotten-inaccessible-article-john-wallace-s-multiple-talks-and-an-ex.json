I believe intent is cutting us a break and speeding some up.\n\nBut in our efforts to try to perpetuate this, we're going to fail without a complete change in something.\n\nThere are 2 or 3 big problems.\n\nMy emphasis on \"magic in your face\", and the incredibly universal self-pity that dominates every new person we get here.\n\nSelf-pity they both feel for themselves, which motivates them to lie and pretend, but also self-pity among those more interested in finding a community, which causes them to stand up for the people who want to pretend the results.\n\nThe river of filth will drown our efforts in just one \"generation\".\n\nI've *seen* why, but even Carlos himself hadn't found the answer.\n\nHe tried to change course several times when I could observe him, and we know from lectures that he tried in the 80s and failed so badly, only Reni was considered salvagable.\n\nAnd let's face it.  Reni is incapable of replacing his efforts.  That whole thing has failed.  Hopefully Reni, Nyei, Kylie, and others closer to the inner circle, did not on a personal level.  But in handling the community, they obviously have.\n\nI believe, since I'm not able to figure out how to fix this, we have 3 choices.\n\nReturn to emphasizing the abstract cores,  try to do what Carlos was trying, which is sort of like trying to repair the tonal of our time in his students, or the more advanced in here put their  heads together, and toss out any remaining self-pity so they can see clearly what will happen if we don't rethink this.\n\nI'll give a concrete example, but it's hard to do that without stepping on someone's toes.\n\nSo, whoever finds this too close to home, don't worry about that.  You gave an early warning, so you helped.\n\nAgain, anyone working hard is in no danger of failing.  It's the new people who will fail as the overall community adjusts and absorbs this, and destroys it for greed.\n\nFor example, in private chat someone mentioned that Miguel Ruiz's trick has been to add the idea that love is something behind everything.\n\nEnd of story.  His students will all fail, and will spread severe damage whereever they tell that false narrative.\n\nAnd pretty much nothing can be done to change that, because there are always endless new and confused people who will go for any fake that comes along.\n\nYou could pay Miguel off to admit he's a fraud and go away, but that would just leave room for the current #2 fraud to rise up.  If you bribed him, #3 would rise up.\n\nI believe Carlos could see this.  It's not like you have to be clever.  *Seeing* is the one that brings this knowledge.  So automatically, when you start to clean your link to intent, that you get the \"news feed\" from infinity. About your situation.\n\nIf you want to think about it in a funny way, consider it to be like those old ticker tape machines in the 1930s business man office in a movie.  Always ticking away, putting out  that little strip of paper with messages on it.\n\nI was watching the feed tonight (don't take it too literally), and saw where it's currently hopeless.\n\nSo, that concrete example: A new  person claimed to have scooped up a purple puff long before that seems likely.\n\nAnd if you listen to their comments in both chat and posts, they are giving the impression they have all kinds of knowledge.\n\nSo they added the idea that they've already done what is very unlikely, and then encorporated it into their other pretend stuff,  and bragged how they'd taken the purple puff and used it for something completely unrelated to sorcery, obviously motivated by self-pity and pretending.\n\nThis is no different than the worst of the bad players we ever get, who comes in here and starts making up whatever it takes, to \"take over\".\n\nRunning crazy guy was a prime example. He just lied, and lied, and lied, and when caught, he'd ignore any arguments, and relentlessly lie again.\n\nUnfortunately, new people can't spot that.\n\nAnd if someone dares to stand up to such a bully, it stimulates the self-pity of new people (and unfortunately women more so), so that they see things as unfair and arbitrary.\n\nIt violates river of shit rules...\n\nI suppose my idea that if this stuff can be added to other things that's good, was naive.\n\nEven if they've gone down a weird path that is different from the Olmecs.\n\nWhich might be true, if you could keep things separate.\n\nBut you can't.  The other \"systems\" have the same problem we do.  New people want to take over, more than they want to learn. And the other systems are motivated by desire to survive, financially.\n\nSo whatever you put over there, won't become helpful to us.  It'll contribute to the destruction of this knowledge.\n\nWhich is inevitable, unless we figure out a new way for new people to understand this.\n\nWhich is likely the reason for the abstract cores.\n\nIn some ways, the abstract cores are an attempt to appeal to the worst motivations in apprentices, but fixate them on precisely what works, and de-emphasize what those bad motivations normally emphasize.\n\nIf  you don't get the part about appealing to the worst motivations, just consider Daoism. It appeals to angry men who like that idea that something is beyond anyone else's understanding, and all you have to do to get attention is pretend you understand it.\n\nThe abstract cores have that aspect too. A puzzle to solve, which makes you superior.\n\nBut they focus the self-pity filled apprentice on an idea that is beyond their control.  The spirit.\n\nBut the brilliant puffs of color are exactly the type of thing their bad motivations tend to emphasize.\n\nShowing off to others, to get attention.\n\nThey're willing to pretend that.\n\nAnd since 100% of what's out there is dominated by pretending, no one is going to notice it's pretend, and no one is going to feel ok with someone directly criticizing the pretenders.\n\nNo one will fix that.  Not at any point.\n\nSo there's 2 aspects there. One is what new people focus their attention on.\n\nThe other is the self-pity filled behavior of new people.\n\nIf  you could solve either problem, the remaining one would be solved.\n\nFor instance, self-pity can't stand up to dazzling magic, earned with hard effort.\n\nIt can pretend that, so the person never actually sees any and continues the belief it's all pretend, and that's normal.\n\nBut, when people really do get to see the real thing, they're cured enough of self-pity to be relatively safe from there out.\n\nCarlos thought he could \"fix\" the tonal of his followers.  Tensegrity and recap. But he died, so we'll never know if that was going to work.\n\nFor new people reading this, if he hadn't died his plan was to emphasize stopping the world next.\n\nBypass any attention seeking magic and go straight to fixing the tonal.\n\nWhich is a very specific strategy.\n\nCertainly Carlos knew about the puffs.  He even grinned at me while playing with one, just 2 feet away from me.  He was almost mocking me in his demonstration. As if he knew this was a very bad idea, considering what he knew about my tendancy to go out and write newsletters and convince others to work hard.\n\nHe knew with his death, the chance of success was extremely small, so he was willing to encorage me to do what he'd decided was a very bad idea.  But he also knew, magic in  your face was a bad motivation because it was so easy to corrupt that point of view.\n\nYes, someone who insists on the real thing is guaranteed to learn. But the next guy is perfectly willing to fake it.  He's the one you have to worry about. If you managed to emphasize fixing the tonal as Carlos was trying to do, that wouldn't sppeal at all to the fakers.  They aren't going to be able to pretend to be super powerful on recap.\n\nNo one will care. So they are unlikely to corrupt that path.\n\nI of course would try to put real magic into the recap, which could certainly be done. But then recap would be subject to pretending and destruction.\n\nSo what's an uncorruptable method to spread this?\n\nMaybe the abstract cores.\n\nOr more specfically, the idea that you are trying to interface to a living being (the spirit).\n\nAnd that it gave you the call in the first place (you were choosen) , but now you have to try to lure it, as if it were a wild animal who had to be lured very carefully.\n\nSeems like I must be out of space in this comment. And out of ideas.\n\nYou have to wonder if the old seers, going around murdering enemies, wasn't a better approach than we can do in modern times.  They did afterall create all this.  \n\nAnd they took pity on the dim witted among them, and allowed Men of Knowledge to be licensed, so they could perform social services needed by the community.\n\nThey likely only ate the bad players who couldn't be controlled.", "edited": 1636883451.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hkkh7ue", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why, but this seems like a good place to explain something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re failing here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be fixed, but it will take more knowledge than I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean to say, individuals who are putting in effort won&amp;#39;t succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some cases they&amp;#39;re learning faster than any genuine lineage students learned.

You can even forget in 10 minutes, and even if you try not to.\n\nWe forget a little less of it, doing our darkroom practice, because we weren't pushed there by surprise, and can connect the memories back to here, through how hard it was to move that far.\n\nThat's one reason I recommend the \"thumbs up\" technique to beginners. To leave some \"trail\" you can follow when you wake up the next day and largely forget what happened.\n\nEven if it doesn't bring back the memory, you at least know if it was a \"1 thumbs up night\", or a 6 thumbs up one.\n\nThat much  you can always remember.\n\nBut struck by a Nagual,  pushing your assemblage point all the way to the front, would be literally impossible to remember.\n\nNo reference point to locate it in the brain!\n\nLet's say I ask you what you had for dinner 3 months ago, on a random monday.\n\nNo luck.  You couldn't with just that information.\n\nIf I said, \"Sure you know. You were with that woman in the red dress.\"\n\nBingo.  You now have something to help you find the memory.\n\nSo Carlos only began to remember what was really going on, after don Juan left.\n\nIf he'd had any small memories of it, those would have been so crazy he would have dismissed them on the spot.  Since he wasn't even aware that process was going on, a single weird memory would not have triggered more.\n\nIt's by design!  Part of \"the rule\".\n\nAnd every single one of you, who keeps practicing, will end up in the same boat as Carlos.\n\nThe rule repeats itself!\n\nA sorcerer will come teach you, and you'll have absolutely no memory of it.\n\nExcept a very bizarre segment of a memory on very rare occasions, which will be so crazy, you'll worry you even thought that.\n\nIt's the world of the Brujos!\n\nBetter known as the inorganic being's world.\n\nThat's a real place, filled with sorcerers just as the early books said, and you can in fact go in there and find a teacher.\n\nAnd will.\n\nThey seem to help a bit in our case, so we can find it.  They'll \"come out\" to aid that process.\n\nI have a teacher who is associated with a giant tree.\n\nMaybe he turned his body into a tree, so he could go live there and not have to bury himself.\n\nDoesn't seem like a good plan. The oldest trees are only 5000 years old.\n\nDon't ignore those kind of details, such as that Carlos was being taught without remembering it!!!\n\nWhen you hear, \"the warrior's way\", and find some angry man obsessed with repeating those rules as if they were how to learn sorcery, keep in mind he's ignoring the entire story line.  Picking and choosing what lets him pretend the most easily.\n\nFrankly, it's despicable!  You hear, \"erasing personal history\", and you have a dimwitted, or even worse dishonest person in front of you.\n\nThe warrior's way is useless, without the nagual's Blow teaching you on the side.\n\nThey ask questions in that Second Ring of Power book, where Carlos starts to remember,  such as, \"Who don Juan really was...\"\n\nThey're frantic about it!  Upset, as if they were date raped by rufi and only now remember.\n\nAnd even accuse don Juan of being a \"devil from another time\".\n\nNot very Yaqui, is that?\n\nAnd we learn in later books,  there are 15 or 16 in his sorcerer's party, with only him being a Yaqui.\n\nSome aren't even native American.\n\nDon Juan just told him that Yaqui story, because he went around looking for a \"genuine Indian shaman informant\".\n\nDon Juan couldn't tell him what was really going on, because that wouldn't have been useful for his PhD dissertation. And Carlos would have moved on.\n\nAnd don Juan was in fact a Yaqui, who lived at the end of the bus route leading from southern California to where the Yaqui wars ended in Mexico.\n\nJust keep going from Morongo, and you'll end up there.\n\n(As I recall from my 12 years old child's knowledge of freeways in the 1960s.)\n\nSo telling Carlos don Juan was Yaqui, was a very good cover story.  He couldn't have kept Carlos around if he did not.\n\nAs for how long it took Carlos from 1972 to 1977 to remember, seems to me likely to be until 1976. Or at least, until the fastest you could start a book from scratch, and get it out there.\n\nHe wrote Art of Dreaming in just a couple of weeks!\n\nSpeaking of which, for the more advanced in here,  Carlos seems to have told people somewhere, he wrote art of dreaming in heightened awareness.\n\nThat's important, because it implies he wasn't always in HA.\n\nMany of us keep thinking if we could only stay there, we'd be in really good shape.\n\nBut apparently Carlos did not!\n\nAnd yet, from this article we know, he cold get back to that state, in less than a minute, with this weird tensegrity move to see the lines of the world.\n\nThat's heightened awareness!\n\nSo, maybe that wish is barking up the wrong tree, but don't let me stop you!\n\nAnyway, I really doubt Carlos would realize everything he had printed so far was a lie, and hang onto it for just himself, longer than a couple of weeks.\n\nI feel the same thing.\n\nIf I do something cool in the darkroom, I can't wait to draw it up the next day because it seems important to keep people interested in learning.\n\nCarlos would have been excited to write that book. Not depressed, as the book in general makes one feel.\n\nSo Yaqui sorcery: no.  \n\nCan we just drop that old attack on Carlos?  I still hear that nonsense if I try to go elsewhere to interest people.\n\nYaqui sorcery is likely nearly impotent, like the other forms of shamanism around.\n\nI've seen them myself.   Not the Yaquis.  I suppose they might have a chance to be more powerful, since don Juan still knew sorcerers from there.\n\nBut in general, at a random tribe, you will find the shamans to be impotent.  \n\nDrug tea mostly, like Maria Sabina.\n\nNot as impotent as everyone not in a tribe, who is not practicing shamanism.\n\nCertainly they're at the edge of really cool stuff!\n\nBut nothing like what we do in here.\n\nMaria Sabina for example, didn't have anything we'd like to copy in here.\n\nNative american shamanism these days is 13,000 years away from its Siberian origin, and  things likely get weaker and weaker as time goes on.\n\nIt's happened to Kabballah, and it happened to shamanism too.\n\nThat's part of the rage native American males,  pretending to have sorcery knowledge, feel.\n\nThe Sorcery in the books of Carlos is too good to be true, so they assume it's a lie.\n\nAnd if he's lying in order to exploit their valuable religion, he's evil and needs to be attacked.\n\nThis is not to say there aren't native American shaman with magic as powerful as that of don Juan.\n\nWe know there are!\n\nBut don Juan said there were only a handful of such lineages.  \n\nBut \"scores\" of wannabees who just copied some old rituals, and had no actual understanding.\n\nAlso, no real shaman would attack this subreddit.\n\nThey'd be curious what will happen as a result of it.  Since it's never been done before.\n\nNot angry.\n\nAnd, they wouldn't interfere.\n\nYou break it, you bought it.\n\nFor a real sorcerer.\n\nReality bends as it forms, based on any traces in  your awareness.\n\nThat's why the recapitulation, taking responsibility, and erasing personal history.\n\nTo reduce traces that interfere with your ability to travel to other worlds.\n\nWhich we do in here!!!  I suppose me and Cholita more than the others, having been taught by Carlos himself.\n\nBut we've already proven you can do that.  And will do it if you keep going.\n\nSo if someone attacks this subreddit, you can be sure they have absolutely no real Sorcery knowledge.\n\nThey only came here because the pictures made them worried.

But recent archaeological  finds show they rivaled us in intelligence.\n\n*by* [**The Conversation**](https://www.inverse.com/profile/the-conversation-18958944) *and* **Nicholas R. Longrich**\n\nWhy did humans take over the world while our closest relatives, the [Neanderthals](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/who-were-the-neanderthals.html#:%7E:text=The%20best%2Dknown%20Neanderthals%20lived,is%20around%20130%2C000%20years%20old.), became extinct? It\u2019s possible we were just smarter, but there\u2019s surprisingly little evidence that\u2019s true.\n\nNeanderthals had [big brains](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24290-7), language, and [sophisticated tools](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aba3831). They made [art](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aap7778) and [jewelry](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0914088107).  They were smart, suggesting a curious possibility. Maybe the crucial  differences weren\u2019t at the individual level but in our societies.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand years ago, Europe and western Asia were [Neanderthal lands](https://theconversation.com/war-in-the-time-of-neanderthals-how-our-species-battled-for-supremacy-for-over-100-000-years-148205). *Homo sapiens* inhabited [southern Africa](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aao6266). Estimates vary, but perhaps [100,000 years ago](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1199113), modern humans migrated out of Africa.\n\n[Forty thousand](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2022466118) years ago Neanderthals disappeared from Asia and Europe, replaced by humans. Their slow, inevitable [replacement](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0903446106) suggests humans had some advantage, but not what it was.\n\nAnthropologists once saw Neanderthals as [dull-witted brutes](https://doi.org/10.1002/evan.21918). But recent archaeological finds show they rivaled us in intelligence.\n\nNeanderthals [mastered fire before we did](https://theconversation.com/how-a-handful-of-prehistoric-geniuses-launched-humanitys-technological-revolution-171511). They were deadly hunters, taking big game like [mammoths](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.11.019) and [woolly rhinos](https://doi.org/10.1002/1099-1212(200009/10)10:5%3C379::AID-OA558%3E3.0.CO;2-4) and small animals like [rabbits and birds](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-8219-3_10).\n\nThey gathered [plants](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2018.02.009), [seeds](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1016868108), and [shellfish](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024026). Hunting and foraging all those species demanded a deep understanding of nature.\n\nNeanderthals also had a sense of beauty, making beads and [cave paintings](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/aug/02/tinted-cave-stalagmites-are-neanderthal-art-say-archaeologists). They were spiritual people, [burying their dead with flowers](https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2019.207).\n\n[Stone circles](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2090183-neanderthals-built-mystery-underground-circles-175000-years-ago/)  found inside caves may be Neanderthal shrines. Like modern  hunter-gatherers, Neanderthal lives were probably steeped in  superstition and magic; their skies full of gods, the caves inhabited by  ancestor-spirits.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact *Homo sapiens* and Neanderthals [had children together](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006340).  We weren\u2019t that different. But we met Neanderthals many times, over  many millennia, always with the same result. They disappeared. We  remained.\n\nSee link for more...\n\nWhat I'd like to know is, was there any Neanderthal sorcery???\n\nWe get to find out!\n\nIf we can put an end to the pretending which nearly destroyed our sorcery.\n\nWe even get an \"Attack of MEs\" every week, in threes typically.\n\nThree \"Mes\", all raging with \"Me greed\", and believing they can bully their way to sorcery fame.\n\nClueless about how obvious they are to those who have been studying here a while.\n\nI believe this picture shows a Neanderthal chair.  I'm not sure, because the website seems to cycle the main images, and this one had no caption.\n\nI hope Cholita doesn't see this. She might insist we have to make one.  She's still angry from years ago when we went to the furniture store, and she wanted to buy thousands of dollars of stuff.\n\nAfter already having bought many tens of thousands of dollars of stuff in a short time.  Staying in every hotel from our home, to downtown Los Angeles 50 miles away.\n\nShe was self-medicating with shopping.  And trying to avoid having to live with me.\n\nAs we left without her stuff, she managed to stand fully up in my car, and place a curse on me using the \"tickling the web\" magical pass.\n\nYou can in fact use that magical pass to learn to fly the way La Gorda and don Juan could, by \"uncovering\" the red emanation fragments.\n\nI stumbled on that once, and all hell broke loose.  But that's another story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihfy092u4wrc1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fdbbe5a04616a900b8e4ec7dff302985e95307e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Wearing a diaper.\n\nIt's not really something you'd want to be learning.  Even they don't want to be doing that. They just need some money, or they'd have to get a job at \"Pakora King\" in  Bengaluru.\n\nRemember that famous daisy bopping Guru, Maharishi?\n\nWhen he died his taxi cab brother tried to take over.    Might even have been better as a guru than Maharishi himself.\n\nBut honestly, they can't shapeshift. They only dream of such things.  Literally.\n\nTo shapeshift you have to move your assemblage point down to the bottom of your back. To what our lineages called \"The Shift Below\". And they don't even know about the assemblage point.\n\nNo one doing closed eye asian mediation ever gets off that green line way up near the shoulder blades.  At least not on a regular basis.   So they never learn to shapeshift.\n\nOddly, there's random crazy people in Mexico who manage to do it.\n\nWe read the story in the books written by Carlos of the guy who turned into a large dog so he could steal cheese from the neighbor.\n\nGot shot and killed.\n\nApparently a \"WereDog\" if fair game for shooting in Mexico.\n\nSo how come he was able to do that, when it's so very hard to learn to be a \"seer\"?\n\nBecause it's only a movement down to the red zone.  Power plants can get you down there.\n\nBut no further.\n\nSorry Psychonauts.  You're confused about what's going on.\n\nThe \"red zone\" is the level of \"enhanced meaning\".\n\nEverything is meaningful down there!  Even total nonsense is meaningful.\n\nPsychonauts like to drug themselves down to there, and sit and absorb all the \"meanings\".\n\nSo they can go brag to their buddies about  the new additions to their collection of \"meaningful events\". Add to their psychonaut inventory of \"knowledge\".\n\nThey find it all VERY meaningful, so they come here thinking they have a trick to get to silent knowledge.\n\nBut silent knowledge is the OPPOSITE.\n\nNothing has meaning over there. Everything is expected, nothing seems to be anything but oddly random, and you don't even get excited about successfully doing miracles.\n\nBut what could be more fun than turning into a Jaguar, like the old seers?\n\nCan we do both?\n\nGo be an \"egghead\" and ponder the emptiness of it all out in the purple region of the J curve, but also spend some time down in the bottom of the red zone having \"crow sex\".\n\nAs Taisha did.\n\nAnd as I recall, La Catalina and Julian liked \"werewolf sex\".\n\nNo, unfortunately if you want to reach Silent Knowledge you can't spend too much time down there at the bottom.\n\nThe problem is how hard it is to escape the blue line up at the top!  You know that yourself if you are a beginner.\n\nAnd  when you finally learn to be silent enough and make it down all the way to the bottom, if you play around there too much it becomes your new \"blue line\".\n\nYou can get stuck. So that you can easily move your assemblage point directly to that point down there, and see magic all around you!\n\nBut it becomes harder and harder to move it to the front.  And maybe even, self-flattery convinces you there's no need to move further.\n\nThe teacher of the Nagual Julian,  the Nagual Elias,  didn't allow him to get so stuck down there that he couldn't keep going to Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt's just that Julian created his own \"speed bump\" down there, so that he couldn't move his assemblage point all the way across the entire J curve in 1 second. As mature sorcerers learn to do.\n\nWhich is likely very close to what it takes to burn with \"The Fire From Within\".\n\nSo even though Julian did reach the highest sorcery states, over and over again, he still couldn't escape death.\n\nHe had to go hide in the inorganic being's world, where he lives to this day.\n\nNo old seer who learned to go there has yet died. They're all over there.\n\nIn our case it's ok to play around down there in the red . Do it as much as you like.\n\nWe're \"self-powered\" and that comes with privilege's, and curses.\n\nBut just keep an eye out to make sure you eventually see the \"Whitish Light\" on surfaces. And that should evolve to having a fully visible \"Energy Body\".\n\nDaily you want to keep moving until you see the whitish light.\n\nIt's ok if you play around down in the red and do something so amazing that you want to stop practicing for the night.\n\nJust don't do that everyday.  Keep pressing onward into the whitish light.\n\nSo that you can merge your \"energy body\" with your tonal body.\n\nInstead of having to fully switch over to the double, in order to accomplish magic.\n\nThat blue ball in the picture is the kind of thing you'll eventually see.\n\nAnd it turns out that once you have that \"energy body\" surrounding you, you can now shapeshift safely.\n\nThere's no risk of being stuck by that activity.\n\nThe best analogy I can come up with is perhaps, if you had a 13 year old son who liked the 16 year old neighbor girl, who was known to \"play with the boys\",  if he went over to her house when her parents weren't home that would be like shapeshifting in the red zone.\n\nBig risk.\n\nBut if he went to the public library with her, and it was a locked library so that they couldn't sneak out the back,  the risk of \"excessive fun\" is minimal.\n\nThat's what Silent Knowledge is like.\n\nYou're in the vast library of all human knowledge.\n\nAnd so if you happen to crawl along on your mattress looking at the \"whitish light on surfaces\" that Carlos told us to find and realize your hand is turning into a Black Puma's paw, you might suddenly realize \"Of course you can shapeshift in silent knowledge!\"\n\nYou'll find it obvious at that point.\n\nIt's not an intense revelation that might hook you on shapeshifting everyday, and finding someone to share shapeshifting sex with.\n\nIt's just more cool things about Silent Knowledge and the various presentation methods it can utilize.\n\nAnd even when you realize you can turn into a black puma, there's 100 better things to do right there all around you.\n\nWhat you see in that picture is 2 things I did last night, out of perhaps 30.\n\nMost of the 30 were way cooler but are now lost.\n\nThe memory of those can't often be retrieved and brought back here.\n\nI suppose you could say, in Silent Knowledge you are ALWAYS shapeshifted.\n\nInto something more non-human.  A being that doesn't have to think in a linear, time oriented progression of memories.\n\nTwo things can even be taking place at the same time!\n\nAnother reason the thrill of shapeshifting is not present at that position of the assemblage point.\n\nOur normal reality is just a flow of linear perceptions.\n\nShapeshifting in the red zone is also.\n\nA series of smaller events, spaced out in time.\n\nBut out in Silent Knowledge time can go forwards, backwards, sideways, and even loop.\n\nYou'll also find that the things we were described in the books, such as how to dent the energy body's assemblage point, are not the only way to look at that.\n\nNot the only view of reality possible way out there.\n\nCarlos and don Juan merely did what we have to do with posts in here.\n\nPick something, and pretend it's \"always like that\".\n\nAlways a necessary step in your learning.\n\nBut it's really not.\n\nYou do have to move your assemblage point.  By your own power.\n\nBut what happens after that can't really be predicted reliably.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Silent Knowledge Shape Shifting", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shapeshifting"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"sjrdltaf9oca1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab1e596c03484764c21476408a5b548aa721f909"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=157190957b9a720a52ac8cb813ef8cd1cb8c3b4c"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=491b93b953e54b62d954db2e65201b48819c119e"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ec644dfbd47709997406ae0d935c0a51c77a7dd"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f30c3d4b8d5c707c74d560ae3360b6c65a96194"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de791c774b21b07794ee2ae1e383de60ec87581b"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cac1eea17eae702e624f6a2b104b482570091de"}, "id": "sjrdltaf9oca1"}}, "name": "t3_10eo2k0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shapeshifting", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ojnxvea3jkHp_XPwOb-uoRFdsQpBhW0sgpb8sKA7W3U.jpg", "edited": 1673991088.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1673990807.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5cac1eea17eae702e624f6a2b104b482570091de\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/sjrdltaf9oca1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5cac1eea17eae702e624f6a2b104b482570091de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers and Shamans seem to be the only ones who shapeshift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Koreans had some legends about shapeshifting ancient martial artists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s really obvious they don&amp;#39;t know how to do those things these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yogis might do that, but with their eyes closed.

By your own power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what happens after that can&amp;#39;t really be predicted reliably.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1c61d6d2-b164-11ee-bd2c-26b3935f0eda", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "10eo2k0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 26, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10eo2k0/silent_knowledge_shape_shifting/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/10eo2k0/silent_knowledge_shape_shifting/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1673990807.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j4vu52g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j4vrb5v", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "That's kind of my feeling on the whole \"escaping death\" thing.\n\nWe get new people who are obsessed with how this potentially leads to living forever.\n\nI think maybe they're trying to escape the clutches of Jesus or the Buddha.\n\nBut instead of simply rejecting that nonsense and trying to learn REAL magic, they worry about what it all means in the end.\n\nThey stop worrying about getting magic NOW, and instead ponder eternal life as a motivating factor.\n\nIt's not a good strategy.\n\nWe're already so screwed up and entirely doomed, that the best thing to do is just see some real magic, so you know you aren't being fooled again.\n\nEven though, this place has absolutely no way to take money from you.\n\nSo no motivations to lie.\n\nThere's none other like it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j4vu52g", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s kind of my feeling on the whole &amp;quot;escaping death&amp;quot;

A joke understood by locals.\n\nThat ride is so lame, they cut it down to 1/3rd size for nearly a full decade, and no one noticed.  They just moved the little car to the end of the tracks, soon after the start and cut off most of the animations and decorations.\n\nPeople would jokeingly repeat the remaining dialogue, which was something like \"Here we Go!!!\"\n\nImmediately followed by \"We made it!  That was fun.\", and the exit.\n\nAs for how long to be doing tensegrity forms depends on how much time you can afford.\n\nThis NOT chi gung!\n\nYou have to get that dreadful idea out of your mind.\n\nYou ARE NOT saving up chi energy. Or anything else.\n\nYou're learning to be silent.\n\nI'd like to see it take at least 20 minutes to do your passes,  one time each.\n\nIt's ok if that \"loops\".  I have a routine with 5 unique long forms, but then I repeat the last 2 again after trying to summon witches to visit.\n\nWhich by the way, works often enough to be interesting.\n\nThe last 2 of my long forms that I repeat,  are the ones I like best and which produce the most spectacular results.\n\nBoth manipulate the energy body's shape.\n\n\\&gt; I was pondering if advanced sorcerers need to do the passes as much as beginners\n\nNot in the way you mean it.\n\nI have a mild cold today.  Had it for several days.\n\nCould be yet another endless covid re-infection.\n\nI feel kind of lousy from time to time.\n\nBut if I do my 20 minutes of tensegrity forms until I'm surrounded by other realms that are fully visible, with spirits coming to see if I want to play with them today, I feel wonderful.\n\nNot a trace of the illness.

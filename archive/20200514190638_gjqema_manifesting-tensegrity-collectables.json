But this is fairly easy to do.](https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37969328722b39d7b7baa981d402839a073cde3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Yogananda\u2019s book, objects get manifested and last for years before finally going away.\n\nAnd they\u2019re SILVER!\n\nHow cool!!!\n\nI have to wonder, if they were sandal wood instead, would it not be as cool?\n\nThere's Yogananda writing his autobiography, and he has to decide if it's ok to manifest wooden objects.  Or maybe it has to be silver, or it's not supernatural enough?\n\nBook deal perhaps?\n\nBeats me.\n\nAnything I manifest is lucky to last a few hours.\n\nAnd God only knows what they're made out of!\n\nThe ones that last a few hours tend to be alive, sitting in the corner somewhere, with me having forgotten about them.  A rodent, a magical treasure chest.\n\nThat kind of thing.  Those can last.\n\nBut Tensegrity Toy Collectables are only good for a few seconds, if you set them on the bed.\n\nThey turn into a steaming pile of jet blackness, with blue smoke.\n\nBut not just steaming!\n\nThey bubble and sizzle.\n\nI suspect, even when they deteriorate into a pile of black, they still have the potential to be anything.\n\nSo if you try this technique, don't forget to gaze into the steaming pile on the bed!\n\nIt's so easy to overlook things. Like the blackness!  I never realized it was so useful.\n\nAnd once it reverted to blackness on the bed, I didn't think of it the same way anymore.\n\nIt was garbage now.\n\nI was too obsessed with the toys.\n\nBut frankly, that steaming pile probably had a lot to teach me.  More than the toys perhaps.\n\nYes, toys.  Tensegrity Toys!\n\nDid you miss that class?\n\nIt was towards the end when Carlos was certain he wasn\u2019t going to live much longer.\n\nHe\u2019d been pushing to give us a demonstration of something real, from the second attention.\n\nOr at least, that\u2019s what we thought at the time.\n\nNow I realize, he dropped a few bombs on us. Techniques that would ultimately lead deep into the second attention.\n\nOne was a pass that never made it into workshops.\n\nI hope Reni or Miles will bring it back.\n\nI named that pass, \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d, because it unleashes magic on your world.\n\nPermanently if you open it too many times.\n\nI\u2019ll draw that one up later.  It's just the one where you compress a ball in your hands, squishing it to the size of a golf ball, then release it suddenly.\n\nSince it\u2019s a tensegrity pass, it has a few movements so I\u2019ll have to draw multiple frames, like a cartoon.  Maybe next time.\n\nThis particular technique for manifesting objects is a result of my knowledge of Pandora\u2019s Box, and someone asking me if the blackness had any use.\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought about it before, so that night I searched the room. I had a particularly heavy purple fog everywhere, which made it easy to find anything black.\n\nI simply scooped some into my hands, noticing it was just like the purple smoke when you gather it into a blob.\n\nMost Tensegrity moves do a bit of that.\n\nScooping stuff, and depositing it on things, as if it were solid.\n\nAnd as it turned out, there was no reason you couldn\u2019t treat the jet blackness the same way you treat the purple blobs of light.\n\nOnce I had it in my hand, Fairy showed up to watch.\n\n\"Fairy\" is the name I gave to a low energy inorganic being I found, and trained not to assume frightening shapes anymore.\n\nI highly recommend naming your inorganic beings.  It just saves time.\n\nI must admit, some nights Fairy is a bit sexy. I sure wish I could figure out what triggers that.\n\nIn one of Carlos\u2019 books there\u2019s an account of a man they had to pull out of his shack because he\u2019d discovered Inorganic Beings and didn\u2019t want to leave.\n\nTwo guesses what he was doing in the shack\u2026\n\nYep you can. I never did, but I certainly do like to get offers.\n\nThe jet blackness, when scooped into the hand, is hard to see unless you move it around.\n\nWhen it moves, it generates intense purple and blue swirls in the second attention fog.\n\nIn the purple background mists you see in that pic.\n\nIt\u2019s as if the blackness can dissolve the purple, but then the purple lights on fire and restores itself a little distance from the blackness.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s how the yin/yang whorl works. Perhaps the black isn\u2019t eating up the purple, but generating it?\n\nWho ever said the dark side was our enemy?\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be me.\n\nOnce you wave the black blob around a little and can see the edges, you\u2019ll be looking at a hole on your hand. If you gaze into it, you\u2019ll see things.\n\nOr maybe, \u201cpotential\u201d things.\n\nJust reach your fingers in there, around a potential thing you see, and pull it out.\n\nI\u2019ve pre-warned you, so who knows what will happen in your case.\n\nBut, it\u2019s possible to reach right through your hand.  It's just that, if you are thinking you're about to do that, you likely won't.\n\nYou sort of have to forget that your hand is solid, and right below the swirling black hole.\n\nJust a reminder for newbies.\n\nI do everything awake, with my eyes open, and walking around constantly so that I don\u2019t get tired or sleepy.\n\nWhy?\n\nI\u2019ve been doing the other stuff for decades.\n\nBut it\u2019s not good enough to restore the reputation of Carlos.\n\nNo one cares what you do in your dreams, or sitting in a chair with your eyes closed.\n\nWe all know anyone can have freaky visions during meditation.\n\nIt\u2019s stuff done awake, with eyes opened, that we need in the Castaneda community.\n\nIn this case, I just sat on the edge of the bed for that experiment.\n\nAnd it made a convenient place to set down objects I manifested.\n\nUnfortunately, either setting them down, or looking away too long, caused them to turn back into what they always were.\n\nJet black goo scooped from the second attention.\n\nYou can keep them around much longer if you only glance at them.  A quick look every 5 seconds ought to do it, but don't expect it not to mutate a bit.\n\nI was so dazzled by the little girl on the park bench that I stared at her too hard.\n\nShe turned into a fat lawyer questioning someone on the witness stand,  a woman with far too many fancy clothes on, and a grumpy taxi driver.\n\nThen she became that pile you see on the bed.\n\nWhen you can get silent, and move your assemblage point far into heightened awareness, manifesting objects is trivial.\n\nIt's simply the manipulation of *intent*.\n\nJust reach behind the bed, and pull one out!\n\nBut I must admit, I never pulled anything that vivid out, from behind something else.\n\nThe objects pulled from the black goo are intensely real looking.\n\nJust as real looking as in this picture.\n\nOne final thought.\n\nIf you stare at the girl on the bench just right, you can see the park where she was hanging out.\n\nActually, that's not quite right.\n\nIf you even TOUCH her, you know the history.\n\nDon't ask me how.   She seems to come with a history.\n\nMaybe like a baseball card with stats on the back?\n\nIt's another case of the need not to take things for granted, in the second attention.\n\nWe see ourselves as separate from everything.\n\nSo a little girl you can hold in your hand is not you.\n\nIt's an object.\n\nYou can see it, feel it, and tell that is makes no sound.\n\nThat's what we're used to.\n\nBut in the second attention, things come with some sort of history.  And when you encounter the thing, you can read the history.\n\nA lot of people expect *seeing* to be like that.\n\nAnd it is!  But it doesn't have to be.   It's a range.\n\nThe girl on the bench is just as much *seeing*, as if you know the story of her entire life in an instant.\n\nEdited 7 times\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Manifesting Tensegrity Collectables", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Illustrations"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 92, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"bil7rf2jiry41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0984ac1e6fc050bbbdbe014f9503f6221fb54caa"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb7d0cbbe1f342f8979f70e383a8ae3a5fb903a5"}, {"y": 211, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54cc1ce754f501d3ba7bf75853a76a9dc85305d3"}, {"y": 423, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e83988f093edfea1b19bd5cfa83155b99854a748"}, {"y": 635, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da22899cb0e604bff57f63c5e5141bfce5d9ec87"}, {"y": 715, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d49ffb331b274d9ddb19e220100afe1adea9738"}], "s": {"y": 788, "x": 1190, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37969328722b39d7b7baa981d402839a073cde3"}, "id": "bil7rf2jiry41"}}, "name": "t3_gjqema", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Illustrations", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/cT_IUTPtwAPvaEqtH8N5Z5ylYBJhyUwVfhCriQ7WUsw.jpg", "edited": 1589569606.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1589475998.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=1190&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f37969328722b39d7b7baa981d402839a073cde3\"&gt;Ok, I admit it&amp;#39;s freaky.

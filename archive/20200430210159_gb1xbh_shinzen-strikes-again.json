Weird shaped sculptures, as intense as the  sun, floating peacefully in front of you at the height of the ceiling.

The black is jet black, and more intense than the background noise black.\n\nCarlos even pointed it out, in the mirror in water gazing technique.\n\nYes, it turns out you can scoop the blackness! It's every bit as solid and energetic, as the purple.\n\nIt\u2019s a little messy however.\n\nYou get a big gob in your hand, and unlike the purple stuff, which  you can compress and stretch, the black stuff is \u201cdisruptive\u201d.\n\nAs you try to compress it into a solid ball, it stirs up the purple around it and concentrates it into an intense purple border.\n\nIt's as if it's so cold, without actually being cold, that it freezes  the purple on the edges as it passes by, leaving a trail of purple ice  crystals.\n\nAnytime the purple is very intense, things can spin off it.\n\nThat\u2019s how you can \u201cread off the wall\u201d.  A very intense piece of light.  It generates \u201cthings\u201d.\n\nThey're generated perhaps by the tiniest movement of your eyes, which smears the intensity, and it blooms into an object.\n\nThat's kind of advanced, but lets see what you all notice about it later on.  \n\nAfter you get hooked.\n\nIn the case of playing with the black goo, I noticed that there was a red blob stuck in it.\n\nI reached in to see if I could pull out the red blob, which was about the size of a big marble.\n\nInstead, I pulled out a little girl in a red dress, sitting calmly on a park bench.  She was around 2 inches tall, seated.\n\nI could see that the bench was located along a curving sidewalk, in a pretty park with an endless lawn.\n\nI lifted the little girl up, bench and all, and looked for a place to set her down.\n\nTo my right, the purple fog was kind of smooth.  I moved my little  figure from my right hand to my left, so I could slide my right over the  flat spot, to smooth it off.  \n\nMake a place to set stuff down.  It became a slightly intenser blueish surface, instead of just purple fog.\n\nI checked if the little girl had survived the transfer to the other hand.\n\nShe did, mostly. The bench was kind of blurry.  She was sinking back  into the second attention, but still visible enough to pull her back.\n\nI put the little girl down on the flat spot thinking, maybe I can build a village, the way the death defier did.\n\nWhy not?  Who said anything about having to make a full scale model?\n\nAnd who said there was only one \"official\" way to do it?\n\nYou build a virtual world just by visualizing objects until you can  actually see them.  And get another person to do the same with you.\n\nI was cheating here, and pulling them from the blackness. \n\nBut once they were visible, why would they be any different?\n\nThe little girl mutated into a heavy built Perry Mason style lawyer, a  woman overdressed for some fancy event, a taxi driver with an attitude,  and then just junk. \n\nAll would have been wonderful additions to a \"village\".   But now all  that was left was black crud in a little pile on my bluish looking  bedspread.\n\nI was thinking maybe I needed more than one thing on that flat surface, so they could keep each other firm.\n\nIf I had Cholita around, between us we could have kept the little girl intact.\n\nBut the *intent* of one person alone seems to be inadequate.\n\nI continuously reached into the black goo, around the very bright  purple edges, and pulled out object after object, trying to set them  down to make myself a little model of a village.\n\nDidn\u2019t work out.\n\nMy little fairy took notice, and offered me the magic crystal ball oracle I\u2019d seen a week or so ago.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t perfectly formed, but it was intensely bright.  It was floating a few inches in front of my left hand.\n\nI opened my hand to make a curved place in my palm for it to sit in, and it drifted into place by itself.\n\nSort of. It was a bit stubborn, and wanted me to deliberately reach out for it.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize until just now, my little fairy was sort of saying,  \u201cIf you must play with toys, this one is more useful.

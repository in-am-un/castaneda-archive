Although my eyes were used to the darkness I was still unable to see a thing. I stumbled on something and she commanded me to sit down inside a narrow crib and support my lower back with something I thought was a hard cushion.\n\nI next felt that she had backed up a few steps behind me, a thing which baffled me completely, for I thought that my back was only a few inches from the wall. Speaking from behind me, she ordered me in a soft voice to focus my attention on her words and let them guide me. She told me to keep my eyes open and fixed on a point right in front of me, at my eye level; and that this point was going to turn from darkness to a bright and pleasing orange-red.\n\nZuleica spoke very softly with an even intonation. I heard every word she said. The darkness around me seemed to have effectively cut off any distracting external stimuli. I heard Zuleica\u2019s words in a vacuum, and then I realized that the silence in that hall was matched by the silence inside me.\n\nZuleica explained that a dreamer must start from a point of color; intense light or unmitigated darkness are useless to a dreamer in the initial onslaught. Colors such as purple or light green or rich yellow are, on the other hand, stupendous starting points. She preferred, however, orange-red, because through experience it had proven to be the one that gave her the greatest sensation of rest. She assured me that once I had succeeded in entering into the orange-red color I would have rallied my second attention permanently, providing that I could be aware of the sequence of physical events.\n\nIt took me several sessions with Zuleica\u2019s voice to realize with my body what she wanted me to do. The advantage of being in a state of heightened awareness was that I could follow my transition from a state of vigil to a state of dreaming. Under normal conditions that transition is blurred, but under those special circumstances I actually felt in the course of one session how my second attention took over the controls. The first step was an unusual difficulty in breathing. It was not a difficulty in inhaling or exhaling; I was not short of breath \u2013 rather, my breathing changed rhythm all of a sudden. My diaphragm began to contract and it forced my midsection to move in and out with great speed. The result was the fastest short breaths I had ever taken. I breathed in the lower part of my lungs and felt a great pressure in my intestines. I tried unsuccessfully to break the spasms of my diaphragm. The harder I tried, the more painful it got....\n\n...I disregarded Zuleica\u2019s order to enter into a patch of coloration that was forming right at my eye level, and gave myself fully to the exploration of that strange sensation outside me. Zuleica must have seen what I was going through; she suddenly began to explain that the second attention belongs to the luminous body, as the first attention belongs to the physical body. The point where, she said, the second attention assembles itself was situated right where Juan Tuma had described it the first time we met \u2013 approximately one and one-half feet in front of the midpoint between the stomach and the belly button and four inches to the right....\n\n...La Gorda said that she and Josefina lived in Zuleica\u2019s house for several months. The Nagual Juan Matus had delivered them to her one day after making them shift levels of awareness. He did not tell them what they were going to do there nor what to expect, he simply left them by themselves in the hall of her house and walked away. They sat there until it got dark. Zuleica then came to them. They never saw her, they only heard her voice as if she were talking to them from a point on the wall.\n\nZuleica was very demanding from the moment she took over. She made them undress on the spot and ordered both of them to crawl inside thick fluffy cotton bags, some poncho-like garments that were lying on the floor. They covered them from neck to toes. She ordered them next to sit back to back on a mat in the same alcove where I myself used to sit. She told them that their task was to gaze at the darkness until it began to acquire a hue. After many sessions they indeed began to see colors in the darkness, at which time Zuleica made them sit side by side and gaze at the same spot.\n\nLa Gorda said that Josefina learned very fast, and that one night she dramatically entered into the patch of orange-red by swishing physically out of the poncho. La Gorda thought that either Josefina had reached out for the blotch of color or it had reached out for her. The result was that in one instant Josefina was gone from inside the poncho. Zuleica separated them from then on, and la Gorda started her slow, solitary learning.\n\n\nsource - http://toltecschool.com/dreaming-page1/dreaming-7\n\n***\n\nBut Carlos was in a different situation than we are.

But for us, it's a mildly interesting beginner's state.  I calculated that it's 1/690th of how far Carlos instructed us to go.\n\nBut the ultimate way to see that sorcery is all about a \"clean link to intent\" is when you are so silent that you can manifest objects.\n\nYou have to be 100% silent, so that you don't have competing thoughts or expectations floating around in your awareness. Can't even be fantasizing, despite not having any words. Anything at all which catches your attention, is too much to be able to do what I'm about to describe. Because where your attention flows, determines which reality you are occupying.\n\nSo with no thoughts or fantasies at all, you simply request what you want and then instantly forget you did that. \n\nSuch as \"Hamburger\".\n\nYou'll be very surprised when one shows up 10 seconds later, floating in the darkness in front of you.\n\nClear enough for you to see that it has no cheese, but it's got a nice tomato and some lettuce which you didn't request. \n\nLooks like a 1/3rd pounder too!

That it was all that your awareness was still lingering on. That request.\n\nYou can even take it into your hands, and toss it off to the side of the room and hear it plop down onto the floor.\n\nSometimes.\n\nI try to aim for the trash bin.\n\nOn a good night you can manifest 4 objects, before your ordinary thought process kicks in, and you begin to think about how much attention you'll get with your new \"super powers\".\n\nThat puts an end to that ability, because thinking about personal gain is the ultimate dirty link to intent.\n\nMagic becomes inoperative if the link is dirty again.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ktm00gm", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interesting piece of information on allies taking over 10 - 15 years ago!

But for us, it&amp;#39;s a mildly interesting beginner&amp;#39;s state.  I calculated that it&amp;#39;s 1/690th of how far Carlos instructed us to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the ultimate way to see that sorcery is all about a &amp;quot;clean link to intent&amp;quot; is when you are so silent that you can manifest objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to be 100% silent, so that you don&amp;#39;t have competing thoughts or expectations floating around in your awareness. Can&amp;#39;t even be fantasizing, despite not having any words. Anything at all which catches your attention, is too much to be able to do what I&amp;#39;m about to describe. Because where your attention flows, determines which reality you are occupying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with no thoughts or fantasies at all, you simply request what you want and then instantly forget you did that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as &amp;quot;Hamburger&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be very surprised when one shows up 10 seconds later, floating in the darkness in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clear enough for you to see that it has no cheese, but it&amp;#39;s got a nice tomato and some lettuce which you didn&amp;#39;t request. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like a 1/3rd pounder too! Sesame seed bun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re surprised because you actually did &amp;quot;drop it&amp;quot; and forget you made that request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; the object to appear.  That it was all that your awareness was still lingering on. That request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even take it into your hands, and toss it off to the side of the room and hear it plop down onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to aim for the trash bin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a good night you can manifest 4 objects, before your ordinary thought process kicks in, and you begin to think about how much attention you&amp;#39;ll get with your new &amp;quot;super powers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That puts an end to that ability, because thinking about personal gain is the ultimate dirty link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic becomes inoperative if the link is dirty again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1b6xmog", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1b6xmog/why_didnt_don_juan_teach_carlos_the_methods/ktm00gm/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1709734632.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1709734632.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ktkrkgj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "higgsbison312", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1709707911.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ktgc70c", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_55s3xvov", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Interesting piece of information on allies taking over 10 - 15 years ago!

That those are key to progress.\n\nSo originally there were the profiteering, delusional \"Men of Knowledge\". Around 3500 years ago, but going all the way back at least 8000 years.\n\nAmazing men!\n\nIn some ways, superior to the selfish and second attention obsessed \"seers\" of their time.\n\nThose \"seer\" guys couldn't even stand up to invaders, while the men of knowledge were pillars of the community.\n\nLike a famous preacher in their village.\n\nSo they could help fight off invaders.\n\nThe old seers could not, according to don Juan.\n\nThe Men of Knowledge took apprentices and became their benefactors.\n\nThey were teaching them a business, not actual magic.\n\nLikely a \"man of knowledge\" who could produce real magic, only had one or two \"rituals\" to do that with.\n\nThey used a ritual, power plants, and an Ally.\n\nSo everyone be warned, you CANNOT duplicate what the men of knowledge did, unless you have all three of those.\n\nAnd the Ally has to be one that was used in their rituals.\n\nSuch as the talking lizards, or the moth dust that shows people as mushroom shapes.\n\nThose were \"early silent knowledge\" induced by moving the assemblage point with power plants, intending the result with the ritual, and by having the Ally around to help.\n\nFortunately, we have both of those Allies.  Carlos left them to us.\n\nBut the men of knowledge were in it for the profit, and traded their magic shows for goods and services.\n\nThey weren't a lot different than an Ayahuasca peddler in Mexico.\n\nExcept that the Men of Knowledge really did produce DAZZLING magic.\n\nBut they NEVER learned to *see*.\n\nSo they aren't in any way what we'd like to be.\n\nApprentices don't work, benefactors don't work, so forget all that make believe. Our community uses that to steal from others.  We need to remove that kind of thinking from our efforts.\n\nThe way \"*seeing*\" was taught back then, thousands of years ago, was via \"younglings\".\n\nJust like in Star Wars.\n\nToo old to begin the training? Then there was no way they could learn.\n\nThe old seers simply took very small children as servants, and the kids did what kids do best.\n\nAbsorb everything their adult guardian does.\n\nNo one was \"taught\".\n\nAnd there's no way for us in modern times,  to duplicate that learning situation.\n\nBut the old seers got invaded no matter where they moved to, and finally they'd had enough, when the Toltec empire fell around the 1600s.\n\nThe seers hid out in lineages of 15.  Becoming the \"new seers\".\n\nAnd using their \"seeing\" (Silent Knowledge), they uncovered a path to duplicate themselves by another method.  They discovered \"The Rule\" from the book \"The Eagle's Gift\".\n\nKeep in mind, that new path REQUIRED succeeding with specific people, who were \"indicated\" to them by infinity. Not people they were friends with, or thought looked promising.\n\nIn the case of La Gorda, the washer woman, she was pointed out to don Juan by moths circling around her head indicating she would die soon if the lineage didn't pick her up as one of their new witches.\n\nCarlos himself stumbled into don Juan, mumbling about needing an \"informant\" on the use of power plants.\n\nDon Juan could \"see\" that he was a double male.  And so don Juan had to do everything Carlos asked, in order to keep him around.\n\nAnd he taught him about the \"Men of Knowledge\", since that seemed to be what would work best for this PhD thesis.\n\nFollowing the \"Rule\", don Juan led Carlos to learn about sorcery using 15 powerful lineage seniors.\n\nCarlos had FIFTEEN powerful seers to help him learn.\n\nNot to mention, don Juan could move his assemblage point with a simple slap to his back.\n\nKind of like how the old Men of Knowledge could do that with the smoking mixture, or the Devil's Weed ointment.\n\nThe \"new seers\" devised a complicated new way to teach.\n\nOne we also cannot possibly duplicate.\n\nBoth paths are closed to us. Old seers (and Men of Knowledge) and new seers. Neither is a way anyone can learn now.\n\nCarlos created a totally new method, likely with help from don Juan.\n\nTensegrity.\n\nBut it didn't work while Carlos was alive.\n\nHis allies had to come along and take over, around 10-15 years ago.\n\nTHEY created \"darkroom\".\n\nAll the other stuff, such as recapitulation, is automatic.\n\nIf you reach Silent Knowledge, recapitulation becomes totally obvious.  As does \"stalking\".  And \"not-doings\".\n\nNow how can we possibly duplicate what the old seers did, since we aren't already sorcerers, and taking small kids as servants is frowned upon these days?\n\nAnd how can we possibly duplicate what the new seers did, when we can't even gather a SINGLE powerful sorcerer to help us?  Let alone 15!\n\nWe can't.\n\nHow the lineages taught was dictated by infinity, and it worked well for our particular lineage for 408 years.\n\nBut won't anymore.\n\nWe will only succeed by sheer numbers of people trying.\n\nThere's no way we can afford to care about any individuals, try to \"teach\" them, or in any way try to keep those around who don't work hard all by themselves.\n\nWe have the advantage however, of the internet.\n\n8000+ people have flowed through here in the last 4+ years.\n\nAnd those are just the ones who subscribed.\n\nOf those, we perhaps got only 50 to the point of moving their assemblage point 1/3rd of the distance it takes to become a seer.\n\nSo when you ask the question you asked, it shows that you need to understand what's happening a bit better, so you don't fall into the profiteering trap as the Men of Knowledge did.\n\nThey never learned to *see*.\n\nI suppose at least one did.

No need for any props like a box.\n\nAll I need is some darkness, and I can not only watch the  yellow and orange fibers being blown out and sucked back in, but if I find a strong one  I can follow it through the darkness to a scene that represents the event.\n\nIt's silent knowledge \"videos in the sky\" as Carlos described it in his Silent Knowledge publication.\n\nThe box is very nice however, because when you teleport (and you **will**), you can verify if you left the box in some kind of confused daze, or went right through the solid walls.\n\nYou put a little latch on the inside to make it easy to check how you got out.\n\nOf course, you can always just lift the crate.  There's no bottom.\n\nIt just sits over a comfy armchair.\n\nBut typically teleporting will in fact happen, the same way it's described in Taisha's latest book when Zuleica says she needs to be careful because one day she'll find herself on the other end of the patio, without knowing how she got there.\n\nThe box also provides a \"container\" into which *intent* will store, and your inorganic beings will likely perch on the top of it trying to inject false memories of their presence, so they can interact with you awake.\n\nThey try to get your attention due to the energy being given off by a good recap.\n\nSome people fall prey to believing the false memories, so you have to learn to \"test them\" by moving back and forth from believing them, to realizing they're not true at all.\n\nVery fine shifts of the assemblage point, which is precisely what Recap teaches.  Fine movements.\n\nBut the VERY MOST IMPORTANT THING about recap is,  you need to do it in 2 hours minimum or your assemblage point can't move far enough to get the amazing magic it produces.\n\nMagic which is absolutely inevitable.\n\nSo we can conclude that since there has been none among the left over \"inner circle\", they aren't following the instructions for recap and are barely doing it at all.\n\nNo intense magic means, you're exaggerating how much effort you put into it.\n\nWhich is 99.99999% true of all magical systems, and all participants in them.\n\nKids always lie and say they practiced their musical instrument this week, when the band leader asks why they can't play the tune on key.\n\nSame for Castaneda followers.\n\nThe dog ate their homework.\n\nDon Juan tried to figure out when this madness began and made a guess that the fliers took over around 10,000 years ago.\n\nSo that all magic is wiped out by their mind control.\n\nThrough enforcing self-pity as the driver of the internal dialogue.\n\nReal recapitulation is like climbing into a magic cave, and being entertained beyond your wildest dreams for several hours.\n\nJust like in the books!\n\nI'd add, you have to figure out how to \"force\" your internal dialogue off during recap, and yet still be able to look at your list and remember the topics.\n\nBut that's not as contradictory as it seems!\n\nOur internal dialogue is actually rather silly.\n\nLanguage was invented so you could shout to your fellow hunter/gatherer some instructions for which way to go, to help trap and capture the tricky prey.

Cholita, Jadey (Laura) and me.\n\nAll the rest gave up, and even cursed Carlos.\n\nCholita can levitate objects right in your face, walk through walls, create phantom copies of places you can visit with her, and do a whole host of other absolutely amazing things from the books.\n\nOnce in a while I accidentally walk into the second copy of our home she created using her Ally Minx.\n\nTHAT'S shared dreaming supreme.\n\nAnd it's the same thing as when Miles walked into the extra copy of Pandora, and had to be rescued by Florinda.\n\nCarlos tried to lure me in there, just before he died.\n\nInvited me to his house alone, to perform some Chinese ritual involving half a pear.\n\nBut I refused to go into that phantom copy of the house, knowing he'd positioned me so that if I took a single step back, I'd be in it.  \n\nI didn't understand at the time what that would have meant.\n\nPrior to that he'd invited me to be Florinda's lover, presumably meaning I'd go with them along with Kylie.\n\nI doubt Miles was even able to recall going in that phantom copy of the house, because it sure didn't improve his understanding of sorcery.\n\nI go into Cholita's shared realm, the same as walking wide awake into the grocery store.\n\nNever having gone to sleep at all. I just stop practicing tensegrity and walk right in.\n\n \\&gt;so who's to say what format for teaching works best? \n\nWhat works best is following the instructions Carlos left us, in his final publications.\n\nHe specifically told us, we needed to find new teachers in Silent Knowledge, and that \"all of his comrades agreed about it\".\n\nAdvice which Cleargreen totally ignored.\n\nReally, this was all nearly lost. \n\nCarlos was doomed to go down as \"totally debunked\", with no obvious magic you couldn't easily argue against going on among his remaining followers.\n\nMost just doing closed eye stuff like anyone else does.\n\nThat's no longer true.  There are dozens in here doing amazing things.\n\nThey have a hard time practicing regularly, so I don't have people creeping up on my ability to reach Silent Knowledge daily yet, but we're long past \"Carlos was debunked\" in here.\n\nCleargreen followers are not.\n\nI hope you took the time to look around at the posts.\n\nOr at this map Carlos left us. During a private lecture given only once, and only to those who were there that day.\n\nI added pictures of what we've done so far.  Every picture you see on there has been done reliably by people in here. And is a sure indication of where your assemblage point is now located, if you can do that wide awake.\n\nAnything past the very bottom has only been done by me so far, but as I said that's just about how much time people are willing to put into practicing.\n\n100% of my time is devoted to sorcery, and has been for a decade.

Cholita, Jadey (Laura) and me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the rest gave up, and even cursed Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita can levitate objects right in your face, walk through walls, create phantom copies of places you can visit with her, and do a whole host of other absolutely amazing things from the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once in a while I accidentally walk into the second copy of our home she created using her Ally Minx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S shared dreaming supreme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s the same thing as when Miles walked into the extra copy of Pandora, and had to be rescued by Florinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried to lure me in there, just before he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Invited me to his house alone, to perform some Chinese ritual involving half a pear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I refused to go into that phantom copy of the house, knowing he&amp;#39;d positioned me so that if I took a single step back, I&amp;#39;d be in it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t understand at the time what that would have meant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to that he&amp;#39;d invited me to be Florinda&amp;#39;s lover, presumably meaning I&amp;#39;d go with them along with Kylie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt Miles was even able to recall going in that phantom copy of the house, because it sure didn&amp;#39;t improve his understanding of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go into Cholita&amp;#39;s shared realm, the same as walking wide awake into the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never having gone to sleep at all. I just stop practicing tensegrity and walk right in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;so who&amp;#39;s to say what format for teaching works best? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What works best is following the instructions Carlos left us, in his final publications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He specifically told us, we needed to find new teachers in Silent Knowledge, and that &amp;quot;all of his comrades agreed about it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advice which Cleargreen totally ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, this was all nearly lost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was doomed to go down as &amp;quot;totally debunked&amp;quot;, with no obvious magic you couldn&amp;#39;t easily argue against going on among his remaining followers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most just doing closed eye stuff like anyone else does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s no longer true.  There are dozens in here doing amazing things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have a hard time practicing regularly, so I don&amp;#39;t have people creeping up on my ability to reach Silent Knowledge daily yet, but we&amp;#39;re long past &amp;quot;Carlos was debunked&amp;quot; in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen followers are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you took the time to look around at the posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or at this map Carlos left us. During a private lecture given only once, and only to those who were there that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I added pictures of what we&amp;#39;ve done so far.  Every picture you see on there has been done reliably by people in here. And is a sure indication of where your assemblage point is now located, if you can do that wide awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything past the very bottom has only been done by me so far, but as I said that&amp;#39;s just about how much time people are willing to put into practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;100% of my time is devoted to sorcery, and has been for a decade.

We have yet to determine any rules about *dreaming*, for women.\n\nBut for men, if you didn't find your hands it's just a normal dream.\n\nAnd I suspect women would be better off if they did too.\n\nOrdinary dreams are filled with scouts too, but of absolutely no use to learn sorcery.  That's been proven for the last 58 years with no one ever learning sorcery through 4 gates dreaming.\n\nYou need that injection of rationality to make that path work.\n\nAnd it's not a very pleasant path, by the way.   Doesn't make you happy.\n\nQuite the opposite.\n\nBut by finding your hands in order to inject real Tonal \"rationality\" into the dream, to mix with the double's \"Nagual\", you turn ordinary dreams into magical ones usually dominated by a scout.\n\nDoing so will allow you to \"dissolve\" dream phantoms by pointing your finger at them, and staring down your arm and finger like it was a rifle.  Fix your eyes on the chest of the target phantom and don't allow any detail of it to change, without you catching it.\n\nFace is ok too.

But chances are, if you had a crowd of phantoms the real scout will be one of the last you think to check.\n\nPossibly they inhabit all of them at once so that you always find the real one only at the end. We don't have enough who can do this to know for sure.\n\nThe scouts are just awareness injected into our flow from the emanations, so they can be anything.\n\nA mountain even!\n\nI tended to see blobs of light inside them. \n\nNot \"bars\" as Carlos described. But they're still fascinating.\n\nDoing that allows you to tell what's a phantom, and what's an actual scout.\n\nYou must figure that out, to follow the 4 gates. You need to turn that scout into an assistant instead of a pest.\n\nThere's almost surely only going to be 1 scout, pretending to be part of a crowd that's pestering you.\n\n\\&gt;Do you recap when you wake up and realise you\u2019ve made a new unwanted \u201cconnection\u201d? \n\nI never recap dreaming connections!\n\nI'm not sure why people would.  The more energy we can leave in the second attention, the easier to travel there.\n\n\"Will\" is tied to that in some roundabout way.\n\nAnd energy left in dream worlds is not bound by \"self\", so it doesn't have the same bad effect on sorcery as your real world memories.\n\nHowever, remembering more clearly can't be bad, so maybe what you're doing is remembering as much as you can.\n\nWhy is our normal awareness called \"Tonal\"?\n\nI don't know, but it's really just your physical body, and the awareness which got stuck in the internal organs there.\n\nIn 3 \"energy pouches\".\n\nI'm afraid \"Tonal\" and \"Nagual\" both have multiple meanings in the books.  Pinning them down would take a lot of scholarly effort.\n\nEventually an AI might be able to do it.\n\nBut with \"Nagual\" you have the crazies like Armando Torres who say \"Encounters with the Nagual\", when in fact he's never seen even a tiny bit of magic, or the Nagual, in his entire adult life.\n\nHe just means Carlos.\n\nCholita used to call him \"the Nagual\" too.\n\nThe witches insisted on that as a sign of respect.\n\nBut I figure that's just a woman to woman thing.  That the witches had a better understanding of how to motivate women, and that was part of it.\n\nA couple of the men copied that, Felix in particular.  Trying to kiss up so he had a chance to get his own franchise.\n\nBut then,  Miles was calling him \"Doctor Castaneda\".\n\nAs if Carlos needed a certificate, perhaps indicating Miles now believes his magic is all made up.\n\nI just called Carlos \"Carlos\". And to his face.\n\nAnd never got into trouble over it.\n\nOne of the witches one time started to move towards me when I said that, to tell me not to, but then stopped.\n\nCarlos didn't mind at all.

We don&amp;#39;t have enough who can do this to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The scouts are just awareness injected into our flow from the emanations, so they can be anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A mountain even!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tended to see blobs of light inside them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not &amp;quot;bars&amp;quot; as Carlos described. But they&amp;#39;re still fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing that allows you to tell what&amp;#39;s a phantom, and what&amp;#39;s an actual scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must figure that out, to follow the 4 gates. You need to turn that scout into an assistant instead of a pest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s almost surely only going to be 1 scout, pretending to be part of a crowd that&amp;#39;s pestering you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Do you recap when you wake up and realise you\u2019ve made a new unwanted \u201cconnection\u201d? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never recap dreaming connections!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why people would.  The more energy we can leave in the second attention, the easier to travel there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Will&amp;quot; is tied to that in some roundabout way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And energy left in dream worlds is not bound by &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;, so it doesn&amp;#39;t have the same bad effect on sorcery as your real world memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, remembering more clearly can&amp;#39;t be bad, so maybe what you&amp;#39;re doing is remembering as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is our normal awareness called &amp;quot;Tonal&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know, but it&amp;#39;s really just your physical body, and the awareness which got stuck in the internal organs there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 3 &amp;quot;energy pouches&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid &amp;quot;Tonal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Nagual&amp;quot; both have multiple meanings in the books.  Pinning them down would take a lot of scholarly effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually an AI might be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with &amp;quot;Nagual&amp;quot; you have the crazies like Armando Torres who say &amp;quot;Encounters with the Nagual&amp;quot;, when in fact he&amp;#39;s never seen even a tiny bit of magic, or the Nagual, in his entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just means Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita used to call him &amp;quot;the Nagual&amp;quot; too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches insisted on that as a sign of respect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I figure that&amp;#39;s just a woman to woman thing.  That the witches had a better understanding of how to motivate women, and that was part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of the men copied that, Felix in particular.  Trying to kiss up so he had a chance to get his own franchise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then,  Miles was calling him &amp;quot;Doctor Castaneda&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if Carlos needed a certificate, perhaps indicating Miles now believes his magic is all made up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just called Carlos &amp;quot;Carlos&amp;quot;. And to his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And never got into trouble over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the witches one time started to move towards me when I said that, to tell me not to, but then stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos didn&amp;#39;t mind at all. He just grinned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_17udp60", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17udp60/which_way_the_wind_is_blowing/ka5re1k/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1700575857.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1700575857.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ka45ahj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Sweet_Storm5278", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k9wqr0a", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5icju6ju", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "In dreaming, you never know who you\u2019re really connecting with, so yeah, I\u2019m careful of the \u201coffers\u201d, but it can happen.

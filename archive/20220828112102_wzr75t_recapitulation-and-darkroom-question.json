It's almost \"kung fu\" like eventually, in that you can wave your hands around in circles in the air pointlessly, like a crappy martial artist showing off.\n\nExcept that, with sorcery the movements literally leave smears and sparkles of visible colorful light in the air!\n\nWhen you see such sights, even a tiny bit, that gets \"stored\" as a possibility.\n\nEventually your tensegrity moves become a \"ritual\" to transport you into the second attention, with your energy body (your double), visibly surrounding you.\n\nCarlos had intended people to do those in full light!  He expected people to notice sensations and weird fast daydreaming spells that way.\n\nBut everyone just thought, and worried, and daydreamed, and looked at the butt of the practitioner in front of them.\n\nAnd fussed over who was \"leading\".\n\nIt didn't work at all.\n\nSo use what you can. If it isn't dark, you'll just be going down Juann's path.\n\nHe can do darkroom in full sunlight.\n\nAnd Carlos actually recommended using the sky for the darkness.  A flat blue sky.\n\nFlat and detailess is sort of like darkness.  \n\n\nSo those puffs could show up on a white wall.  Just pulsate an instant in the middle of it, until you get excited and make it go away with your expectations.\n\nThe witches also recommended \"sky gazing\".\n\nI understand why now.  It's because of advising women to do \"paper weight over womb\" silence.\n\nHe had them lay down on grass and gaze at the sky.  Because their bodies had already learned to move into the second attention, in that position.\n\nCholita, the witch Carlos imported from Mexico City,  likes a cloudy day better. She just looks for clouds which \"look like a skull\".\n\nAnd the \"dark energy\" she summons that way causes them to start talking to her.\n\nExcept she gets pissed off at what they say.  And takes it out on me.\n\nSo maybe don't do \"skull gazing\".\n\nBut the very most important thing, is to learn to be silent. To remove the internal dialogue.\n\nThe next most important is to \"see weird stuff\", so that you prove you aren't fooling yourself about the silence.

It&amp;#39;s almost &amp;quot;kung fu&amp;quot; like eventually, in that you can wave your hands around in circles in the air pointlessly, like a crappy martial artist showing off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that, with sorcery the movements literally leave smears and sparkles of visible colorful light in the air!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you see such sights, even a tiny bit, that gets &amp;quot;stored&amp;quot; as a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually your tensegrity moves become a &amp;quot;ritual&amp;quot; to transport you into the second attention, with your energy body (your double), visibly surrounding you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had intended people to do those in full light!  He expected people to notice sensations and weird fast daydreaming spells that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But everyone just thought, and worried, and daydreamed, and looked at the butt of the practitioner in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And fussed over who was &amp;quot;leading&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t work at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So use what you can. If it isn&amp;#39;t dark, you&amp;#39;ll just be going down Juann&amp;#39;s path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He can do darkroom in full sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carlos actually recommended using the sky for the darkness.  A flat blue sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flat and detailess is sort of like darkness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So those puffs could show up on a white wall.  Just pulsate an instant in the middle of it, until you get excited and make it go away with your expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches also recommended &amp;quot;sky gazing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand why now.  It&amp;#39;s because of advising women to do &amp;quot;paper weight over womb&amp;quot; silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had them lay down on grass and gaze at the sky.  Because their bodies had already learned to move into the second attention, in that position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita, the witch Carlos imported from Mexico City,  likes a cloudy day better. She just looks for clouds which &amp;quot;look like a skull&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;dark energy&amp;quot; she summons that way causes them to start talking to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except she gets pissed off at what they say.  And takes it out on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe don&amp;#39;t do &amp;quot;skull gazing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the very most important thing, is to learn to be silent.

I'm using Cholita's explanation, which is undoubtedly from Florinda.\n\nUsing recap, you make a cardboard picture of yourself. Like one of those giant \"Terminator\" displays they had back when Terminator was hot, where Arnold is standing there next to the toys.\n\nCholita said you build that with recap, and when the eagle is ready to take your memories, you put that up to trick him and sneak around it.\n\nThen you flee as fast as you can!\n\nBut you aren't \"free\".  You're in terrible danger.\n\nYou MUST have a container for your awareness, to keep it intact.\n\nIf not, it'll just spread out further and further into the dark sea, perhaps being \"sentient\" for a while, but eventually it'll be spread so thin (expanded so large), that it's no longer sentient.\n\nYou're gone.\n\nSo you MUST have a container for your awareness.\n\nThe old seers went to the inorganic being's world.

Said he&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;show us where to go&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To hide in the earth.  In that giant dome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe it goes like this.  I&amp;#39;m using Cholita&amp;#39;s explanation, which is undoubtedly from Florinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using recap, you make a cardboard picture of yourself. Like one of those giant &amp;quot;Terminator&amp;quot; displays they had back when Terminator was hot, where Arnold is standing there next to the toys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita said you build that with recap, and when the eagle is ready to take your memories, you put that up to trick him and sneak around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you flee as fast as you can!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;free&amp;quot;.  You&amp;#39;re in terrible danger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You MUST have a container for your awareness, to keep it intact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, it&amp;#39;ll just spread out further and further into the dark sea, perhaps being &amp;quot;sentient&amp;quot; for a while, but eventually it&amp;#39;ll be spread so thin (expanded so large), that it&amp;#39;s no longer sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you MUST have a container for your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers went to the inorganic being&amp;#39;s world.  That container is good for millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new seers try to use the Earth itself as a container.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s good for billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But both come to an end, when their planet dies. Which is not so far away, compared to eternity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos found another path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t yet know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he did say once, that because of the workshops and all the people doing tensegrity he had access to energetic configurations even don Juan didn&amp;#39;t know about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we might be able to &amp;quot;turbo charge&amp;quot; that, if we insist anyone sticking around us has to be learning to be a real sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;pity people&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cut them some slack&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need actual seers, not &amp;quot;numbers&amp;quot; of dead weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not clear on why the old seers didn&amp;#39;t have enough practitioners back then,  to spot what Carlos found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But  they were likely a LOT weirder than we know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you aren&amp;#39;t following the &amp;quot;Cleargreen plan&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just do your tensegrity and recap, shut up, don&amp;#39;t make trouble, and someday Carlos will come take you into heaven!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very bad plan.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s lead to the near extinction of interest in the books of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon on one will ever take that seriously again, if we don&amp;#39;t fix this bad situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll be like, &amp;quot;Meher Baba&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone even know who that delusional bad guy is, anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_11chue8", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11chue8/freedom/ja4r4zd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677445109.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1677445109.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ja4i20u", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Willing_Brick_2698", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ja4815r", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_i0jsx16j", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt; So he failed to reach the 3rd attention, and is hiding in the inorganic being's world. \n\nBut I think there is another way to reach the third attention.

But that's just \"keep going\" stuff.\n\nI've noticed that it takes about 2 seconds for one reality to fade away when you bring in the next.\n\nSo to experience ALL of them at the same time, which is the very definition of the 3rd attention, you have to move the full distance in 1 second.\n\nThe Nagual Julian played around too much, in the lower right of that picture.\n\nAnd so he created a \"flat spot\".\n\nHe couldn't move the entire J curve in 1 second anymore.\n\nToo much playing around in shape shifted forms.\n\nSo he failed to reach the 3rd attention, and is hiding in the inorganic being's world.\n\nFrom which we could rescue him if we wanted to!\n\nNot only do we already KNOW how to reach the 3rd attention, but we also know what NOT to do, if you want to succeed.\n\nDon't play around too much in the deep red part of the second attention.  You'll make it too hard to pass by at the speeds we need.\n\nBut it's ok to try shapeshifting 4 or 5 times.   So you understand that everything Carlos wrote, works.\n\nAnd now, we have a new goal. Not mentioned at all in the books.\n\nSo we should all learn to reach the 3rd attention using our \"darkroom\" technique, but be on the lookout for other possibilities.\n\nI put the quote from a workshop about the other possibilities in this post, you should read it.\n\nAnd in his final interview Carlos said he was already gone, into the other possibility.\n\nImmortality in the emanations.\n\nHe didn't explain it, because likely it's partially in \"the abstract\".\n\nWhich can't be described at all.\n\nBut which does in fact connect witches to sorcerers in some odd way.\n\nJadey found 2 snakes at her home, looked at them, and when we met up in shared dreaming, she told me about it.\n\nAnd I got stuck in the abstract, examining snake scales for a full hour.\n\nCarlos himself pulled me out of that. At least, it sure seemed to be him.  I run into Carlos in the deep second attention from time to time. He seems to visit with a specific purpose each time.\n\nThe last time I saw him so clearly, I was playing around too much. Zipping in and out of dreaming rapidly.  \n\nHe might have shown up because I was in danger. When you do that, it's almost like burning from within.\n\nThis time, Jadey perhaps got me stuck in the abstract.  \n\nWhich allowed me to \"locate\" Carlos. Or he located me.\n\nIt's not new.  That witches can trigger that sort of thing in male sorcerers.\n\nCholita came to attack me a few months ago, but instead of threatening to kill me she froze and pretended to be a statue.\n\nAnd so later that night I was transfixed by a series of statues existing only in \"the abstract\".  Staring at them for more than a full hour.\n\nThey've become permanent relics in my phantom room.\n\nI suppose you could say, the abstract is outside all of it.  \n\nOutside the second attention even.\n\nBut we do make use of it.  \n\nIt's something you can't talk about at all.

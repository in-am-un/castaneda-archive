Maybe hooked to attention seeking with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of pointless to proselytize with sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you got 100 people to become excited, only one would find the time to actually do any work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And 4 out of 5 of those will quit, once they realize that sorcery requires a lifestyle change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, we don&amp;#39;t remind ourselves enough, you have to keep pushing. You never get to push less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always more!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rewards become astonishing however.  You kick the butt of every prophet, saint, or guru ever written about, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you still have to push harder, to get any further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose a good example is Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d already &amp;quot;had it all&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, he changed his name to Joe Cordoba, and became a fry cook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was curious to see what it would have been like, if he were never born into this river of shit world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You begin to be able to understand that, through Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &amp;quot;retrains&amp;quot; your very existence. How you &amp;quot;feel about things&amp;quot;.  But at a physical level too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another good reason to avoid closed eye meditation at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a death pit of laziness and pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mixed with 5% real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_znio2z", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/znio2z/can_you_skip_the_tensegrity/j0llg63/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1671294140.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1671294140.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j0l6w0e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "NightComprehensive52", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j0l6dg0", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_7zxv6xqs", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Sorry!

I could hear the local night bird singing outside.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t know how early it was.\n\nI cover the clocks in the room when I turn off the lights.\n\nI have no idea what time it is, as long as it\u2019s dark outside.\n\nI was trying to summon Cholita\u2019s inorganic being, to see if it still behaved the same way.\n\nHopefully Cholita was asleep, and it was looking for attention.\n\nIts behavior is quite unique.\n\nI really love that creature.\n\nI feel a little badly that some homeless bag lady out there has lost her companion.\n\nBut Cholita has a habit of snatching inorganic beings from other people.\n\nMy fairy entity showed up a bit, to see if I wanted anything.\n\nI\u2019ve recently learned, you can simply talk to her. Just tell her what you want.\n\nIf you don\u2019t get carried away doing that, I suspect you'll get a pretty high success rate.\n\nIt had never occurred to me in the past to speak to her, because it was such a struggle to maintain silence.\n\nAfter forcing yourself silent, you get the impression that words are your enemy.\n\nA single word might be enough to cause an amazing view coming from the second attention to fade away.\n\nBut in fact, you can easily use sound and words to manipulate the second attention, as I quickly learned last night.\n\nYou just have to get to the point that you can afford to do it.\n\nI was gazing out in the room, hoping to catch a glimpse of Cholita\u2019s new entity, when I heard Cholita scream, \u201cSTOP IT!!!!\u201d\n\nShe was locked in her bedroom. I began to think about whether I\u2019d coughed just now, sneezed, made the bed creek too loudly, or otherwise made a sound she can hear.\n\nSchizophrenia comes with OCD. Cholita has it big time. If she hears me,  she might go into a rage.\n\nShe assumes it's a deliberate attack on her.\n\nBut I hadn\u2019t made a sound.\n\nI was gazing into the purple fog, still looking for Cholita\u2019s inorganic.\n\nThe walls of the room changed to the inside of a white lava cave of some kind. They were smooth, but it was obvious where a flow had poured over another, and frozen in place.\n\nI\u2019d never seen that place before. The \"flat\" walls of my dark room were now curved, like the inside of a huge half sphere.\n\nThe purple fog was present all around the cave, so that it was possible to gaze at any point and extract something  using *intent*.\n\nI heard a blood curdling laugh.\n\nIt slowly rose in pitch, and was way too smooth and way too creepy.\n\nIt was the kind of laugh that only a witch can produce.\n\nI felt a tingle up my spine.\n\nIt was Cholita.\n\n\u201cOver there!!!\u201d, she ordered.\n\nAnd she laughed again.\n\nI almost thought I heard her clapping her hands as if celebrating something fantastic she'd seen.\n\nThe purple fog began to have red patches in it.  They seemed to bloom into being, in response to Cholita's sounds.\n\nThey quickly faded away when the sound ended, almost like an echo of Cholita\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cDo that!  Put it over there!!!\u201d she said.\n\nThe purple fog fizzed a bit, in response to her words.\n\nI\u2019d discovered something new.\n\nSound can manipulate the second attention as easily as the eyes can!\n\nI should have recalled, the old sorcerers had a practice called, \u201cThe loud and the Silent\u201d.\n\nOr something like that.\n\nI\u2019m still banned from reading the books without a good reason. Carlos said it, and as long as I do what he asked of me, I seem to get help from his *intent*.\n\nI tiptoed over to my door and noiselessly opened it a bit, to see if Cholita\u2019s inorganic being was behind her antics.\n\nA night or two before I\u2019d caught a glimpse of it \u201cguarding\u201d the way to Cholita\u2019s room, with a dark mass of tentacles, menacingly pouring out of the crack under the door.\n\nThey waved up the side of the door, as if they would grab anyone who dared cross.\n\nThey were not there.  In fact, I saw a little golden glow, such as my fairy entity can produce.\n\nCholita began to laugh over and over, and I heard her walking around her room.\n\nI felt a little jealous, so I returned to my room and called out to my own inorganic being, the only one I can count on to show up.\n\n\u201cFairy!!!\u201d I called.\n\nI realized, that was the first time I called her by a name.\n\nShe fizzled into view, but vaguely. It wasn\u2019t enough to write home about.\n\nJust a faint woman\u2019s head, which quickly blew away into the fog.  Maybe back to Cholita's room.\n\nI guess she wasn\u2019t sure I was calling her. The whole idea of talking to her was quite new.\n\nI forced more silence, preparing for Cholita\u2019s next laugh.\n\nI wanted to see the red splotches form again.\n\nCholita had turned on a music video. She was singing in Spanish.\n\nShe has a lovely voice!\n\nA bit too loud when inappropriate, but beautiful all the same.\n\nTime went by.   I have no idea how much.  Cholita's singing voice had caused me to stop thinking about doing anything at all.\n\nEventually, in very deep silence, I decided to call out to her inorganic.\n\nMaybe she was ignoring it, and it could be summoned.\n\nYesterday I described it as a fuzzy black mink while writing in this subreddit.\n\nBut I was a little confused while thinking of how to call out to it, being closer to stopping the world than playing with colors.\n\nIt's hard to think clearly on that edge.\n\nAs loudly as I could, without risking the wrath of Cholita, I called out, \u201cMinx!\u201d\n\nI tried to remember.\n\nDo people wear minx?  Or is it mink?\n\nI recalled. A minx is a temptress who dazzles with her appearance.  And highly likely to wear mink.\n\nSounds about right!\n\n\u201cMinx!!!\u201d, I called out.\n\nI repeated it several times, glancing in the direction of Cholita's room.\n\nI felt a bridge of white light forming, between me and Cholita's room.\n\nIn the past I could connect visually to Cholita through that tunnel, but she'd put a stop to that.\n\nIn this case, at least it was obvious that my calls to Minx were going in that direction.\n\nThe purple fog near the door began to change color to blue.\n\nThere was a very faint blue cloud, lingering a foot inside my room, near the door.\n\n\u201cYes, you!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cMinx...\u201d\n\nThe blue fizzled, brightened up, floated in front of me to the place Cholita\u2019s dreaming double had first summoned it, and it turned into an abstract fountain.\n\nIt almost \"popped\" into that shape.  It was floating just a foot or two shy of the ceiling on the east wall.\n\nCholita had turned her backyard fountain back on that night.  You could hear it outside.\n\nThe blue Minx fountain was a bit dim.  Certainly it was bright enough to see clearly, but not as intense as I was hoping for.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure it really was Minx. That's the cool thing about Minx.  She's dazzling beyond anything you can imagine, and completely impossible that you should even be seeing such a thing.\n\nIt's \"too real\".\n\nI looked around the room and saw 2 people arguing in the right corner. They were in the shadows in some alley between tall buildings.\n\nThat was a dream for sure.  It was changing at full speed.\n\nI looked back to the abstract fountain and noticed it only changed shape one or two times a second.\n\nIt began to brighten up as soon as I noticed that detail.\n\nProbably it was dimmer because I hadn\u2019t focused enough attention on it.\n\nMinx seems to need more energy than Fairy.\n\nBut once she has it, she\u2019s dazzling!\n\nThe fountain seemed to have a little band going around it,  like a ribbon made of the same concrete as the fountain itself.  I got lost in the band, almost feeling as if I could drive a tiny car around that loop.\n\nIt was glowing ultra-violet blue, but with a soothing light.\n\nGazing at it made me feel peaceful.\n\nIt was slowly rotating, with super bright details all over the edges.\n\nAnd yet, it didn't rotate at all.\n\nAnd it sparkled.\n\nCholita let out the oddest sound.\n\nIt was somewhere between a laugh, a sigh, and a call to a lost animal.\n\nMinx was gone.\n\nThe next morning as I took a shower before work, I heard Cholita in her room still celebrating loudly. \n\nI thought to myself, maybe she finally likes being home better than wandering around homeless?\n\nOr maybe she was looking for a Minx.\n\nEdited six times\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Second Attention and Sound", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_gble1i", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1588361544.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1588350819.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do dogs have names?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do they care what the name is?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TV detective Colombo had a dog named, \u201cdog\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn\u2019t want to impose his will on it by making up a name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing was good enough, so he gave up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s the value of giving a dog a name?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few times hearing that name, followed by a nice bowl of tasty food, you can use the name to summon them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, inorganic beings are no different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I was practicing at a time that might have been fairly early.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly, not past midnight.

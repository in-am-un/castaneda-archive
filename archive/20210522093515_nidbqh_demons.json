You could say Noah predicted the flood but that's more of a myth based on the epic of Gilgamesh..\n\n&gt; You haven't studied the bible or you wouldn't say that.\n\nI've read the bible plenty as a mormon, though we also had the \"extra\" bible, my point was basically that if you pass down things word of mouth, if a prophecy is prophesied ten years from now in a story passed down for 20 years, it's easier to modify the past when re-telling, oh yeah it came to pass exactly like that... \n\nI've also studied ancient sumeria (in search of maybe a \"true\" but earlier god in their pantheon, since I saw God as narcissistic and also it seemed to me if there were a god he'd have setup his worshippers from the beginning, and sumerian texts are the oldest...) -- a lot of actual biblical and mythical content actually does come from Sumeria - many sumerian god's eventually became god's in Akkadia, Greece, Rome, and one of the God's became elohim (Anu) with (enki) becoming Satan. \n\nThough if you research Enki he was MUCH nicer, better than Anu... and if I were to choose a God worth worshipping it'd be him as he's kind of aloof, gave us civilization, knowledge, and wanted us to evolve and have our own thoughts and free will, verses the other God's who just wanted apes as slaves, but he's a scientist and could care less if we sin or worship him (we're basically animal kingdom - if a lion eats their cub, well that's just nature), of course morality is an important civilizational construct, but it's not dependant on a deity. . \n\nThen there's the fact many biblical \"facts\" are likely changing (read: Mandela Effect, Shifting realities, etc)? \n\nOne thing I wonder if people \"awakening\" to sorcery, and other things who normally are more \"Technically/scientifically\" inclined (like myself) after seeing some sort of \"wake up call\"... are they more susceptible to seeing \"changes\" to reality... \n\nIn other words, I'm wondering if the people in here might be more \"affected\" by mandela effects since y'all already perceive the world as \"something different\" and can see beyond it's normal \"facade\". \n\nHere's just a small overview for those not \"briefed\" on biblical changes. \n\nThe biggest being: \n\n&gt; Isaiah 11:6 \n\n&gt; The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.\n\n&gt; Should be: \n\n&gt; Then the Lion shall lay down with the Lamb and the bear shall eat grass like the ox, and the child shall play on the hole of the asp and nothing shall hurt nor destroy in all My Holy Mountain.\n\nNow this seems crazy, and I don't buy the religious view that \"satan\" is changing this stuff because: end times... I mean, why would he change other things not biblical like the \"Houston We Have a Problem\" in Apollo 13 the movie?\n\nSee: http://mandelabiblechanges.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/word-changes.jpg\n\nGo to any bible search, search the following keywords: \n\n- stuff (13 results, should be possessions mostly)\n- alien (15 results, might be better as : stranger?)\n- corn (didn't exist, it came from mexico, should be grain or wheat) \n- easter (at the time was a pagan thing, should be passover). \n- suburbs\n- bank (financially, in luke 19:23, it should be moneychangers). \n- couch (I'm surprised la-z-boy and futon aren't!)\n- fryingpan (modern word, and should be two words). \n- pavement\n- conduit\n- highway\n- parlour\n- barber\u2019s razor\n- superscription likely should be inscription.\n- mown grass (when were mowers invented?) \n- revenue\n- mart\n- mortgaged\n- planets (constellations?) \n\n[source](http://mandelabiblechanges.com/index.php/2018/04/24/top-40-bizarre-new-words-in-your-kjv-bibles/)\n\n \n\nAlso some crazy passages like (btw this is all KJV, which is what I always used, and what Mormon's): \n\nMatt 1:2\n&gt; Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat ~~Judas~~ Judah and his brethren;\n\nMatthew 27:8 \n&gt; Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by ~~Jeremy~~ Jeremiah the prophet \n\nMatt 3:11\n&gt; but he ~~that~~ who cometh after me is mightier than I, whose ~~shoes~~ sandals I am not worthy to ~~bear~~ loose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire...\n\nMatt 5:13\n&gt; Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost ~~his~~ its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.\n\nMatt 6:9-13\n&gt; 9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father ~~which~~ who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\n\n&gt; 10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done ~~in~~ on earth, as it is in heaven.\n\n&gt; 11 Give us this day our daily bread.\n\n&gt; 12 And forgive us our ~~debts, as we forgive our debtors~~ trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.\n\n&gt; 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.\n\nMatt 7:1\n&gt; Judge not, ~~that ye be not judged~~ lest ye be judged.\n\nMatt 7:15\n&gt; Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ~~ravening~~ ravenous wolves.\n\nMatt 7:22\n&gt; Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out ~~ devils~~ demons? and in thy name done many ~~wonderful~~ mighty works?\n\nMatt 9:17\n&gt; Neither do men put new wine into old wineskins: else the wineskins break, and the wine runneth out, and the wineskins perish: but they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\n\nMatt 10:42\n&gt; And whosoever shall give ~~to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple~~ to the least of these, a drink of water in My name, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.\n\nMatt 19:14\n&gt; But Jesus said, ~~Suffer  little children~~ suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\n\nMatt 22:19\n&gt;Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.\n(Should be denarius, or talent, [pennies weren't a thing](http://mandelabiblechanges.com/index.php/2017/10/11/pennies-from-er-heaven-another-provable-mandela-effect-bible-change/) during King James life, if they were to use a colloquial or familiar term at the time they might've used \"pence\"). \n\nLuke 19:27\n&gt; But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.\n\n^^ Doesn't sound much like the Jesus, I remember. \n\nSome other ones: \n\n- Fruit of the Loom Cornucopia (never existed)\n- Bombing of Black Tom which permanently closed the Statue of Liberty torch from tours which is on Liberty Island (not Ellis) and led to U.S. entering WW1 (not the sinking of the Lucitania if that's what you remember). \n- Photography tech being much earlier: Many remember Lincoln being first president to be captured on camera, but pictures exist from 1830's, and 2 other presidents were captured on camera before Lincoln. \n- [Indiana Jones' hat is way too tall, it's ridiculous](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8e/Indiana_Jones_in_Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark.jpg). \n- Yellow sun is now blindingly white, and we're not on the edge of galaxy in Sagittarius arm, but in the orion arm. \n- Wizard of Oz: Scarecrow had a gun? Cowardly Lion has a net and bug spray, and I tin-man had an ax, but that I remember... \n- [Razzle Dazzle Ships from ww1](https://www.alternatememories.com/historical-events/science/razzle-dazzle-ships) (once you see, you can't unsee, so these should be common knowledge). \n- Northpole - used to be shown as ice on maps, this is where santa lived, may or may not have been land UNDER the ice, but there sure as hell was ice in the north pole. Now ....there never was (except maybe during an ice age). \n- Svalberd is new, didn't exist. \n\n[...so many more...](https://www.alternatememories.com/mandela-effect-list) \n\nTLDR: Bible facts, may not be \"fact\" in a world where reality is shifting anyways...and on a tangent: Does insight, spiritual awakening correlate to \"seeing\" shiftings in reality aka Mandela Effects?

I mean, why would he change other things not biblical like the &amp;quot;Houston We Have a Problem&amp;quot; in Apollo 13 the movie?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See: &lt;a href=\"http://mandelabiblechanges.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/word-changes.jpg\"&gt;http://mandelabiblechanges.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/word-changes.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to any bible search, search the following keywords: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;stuff (13 results, should be possessions mostly)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;alien (15 results, might be better as : stranger?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;corn (didn&amp;#39;t exist, it came from mexico, should be grain or wheat) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;easter (at the time was a pagan thing, should be passover). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;suburbs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;bank (financially, in luke 19:23, it should be moneychangers). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;couch (I&amp;#39;m surprised la-z-boy and futon aren&amp;#39;t!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;fryingpan (modern word, and should be two words). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;pavement&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;conduit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;highway&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;parlour&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;barber\u2019s razor&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;superscription likely should be inscription.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;mown grass (when were mowers invented?) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;revenue&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;mart&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;mortgaged&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;planets (constellations?) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mandelabiblechanges.com/index.php/2018/04/24/top-40-bizarre-new-words-in-your-kjv-bibles/\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also some crazy passages like (btw this is all KJV, which is what I always used, and what Mormon&amp;#39;s): &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matt 1:2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat &lt;del&gt;Judas&lt;/del&gt; Judah and his brethren;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matthew 27:8 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by &lt;del&gt;Jeremy&lt;/del&gt; Jeremiah the prophet &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matt 3:11&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;but he &lt;del&gt;that&lt;/del&gt; who cometh after me is mightier than I, whose &lt;del&gt;shoes&lt;/del&gt; sandals I am not worthy to &lt;del&gt;bear&lt;/del&gt; loose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matt 5:13&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost &lt;del&gt;his&lt;/del&gt; its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matt 6:9-13&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father &lt;del&gt;which&lt;/del&gt; who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done &lt;del&gt;in&lt;/del&gt; on earth, as it is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11 Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12 And forgive us our &lt;del&gt;debts, as we forgive our debtors&lt;/del&gt; trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.

Cholita has one,  and it was not quite black as described. Almost though.\n\nSome IOBs can only form a scary shadow shaped like a man, and lurk about trying to frighten people.  But they can't actually do anything other than jump out at you.\n\nOne of the homes don Juan hung out in on occasion had one of those to guard the house.\n\nI've seen those, and there's even a technique in here for exposing them, although no one has duplicated it so far.  You get them from \"seeing energy on flat surfaces\", by running your hand along the light, with the intention to make IOBs visible.\n\nThat's for finding them, not summoning them.  That technique is unlikely to bring you one that wasn't there before.\n\nI blame Cholita for our shadow man.  I believe she got it when she ran away for a couple of weeks last year.\n\nIOBs that we encounter here on this planet come from each of the 8 great bands, and don Juan said there are as many as there are organic beings on this world, mostly because organic beings only come from one band, and they come from 8.\n\nI suspect, there are even IOBs who prefer insects.  Even ants perhaps.\n\nSo no, they aren't demons.  But they play one on TV.\n\n(a joke, sort of).\n\nThe reason they so often look like our idea of a \"demon\" is that the kind humans most easily perceive form their appearance based on latent images in the minds of the viewers, and they can alter it based on the type of emotion they are trying to interact with.\n\nFear is the easiest, and over time we've all come to expect them to look like \"demons\".\n\nBut there are no demons. It's a fabrication.  Sometimes accidental, but sometimes on purpose.\n\nThe Jewish Prophets probably misrepresented them on purpose.  You have to study the history of that area, around 6000 years ago, to understand why they did it.  It wasn't out of malice.  And they didn't intend for their fabrication to spread to other cultures.\n\nThe Christians did that.\n\nBut it was a very rough place back then, and I presume they understood that a good story involving demons and a single God, could create some positive morals and stem the tide of violence in the middle east.  Not to mention, the \"single God\" idea ran contrary to their worst enemy, who was responsible for a large amount of violence back then.\n\nIn the Jewish portion of the bible (the old testament), IOBs create specific moods in people. They're invisible under normal circumstances.\n\nA demon of jealousy, a demon of lust.  Those were always taking over kings in their storyline.\n\nYou can find long lists of specific Jewish demon types, in books influenced by Enochian magic (Jewish Prophet Sorcery which is the basis of most western magic).\n\nSo those of you who still feel the ugly hand of Christianity pulling on you, remember this:\n\nThere are no demons as described in the bible.\n\nYou can draw your own conclusions based on that, but you should verify it for yourself first.\n\nDon't add even more inventory to your already cluttered mind.\n\nSee for yourself using Darkroom gazing.\n\nAnd also, have a little common sense.  In the Jewish bible, when a demon is described as almost human, it's just a man. Sometimes very tall, as in Noah's \"giants\".  But Satan himself is supposed to be very dapper, and pleasing to look at.\n\nThey're just men, but in a non-organic body at the end of the world, and back in Noah's time, they could even impregnate women.  So they were nearly identical to us, in that story.\n\nThe Chinese around that period had Kabuki like demons, in special shapes which these days are perfect for tiny action figures and video games. Didn't look anything at all like the Jewish demons.\n\nDaoist and Buddhist demons also are rather highly decorated and stylish and have rulers and armies.\n\nIn the lower reaches of Chinese hell, the demons pick up their pitchforks to punish humans.\n\nThis view visited the Hellenist Jews (Rome), and was adopted by the early Christians, who created an exaggerated form of the Jewish demons based on Chinese mythology. \n\nInstead of only affecting your mood, they could completely take you over and make you go into convulsions.\n\nJesus \"rescued\" people from those.\n\nBut since they don't exist, you can again draw your own conclusion.\n\nChristianity became so infected with Chinese demon imagery, that today we have the picture of Satan in red fireproof long underwear, ruling over millions of Chinese style demons in a deep cavern.  The cavern is also part of Chinese beliefs, and foreign to Judaism except in translated versions that don't clarify what they're talking about.\n\nThe word, \"Hell\" is actually 6 different words in the original languages.  For 6 different things, one of them being a famous garbage dump outside Jerusalem.\n\nIt's not a cavern filled with angry demons at all.\n\nI'm afraid to say that western magic is infected with this borrowed and untrue imagery, which should tell you something about western magic.\n\nIt's book dealed and nonsensical.\n\nI suggest that as a witch, you make yourself a \"familiar spirit\".\n\nJust because it's funny.  IOBs like to please us, so \"funny\" is a positive to them.\n\nFairy's shape probably worked out so well, because  I liked the heroine from \"Dragon's Lair\", a very early video game.  So it was nice for both of us, and she did a very good job of holding that appearance for me.\n\nBut prior to that, under don Juan's control, she was very scary.\n\nThe first time a \"demon\" tries to scare you in the dark room, don't be afraid.  Tell her she's welcome anytime.  But that you could have a lot more fun with her, if she looked like a cat.\n\nTry a Siberian.  The Cheshire cat.\n\nLittle Smoke did that for me, although her first 2 tries were comical.  She made herself into a Fairy, with a cat's hair all over her face.\n\nBut eventually she became a perfectly formed Siberian, and jumped up on the bed.\n\nThe bed even seemed to bounce.\n\nThere's too much to say about IOBs, but bottom line, they can push with a small amount of force.\n\nNot enough to hurt you, but they could cause something to fall on you, if it only took a little force to push it off a place higher than you are.\n\nFancy has done that to get my attention.\n\nThe important thing to remember is: Humans need magic. They need fright. They need darkness. They need the unknown.\n\nAn IOB is far healthier for you, than any multi-vitamin you might be taking.\n\nPlus, you get to have fun with other humans.\n\nYou can ask your spouse, \"Honey, is it ok if I stare into the void all night, to find my own demon?  We don't have any yet.\"", "edited": 1621699399.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gz2dvr5", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sure hope so!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs come in millions of types.

Those were always taking over kings in their storyline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find long lists of specific Jewish demon types, in books influenced by Enochian magic (Jewish Prophet Sorcery which is the basis of most western magic).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So those of you who still feel the ugly hand of Christianity pulling on you, remember this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are no demons as described in the bible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can draw your own conclusions based on that, but you should verify it for yourself first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t add even more inventory to your already cluttered mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See for yourself using Darkroom gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, have a little common sense.  In the Jewish bible, when a demon is described as almost human, it&amp;#39;s just a man. Sometimes very tall, as in Noah&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;giants&amp;quot;.  But Satan himself is supposed to be very dapper, and pleasing to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re just men, but in a non-organic body at the end of the world, and back in Noah&amp;#39;s time, they could even impregnate women.  So they were nearly identical to us, in that story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chinese around that period had Kabuki like demons, in special shapes which these days are perfect for tiny action figures and video games. Didn&amp;#39;t look anything at all like the Jewish demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daoist and Buddhist demons also are rather highly decorated and stylish and have rulers and armies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the lower reaches of Chinese hell, the demons pick up their pitchforks to punish humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This view visited the Hellenist Jews (Rome), and was adopted by the early Christians, who created an exaggerated form of the Jewish demons based on Chinese mythology. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of only affecting your mood, they could completely take you over and make you go into convulsions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jesus &amp;quot;rescued&amp;quot; people from those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since they don&amp;#39;t exist, you can again draw your own conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Christianity became so infected with Chinese demon imagery, that today we have the picture of Satan in red fireproof long underwear, ruling over millions of Chinese style demons in a deep cavern.  The cavern is also part of Chinese beliefs, and foreign to Judaism except in translated versions that don&amp;#39;t clarify what they&amp;#39;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word, &amp;quot;Hell&amp;quot; is actually 6 different words in the original languages.  For 6 different things, one of them being a famous garbage dump outside Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a cavern filled with angry demons at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid to say that western magic is infected with this borrowed and untrue imagery, which should tell you something about western magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s book dealed and nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest that as a witch, you make yourself a &amp;quot;familiar spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just because it&amp;#39;s funny.  IOBs like to please us, so &amp;quot;funny&amp;quot; is a positive to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy&amp;#39;s shape probably worked out so well, because  I liked the heroine from &amp;quot;Dragon&amp;#39;s Lair&amp;quot;, a very early video game.  So it was nice for both of us, and she did a very good job of holding that appearance for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But prior to that, under don Juan&amp;#39;s control, she was very scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time a &amp;quot;demon&amp;quot; tries to scare you in the dark room, don&amp;#39;t be afraid.  Tell her she&amp;#39;s welcome anytime.  But that you could have a lot more fun with her, if she looked like a cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try a Siberian.  The Cheshire cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke did that for me, although her first 2 tries were comical.  She made herself into a Fairy, with a cat&amp;#39;s hair all over her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But eventually she became a perfectly formed Siberian, and jumped up on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bed even seemed to bounce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s too much to say about IOBs, but bottom line, they can push with a small amount of force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not enough to hurt you, but they could cause something to fall on you, if it only took a little force to push it off a place higher than you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy has done that to get my attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The important thing to remember is: Humans need magic. They need fright. They need darkness. They need the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An IOB is far healthier for you, than any multi-vitamin you might be taking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, you get to have fun with other humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can ask your spouse, &amp;quot;Honey, is it ok if I stare into the void all night, to find my own demon?  We don&amp;#39;t have any yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nidbqh/demons/gz2dvr5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1621698916.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_nidbqh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gz3y2je", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "zvive", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gz3w8hh", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_l8zck", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I'll have to wait on that, still looking for them...

But over time I've come to realize just how flexible the assemblage points of women are.  They seem to have fairly easy command of the range between blue and green on the J curve, with occasional ability to \"swoop\" all the way down the back and up the front, in no time.\n\nBut they won't remember doing that.\n\nUp near the shoulder blades, they have no problem remembering. But they just call it \"being moody\", or if it moves down to the green they feel \"soothed\".\n\nHot water can allow them to move it.  Darkness helps too, or they wouldn't like smelly baths with candles all around.\n\nThere's questions of course.  \n\nDo you have to have an inorganic being already showing up once in a while?\n\nThey tend to like men more because nearly all inorganic beings are female.\n\nCan they push on water if you never played with them in their own world?\n\nBut it's worth a try.  Hopefully you already shower once in a while!\n\nJust keep in mind, you have to silence that internal dialogue!\n\nWhy do  they like water?  Some passages in the books seem to imply the opposite ought to be true.\n\nBut it's pretty clear they do from the lectures of Carlos.  Which include a \"dark story\" about them and water.\n\nAnd by the way, if you are wandering around in their world and some beautiful half dressed women in a warm water pond try to lure you to come bathe with them, better pass on that offer!\n\nImages of water seem to just come up, in their world.\n\nI've seen them move objects right in my face a good 20 times.  Nearly all were high water content objects.\n\nI must admit I spent a lot of time in my Ally's world pushing and pulling on her, before I started to have a Poltergeist.  So them moving stuff might require you to \"interface\" to them a little.\n\nAnd just when my efforts to learn to get them to move things was getting cool, I made a terrible mistake.\n\nI got worried about Cholita, and told my inorganic being to guard her when I wasn't around.\n\nThat was the end of my \"poltergeist\" fun.\n\nBut Cholita was soon able to command her with a gaze.

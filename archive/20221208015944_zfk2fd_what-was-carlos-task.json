And doesn&amp;#39;t believe a word of his own pretend magic, which he&amp;#39;s selling to others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If what they&amp;#39;re doing doesn&amp;#39;t get money, they&amp;#39;ll go do something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see it all over Youtube.  The guys with the channel that &amp;quot;knows and can explain everything&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Sadhguru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If one of those pops up on my Youtube feed, and their lecture of the day has anything at all to do with Carlos, I go comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keeps a flow going into instagram.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe Carlos was aware of how humans convince each other of things, and knew that putting random people together in an unsupervised discussion group only leads to contamination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to egging on bad men like O&amp;#39;Neil.  Because now they have a low effort place to try to do what they want: dominate others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without that maybe they would have moved on to plague Yoga instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in a discussion group there&amp;#39;s more than just discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s bad people lurking, trying to steal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those drown out the voices of people who are actually succeeding a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This place would die in months if it wasn&amp;#39;t managed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings up an interesting point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can couples practice sorcery together?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YES, if one of them can pull the other into real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if both of them are willing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita could pull a lover into real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming she ditched the pet skunk, which greeted me again this morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But her lovers would dismiss any hint of real magic as being just her craziness.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on the receiving end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she lifts you up into the air with one finger, it&amp;#39;s darned hard not to forget that in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;not allowed&amp;quot; in our normal flow of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a couple trying to practice must have both willing to perceive magic, and possibly neither with some strong interest in an outside fake magical system or that will taint their interpretations just as badly as not believing in anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if neither in the couple can pull the other into advanced magic levels, maybe all you end up with is one serious person being held back by a less serious person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard enough to overcome your own disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_zfk2fd", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zfk2fd/what_was_carlos_task/ke6hj6p/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1703080858.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1703080858.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ke5zrsq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_izewvcv", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt;O\u2019Neil\n\nI\u2019ll put this screenshot from today\u2019s practitioner chat here.

In the cleargreen chat group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was in fact frustrated that most in private classes couldn&amp;#39;t be bothered to show up on very short notice, like 2 hours after a call from Amy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was reading infinity, and sometimes he&amp;#39;d see an opportunity in the flow of energy, requiring him to try to make use of it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;d get a call for a private class, on Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy was by the way, one of the witches. For real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a crappy one I presume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Was there ever confusion or skepticism especially after carlos died?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed the rule, and trashed him myself a bit.  I tried to get others to realize it was all play acting, but no one would buy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I went with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even tried to get Cholita to stop leaving his books around our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was an odd case in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did everything they told her to do, and practiced religiously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was definitely not a groupie, although she might have been motivated in part, by being given a place to live, and a profession that lasted as long as her sanity held up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was complaining to me 2 days ago that I had put a curse on her email.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she wasn&amp;#39;t getting any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pointed out that I emailed her just the week before and she got it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s just the point. I only get YOUR emails. It&amp;#39;s obvious you&amp;#39;ve cursed it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fairness to Cholita, if she curses something, it&amp;#39;s really cursed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to suggest that maybe getting angry over bizarre delusions, the way paranoid schizophrenics do, is why no one was emailing her anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except one mysterious old person out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;#39;t actually use email.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita once asked me to go get her some tissues, looking like she was about to cry.  While we were checking something on my computer at work and the results weren&amp;#39;t going her way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was gone, she contacted that person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t get to see how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was instructed to leave immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_zfk2fd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zfk2fd/what_was_carlos_task/izewvcv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670517646.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1670517646.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "izettl2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Artivist", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1670516444.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_izeqbau", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4pgwt", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "When you were attending the private classes, what made you stick where others doubted and dropped out?

Had to hire a real bodyguard.\n\nHarvey is still out there, cheating people of money.\n\nI saw a link saying, \"Harvey was quickly exposed as a fraud by the Cherokee nation\".\n\nBut the link didn't produce that text.  It's probably scrolled out of there.\n\n[https://www.baltimoresun.com/](https://www.baltimoresun.com/)\n\nThen there's the fake \"real don Juan\".\n\nA completely delusional story, which up until now, wasn't so obvious  you could just point here, and show them they're nuts.\n\nNow you can.\n\nSo they don't like this place. I think a leader was hoping to take over, because the old bastard is very old.\n\nInventory warriors they were. Just repeating stuff from the first books, as if they had crossed themselves and prayed to the virgin Mary.\n\n\"Affirmations from the world around us\", was their idea of \"magic\".\n\nHey clueless guys:  That was little smoke!  Carlos demonstrated in class, as if it weren't already obvious.\n\nAnd that \"black dot of death\"?\n\nYou really bought that one?\n\nDon Juan was teaching Carlos the point of view of the \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nWho never learned to see, so they were off their rockers.\n\nTook them a year to prepare an encounter with Little Smoke.\n\nCarlos just whistled, and she came running.\n\nBut like I said, the bad player attackers lie.\n\nSo you can never just ask them what's going on.  Even if you'd like to help them escape their madness.\n\nHere's a theory:\n\nThe shamanism subreddit is infested with fake shamans and their students.\n\nEven the Mods.\n\nThey all hate Carlos.\n\nReason it's likely infested?\n\nI can't imagine a real shamanism student, a native American, bothering to go in that subreddit.\n\nWhy???\n\nJust like real Jewish people studying Kabbalah, don't go around advertising themselves.\n\nIt's a serious belief system, as is real shamanism.\n\nBut fake don Juan surely has some henchmen in the shamanism subreddit. He can recruit clueless people in there!\n\nNative Americans and Jews, don't want to recruit crazy people.\n\nJust a theory.  But if I try to post in the shamanism reddit, I get tared and feathered.  And then the Mods delete it,  under the pretense I'm causing trouble because I stand up to bullies.\n\nExcept by the real people in there, who ask me to post more.

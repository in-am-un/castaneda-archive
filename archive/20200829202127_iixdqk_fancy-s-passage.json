It was beyond the wall of my bedroom, but nothing would have stopped me if I wanted to walk right in there.\n\nDon't ask me how that's possible. I have no idea.\n\nA better question might be, can inorganic beings teach us how to do that?\n\nOf course! That\u2019s all they want to do.  Teach us advanced sorcery!\n\nBesides eat you.  There's that too.\n\nBut most are too well behaved to do that.\n\nExcept for Fancy, my new inorganic being.\n\nShe seems to play nice, but if you keep track, it\u2019s all trickery.\n\nAs Juann has pointed out, inorganic beings are at a disadvantage for teaching.\n\nWhile they may talk in lucid dreaming, I\u2019ve never heard them talk when I was awake.\n\nCarlos once spoke to a coyote, who was almost surely Little Smoke in disguise.\n\nBut later on when he insisted it spoke, Don Juan pretty much told him, they cannot.\n\nIt just seems that way.\n\nMyself, that\u2019s good enough!\n\nI don\u2019t even get that.  The imagined talking.\n\nJust like Juann, I only figure out they were teaching me, much, much later on.\n\nAs Don Juan said, \u201cEverything the inorganic beings do is significant.\u201d\n\nTrouble is, you have to pay careful attention.\n\nLast night I was pleased to see that Fancy came when called.\n\n5 seconds! That\u2019s how long it took her head to show up, once I called her name.\n\nFairy never came that fast.\n\nWait...  Bad choice of words.\n\nBut as usual, Fancy was so dim it was not satisfying.\n\nI had a long talk with her about it.\n\nHopefully Cholita wasn\u2019t listening, because I talked to her out loud.\n\nAs a result, she floated towards a purple puff.\n\nI put my hand into it, and she got a little brighter.\n\nI wiggled my fingers in it, and she got even brighter.\n\nThen out of curiosity, or maybe because of something she was doing, I stuck my head in there.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019d never thought of that before.\n\nPerhaps it was the Shimmer Gazing I\u2019d done a few days earlier, which made it possible for me to focus my attention on the fine details inside the puffs.\n\nEach time I tried something, I noticed that Fancy either got brighter, or was gone.\n\nShe was leading me somewhere.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that the Tensegrity pass, \u201cTeasing the web\u201d, was working extremely well.\n\nI could literally pull on the little fine lines of pinkish light I found inside the puff of color.\n\nIf I wiggled them, I could even locate \u201cspecial\u201d fibers which seemed to be attached to my body.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual to run into a single occurrence of that, while scooping colors in darkness.\n\nBut a fully reliable, fully stable cobweb, which tickles you every single time you touch it, is just plain creepy.\n\nI can fully understand why Carlos stopped wiggling his fingers, once he felt that.\n\nZuleica threatened to bop him on the head if he didn\u2019t keep it up.\n\nI found 3 or 4 such fibers, each attached to a different part of my body.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I looked up at the ceiling. It was oddly bright, with a mellow yellow light.\n\nIt reminded me of a scene from when I was a baby. Maybe my little bed was under such a ceiling, and I used to gaze up at it.\n\nWhatever the reason for the memory, the instant I gazed at it I fell into absolute silence.\n\nThe deepest kind, which even seems to be self-sustaining.\n\nIn a single breath, I fell into heightened awareness.\n\nAside from the amazing levels of bliss, my breath was instantly perfect.\n\nJust the stomach moved, and it wasn\u2019t under my conscious control.\n\nMy body was breathing naturally, by itself.\n\nFancy turned super bright. That\u2019s what I\u2019m always after.\n\nThe \u201cWow!!!!!\u201d experience.\n\nI found myself staring at TV screen static.\n\nI don\u2019t know where it was located. I was simply looking at it, in some other place.\n\nI remembered that whenever I had a fever as a child, I could travel to where that static existed.\n\nIt was a miniature vision which was repeatable, over and over.\n\nOnce I learn to do it when I had a fever, I could do it at night in bed.\n\nBut at around 14 years old, I lost the ability.\n\nI decided to see what some Tensegrity looked like, at this level of silence.\n\nThe V spot pass was stunning. Each time my cupped hand swung in from the outside, towards the V spot, it dragged a huge quantity of the colorful fibers floating in the air.\n\nThey sort of created a disk or halo around my pointed fingers, which ended up being stuffed into that spot, spilling out to the sides.\n\nI began to think a bit.\n\nWhat an awful shame that Cleargreen never figured out what the Tensegrity passes can really do.\n\nIt\u2019s just weird Tai Chi for them.\n\nHopefully we can get our 16 waking dreamers (yes, I increased it), and finally figure the moves out.\n\nThe Tensegrity moves are all over the place, scooping from the floor, pouring invisible water, and even poking holes into things, using special hand gestures.\n\nHow could they not have gotten curious?\n\nAnd it was their job. They were payed to teach!\n\nJust not to learn I suppose.\n\nAll the thinking made me notice a hole in my lower left rib-cage.\n\nI even stuck a finger in there, but it wasn\u2019t my Tonal\u2019s finger.\n\nI could feel the size of the hole.\n\nFancy\u2019s ice cave became visible on the south west wall.\n\nI could clearly see the floor going all the way into the cave.\n\nI walked towards the inside far enough to realize I had gone beyond the bedroom wall.\n\nI stepped back.\n\nOn the floor I saw a bolt.\n\nThe first or second time Fancy brought me into her cave, two screws fell onto the ground, right through the bed.\n\nI could see them down there as clear as anything.\n\nMy dreaming body was right there, with my Tonal.\n\nExcept it was standing up, right through the bed.\n\nThis time, I must have walked away in it because it\u2019s unlikely my Tonal could manage to pass through the solid wall.\n\nI had a strong urge to pick up the bolt.\n\nFancy was looking at me like, \u201cDo it!\u201d\n\nI realized, it would perfectly fit into that hole I had found.\n\nI have no idea what would come of that, but I recall Carol Tigg\u2019s warning about not touching things in other worlds.\n\nIf you get too involved, you can end up stuck there.\n\nEven reading a newspaper is risky.\n\nSticking a bolt into a hole in your body would probably not be a good idea.\n\nLater I thought about the weird screws and bolts.\n\nAnd I realized, as a child I always picked up any piece of metal I found on the ground.\n\nWires, brackets, screws, bolts, 22 bullet casings.\n\nI built things from them and could never get enough.\n\nNow, even as an adult, I have to stop myself from picking up things like that, when I walk around my business.\n\nBut if it's an especially nice looking screw or bolt, I give in.  I just toss it into the \"Screws\" bin at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title":

They were payed to teach!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just not to learn I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the thinking made me notice a hole in my lower left rib-cage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even stuck a finger in there, but it wasn\u2019t my Tonal\u2019s finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel the size of the hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy\u2019s ice cave became visible on the south west wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could clearly see the floor going all the way into the cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked towards the inside far enough to realize I had gone beyond the bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the floor I saw a bolt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first or second time Fancy brought me into her cave, two screws fell onto the ground, right through the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see them down there as clear as anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dreaming body was right there, with my Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it was standing up, right through the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time, I must have walked away in it because it\u2019s unlikely my Tonal could manage to pass through the solid wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a strong urge to pick up the bolt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy was looking at me like, \u201cDo it!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, it would perfectly fit into that hole I had found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what would come of that, but I recall Carol Tigg\u2019s warning about not touching things in other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get too involved, you can end up stuck there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even reading a newspaper is risky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sticking a bolt into a hole in your body would probably not be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later I thought about the weird screws and bolts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I realized, as a child I always picked up any piece of metal I found on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wires, brackets, screws, bolts, 22 bullet casings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I built things from them and could never get enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, even as an adult, I have to stop myself from picking up things like that, when I walk around my business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it&amp;#39;s an especially nice looking screw or bolt, I give in.  I just toss it into the &amp;quot;Screws&amp;quot; bin at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

I had finally accepted, after years of struggle and purely on the basis of our encounter with them that night, that the allies had a consensual form, a substance\nwhich could be perceived equally by everyone&amp;#39;s senses.\nI jokingly told la Gorda that I had already written in my notes that they were creatures with form.\n&amp;quot;What am I going to do now?&amp;quot; I asked in a rhetorical sense.\n&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s very simple,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Write that they are not.&amp;quot;\nI thought that she was absolutely right.\n&amp;quot;Why do I see them as monsters?&amp;quot; I asked.\n&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s no mystery,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;You haven&amp;#39;t lost your human form yet. The same thing happened to me. I used to see the allies as people; all of them were Indian men with horrible faces\nand mean looks. They used to wait for me in deserted places. I thought they were after me as a woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_iixdqk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/iixdqk/fancys_passage/g3a5ds8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1598734451.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1598734451.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g3a100o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g39xd6m", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I think so.

In tiny insect form, flying towards me and speaking out loud.\n\nIt made everyone laugh, but Carlos said that was in fact seeing.\n\nTwenty years later, that sight of Little Smoke playing insect became common for me.\n\nThese days of course, there's no doubt what seeing is.  \n\nBack then, no one in our community was sure.\n\nHere's something Juann used to do.  Not only is it \"seeing\" but it's Silent Knowledge.  On his shoe.  At the time, we didn't clearly understand that.\n\nJuann drew this for a post.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nz887xhtvvbc1.jpeg?width=477&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec472ff2ad5c24e3a1135239f20880e7b370be74\n\nBut it was only one or two private classes where Carlos making us force silence worked.\n\nAnd no single experience is retained for long.  Magic vanishes quickly!\n\nThat's how we got trapped at the blue line.\n\nIt's like moving into a dream and picking up the \"history\" of the place, and that's all you know at that point. Even if you become semi-lucid and try to figure out if you are dreaming, you are utterly convinced that's not possible, and it's the real world.\n\nSo the actual Tensegrity movements that the lineage used, were likely just an observation that if you wave your hand a certain way, it can alter the flow of the second attention.\n\nOr that you can do the \"gait of power\" in a circle, and end up visiting Hell.\n\nOr on a slightly more advanced level, like my \"fibers from the hands\" magic, manipulating the second attention and leaving visible trails of really cool stuff.\n\nThe \"long forms\" were made just for the workshops.\n\nIf Carlos says they were made in dreaming, that just means he tried to apply second sights to make them work better for us. \n\nAnd perhaps was trying to pull the Chacmools into waking dreaming, while they designed the long forms at Pandora.\n\nSomething you can visibly see during darkroom.  How to adjust the forms to produce more spectacular results.\n\nI've \"tweaked\" a few so that they are no longer \"precisely\" like Carlos taught.  Which means, I altered them in waking dreaming.\n\nIn order to maximize the visible magic.\n\nNow... to be complete, Taisha was doing martial arts on the ground while her body was up in the tree house.  In her last book which took place at Zuleica's house near Fort Ortiz.\n\nPeople assume that was Tensegrity.

In tiny insect form, flying towards me and speaking out loud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It made everyone laugh, but Carlos said that was in fact seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, that sight of Little Smoke playing insect became common for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days of course, there&amp;#39;s no doubt what seeing is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then, no one in our community was sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s something Juann used to do.  Not only is it &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; but it&amp;#39;s Silent Knowledge.  On his shoe.  At the time, we didn&amp;#39;t clearly understand that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juann drew this for a post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nz887xhtvvbc1.jpeg?width=477&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ec472ff2ad5c24e3a1135239f20880e7b370be74\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/nz887xhtvvbc1.jpeg?width=477&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ec472ff2ad5c24e3a1135239f20880e7b370be74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was only one or two private classes where Carlos making us force silence worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no single experience is retained for long.  Magic vanishes quickly!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how we got trapped at the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like moving into a dream and picking up the &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; of the place, and that&amp;#39;s all you know at that point. Even if you become semi-lucid and try to figure out if you are dreaming, you are utterly convinced that&amp;#39;s not possible, and it&amp;#39;s the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the actual Tensegrity movements that the lineage used, were likely just an observation that if you wave your hand a certain way, it can alter the flow of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that you can do the &amp;quot;gait of power&amp;quot; in a circle, and end up visiting Hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or on a slightly more advanced level, like my &amp;quot;fibers from the hands&amp;quot; magic, manipulating the second attention and leaving visible trails of really cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;long forms&amp;quot; were made just for the workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Carlos says they were made in dreaming, that just means he tried to apply second sights to make them work better for us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And perhaps was trying to pull the Chacmools into waking dreaming, while they designed the long forms at Pandora.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something you can visibly see during darkroom.  How to adjust the forms to produce more spectacular results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;tweaked&amp;quot; a few so that they are no longer &amp;quot;precisely&amp;quot; like Carlos taught.

Even if you&amp;#39;re laying there or half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still the same process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s actually how all of reality works, except that we perpetually feed awareness into the same range of emanations, to the point that it&amp;#39;s nearly inescapable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, at intermediate stages you become able to recall dreams that couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have ever taken place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then realize, not only did they actually take place, but you were stuck in them for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the memory of it was erased when you emerged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That leads to the odd situation of those dreams themselves, &amp;quot;emerging&amp;quot; into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, such things are too abstract to describe, so that people can be aware such things happen to sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was stuck viewing a black blob for close to an hour, before i got tired of it, stood up, and lifted it off my chest, to place it on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A huge black blob, of a fixed shape!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The instant I set it down, that dream ended and the memory was erased from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only know about it now, because I went looking for it later on, using silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a more describable analogy, I can only think of the nightmarish appearance of Genaro, when Carlos was summoning mushroom shapes of people using the smoking mixture and the dust on Little Smoke&amp;#39;s moth wings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dust gave a little sparkle in the second attention blackness of space, and since his assemblage point was in the deep red zone, if he named a person he wanted to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, it was enough for the mushroom shape of the person to appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A well designed technique, once you understand how silent knowledge works!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was &amp;quot;recalling&amp;quot; people, and then they showed up on top of the little sparkles, flowing in the blackness.  Sparkles which came from an Ally, so they carried alien energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when he called on Genaro, Genaro himself jumped out from the campfire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happens when you use Silent Knowledge to remember dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can literally &amp;quot;come out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Resume.

We were discussing an unrelated topic when he abruptly changed the subject and began to tell me a joke. He laughed and very gently patted my back between the shoulder blades; as if he were shy and it was too forward of him to touch me. He chuckled at my nervous reaction.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"You're skittish,\" he said teasingly, and slapped my back with greater force.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My ears buzzed. For an instant I lost my breath. It felt as though he had hurt my lungs. Every breath brought me great discomfort. Yet, after I had coughed and choked a few times, my nasal passages opened and I found myself taking deep, soothing breaths.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I had such a feeling of well-being that I was not even annoyed at him for his blow; which had been as hard as it was unexpected.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then don Juan began a most remarkable explanation. Clearly and concisely, he gave me a different and more precise definition of sorcery.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I had entered into a wondrous state of awareness! I had such clarity of mind that I was able to comprehend and assimilate everything don Juan was saying.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***He said that in the universe there is an unmeasurable, indescribable force which sorcerers call intent, and that absolutely everything that exists in the entire cosmos is attached to intent by a connecting link. Sorcerers, or warriors, as he called them, were concerned with discussing, understanding, and employing that connecting link.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***They were especially concerned with cleaning it of the numbing effects brought about by the ordinary concerns of their everyday lives. Sorcery at this level could be defined as the procedure of cleaning one's connecting link to intent. Don Juan stressed that this 'cleaning procedure' was extremely difficult to understand, or to learn to perform.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorcerers, therefore, divided their instruction into two categories.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One was instruction for the everyday-life state of awareness, in which the cleaning process was presented in a disguised fashion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The other was instruction for the states of heightened awareness, such as the one I was presently experiencing, in which sorcerers obtained knowledge directly from intent, without the distracting intervention of spoken language.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Don Juan explained that by using heightened awareness over thousands of years of painful struggle, sorcerers had gained specific insights into intent. They passed these nuggets of direct knowledge on from generation to generation to the present. He said that the task of sorcery is to take this seemingly incomprehensible knowledge and make it understandable by the standards of awareness of everyday life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then he explained the role of the guide in the lives of sorcerers. He said that a guide is called 'the nagual', and is a man or a woman with extraordinary energy; a teacher who has sobriety, endurance, and stability; someone seers see as a luminous sphere having four compartments as if four luminous balls have been compressed together.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Because of their extraordinary energy, naguals are intermediaries. Their energy allows them to channel peace, harmony, laughter, and knowledge directly from the source- from intent- and transmit intent to their companions.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Naguals are responsible for supplying what sorcerers call 'the minimal chance'; the awareness of one's connection with intent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I could understand everything on Juan was saying about his world easily, and yet he had described the process of understanding as very difficult.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I told him that my mind was grasping everything he was telling me, but that the only part of his explanation still unclear to me was why two sets of teachings were needed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"You will need a lifetime to remember the insights you've had today,\" he said, \"because most of them were silent knowledge. A few moments from now you will have forgotten them. That's one of the unfathomable mysteries of awareness.\"***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Don Juan then made me shift levels of consciousness by striking me on my left side, at the edge of my ribcage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Instantly I lost my extraordinary clarity of mind and could not remember having ever had it.\n\nWhat this passage clarifies for my tiny pea-brain is that -\n\nSorcery is equivalent to Mastery of Intent and\n\nSorcery is equivalent to Cleaning our Link to Intent\n\nTherefore Mastery of Intent is equivalent to Cleaning our link to Intent\n\n\"But hanskey, you fool!

I didn't say anything because they were points that would be cleared up with practice.\n\nWhen you get close to mastering intent, you can skip from world to world very easily just by visualizing another one. Or by focusing on some more detailed aspect of this one.\n\nIt only takes a few seconds, and you are transported to the new world.\n\nTo the new \"selection\".\n\nYou WILL do this, if you keep working.\n\nThere are many ways to invoke intent, because humans can exist in many forms. Some we'd consider non-human, and they can even exist in some strange abstract forms.\n\nAll of them still have to manipulate intent, so it's very flexible in terms of how you can manipulate it.\n\nYou can speak to invoke it, if that speech is followed by bold actions with a touch of malicious humor.\n\nAnd if they further the goal of expanding how many people can practice sorcery.\n\nBut that type of \"spell\" is typically only needed to help someone else.  And by the way, witches do that by accident with their \"invocations\".\n\nOn your own, you just visualize where you want to go and you go there almost instantly.\n\nEven a tiny fantasy in the mind will stop you from leaving this world.   Likewise, a tiny fantasy in the mind of another reality, can transport you to that one instead of this one.\n\nWhat you \"visualize\" could be as simple as a weird object in an alien world.  If it's the only thing in your consciousness, reality changes to \"over there\".\n\nOn the other hand, if you're thinking about those fresh \"Western Bagels\", a favorite of private class students, even the image of the cream counter with all the fake sugars there will prevent changing worlds.\n\nNormally we have RAGING internal dialogues, so it's utterly impossible to summon intent to change where you are located.  The internal dialogue is suffering in grief and remorse, and flows from sentence to sentence naming what's bothering it, with images accompanying it in your mind.\n\nBut it doesn't matter if it's temporarily happy or satisfied. Or even if it's in \"Bliss\".\n\nIt's still a flow of images in the mind, tieing you to this reality.\n\nIf you shut that off, your energy body, which is your \"double\", will come out in the form of puffs and you can play with those.  And as the assemblage point moves down the back, once in a while you will \"get lucky\" and have no internal dialogue long enough that you have a chance to see what happens when there's no images in the mind also.\n\nYou get an \"intent gift\".\n\nA scene materializes on the darkroom wall, some odd creature materializes,  or you even build an entire freeway in your darkroom, and get your Ally to drive a truck along it so you can watch.\n\nBut none of those things are as starling as what happens when you can remove both the internal dialogue, and all the images in your mind.\n\nIn that state you can go anywhere, nearly instantly.  Recently someone posted remarks about the old seers gazing at objects to summon this, but you really don't need any \"props\".\n\n\"Cleaning the Link\" is really just getting rid of the internal dialogue, and the images in the mind. The \"fantasies\". Even if those are very small fantasies with limited things involved.\n\nBut on a larger scale, closer to where beginners are when they start, you're filled with bad motivations for learning sorcery.  Such as writing a book, becoming famous, or even something as simple as going to another subreddit so you can pretend to have sorcery knowledge.\n\nNone of that can be tolerated in this subreddit, or we'll lose what we have. It'll be flooded over with greed and attention seeking.\n\nSo for a beginner the idea of \"cleaning the link\" is easier to understand.\n\nBut later it's simply,  \"stop fantasizing\".\n\nBecause a fantasy, even if it's just a single object in the mind, like a tasty fresh Western Bagel, belongs to the reality from which it came.  Western Bagels only exist here, at the blue line, in our normal reality.\n\nIntent lets us change realities, by visualizing something from a different one!\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nYou can also view the concept of \"stop fantasizing\" as \"reduce rationality\".\n\nIt's another angle to go at it from.\n\nNew topic:   Not remembering heightened awareness is something you get to see for yourselves!\n\nCarlos took heavy criticism from jealous rivals over that. They said how convenient he forgot so much, so he could write 6 more books with the same stories in them.\n\nBut in fact, it's exactly what happens.\n\nYou'll see it for yourselves!  It's totally amazing.\n\nYou'll be fully silent, notice there's still an image or two in the mind every few minutes, and then concentrate on eliminating those.  Some kind of subtle balance will be reached, you'll notice a hint of something in the air, perhaps to the left of your eyes and slightly down, and you'll allow only that unformed sight to exist in your mind.\n\nAnd instantly you find you are in a bus station with sorcerers, discussing your travel plans with someone they know there.\n\nYou learn, you went back in time and are now one of the apprentices from the books, traveling south along the bus route to the end of the Yaqui wars in western Mexico.\n\nYou can stay in there for hours, or you can \"turn your head\" and zip back.\n\nBut in either case, there's a huge likelihood that you won't be able to remember any of it, in 10 minutes.  It will be as if it never existed.\n\nThat's because there's no \"connection\" between that memory, and your normal world.\n\nWe only remember things by searching the brain using \"related memories\".  For instance, to remember what you had for breakfast 3 days ago you start searching your \"things I ate in the morning\" memory.  That's tied to your hair still being wet from a shower, to dropping an egg on the floor and cursing, or to the long line at McDonald's drive through.\n\nThere's all sort of \"connecting memories\" to help you remember it.\n\nThere's no such connections when you break from this reality, to skip to another one.\n\nFor this reason, I recommend giving yourself a \"thumbs up!\" when you see or do cool magic during darkroom.  It gives you more chances to remember it.  You've tied some magic, to the ordinary act of raising the thumb.  You can do a unique number of thumb gestures, or notice your shirt sleeve moving, or remember where you were in the room when you did it. Was it a cold thumbs up, or did you have a fan blowing on you?\n\nAnd then the next day you can ask yourself how many of those you did, and narrow it down to find the memory.\n\nYou truly can't remember things that happen in a distant position of the assemblage point!  And you need to see it for yourself to actually get it.  Until then, it's just a tall tale.\n\nThe gasping for air on receiving the Nagual's blow, will happen to you also.  Moving the assemblage point yourself does not prevent the \"breath change\".\n\nIt happens when the assemblage point reaches the bottom of the back, and goes  under to come up in front.\n\nCarlos demonstrated 3 types of breath in class, and that was the most \"subtle\" and relaxed.\n\nOnly the lower stomach moves, and there's absolutely no thought to control the breath, as people do when they're up at the blue line.\n\nThe world \"breathes you\", instead of you breathing it.\n\nAt first it's quite shocking, then amazingly pleasant, but eventually you get used to it and it even becomes your normal \"resting breath\".  Even at work.\n\nIt's kind of a pity we get used to it, because it's so amazing at first.\n\nI DO NOT believe in breathing techniques.

I didn&amp;#39;t say anything because they were points that would be cleared up with practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get close to mastering intent, you can skip from world to world very easily just by visualizing another one. Or by focusing on some more detailed aspect of this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only takes a few seconds, and you are transported to the new world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the new &amp;quot;selection&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You WILL do this, if you keep working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to invoke intent, because humans can exist in many forms. Some we&amp;#39;d consider non-human, and they can even exist in some strange abstract forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of them still have to manipulate intent, so it&amp;#39;s very flexible in terms of how you can manipulate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can speak to invoke it, if that speech is followed by bold actions with a touch of malicious humor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if they further the goal of expanding how many people can practice sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that type of &amp;quot;spell&amp;quot; is typically only needed to help someone else.  And by the way, witches do that by accident with their &amp;quot;invocations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On your own, you just visualize where you want to go and you go there almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even a tiny fantasy in the mind will stop you from leaving this world.   Likewise, a tiny fantasy in the mind of another reality, can transport you to that one instead of this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you &amp;quot;visualize&amp;quot; could be as simple as a weird object in an alien world.  If it&amp;#39;s the only thing in your consciousness, reality changes to &amp;quot;over there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you&amp;#39;re thinking about those fresh &amp;quot;Western Bagels&amp;quot;, a favorite of private class students, even the image of the cream counter with all the fake sugars there will prevent changing worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally we have RAGING internal dialogues, so it&amp;#39;s utterly impossible to summon intent to change where you are located.  The internal dialogue is suffering in grief and remorse, and flows from sentence to sentence naming what&amp;#39;s bothering it, with images accompanying it in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s temporarily happy or satisfied. Or even if it&amp;#39;s in &amp;quot;Bliss&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still a flow of images in the mind, tieing you to this reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you shut that off, your energy body, which is your &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;, will come out in the form of puffs and you can play with those.  And as the assemblage point moves down the back, once in a while you will &amp;quot;get lucky&amp;quot; and have no internal dialogue long enough that you have a chance to see what happens when there&amp;#39;s no images in the mind also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get an &amp;quot;intent gift&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A scene materializes on the darkroom wall, some odd creature materializes,  or you even build an entire freeway in your darkroom, and get your Ally to drive a truck along it so you can watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But none of those things are as starling as what happens when you can remove both the internal dialogue, and all the images in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that state you can go anywhere, nearly instantly.  Recently someone posted remarks about the old seers gazing at objects to summon this, but you really don&amp;#39;t need any &amp;quot;props&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cleaning the Link&amp;quot; is really just getting rid of the internal dialogue, and the images in the mind. The &amp;quot;fantasies&amp;quot;. Even if those are very small fantasies with limited things involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on a larger scale, closer to where beginners are when they start, you&amp;#39;re filled with bad motivations for learning sorcery.  Such as writing a book, becoming famous, or even something as simple as going to another subreddit so you can pretend to have sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of that can be tolerated in this subreddit, or we&amp;#39;ll lose what we have. It&amp;#39;ll be flooded over with greed and attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for a beginner the idea of &amp;quot;cleaning the link&amp;quot; is easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But later it&amp;#39;s simply,  &amp;quot;stop fantasizing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because a fantasy, even if it&amp;#39;s just a single object in the mind, like a tasty fresh Western Bagel, belongs to the reality from which it came.  Western Bagels only exist here, at the blue line, in our normal reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent lets us change realities, by visualizing something from a different one!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also view the concept of &amp;quot;stop fantasizing&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;reduce rationality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s another angle to go at it from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New topic:   Not remembering heightened awareness is something you get to see for yourselves!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos took heavy criticism from jealous rivals over that. They said how convenient he forgot so much, so he could write 6 more books with the same stories in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, it&amp;#39;s exactly what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see it for yourselves!  It&amp;#39;s totally amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be fully silent, notice there&amp;#39;s still an image or two in the mind every few minutes, and then concentrate on eliminating those.  Some kind of subtle balance will be reached, you&amp;#39;ll notice a hint of something in the air, perhaps to the left of your eyes and slightly down, and you&amp;#39;ll allow only that unformed sight to exist in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And instantly you find you are in a bus station with sorcerers, discussing your travel plans with someone they know there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learn, you went back in time and are now one of the apprentices from the books, traveling south along the bus route to the end of the Yaqui wars in western Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can stay in there for hours, or you can &amp;quot;turn your head&amp;quot; and zip back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in either case, there&amp;#39;s a huge likelihood that you won&amp;#39;t be able to remember any of it, in 10 minutes.  It will be as if it never existed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;connection&amp;quot; between that memory, and your normal world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We only remember things by searching the brain using &amp;quot;related memories&amp;quot;.  For instance, to remember what you had for breakfast 3 days ago you start searching your &amp;quot;things I ate in the morning&amp;quot; memory.  That&amp;#39;s tied to your hair still being wet from a shower, to dropping an egg on the floor and cursing, or to the long line at McDonald&amp;#39;s drive through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s all sort of &amp;quot;connecting memories&amp;quot; to help you remember it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no such connections when you break from this reality, to skip to another one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I recommend giving yourself a &amp;quot;thumbs up!&amp;quot; when you see or do cool magic during darkroom.  It gives you more chances to remember it.  You&amp;#39;ve tied some magic, to the ordinary act of raising the thumb.  You can do a unique number of thumb gestures, or notice your shirt sleeve moving, or remember where you were in the room when you did it. Was it a cold thumbs up, or did you have a fan blowing on you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then the next day you can ask yourself how many of those you did, and narrow it down to find the memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You truly can&amp;#39;t remember things that happen in a distant position of the assemblage point!  And you need to see it for yourself to actually get it.  Until then, it&amp;#39;s just a tall tale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gasping for air on receiving the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow, will happen to you also.  Moving the assemblage point yourself does not prevent the &amp;quot;breath change&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It happens when the assemblage point reaches the bottom of the back, and goes  under to come up in front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos demonstrated 3 types of breath in class, and that was the most &amp;quot;subtle&amp;quot; and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only the lower stomach moves, and there&amp;#39;s absolutely no thought to control the breath, as people do when they&amp;#39;re up at the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world &amp;quot;breathes you&amp;quot;, instead of you breathing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first it&amp;#39;s quite shocking, then amazingly pleasant, but eventually you get used to it and it even becomes your normal &amp;quot;resting breath&amp;quot;.  Even at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of a pity we get used to it, because it&amp;#39;s so amazing at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I DO NOT believe in breathing techniques. Cholita loves them, as does Nyei.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in my opinion, they&amp;#39;re just placebos.  Which is fine for women.  Women can turn placebos into magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But men turn placebos into franchises which they use to steal money from others, and which distract those who use them from realizing their horrible situation, so they will do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We see endless new people who come in her, and try to come up with &amp;quot;something else I can do&amp;quot;, rather than doing what works.

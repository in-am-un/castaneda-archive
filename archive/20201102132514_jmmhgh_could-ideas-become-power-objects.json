And we have an Arnold Schwarzenegger  statue in the wagon.  We force everyone we see to talk only to the statue, as if it were us.\n\nThat's the idea of \"self\" created by our family and friends.\n\nOnce we're hooked to that imaginary being, we defend it to the death for the rest of our lives.\n\nIn darkroom gazing, you starve it off.  And then you realize, it isn't real!\n\nNot to mention, you find yourself in 2 places at once on occasion, which really messes up the idea of a \"self\".\n\n&gt;I always thought that some of them could be adapted in some circumstances. Also that new ones could be discovered.\n\nThey can. But only by someone who can see energy,  or hear the voice of seeing.\n\nWhen modified by a fake, you get the intent of cheating people.  \n\n&gt; some techniques do produce chaos and fogginess if modified and changed.\n\nIt breaks the link to intent.  Did you see that quote from don Juan, about how the only thing we have is the \"razor sharp\" intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, and so we must hook ourselves to it and follow it nearly to the end. We only deviate from them by exploring non-human worlds, instead of obsessing on only the human ones.\n\nIn some respects, the fake benefactors are following the path of the old sorcerers, even though they pretend to be \"men of knowledge\".\n\nThey're obsessed with other people, instead of actually learning for themselves.\n\nKeep practicing in the dark room.  Maybe as an experiment, keep a list of the \"gifts\" you get from intent?\n\nIf you are more aware of them than we were, you might get more.\n\nI'd say, one gift per 2 weeks is average at first.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gb0mws9", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Am I really experiencing this, or am I just persuading myself?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it was actually visual, with eyes open, it was real.

The Eastern Bloc is spoiled with this kind of activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst is 4 gates dreaming.  It turns people into murderers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Murdering the chances of others to actually learn by giving them false information.  And from what I&amp;#39;ve seen, in person they might actually do it physically, they get so angry when someone corrects them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(There&amp;#39;s a lot of mental illness in esoteric communities).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is self importance even more subtle than I thought then?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self importance is merely a reference to our tendancy to try to &amp;quot;save face&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re walking around with a little red wagon, like a kid. And we have an Arnold Schwarzenegger  statue in the wagon.  We force everyone we see to talk only to the statue, as if it were us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the idea of &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; created by our family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we&amp;#39;re hooked to that imaginary being, we defend it to the death for the rest of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In darkroom gazing, you starve it off.  And then you realize, it isn&amp;#39;t real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, you find yourself in 2 places at once on occasion, which really messes up the idea of a &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I always thought that some of them could be adapted in some circumstances. Also that new ones could be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can. But only by someone who can see energy,  or hear the voice of seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When modified by a fake, you get the intent of cheating people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;some techniques do produce chaos and fogginess if modified and changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It breaks the link to intent.  Did you see that quote from don Juan, about how the only thing we have is the &amp;quot;razor sharp&amp;quot; intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, and so we must hook ourselves to it and follow it nearly to the end. We only deviate from them by exploring non-human worlds, instead of obsessing on only the human ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some respects, the fake benefactors are following the path of the old sorcerers, even though they pretend to be &amp;quot;men of knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re obsessed with other people, instead of actually learning for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep practicing in the dark room.  Maybe as an experiment, keep a list of the &amp;quot;gifts&amp;quot; you get from intent?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are more aware of them than we were, you might get more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say, one gift per 2 weeks is average at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_jmmhgh", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jmmhgh/could_ideas_become_power_objects/gb0mws9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1604420671.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1604420671.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gazmhf5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1604394754.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gayfnnt", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jmmhgh/could_ideas_become_power_objects/gazmhf5/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gazmhf5", "created": 1604394754.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_jmmhgh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gayfocb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1604364548.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gayfnnt", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "I\u2019m still tranced out on Montgomery\u2019s card\u2014the classy coloring, the thickness, the lettering, the print\u2014and I suddenly raise a fist as if to strike out at Craig and scream, my voice booming, \u201cNo one wants the fucking *red snapper pizza*!

At least, in our situation.\n\nIt's a man who's pretending to be what he is not, and to make it more real he goes out and victimizes a younger person.  Sometimes there's sexual abuse involved.    He provides the attention that someone with a normal internal dialogue craves, claiming to be teaching him sorcery, in exchange for whatever attracts the \"benefactor\" to pretending to be a wise teacher.  I have yet to find a case where this is not what is going on.  So if you hear someone say, \"My benefactor taught me\", be careful.  You have a damaged student.\n\nIf it weren't so, we would have little pockets of successful sorcery students out there, as we do in here.\n\nBut you can't find any because there aren't any actual \"benefactors\" out there.\n\n&gt;What can a person do to avoid getting pulled back into conditioning of this ordinary reality?\n\nWork so hard that the world around you transforms, and you just can't ignore it.\n\nDon Juan advised to leave your friends and family, and erase personal history. He even tried to help his inner circle achieve that.\n\nAnd I suppose that's a good idea, but it's not as important as actually learning to have real, visible magic, right in your face daily.\n\nIn don Juan's case, he was taking care of that behind the scenes, and only needed to keep his apprentices safe from their acquaintances. \n\nWhen you're walking through the walls of your home, witches materialize and lead you into alternate dimension realms, and when you're laying in bed to sleep and your demon girlfriend comes to tuck you in, it's pretty hard to get sucked back into the river of mud where everyone else lives.\n\nBefore that, it's easy. Unfortunately, I expect some who succeed brilliantly doing darkroom gazing, to be pulled back.  Don Juan predicted it.\n\nOne way to tell is, if you learn to move your assemblage point until you are surrounded by visible magic, and you find it boring, this might not be the path for you.\n\nOr maybe, you got lazy and have a little talent, and didn't move your assemblage point all the way on the J curve, where everything becomes obvious.  Instead, you're hypnotized by the puffs and think you've reached the goal.  That's also a dangerous place to linger too long.\n\nBut just being willing to linger there and let doubt return, indicates this might not be the path for you.  You have to be independent, and self-motivating.\n\nUsing a \"benefactor\", or even a valid teacher like Carlos, is a bad thing for us.  Those need a lineage behind them, or they kill the teacher.  Needy students killed Carlos by drowning him in \"*counter intent*\".  As he told us, he just couldn't build the energetic mass to \"jump grooves\" and eliminate his illness as he and other sorcerers had done in the past.\n\nYou, alone, have an appointment with *intent*.

I hate to see someone disappointed, just because they weren't ready to try that technique.\n\nWe're all up to our ears in Castaneda disappointment.  Time for some action!\n\nFirst an explanation. A very simple digital camera tries to expose (make pictures) using a shutter speed of 1/30th second maximum.\n\nIt\u2019s not fast enough for moving cars, but for people walking around it leaves no blur. And it syncs to artificial light sources, in 60Hz countries.\n\nLonger than that causes a blur.  Shorter than that causes bands to scroll down the images, until you get to 1/60th.\n\nWhat people do, in the camera industry, is \u201cstack pictures\u201d at safe frame rates.\n\nTo get the longer exposure, without blur, they take 2 pictures at the 30fps rate, and try to consulate them to make one. It's an artificial 1/15th second exposure.\n\nThat\u2019s what you need to do too!\n\nIn fact, your eyes might already be doing that, in darkness.  When you learn to wave your hands in darkness and see \"dark waves\" in their shape, you'll be wondering if it isn't stacking frames there too.\n\nBut how to do that in daylight?\n\nEasy.  Search for motion.\n\nDon\u2019t flood your eyes with too much detail, the way that technique specifies.\n\nInstead, flood your eyes with a search for movement only. You\u2019re only interested in what moves.\n\nThat automatically causes your brain to compare sets of pictures.

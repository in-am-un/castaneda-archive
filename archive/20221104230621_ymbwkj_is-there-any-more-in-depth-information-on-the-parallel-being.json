We don't come back!\n\nBut you do have other lives out there. Right now! And you can switch over to those, if you work hard.\n\nLujan hasn't even been paying enough attention to know our sorcery is Olmec, not Toltec, and easy to prove as being at least 8000 years old,  with jade figurines showing our techniques are much older than Buddhism.\n\nAnd a likely history going back 10,000 years, if you look at the relic documented west coast migrations from Proto-Siberia.  The source of our sorcery.\n\nNot to mention, Buddhism has no magic worth mentioning. It's just exaggerations and outright lies, to steal money from people before google was available to make that obvious.  \n\nBut now it is!  So use Google to clear up your mind.\n\nLujan has some lousy \"peace and tranquility\" youtube videos so childish,  it's amazing anyone falls for him. And look at that \"badass\" sorcery name.\n\nIs he 5 years old?  Kind of looks that way on some of his book promotion photos.\n\nI sure hope you develop more common sense, hanging around in here.\n\nHowever, usually when someone brings up a terrible person like Loogie Matus in this subreddit, be it Sergio or Mango or one of the other foreign language speaking phonies whose names I can't remember, they're actually trying to promote that person.\n\nAnd it turns out, what they really like about that fake sorcerer is that they're getting away with stealing money from others.\n\nThey're \"franchise hopefuls\" who admire those like Lujan, who succeeded in stealing from the community.\n\nDon't be that guy for your own sake!

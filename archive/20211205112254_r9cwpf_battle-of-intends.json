It could be your momma's milk. Attention. Affection. Safety.\n\nYou used simple intends from your starting place in the [game](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/r0zbux/new_players/) to navigate.\n\nBut as you grow older, the intending grows more complicated. Recognition. Friendship. Partnership. Achievements. More good. This includes counter intending. No pain. No sadness. No bad. Some of those are inherent in our animal nature. Some are imposed on us by society. \n\nMost likely, you are a mess of innumerable intends that sum up to something or cancel themself to nothing. Most likely, you are navigating through [the river of filth](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/l1coul/how_to_recognize_a_bad_player_in_this_subreddit/) with no power to break out.\n\nIt is possible that you already have tight intends. Meaning, you don't waste unnecessary energy, and you focus on your endeavors. Then, you are at an advantage.\n\nIf you ever took a project, a goal, or a hobby to pursue feverishly, you have experience of staking intends. Every day, intending the same thing will inevitably gather power behind that direction. Once your direction gathered enough strength, a battle is inevitable. \n\n##The totality of your available energy\n\nOlmecs teach us that human beings have a limited supply of energy. As you stack intends in a particular direction, that direction fights for priority in your life. And your energy behind intends that you have no attachment to are being discarded. Their energy is now redistributed. You are becoming more focused and more single-pointed.\n\nEventually, that goal will clash with other goals that you have. Most of them are goals that you stacked behind for your entire lifetime. Be a good boy/girl. Do this. Act like this. Be successful. Society learned intends fix your [Assemblage Point](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/assemblage_point) in the [Blue Station](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/). In [The First Attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ds3n8q/the_first_attention/). The [map](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/g4zx4a/the_rule/) of the sorcerers leads our Assemblage Point to the end of the Orange Station. [The Second Attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/second_attention). And beyond.\n\nThink of little kids and their toys. The toys, when on the shelf, are lifeless. Once a little kid gets that toy, he starts to put awareness in it. A part of his energy is now trapped in there. Try to take that toy from him, and it will be like you took his arm. You are an adult now, and this kind of behavior may seem stupid from your point of view. But, in reality, a bunch of your energy is trapped in people you know and knew. Not only people but also things that you possess. That makes them real. [Reclaiming that energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/recapitulation) allows you to upgrade your vehicle from Prius to Porsche with V8 inside. And things themself become [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character) once again.\n\n## Mechanics of the battle\n\n*Why is it not so simple that we intend one goal and work until we reach it?* \n\nIt is that simple. \n\nIf the totality of your [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ooabig/you_guys_dont_need_it_but/h5xcoi5/) intended any destination, the [Eagle](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/eagle) would reskim the emanations, and [Intent](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/intent) would provide it. The problem is, you don't want to release the energy behind old intending. You are indulging in them, and you keep stacking power behind them. The Tonal mechanism that constantly reinforces your old intends is your inner dialogue. This is why **silence** is the most important skill on a path of sorcery. **If you are not [intending to be silent](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/silence) every day, why are you even reading this?** \n\nGood for you and everybody else is the fact that we have more tools available than that mental chatter that seems never to go off. One of those tools is your [willpower](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/cqeq9p/don_juans_eight_points_diagram/). The power behind your Nagual, your [personal power](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/terminology/power).\n\nYou can't use your internal dialogue to navigate down the J curve. You may reach Green Station by replacing your inner dialogue with mantras, scriptures, or moral beliefs. It may be enough, and it could be that that is just what you are looking for. Bliss, peace, and a tiny bit of magic, that does not shake the world as you know it. You will have a grander perspective than the majority of people. And you can be significant. If you want, find some shaman or a meditation group. Be persistent, and you have an [easy way out of the Blue Zone](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/r1rq6a/useful_theory_on_the_evils_of_visualizing_things/). \n\nThis is the reason that almost nobody learned real magic so far. They got stuck at understanding. **Once you got the right direction, you have to let go of what you know.** Until you realign and actually move forward. Then, you see things from a new place and navigate again by dipping into the map. **Holding onto the knowledge will only keep you stuck where you are**.\n\nIf you want to taste the real magic, be prepared to fight for it. Unless you have super endless energy and don't care about society's morals and rules, or you are a woman. Then it might be easy for you. \n\n\n## Boss Fights\n\n\nThere will be Boss Fights along the way. But what is a Boss? \n\nYours intends tend to lump together if they point to similar directions. You probably have many intentions that point to the *Be a good boy/girl* direction. Bunch of others that go to *I need attention*. Each of those lumps creates a single Boss you need to clear, or at least damage, to proceed. Each Boss prevents you from leveling up.\n\nEvery level is cleared by stacking intends and working hard. Once the lesser intends are cleared of energy and stacked behind Olmec intent; eventually, there will be no more loose ends that you can use. It will be time to challenge a Boss, intends that are ingrained deeper in what you consider to be ME. \n\n\nWhen two vital directions fight for power, a sort of crisis happens. You worked for some time now that it might feel that you didn't advance for a long time. And a Boss will try to pull you to their dungeon where you will indulge again. There he will convince you that you need to follow his direction. Here is a trick for every Boss in the game. \n\n**Continue stacking intends behind the [Olmec Path](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/pj24nd/siberian_shamanism_is_our_source/).** \n\nDon't go into that lair, and the Boss will weaken. **The Boss is made of your awareness!.** By continuing during hard times, you will slowly eat his energy away and put it behind the Sorcery. His participation in the internal dialogue will be quieter each day. And then, one day, you may find out that you can go into his dungeon and that what used to be a giant monster is nothing more than an annoying fly. Beware of spiders and snakes, though. They bite with venom.\n\n## Eagles Loot Box\n\nLearning is not linear, not for sorcery, and not for anything else where you want to be a master of. To be a master, a skill needs to come from silence. From abstract.\n\nYou can learn to hyperventilate and feel some sensations in your body. Those are mechanical skills. With them, you are using what you already knew. But fundamental skills are only learned by taking the loot boxes once you defeat a Boss. After a long fight, sometimes after you even forget about the contest, one day you wake up, and you know how to do it. You gathered enough energy, and you leveled up. \n\nIf you think of giving up while it is hard, use your will to continue. Once you clear the level, you can take a rest. But then, you will not be tired anymore.\n\n## Using the gravity to propel you to Infinity\n\nGravity is not only a force that glues you to this world. Every intending creates a gravitational pull to its destination, and in the same manner, it is being pulled by other intents.\n\nOlmec Intent has a tremendous gravitational force. And by reading the books, or the forum, you are allowing yourself to be pulled by it. In the same way, you can use any energetic mass. Allow yourself to be drawn by it only to the point of gathering speed. Then suddenly, change direction, and relocate the energy to your path. They may quickly clear some minor Bosses for you. Or a major one, if you master [stalking](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/stalking). Disclaimer! Advance practitioners only.\n\n## The Map\n\nThere used to be sorcery groups and a lineage. But it was not always like that. [Old seers](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/oyps5u/a_list_of_the_most_used_names_of_the_people_in/) used magic for power. But once Mexicans came with their technology, they almost got wiped out. So they created secret orders. The map evolved. Don Juan said that power is not what [the new seers](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/qqzd02/a_reminder_of_the_basics/) seek. Instead, they went for freedom and total awareness. Now, there is no more nagual to smack your back and plunge you into The Second Attention. We have to reach the destination on our own. The map is evolving again.\n\n## The battleground\n\nWay back then, the battleground was the desserts of Mexico. For food, you went hunting, and you were secured. Or you showed some magic abilities to the king, and he provided you with everything in exchange for your services. Do you need a house? Pick a land and build one. Today though, the battleground is our everyday world: work, school, and society at large. But the same principles apply. Learn to become [a hunter](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/oxhsfu/2_stages_hunters_and_warriors/) in the real world. Not to indulge in it, but to provide yourself with the means to pursue your goals. You cannot just plainly ignore the morals and rules imposed upon us. Like you cannot ignore the danger of a wolf biting your head off in the forest. \n\nYou got to play them. Outsmart them. And by doing so, you master [The Game](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/r0zbux/new_players/). \n\nThe battle between Tonal and Nagual begins.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Battle of Intends", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_r9cwpf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_ar84z8e", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1638699774.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifelong battle&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have been in a battle since the day you were born.\nWho knows what were you intending as a baby?

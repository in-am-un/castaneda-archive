Unless you want to count recap.\n\nWe have one trying that right now!  But I'm afraid, he's combined it with puffery. He \"knows too much\" to follow the guidelines.  The result is unpredictable. It'll probably burn out on him.  Like pulling taffy too hard.\n\nI've heard that's a bad thing.  Never saw it myself.\n\nIf someone came along with another working path, that would be wonderful!\n\nBut so far, they only come along with pretend sorcery, looking to get attention for themselves.\n\nSeeing as how we have only one path at the current time, it's a very good idea to stay on it.\n\nDon't deviate!\n\nDon't try to \"skip ahead\"!\n\nDon't add something from outside.\n\nIt's possible you could succeed that way.\n\nBut I haven't seen it.\n\nAnd neither did Carlos. Unknown to us, he taught before his workshops.\n\nSeveral times he tried to teach others.\n\nAnd failed.\n\nOne thing he seems to have learned is, don't describe dessert to the kids, during dinner.\n\nI often saw him asked a question in class, which he wanted to answer.\n\nBut he got a painful look on his lips. Like he had to crush them, to keep from speaking.\n\nHe'd glance over at the witches, and they'd try to look away as if they didn't notice. One even looked down at her shoes, but the awkwardness of Carlos seeming to want to answer the question, while remaining silent, would force someone to answer.\n\nI wish I didn't have face blindness!  Then I could tell you who answered. But I'm hopeless to recognize someone if everyone has the same short hair, and no obvious makeup.\n\nI suspect, the stalker got stuck with the job. Taisha.\n\nShe seemed unsure of herself, and fearful of doing damage.\n\nBut she would answer.\n\nHere's an example.\n\nPrivate classes were new. Everyone was just happy to be in there. We didn't yet have the kind of sharks we get in here.\n\nCarlos was optimistic!\n\nHe showed us Zuleica's pass.\n\nIt's in the tensegrity part of the wiki.\n\nIf you believe that's not one of the most important passes Carlos taught us, you need to read Eagle's Gift again!\n\nIt has it all. Bringing out the second attention energy body, wiggling the fingers to stimulate the correct awareness, and sweeping the floor with a tentacle so you can learn to move around.\n\nIt's like, \"Finding your Spot\", from the first book Carlos wrote.  He gave everything you needed to know, right up front.  But it was up to the students to notice that.\n\nOne of the Europeans, always wanting to ask questions to get attention, asked, how many of these \"passes\" do we need?\n\nBut I shouldn't criticize him. Likely he had to go home soon, and was hoping just a few would suffice him.\n\nPeople in here ask the same:  How many do we need?\n\nCarlos of course knew the answer.  And wanted to give it!\n\nI could tell.\n\nBut the answer is damaging.\n\nNone.\n\nOne.\n\nThousands.\n\nThe real question is, can you get silent so your assemblage point can move?\n\nIf you can, any pass will do.  Just one is more than you can ever finish exploring!\n\nIt's like asking, how many dragons do you need?\n\nInstead of answering, Carlos tilted his head and looked up at the witches. Since class was brand new, they were all in attendance.\n\nCarlos never introduced new magic without a woman around. He borrowed their energy to do it.\n\nI can't recall if he had to tilt his head and look up because he was much shorter than the witches, or if he leaned over as if he had a side ache, and needed to sooth it.\n\nBut he was restraining himself.\n\nFrom somewhere out of my view came a meek answer.\n\n\"One?\"\n\nIt was so quiet, I didn't have any idea who had said it.  But it was a woman, who didn't know any better than to answer it.\n\nIt seems, she'd  had that explained to her.\n\nThe witches looked at Carlos, and some quiet conversation started between them, with heads shaking up and down and sideways.  But so subtly you wouldn't notice it unless you were looking for it.\n\nCarlos nodded his head a little, as if to say the answer ought to be comforting, and gave a barely audible \"yes.\"\n\nI was standing only 4 feet away, so it was a very quiet conversation. I barely heard a word of it.\n\nSuddenly everyone moved a little, quickly, as if they had important things to return to,  just feet away from where they were standing.\n\nAnd they dropped the topic.\n\nCarlos not only taught us sorcery.\n\nBut he also taught us how to teach.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no teachers anymore.\n\nI was chatting with Juan about it.\n\nWe can't teach.\n\nWe can show.  Recommend.  Even guide a little by reporting things we've done.\n\nBut no one in here can teach.\n\nYou have to be a formless warrior with perfect silence, full access to seeing the emanations and the luminous shells, and a full connection to *intent*.  Without those, no one can teach.\n\nBut we can suggest and show!  And hope, you'll decide to teach yourself.\n\nHere's an analogy, in the form of a story which has no ending yet.\n\nI used to be a big fan of Kafka.\n\nThere are thousands of very little paths leading up a large mountain, to a long lost gold mine.\n\nBut it's so hard to find, no one knows a way other than a single guide who knows just one very long path.\n\nThere's more than enough gold for thousands of people.  So there's no reason to keep it secret.\n\nBut unfortunately, the gold mine has been lost for so long that there's a whole map selling industry, surrounding the mountain.\n\nEndless \"guides\" who will sell you a map, and take you a tiny distance up the mountain.\n\nI don't know how they keep tricking people, but their technique is simple.  You give them some cash, and they give you a map.  But no one has ever made the map work.\n\nAnd so they sell you an \"excursion\".  Can't read the map?  Pay more, and they'll lead you.\n\nBut they don't. They walk you up the mountain a tiny bit, being too fat to go further, and  they point to the most distant peak they can find.  \"It's over there!\", they say.\n\nAnd then, so you don't beat them to death as an angry mob, they tell stories about the vast riches of gold.  And the long history of that mine.\n\nIt works.\n\nNo one knows why. Perhaps the people who buy the map never really expected to find the mine.  They just wanted \"hope\".  Like buying a lottery ticket when you get your paycheck.\n\nPeople are pretty much brainwashed by this map selling industry, and so if you try to lead them up the right path, it's very difficult.\n\nIf you start out trying to lead 100, you'll be lucky to get even near to the mine with any left.\n\nDown low many realize they're out of breath and can't go further, and so they go down a little side path, probably a jack rabbit trail.\n\nAs they go down the rabbit trail, they try to lure others go come with them.\n\nYou lose a good half at the bottom!  None actually believed you knew the path, so it's easy for them to get sidetracked before they even got started.  As they run along the rabbit trail, they tell each other stories about the mountain.\n\nFurther up, you find the mountain wanderers.  They're like zombies.  They got lost long ago, but refused to leave the mountain.\n\nWhen they see a group of 50 staying together, they try to lure some to go wandering with them.  They've been nearly alone for a long time, and badly need company.\n\nThey say things like, \"It's not about the gold!  It's about love!  Love is what makes you wealthy, not gold!\"\n\nIf you're the leader, you're kind of happy that you lose some to the wanderers.\n\nBut not happy at the result.  The wandering people might lure off 5, but those 5 were keeping another 10 around.  And on seeing those leave, they figure it's just another phony map seller excursion, even though no one sold them anything, or took any of their money.\n\nYou lose 15 to the wanderers.\n\nNot too far from that, some of the crazy ones in the group who have stuck with it so far because they have no friends at all, and this is the closest they can come,  sit themselves down on a rock to \"rest a while\".\n\nThey insist they'll \"catch up later\".  \"I have you in sight!\", they insist.\n\nAnd they add, \"Hey Bob, sit and talk to me a while\".\n\nYou lost another small portion to the crazy people, who just wanted a friend.  And can lure a few to join them on the big rocks, to watch the whole thing from a distance.  They're all watching to see if there's cheering when the group gets to the top. Then they'll know for sure, there's really gold up there.\n\nAnd why put out such an effort, before you know it's worth it?\n\nAnother 10 just can't do it. They have kids to feed at home.  They somehow hoped they could make it to the gold mine in a very sort time and bring home a few \"quick nuggets\".  To pay the bills. Their interests are short term only.\n\nThey didn't listen to the leader's warnings about what a long climb it is.\n\nThey disappear one by one, without a word.\n\nBut halfway to the mine, things get even worse.\n\nThe high altitude and deprivation of air, makes many of the remaining a little giddy.\n\nOne remembers you said there were very round bluish bushes near the mine.\n\nSeeing a few of those off to the side further up, he believes he's found a \"shortcut\".\n\nAnd off he goes.  He leaves the group to go chase shortcuts.\n\nAnother remembers that he heard you can \"skip\" along to walk up a mountain, and you won't get as tired.\n\nHe's out of air and light headed, and starts making a huge fuss skipping along and stirring up dust.\n\nNo one knows what happened to that guy, but likely he fell off the side of the mountain.\n\nEnd of story.\n\nThat's all the further we've gotten.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stay With the Path!!!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"h311bzk5knl61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 144, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h311bzk5knl61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2812c9cd905b089f4873dde77fe2c790527eb8a9"}, {"y": 288, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h311bzk5knl61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fbf1ae4dd248a16cff043a55d930364183a6b72"}, {"y": 426, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h311bzk5knl61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8430e8b1b171a35c9ed6d05d1eb9c5f6b9ce2cb5"}, {"y": 853, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h311bzk5knl61.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e034529fcc7c186d18ac9533c5ae64dc85a1d4"}], "s": {"y": 960, "x": 720, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h311bzk5knl61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e6002de34b802aaf6263b3517e332783a21cc1a"}, "id": "h311bzk5knl61"}}, "name": "t3_lz6z7o", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xmM2J23WIYMaEctsJcql_8XUdlp4D6Xnd0CaYnYS0kk.jpg", "edited": 1615143398.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1615053101.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h311bzk5knl61.png?width=720&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7e6002de34b802aaf6263b3517e332783a21cc1a\"&gt;Cholita (the IOB?), warning you to stay on the path.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many paths to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we only have one in here.

Then they&amp;#39;ll know for sure, there&amp;#39;s really gold up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why put out such an effort, before you know it&amp;#39;s worth it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another 10 just can&amp;#39;t do it.

He leaves the group to go chase shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another remembers that he heard you can &amp;quot;skip&amp;quot; along to walk up a mountain, and you won&amp;#39;t get as tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s out of air and light headed, and starts making a huge fuss skipping along and stirring up dust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one knows what happened to that guy, but likely he fell off the side of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;End of story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all the further we&amp;#39;ve gotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "lz6z7o", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 34, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lz6z7o/stay_with_the_path/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/lz6z7o/stay_with_the_path/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1615053101.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_gqd9bxd", "id": "gqd9bxd", "parent_id": "t1_gqd3q4i", "depth": 1, "children": ["gqd9bxd"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gqd3q4i", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1615318393.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_lz6z7o", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "u/danl999's original image for this post was similar to these:\n\n[Image #1](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fh-lqKpxnn8/UvoZKUkOJPI/AAAAAAAAkXY/O3x-MgjfGvQ/s1600/DSC03444.jpg)\n\n[Image #2](https://i2.wp.com/novate.ru/files/u34189/huashan8.jpg)\n\nAnd lastly, climbing the path of the ancients:\n\n[The Long-Established &amp;

The dark room experiences reminiscent of k-hole (brahman) type of experiences that I always sought as I did dissociatives. I feel like the double actually makes it difficult to get there since the assumption of any sort of body is fundamentally limiting.\n\nSo the question for me remains what is the goal, long term it seems to be complete freedom (which definitely means surpassing the body at minimum), but \"short term\" ultimate goals is what we really want to work with here and those are hard to find. Complete freedom is not an acceptable answer since I don't know who achieved it, and as far as I know the brahman type of experiences and dancing with IOB in the IOB realm is the closest I have gotten to it and I don't really hear anyone talking about those.\n\nNone the less, I am going to do more of darkroom where I am sitting up, maybe bring out my double a bit more often, and read a bit more about stability/control.

Last time I had to haul art supplies for Cholita (a huge thing it was), I found her talking to the shop owner, who looked truly flabbergasted at the conversation she was having with Cholita. \n\nI didn't find out why, but the shop owner asked me, \"Do you have an electric saw???\"\n\nMy guess is that Cholita told her she'd been kidnapped by me, and I was threatening to cut her into pieces.\n\nI could only reply, \"Yes, until she smashed it on the ground.\"\n\nI had been planning to fix a door using it, and Cholita didn't approve of that method. So she smashed the electric saw and I had to replace the entire door and frame.  \n\nWith metal this time, just to make sure.\n\nLately she moved her bed out of her room, so that I couldn't search for her through the walls at night.  I was just happy she didn't cut the entire bed into little pieces and stuff it into the trash bin.\n\nOddly, knowing she has to be in her studio in the garage, makes it easier to find her.  Cholita thought being further away would help, but in fact distance is irrelevant.\n\nThe initial sight is vague, and if you have 100 feet to scan, it's hard to locate her.\n\nIf it's only 10 feet, it's much easier to see through the walls.\n\nAnd she's also lately decided, if I buy the toilet paper there must be some plot going along with it.\n\nCholita insisted on toilet paper made from bamboo.  I suppose that's ok, although rubbing your butt with bamboo seems more like torture.  But the main problem is, the rolls are tiny.\n\nSo I was buying the deluxe brand.  Too expensive for Cholita. And huge rolls.\n\nShe's buying her own now.  Doesn't want to be part of the \"toilet paper plot\".\n\nAnd she put the stack I set for her in the closet, next to my bedroom door so I'd know it's no longer ok to buy toilet paper.\n\nI was proud of her.  In the past, she might have formed all of the toilet paper into a noose, and hung it from the ceiling light in my bedroom, to give me a warning not to continue the toilet paper conspiracy.\n\nBut baby wash shampoo is still ok for me to purchase.  Until Cholita figures out where I get that specific brand.\n\nBeing from Mexico, Cholita washes clothes mostly by hand, and is not too picky about what soap she uses.\n\nAt the laundromat, back when she'd still go places with me, she'd take one of those little boxes of laundry soap they sell for 50 cents, and use 1/10th of it in a wash.\n\nI was horrified the first time, and started to open my mouth.\n\nHer hand flew up and covered my open mouth.

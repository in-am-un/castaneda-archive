lawyer and all, when you get to very advanced levels, you just focus your attention on something, and you get a Perry Mason style analysis of \"who did it\".  Complete with visuals, audio, and \"field trips\".\n\nIt's astounding!\n\nThe problem is it keeps drilling down into reality, until  you're looking at the bottom most thing:  The emanations, and awareness flowing on them.\n\nThe emanations are like \"super strings\", except instead of energy, they give off feelings. Our reality is just the sum total of all those micro feelings tossed back in our face.  Since they interact with each other via \"harmonics\", they seem to form a \"whole\".  We get so used to manipulating it, we don't realize each is just a tiny feeling, and can never change.  Only which we focus awareness on can change.\n\nLast night I was playing with my double in ways I can no longer recall. I decided not to run to my computer and write it down, which I suppose was a mistake because it's all gone.  More \"secrets of the universe\" lost.\n\nHowever, if you play with your double in a visible way with him helping you,  when it's over you are in Silent Knowledge mode. Access to all the secrets of reality, past, present, or maybe even future.\n\nBut you get SK after being fortified by the double, in a \"safe\" form where you aren't tossed into that tunnel Alice fell into to enter wonderland.\n\nRemember how she fell and saw visions along the way down?\n\nFull on Silent Knowledge is like that. Out of control falling, watching scenes go by.\n\nBut when it's controlled, it would be a lawyers dream come true!\n\nIn fact, I defeated Nintendo using Silent Knowledge.   Long story, but they kept getting useless patents, and then threatening to sue me if I included their useless patents in my video game cartridges.  Like a shape of bevel.  Has no real value, but it won't fit in the machine without that shape.\n\nI just sat in silence considering the problem, and the answer to the patent was floating in front of me, absolutely real looking.  \n\nWhen I didn't understand, a voice said stuff like \"What are you stupid?  Look at the shape!  Don't you see how...\"\n\nIt's called, \"the voice of seeing\".  \n\nLast night I was focused on a question a beginner asked about the River of Shit story, where people climb out onto dry land, sorcerers hose them off, but it's cold out there.  So they jump back into the river where it's \"cozy\".\n\nSomeone asked, \"What's cozy mean?\"\n\nMy reaction, being the old fart type person, was \"How can you not understand that???!\"\n\nBut it \"came up\" when I was in SK mode last night, and I got a Perry Mason presentation on what \"cozy\" means.\n\nAt the top level it looks innocent enough.  Friends, family, familiar routines.  Rushing home after a hard day, to watch your favorite TV show while drinking beer.\n\nLaying in a hot bath after a workout.\n\nBut it also includes fussing and fuming with the people you know. Trolls enjoy being trolls on the internet, even though that's an awful behavior.\n\nEven the unpleasantness of social interactions are \"cozy\", compared to traveling into the second attention where you are no longer even human.  You shapeshift along the way.  All alone because there's no one available at your skill level, to go along with you.\n\nLike Dr. Strange I suppose.  He can travel into the multiverse, but no one can come along with him.\n\nThe longer I watched examples of \"cozy\", the deeper it went into the guts.\n\nFinally I was looking at yellow fibers of light pressed together in an infinite sea, except I was only watching the ones in a slice 1 foot thick, running at a slight angle down the middle of my body.  A \"cheese slice\" is how Carlos described it. In a ball of 8 total cheese slices, which represent alien awareness.  We can only perceive 2 of those slices, and only our own well.\n\nI was watching the fibers of light interact with each other, giving rise to what we know as \"reality\".\n\nBut an overall wave of smoke like light flickered across them all.  Maybe every 3 minutes.\n\nI voice said, \"That's the Eagle's commands\".\n\nHe injects some overall awareness to force certain behaviors. Or perhaps it's a \"flow modifier\" like we have in the brain with those \"side chemicals\" that alter how the neurons carry the sodium ions around.\n\nThe injection of \"Eagle's Smoke\" gives rise to things like self-awareness.\n\nHe's tinkering with us, to make us good probes for stories.\n\nHe likes stories.\n\nI also detected a darker or dirty colored smoke.  Much fainter and very hard to perceive. I'd like to say \"dirty blue\" but I have no idea why I got that interpretation.\n\nThe voice said, \"**THAT'S** cozy.

And with more drumming and silence, you&amp;#39;ll be able to move to the red line, and see the magic intensify.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attaching the results to the J curve will help people not get trapped and settle for just one thing like shamanic drumming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making shamanic drumming work will NOT get you to where we want to go, in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s sort of &amp;quot;the wrong intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once placed on the J curve, it&amp;#39;s not as bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the goal is to move the assemblage point, and not just to get something weird to happen using the drums.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One argument might be, if you can&amp;#39;t move on the J curve in 1 second, you can&amp;#39;t reach the 3rd attention.  So you can&amp;#39;t burn with the fire from within.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might motivate people...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except we still don&amp;#39;t know if you have to stretch the cocoon before you burn, so you can get a running start on the J curve proper.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/odqpdu/how_do_we_imitate_the_sorcerers_of_ancient_mexico/h41xe9g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625426320.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_odqpdu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h4utpqc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dopameany", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1626042263.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_odqpdu", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_c461jqtb", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I think this quote sums it up quite well: \"Power rests on the kind of knowledge one holds.

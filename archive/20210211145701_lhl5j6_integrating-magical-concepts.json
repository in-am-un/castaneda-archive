Both are states of awareness where you have real magic and conection to the universe at hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan liked the first one, and the witches the second (names).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first attention is your &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; awareness state, in wich you perceive ordinary reality. The whole human being is likely in the same position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we were born, our assamblage points were much more fluid, and we were able to perceive lots of things that &amp;quot;were not there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each time little sagajohanna was enjoying that magic, her mother told her to stop. She just didn&amp;#39;t want her to do &amp;quot;weird things&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you follow the story, your mother had the same upbringing, the same as your grandma..... until you get to the &amp;quot;agricultural myth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It bassically tells that humans lost the magical conection with the universe when they left their nomads spontaneus habits, and started forming big families (actual social order) and cultivating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So returning, the second attention is our hability to perceive more than normal reality, but wich is usually not used and developed as sorcerers do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/k3dra1/facebook_feed/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;(Dan talking about the agricultural myth)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_lhl5j6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lhl5j6/integrating_magical_concepts/gmyge9q/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1613062848.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gmydq8j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "sagajohanna", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1613061750.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_lhl5j6", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_a6wp8gl4", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Heightened awareness, dreaming awake, 2nd attention ... are these names for shiftning the assemblage point while awake?", "edited": 1613256569.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gmydq8j", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heightened awareness, dreaming awake, 2nd attention ... are these names for shiftning the assemblage point while awake?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lhl5j6/integrating_magical_concepts/gmydq8j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1613061750.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_lhl5j6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gn2axbo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Persephone_22", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gn24raf", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_89uuwcz3", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thanks for the explanation, I thought it had to do with viewpoints more in a literal sense.

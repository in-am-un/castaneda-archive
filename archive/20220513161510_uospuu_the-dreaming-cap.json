At first it had been relatively easy, perhaps because of the newness of the concept. I had had no trouble at all in reminding myself that I had to look at my hands. But the excitation had worn off and some nights I could not do it at all.\n\n\"You must wear a headband to sleep,\" he said. \"Getting a headband is a tricky manoeuvre.

Dreaming is easier when one wears a power object on top of the head. You could wear your hat or put on a cowl, like a friar, and go to sleep, but those items would only cause intense dreams, not dreaming.\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment and then proceeded to tell me in a fast barrage of words that the vision of the headband did not have to occur only in dreaming. It could happen in states of wakefulness and as a result of any farfetched and totally unrelated event such as watching the flight of birds, the movement of water, the clouds, and so on.\n\n\"A hunter of power watches everything,\" he went on. \"And everything tells him some secret.\"\n\n\"But how can one be sure that things are telling secrets?\" I asked.\n\n\\*\\*\\* end the books \\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Dreaming Cap", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"4e852afl39z81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4e852afl39z81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5dfebcee6e432fa93a4787cae2787f25736edd2"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4e852afl39z81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2604771b21293762e3d0138f21fa667980f7e7b"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4e852afl39z81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdb225e1d74effd25c2c414ae6b1187509e0d985"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4e852afl39z81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4fa492f5e578166895afa02e4fe93a57fc67497"}], "s": {"y": 794, "x": 794, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4e852afl39z81.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32dbdb240d6704bafacb367b06c457f829bcf8b2"}, "id": "4e852afl39z81"}}, "name": "t3_uospuu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/LpxrYalVTFN1pwQ71gMDIe4B05Clf2BdBV_6_HJoq-s.jpg", "edited": 1652453187.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1652451310.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4e852afl39z81.png?width=794&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=32dbdb240d6704bafacb367b06c457f829bcf8b2\"&gt;Yep, that would work too...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of &amp;quot;props&amp;quot;.

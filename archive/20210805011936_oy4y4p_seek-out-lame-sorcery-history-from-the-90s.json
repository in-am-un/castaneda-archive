Reading the notes from Carlos and Taisha i must have hooked involuntarily to their Intent, cause (even if it&amp;#39;s difficult to explain) not only their Words sounded truer than ever, but i felt how they were exactly related to my Energy at the Moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Reading some notes on the flyers and the importance of silence and recapitulation i started to feel a wonderful nostalgia of something not clear which must have happened when i was kid, i have no clear visual Memories but i know for sure that  these Memories lie in some part of my body, and  when i was kid i must have been an avid sucker of the Spirit world, i felt exactly what Carlos mean when he recollects his memory of having seen at UCLA, we HAVE ALWAYS seen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But i felt this strong opposition to seeing, like a hostile force physically present in the room, and even in my thoughts (insinuating doubts against my Will about the realness of sorcery), anyway the i got a feeling of resolution, like  i know what i have to do, and keeping Reading the notes of Taisha speaking about how silence makes the world collaps, the room (lights were out but was not entirely dark) started to fill with  buzzing particles light and in the darker spots i saw Red and purple dots, and It was like a confirmation of Intent i think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was very  very grateful and decided to go to sleep and i was istantly in a lucid Dream, i was in a exact Copy of the room and and i take up my head to see what was going on, well all the room was filled with dark energy and there were an immense pressure going on, Shadows were moving, and one was over me, crawling over my stomach and pressuring me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t dare to Watch directly but i tried to remain sober invoking Intent and saying out loud &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;ll never let you steel my Energy again&amp;quot;, It didn&amp;#39;t worked cause i was too weak, but the fact that i felt ready to fight even if a loss Is probable, maked me forget about the flyer/Shadow and concentrate on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to express my gratitude to taisha and the rest of the lineage wherever they were, the dark energy on the room start to open up up and forming like clouds of lights and i felt that  maybe this opening was a way to let my gratitude flow to the Intent of the lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time i had the certainty that i am still too weak to face the unknown and the dark see of awareness, and that i have to recapitulate seriously and let every mundane concern behind, cause everything Is happening now, and not in the so called &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; reality. I tried to get rid of the Shadow, trying to force the &amp;quot;Will&amp;quot; of the stomach to move myself up on the bed, the Shadow put on an extreme resistence and made me feel impotent, like an enourmous father which take down his sibling with no effort at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After sometime i manage to free myself, but getting up i was swarmed again by another Shadow which scared the hell out of me  even more than before,  this time i thought that i have to stop dreaming cause i have not enough Energy to fight again, but my grit was here i feel some sort of rage and desire to fight back even in the daily world.\n It felt to me like they wanted to suck up all the Energy they can cause now that i physically know of their presence they Will not have the same Power over me .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Sorry for the long post, Just wanted to share an experience maybe connected with (the Intent of) the private classess and workshops. To me theres no doubt these fucking Shadows were real, the pressure over my stomach was unbearable, i couldn&amp;#39;t move a single muscle, maybe i don&amp;#39;t know, i was tricked and they are simple IOB, but definetly this experience to me seems a consistent explanation about why it&amp;#39;s so difficult to live a magical Life, the Intent of human society Is huge, but my (inexperienced) opinion tells me that it couldn&amp;#39;t be so strong to extirpate the magic totally and thoroughly from humanity without an external aid from the spirit world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oy4y4p/seek_out_lame_sorcery_history_from_the_90s/h7s3vip/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1628149619.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_oy4y4p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h7ssv9s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1628168030.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_oy4y4p", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "This is an example of a seemingly lame attempt to hook to intent\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/oy9hf0/dreaming\\_beyond\\_fear\\_moscow\\_russia\\_january\\_3\\_4\\_5/h7srzre", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h7ssv9s", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a seemingly lame attempt to hook to intent&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/oy9hf0/dreaming%5C_beyond%5C_fear%5C_moscow%5C_russia%5C_january%5C_3%5C_4%5C_5/h7srzre\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/oy9hf0/dreaming\\_beyond\\_fear\\_moscow\\_russia\\_january\\_3\\_4\\_5/h7srzre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oy4y4p/seek_out_lame_sorcery_history_from_the_90s/h7ssv9s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1628168030.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_oy4y4p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

One kicked out of here a while, went there and played dumb while he continued his delusional attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to forget about the shamanism for a while, even though we got 4 to come over here.  Too bad, I could at least teach them all about intent, second attention, assemblage point, and basic things they&amp;#39;re clueless about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also ran into a particularly nasty &amp;quot;comrade&amp;quot; type, who complements and supports you as if he has advanced knowledge, then starts offering you to read his favorite things, like fire Kasina and such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignores that what you posted blows away anything he knows about, and  pretends that pretending itself is just as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally he believed magic is all over (the first sign of someone lying his butt off), and when I insisted he should point me to a single page on the net, he pointed to 5-10, so I couldn&amp;#39;t check it out and prove he was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I called him on that, asking him to pick the one he&amp;#39;s sure has magic, he changed the subject. Said it was more secret than that, and there wasn&amp;#39;t anything I could get entry to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;hey, I agree with you, I&amp;#39;m a comrade&amp;quot;, type is the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because ultimately you have to cause them to explode, or they take up more and more of your time.  This type ends with sadness.  That you &amp;quot;let him down&amp;quot; by not turning out to be as powerful as he believed (didn&amp;#39;t agree with him).  He&amp;#39;s the type of petty tyrant who oppresses with sadness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting 4 from there doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything. Most want attention, see it&amp;#39;s actual work, and fade away.  I usually get 2 if I visit a subreddit, but I can&amp;#39;t recall any who are still here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The LD forum could even have former private classes members in the mods, in which case they&amp;#39;ll stop anything that might make Carlos look like the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a lesson for potential future teachers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy who shows up and pretends to be a supportive comrade, is the most poisonous type of bad player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The small fry angry guys aren&amp;#39;t so bad, it&amp;#39;s obvious what&amp;#39;s up with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they never give in, and never listen to your arguments. So good arguments are ineffective, because in fact they are mentally ill, and only want to fight.  Go look in their history and you&amp;#39;ll see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They might even be trying to medicate a bad batch of catatonia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita can fight off going catatonic, by beating up on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Catatonia is very painful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_oxvggx", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oxvggx/more_faction_h_stuff_the_rubber_tree_people/h7t78qc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1628173553.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1628173553.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h7qzb6y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "the-mad-prophet", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h7pys4z", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_4dz9kepm", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;Maybe I'll try the lucid dreaming folks again!\n\nThey won't like it.

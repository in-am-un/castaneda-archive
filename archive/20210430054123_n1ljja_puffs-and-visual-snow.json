Sometimes I'll be looking straight ahead, and my feet will be fully lit, as if the lights in the room were on.  Tending towards too yellow.\n\nPandiculating stimulates this effect.  Pandiculating also includes rolling the eye balls.\n\nBut if you stretch like that original picture in that \"Pandiculations of Zoltar\" post,  you'll likely get the max \"fake light\".  \n\nHoward Lee likes to use something similar at his workshops.  \n\nI believe Juann's been using it lately too.\n\nIt's a poorly explored topic, because it's like when you were a little kid and could roll your eyeballs and get weird yellow hoops to become visible.  And no one cared.\n\nOr you could stretch up high and inhale too deeply, getting little stars to form in the air just before you passed out.  They cared about that, but only the fall over and bump your head part.\n\nSo the immediate instinct is that it's \"invalid\" to force weird lights in the darkness.\n\nBut it's no less valid than using a candle to get the colors going the way Buddhists and Daoists do.\n\nJust remember, if it works it's valid. It's all just position of the assemblage point, and what causes it to move isn't as important as learning to move it.\n\nThe \"gait of power\" moves it through the tapping sound of the feet. Not by any actual physical magic.\n\nHere's a bizarre example, in honor of Cholita who is currently spraying perfume near my bedroom door, as soon as she gets home in the evening.\n\nI'm not sure what triggered that, but there was a fine cuban cigar smell yesterday or the day before.  \n\nWhat if you could find the most rank rotten organic matter, so bad it made your eyes water, and you felt like hurling the instant you got a whiff.\n\nAnd you built a little box with a string you can pull, that slowly lifts a little opening.  Slides up a piece of wood, so more and more of the smell is exposed to the room.\n\nYou could control the horrible smell levels.\n\nI suspect that would have a strong effect on darkroom practice, once you get down to the red line and beyond.\n\nIt might tilt everything right.\n\nOr drive the IOBs nuts.\n\nIf it could drive the assemblage point right, maybe a box with the most wonderful flowers inside imaginable could drive it left.

I certainly do the 'looking through' the VS to read off the wall, perform WILDs, trigger hypnagogic visions etc. But the things is, VS isn't something that sits on objects in my environment, it is an intrinsic part of my vision. It is constant evenly across my visual field whether my eyes are open or shut; It is not affected by my environment. If it is a surface, it's inside my visual processing. \n\nSo maybe I can use it for the same things. I need to experiment with seeing 'depth' some more to check what the VS is doing there. But even things that seem to affect it like retinal after-images actually aren't changing the VS, I can stare into the bright colours and it is still there unchanged.\n\nAll my recent experiments with it, staring at or through it, brings on vivid visual imagery very quickly often within seconds, even without that being my intention.  I'm not sure if that is the VS or more the act of looking through my mind like a lens that is doing it though. I will keep experimenting and see if I can uncover anything else.

Which is why the text is glowing like that.  I haven't resolved that problem.\n\nI'd love it if people would look through the books, and provide inspirational quotes about \"the will\"!\n\nIt would be revealing to see those.\n\nHere's one from La Gorda, and as always she makes the supernatural seem mundane to a dark roomer.\n\nSuch as when she redefines \"stopping the world\" to be merely getting to the green line on the J curve.  Meanwhile, the two accounts we have of Carlos doing that involved him floating in the air in ecstasy, losing consciousness, and even waking up somewhere else. \n\nLike when he did that near the UCLA cafeteria.\n\nBut to La Gorda \"stopping the world\" was merely exiting the blue zone, and seeing a bit of the second attention in the green.\n\nAs if Carlos had been taught the \"hyped up\" version suitable for a man, and La Gorda was taught the \"toned down\" version which assumes women only need a hint, and they can take it from there.\n\nCarlos got the \"mansplaining\" version.   \n\nAnd for \"the will\" we got hooked on that one to the point that there's surely some bad players out there who took pictures of themselves with a red Rambo Bandana, standing on a rock under a waterfall pretending to be don Genaro.  \n\nOn shrooms.\n\nSo here's La Gorda's version, which to advanced darkroomers will be more than a little disappointing.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Will is such a complete control of the second attention that it is called the other self,\" la Gorda said after a long pause. \"In spite of all we've done, we know only a tiny bit of the other self. The Nagual left it up to us to complete our knowledge. That's our task of remembering.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHere's the copy of the text I used on Facebook to go with this post.\n\nAnd sorry for how \"naggy\" it is. \n\nThey really need nagging over on Facebook.\n\nBeginners in here? \n\nAll you need to know is, no one is pulling your leg. \n\nOur magic kicks butt!\n\nEven Dr. Strange would be jealous.  \n\nAnd even better, we do this sort of thing each and every night!\n\nNone of it is \"rare\", or else we can't go far enough in a single lifetime, to learn about \"will\".\n\nAnd how do you know you aren't getting lied to (like everything else you tried)?\n\nBecause no one here wants your money, there's no group, no church, no meetings, no interviews, no books, and no workshops.\n\nThus no motivation for anyone to lie to you.\n\nEven the Tensegrity is free in here, although if you get a chance,support Cleargreen and take a workshop.\n\nSo they don't go nuts inventing new franchise opportunities or making up new magical passes.\n\nDon't gloss over that little detail. That no one wants your money in here.\n\nOr you might miss your chance.  Could be the **only** one you get to learn real magic.\n\nOr maybe not.  There will be cartoons soon.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nWill, will, will...\n\nCan we give that a rest?\n\nIt's automatic if you do the tensegrity. And comes even faster if you work hard to learn to be silent.\n\nAnd maybe even do the Tensegrity in darkness so as to activate dreaming awake.\n\nSince the tensegrity moves your assemblage point all the way to Silent Knowledge, something Carlos showed us in private classes during his famous \"J Curve\" lecture, you end up both dreaming AND seeing.\n\nAt the same time.\n\nAnd then if you just \"feel\" how the phantom (or partly real) dreaming awake visions come into FOCUS in an instant if you just \"lock on\", you've discovered will!\n\nSoon you'll be willing hamburgers to fall from the ceiling and plop onto your bed.\n\nAwake!\n\nNEVER do magic with your eyes closed if you are male. You'll just turn into an angry liar, trying to get attention by misrepresenting your nightmares. So you can steal.\n\nThere's a lot of that going around!\n\nOr as Carlos explained when someone tried to misrepresent a dream as sorcery, \"That's just your liver!\"\n\nWoman can get away with that.  Sleeping (womb) dreaming as a path. But I wish they'd try both.\n\nSo put down the Chinese fortune cookie wisdom. That was only written to fool the naive.\n\nAnd the cookies were invented in San Francisco anyway.\n\nSorry to those with their own \"Asian Fusion Franchise\" going on. I know I piss you off.\n\nI lay awake at night, feeling bad for insulting your greedy ambitions...\n\nBut you can figure out how to both keep your cheap Chinese import business, and learn actual magic.\n\nIf you know actual magic, I suppose no one can complain if you like Chinese philosophy. You might even \"fix\" it a bit.\n\nLa Gorda liked nuns and priests.\n\nAmy liked \"Bishops\". Carlos used to give lectures on Bishops, for Amy's sake.\n\nTo those obsessed with Genaro at the waterfall, forget it.\n\nCholita already beat you to that, so you won't be the \"first one\".\n\nExcept she could just hover there, without having to do any acrobatics.\n\nAND, did you realize that Genaro was in his double all but 2 of the times he interacted with Carlos?\n\nWhen you can do that, be in your double with no one figuring that out, then maybe you can prank your friends at waterfalls.\n\nBut like I said, you're too late. It's already been done in our community.\n\nPlease notice in that picture, that will also becomes visible during recapitulation if you increase your sessions to 2+ hours (so the assemblage point can move all the way to Silent Knowledge), and if you try to be silent, despite remembering the past.\n\nOr at the very least, don't fantasize about unrelated topics. Stick to the current subject you are recapitulating.\n\nNO OTHER THOUGHTS IN WORDS OR FANTASIES.\n\nThen, recap is also a path to the \"will\".

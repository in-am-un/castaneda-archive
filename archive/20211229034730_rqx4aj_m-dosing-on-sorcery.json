Seems to be covered in frozen methane gas in most parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; that phantom room into the orange zone, was even faster.  Maybe just 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it got super fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A red zone phantom room is kind of like a smooth cave in hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, it looks like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the pink zone the walls formed better than they were in the red zone, and it was now rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the big shock was in the whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the whitish light began to form, I wanted to see if it would allow manifesting things without disturbing the phantom walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the south wall, as I was gazing and trying to manifest something, &amp;quot;wallpaper&amp;quot; zipped down from the ceiling covering around the same width, as normal wall paper might.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, I&amp;#39;d never tried to manifest something for which I had a need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always random things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I manifested decorations for the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, it was a translocated scene of a beautiful lake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out, you can &amp;quot;decorate&amp;quot; rapidly in the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy was there the whole time, over teaching me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can be doing that for real.  We don&amp;#39;t mess around in here, becasue there&amp;#39;s no profit motive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as the Olmecs who invented this. unlike Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism or anything else, there was no money when they created all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no reason to lie or exaggerate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we get enough people in here who can make it to that level of phantom room creation, we can connect those phantom rooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, Fancy makes that claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked to see if it could connect to Cholita&amp;#39;s phantom house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s located just 10 feet away from my wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead, it dominated her house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s not here anymore, and I don&amp;#39;t have the key to enter there, so I guess that realm is in flux.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was sort of like trying to get a large bubble, to merge with the one next to it, by pushing it towards it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that works with soap bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead, it smashed the side of Cholita&amp;#39;s bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Cholita is where I hope she is, she might have brought the other end of the bubble with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That could be interesting.  I still don&amp;#39;t know who are the people over there, who want Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(She&amp;#39;s dangerous).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rqx4aj/\u03bcdosing_on_sorcery/hqf8kli/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640794004.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_rqx4aj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hqev8o8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "matejthetree", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hqeuzh1", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_ar84z8e", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "https://reddit.com/r/castaneda/w/silence\n\ncheck the bottom description and then linked posts", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hqev8o8", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/castaneda/w/silence\"&gt;https://reddit.com/r/castaneda/w/silence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;check the bottom description and then linked posts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_rqx4aj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rqx4aj/\u03bcdosing_on_sorcery/hqev8o8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640788140.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1640788140.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hqeuzh1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "HeiruRe777", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1640788017.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hqdhhuz", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_7vevtzj2", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Which wiki might that be?

If you need it, you aren't actually doing much work.  You might still be pretending, or trying to get out of work by finding a shortcut.\n\nThat's the opposite of what you need to do.\n\nGo read Carol Tigg's poem from a workshop, where she prays to God to make her miserable.  That's where you need to go.\n\nHere's good advice on bad days:\n\nBad days are your lucky day!\n\nThe harder you struggle on a bad day, the more you learn about shutting off the internal dialogue.\n\nI suppose last night is a good example.\n\nI was practicing darkroom for around 30 seconds in the middle of the night, when Cholita stormed in from God knows where, and started tossing things around.\n\nShe has a habit of figuring out when I'm practicing.\n\nIt was so distracting I couldn't summon colors, inorganic beings, or anything.\n\nI decided, I wasn't going to let that stop me, so I concentrated on the very deepest levels of the internal dialogue.\n\nA skilled darkroom gazer will admit, you don't have to have perfect silence to get magic.\n\nAnd once you have magic there's so much to do, playing with it, that you don't try even harder, to get better silence.\n\nThere's silence, and then, there's the human form.  Somewhere while forcing better and better silence, and even BEYOND stopping the world, there's our own annoying composition.\n\nWhat we're made out of.\n\nInternal dialogue...\n\nWhile Cholita was carrying on, I was forcing internal silence so strong,that the bangs and noises she was making were irrelevant.  They didn't matter at all.\n\nUnless she just broke the bathroom cabinet.\n\nOh well. I'll find out in the morning...\n\nThey were just as unimportant as the lovely night birds singing outside my window.\n\nI reached that level, but I could still see something left of my internal dialogue.  I had to make an effort. That's what was left. The whole, \"effort' thing had to go. Until I got rid of the need to make an effort, it wasn't good enough.\n\nSuddenly I fell through a hole in the bottom of my pillows.\n\nDown to the floor.\n\nI saw a train on some white tracks. All of the cars were white squares.\n\nAs I silenced my internal dialogue further, the car in front \"popped\". And vanished.\n\nI realized, that was my internal dialogue.\n\nIt was a series of boxes pulled along, inevitably one after the other.\n\nI tried very hard to \"pop\" all of them, remembering how Carlos took a job in the desert as a fry cook, got an ordinary apartment, and spent his time there trying to further improve his silence.\n\nI had visions of \"losing the human form\", and got greedy.\n\nI then found myself out of by tonal, and into either my dreaming body, or the double, and I can't recall past that.  I probably ended up with Cholita, in the phantom copy of the house.\n\nBad days teach you the most.  Even if you suffer the entire time and \"make no progress\".\n\nIt strengthens your \"silence muscles\", like going to the gym.\n\nYou won't notice for a few days. Until the new muscles heal.\n\nYou ask what you can do to have more success, and why some days are bad, and some good?\n\nThat's what \"impeccability\" really means.\n\nIt's why I say the \"impeccable warrior\" thing is nonsense.\n\nIf you get into a battle with the fake sorcery teachers out there, they always return to the impeccable warrior thing.\n\nThey can't do magic. But they can make people angry, and get them to pretend they are impeccable, and everyone else is not.\n\nThey induce \"tribal behavior\" in their followers, using the idea that only they are impeccable warriors. Everyone else is slime.\n\nSo if you have magic and they do not, it doesn't matter because you're a poopy-head.\n\nMeaning, you aren't impeccable and they are.\n\nThat's how horrible the \"warrior's way\" has become.\n\nBUT, once you have a little magic, you are forced to figure out what impeccability really is.\n\nBecause, you want more magic.\n\nThen, it makes sense.", "edited": 1620921192.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gxzmmyx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Also how is it possible that lets say the moon facets effect our mood?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally I&amp;#39;d say no, and even become a little grumpy people are confusing themselves like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, Carlos taught us about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some of it in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is a Tarot Card reader.

Until the new muscles heal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You ask what you can do to have more success, and why some days are bad, and some good?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what &amp;quot;impeccability&amp;quot; really means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why I say the &amp;quot;impeccable warrior&amp;quot; thing is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get into a battle with the fake sorcery teachers out there, they always return to the impeccable warrior thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t do magic. But they can make people angry, and get them to pretend they are impeccable, and everyone else is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They induce &amp;quot;tribal behavior&amp;quot; in their followers, using the idea that only they are impeccable warriors. Everyone else is slime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you have magic and they do not, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because you&amp;#39;re a poopy-head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, you aren&amp;#39;t impeccable and they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how horrible the &amp;quot;warrior&amp;#39;s way&amp;quot; has become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, once you have a little magic, you are forced to figure out what impeccability really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because, you want more magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nbfc80/energy_changes/gxzmmyx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1620920558.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_nbfc80", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gzmltil", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gzlre94", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": " All I can say is I always have my calendar marked for the upcoming days, and I do feel / experience a difference the second half of the day before, and the day of.\n\nThe only other similar post is this one I made a while back:\n\nCorona Borealis (constellation) zenith transit times -

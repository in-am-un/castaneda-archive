Silence is needed, although some can find them with fairly poor silence levels.\n\nIf the silence level is extremely good, you get very bright colors and clear inorganic beings. Worlds can materialize in the mists of pink and purple.\n\nOr whatever colors you find. We have yet to have a red/orange person, but Zuleica said that was her favorite.\n\nThe goal is NOT to do something with the colors.\n\nThe goal is to learn how to move the assemblage point by yourself, without the rituals the old sorcerers used, and without power plants.\n\nIf you don\u2019t find any colors at all, and you believe your silence is good enough that you should, power plants can be used a time or two. They loosen the assemblage point in very stubborn cases.\n\nMy guess would be, even if you get silent, if you have an inflexible assemblage point you have all sorts of subconscious things going on. It\u2019s almost as if you were beaten all your life, and threatened not to deviate.\n\nAnd so your silence still won\u2019t let the assemblage point move, because it\u2019s stuck in mud of some kind.  Perhaps your boots have sunk too deep into the river of filth don Juan mentioned, in which the entire world now lives.\n\nThe power plants mix that up, so you can slip out.  It's as if they put some bubbles in your pants, so you can float up a bit.\n\nBut eventually, you have to learn to do this yourself.  Don't cheat yourself with power plants.\n\nAfter a while of playing with colors, you\u2019ll begin to notice that you can see the room. Except, if you have an absolutely dark room, you know that light is coming from the second attention.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cseeing energy on the horizon\u201d, which Carlos wrote about in his final publications.\n\nThe cover of \u201cThe Wheel of Time\u201d shows the possibilities. You could actually do that! Produce those scenes of the moon\u2019s phases, just hanging out in the sky.\n\nThe surprising thing is, that's not even difficult!\n\nBut I prefer to \u201cplay\u201d with it.   Not enter, not view a movie on it, just see what things are contained in it.\n\nYour wall will have light everywhere, but it won\u2019t be entirely even.\n\nI've shown 3 common \"looks\" on the same wall, but when you do it you'll see one or the other. I've never seen more than 1 on a wall. But I did look north one time, seeing vertical lines, then I looked south, and they were horizontal!\n\nUnfortunately, I turned back north and it was yet another thing.\n\nAt first,  the light may even be smooth.  But it develops details as you gaze at it and the assemblage point adjusts to that new sight.\n\nThe details can form into another world. The things from that world can even begin to invade your room. For example, roots from huge trees can be found growing up to the foot of your bed. Or bamboo shoots can cover the floor.\n\nLittle villages in Mexico with nothing but dirt roads and clay buildings, can form on your floor.\n\nDon't step on anyone!\n\nBut entering those worlds probably requires in inorganic being most of the time. If you walk towards them, the worlds recede. You can never get closer to them, and you finally hit the wall.\n\nThe problem is, you\u2019re using your Tonal, not your dreaming double.\n\nThe dreaming double is around. You\u2019ve lured it into practicing with you by making that dazzling light show.\n\nBut to walk through the wall you have to switch over to that body.\n\nThe transition is unnoticeable. Except that, you just violated the rules of physics by passing through a solid wall.\n\nIn the other world you can remain as long as you like. You\u2019ll be fully lucid the entire time. It\u2019s not like lucid dreaming.\n\nCarlos said, the worlds accessible through silence are different than dreaming worlds.\n\nHere\u2019s an experiment I wish someone would try for me. It would take someone who can assemble a world using this method. And is also skilled in lucid dreaming.\n\nTry to find the whitish energy on objects in the lucid dream. Look at walls to make it easier.\n\nAccording to Carlos, you can tell a phantom in a dream from something that is \u201creal\u201d, by looking for energy.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what kind of \"looking for energy\" he had in mind yet, but I suspect it\u2019s the same as seeing energy on the horizon. It\u2019s just a glow that can re-organize if you gaze long enough.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s an entirely different view you can have, in the dark room.\n\nZuleica was after that one.\n\nAt the point in the story where she tells Carlos to wiggle his fingers, it's already assumed he found colors in darkness. He mentions it elsewhere.\n\nHer technique is designed to finish the process of building a usable second attention energy body.\n\nShe has him *feel* for something there.\n\nAnd what you are *feeling* for, is that energy body.\n\nIf you emphasize feeling for cobwebs, the view in the room starts to change.\n\nYou can end up seeing nothing but fine lines of light, going everywhere.\n\nAnd the puffs go away.\n\nDon't worry. They'll come back, as you use the fiber *feeling* technique.\n\nIt's all about the position of the assemblage point.\n\nSo rather than blobs, you can be seeing filaments of energy, seemingly organized around your own body.\n\nIf you feel around for \u201ccobwebs\u201d, you will find some that are attached to specific places on your body.\n\nFor instance, while slowly moving your hand, your upper lip quivers.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar quiver, except that each time you move the hand to that spot, around 3 feet from your face, and to the right about 8 inches,  it does it again!\n\nEventually it, \u201cwears out\u201d, but you can find other spots.\n\nShould I be telling you where they are?\n\nAbsolutely not. I was just giving a known example, from one I felt last night.\n\nAnd if you run into a patch of many fibers, you can feel it as \u201csand\u201d brushing against your hand.\n\nImagine someone taking a handful of sand and tossing it into a strong wind. And you\u2019re far enough away that it has spread out into separate grains with space between them.\n\nIt feels as if you had your hand in the path of some of that blowing sand.\n\nMy guess is, it\u2019s the same thing as a cobweb. You\u2019ve simply become more sensitive, so you\u2019re picking up a whole bunch at once.\n\nOr, maybe some are stronger than others, and now you\u2019re feeling the weaker ones.\n\nThe view of darkness as fibers is not the same as stopping the world, and seeing the emanations.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s 1/4th of the way there. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a different thing.\n\nI suspect, the weird ideas we have about how *seeing* is going to be, and what things look like when *seen* as energy, is exaggerated until what we\u2019re after is impossible.\n\nWe've book dealed ourselves into an impossible expectation!\n\nSo we don\u2019t notice it when we get the beginnings of the real thing.\n\nRemember this: If you play in perfect darkness, ANYTHING you can see, is *seeing*!\n\nIf you're telling your sorcery buddy about it and he says, \"That's not seeing!\"\n\nRun.  Get away from him.  Never hand out with him again.\n\nHe's got a self-destructive book deal infecting his internal dialogue.\n\nThere's no way to cure that. It's a fatal malady.\n\nYou **have** to notice the early phases of it, so that you can view that more, and train your assemblage point to fine tune that view.\n\nThe fastest way to learn that, is to get an inorganic being of your own.\n\nThey are very entertaining, and you will CRAVE them becoming solid and real.\n\nMost of the time they\u2019ll be so vague and dim, you\u2019ll doubt you even see them.\n\nWhen they step out of the mists and appear to be as real as you are, standing right there, you\u2019ll get goosebumps!\n\nAnd, you\u2019ll try very hard to do that again!\n\nThat\u2019s the value of inorganic beings in darkness gazing.\n\nLast night I spend a good 2 minutes, trying to convince Fancy to kiss me.\n\nI just couldn't figure out how to make her solid, so I could feel it.\n\nBut she was certainly realistic looking!\n\nSo if you feel like it, add, \"Darkness Kissing\" to the techniques.\n\nI won't tell Fairy about it if you don't.\n\nEdited once\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Never hand out with him again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s got a self-destructive book deal infecting his internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way to cure that. It&amp;#39;s a fatal malady.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to notice the early phases of it, so that you can view that more, and train your assemblage point to fine tune that view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to learn that, is to get an inorganic being of your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are very entertaining, and you will CRAVE them becoming solid and real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time they\u2019ll be so vague and dim, you\u2019ll doubt you even see them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they step out of the mists and appear to be as real as you are, standing right there, you\u2019ll get goosebumps!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, you\u2019ll try very hard to do that again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the value of inorganic beings in darkness gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I spend a good 2 minutes, trying to convince Fancy to kiss me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how to make her solid, so I could feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she was certainly realistic looking!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you feel like it, add, &amp;quot;Darkness Kissing&amp;quot; to the techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t tell Fairy about it if you don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited once&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

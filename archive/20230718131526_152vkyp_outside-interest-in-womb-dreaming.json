When she gives me pictures to use to animate special effects, if she doesn't have one about \"cracks in the world\", I might add them myself.  But I suspect she meant what I was talking about.\n\nA good analogy might be when Don Juan mentions the allies in the books of Carlos, and suddenly the Allies are hiding in the bushes, making sounds.\n\nIt's not like they were there all along, and he only needed to be \"in the moment\" to notice them rustling around in there.\n\nIt was the very act of thinking about them, which summoned them.\n\nI know you have less time for things like darkroom, and if you force silence before sleep, that will work too.\n\nBut if you learn dreaming awake, there comes a time when you can just sit up on pillows watching the darkness, looking for \"anomalies\".\n\nThings that should not be there.\n\nIf it's a little sparkle, you can just roll your eyes on that spot so that you see it from various slight angle differences, and it gets more vivid until a dream bubble opens up. You \"treated it as real\" by believing you could circle it with your eye movements.\n\nOnce it turns into a dream bubble, you can leap into those! \n\nLiterally.  With your eyes open, standing up, you just leap right in.\n\nIt's the darndest thing! No way to explain why you don't break your neck.\n\nBut a warning. That typically takes the help of an Ally if you have only made it to the red zone.  So don't anyone pretend that.\n\nYour body leaps all by itself. Otherwise, don't do it.\n\nBut out in the purple zone, while you look for anomalies you'll find \"invisible ones\".\n\nJust some kind of \"pressure\".\n\nThose can't be found by \"being in the moment\".  Or even by using the head sweep, to look for anomalies.\n\nThose are \"gifts\".\n\nGiven because you were working hard.\n\nTo continue the analogy, imagine you're a little toddler on the rug, and you believe that if you crawl around you'll find candy down there. Because you did before!\n\nBut actually, it's your bad uncle standing above you tossing candy to you at random spots to see if he can get you to do weird things, believing you're finding the candy by yourself.\n\nHe's \"experimenting\" on you.\n\n\"The Spirit\" does that to us.\n\nAnd the key always seems to be, the quality of your silence levels.\n\nWe don't know why the Eagle does that.\n\nIt's a very odd thing.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jss2jcz", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you said is a valid method used by beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Listening to the sounds of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not fantasizing means, not having some story in your head which is going to bring back the internal dialogue even if you pretty much got rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But eventually you get past that.

But men have to struggle to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then instead of &amp;quot;being in the moment&amp;quot;, you look for cracks in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And focus on those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Athina&amp;#39;s womb dreaming post was alluding to that. When she gives me pictures to use to animate special effects, if she doesn&amp;#39;t have one about &amp;quot;cracks in the world&amp;quot;, I might add them myself.  But I suspect she meant what I was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good analogy might be when Don Juan mentions the allies in the books of Carlos, and suddenly the Allies are hiding in the bushes, making sounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like they were there all along, and he only needed to be &amp;quot;in the moment&amp;quot; to notice them rustling around in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the very act of thinking about them, which summoned them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you have less time for things like darkroom, and if you force silence before sleep, that will work too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you learn dreaming awake, there comes a time when you can just sit up on pillows watching the darkness, looking for &amp;quot;anomalies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things that should not be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s a little sparkle, you can just roll your eyes on that spot so that you see it from various slight angle differences, and it gets more vivid until a dream bubble opens up. You &amp;quot;treated it as real&amp;quot; by believing you could circle it with your eye movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it turns into a dream bubble, you can leap into those! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally.  With your eyes open, standing up, you just leap right in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the darndest thing! No way to explain why you don&amp;#39;t break your neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a warning. That typically takes the help of an Ally if you have only made it to the red zone.  So don&amp;#39;t anyone pretend that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your body leaps all by itself. Otherwise, don&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But out in the purple zone, while you look for anomalies you&amp;#39;ll find &amp;quot;invisible ones&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just some kind of &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those can&amp;#39;t be found by &amp;quot;being in the moment&amp;quot;.  Or even by using the head sweep, to look for anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are &amp;quot;gifts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given because you were working hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To continue the analogy, imagine you&amp;#39;re a little toddler on the rug, and you believe that if you crawl around you&amp;#39;ll find candy down there. Because you did before!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But actually, it&amp;#39;s your bad uncle standing above you tossing candy to you at random spots to see if he can get you to do weird things, believing you&amp;#39;re finding the candy by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;experimenting&amp;quot; on you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Spirit&amp;quot; does that to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the key always seems to be, the quality of your silence levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know why the Eagle does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very odd thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_152vkyp", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/152vkyp/outside_interest_in_womb_dreaming/jss2jcz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1689885876.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jsrtvf9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Cautious_Recipe3847", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jsrs3x9", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_9b5e8a6ng", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I probably didn't express myself that way.

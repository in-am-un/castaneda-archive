I spent 4 hours last night doing stuff that shows what you suggest is not a good idea.\n\nI'll tell you something I might have kept to myself.  I do stuff that's not good for this subreddit to know.  Hard to resist telling it, but it's harmful.\n\nIt's like telling the kids, there's a huge bag of the world's best candy from Grandma hidden in the bedroom up stairs, waiting for them to finish dinner.\n\nThey'll be crawling under the table to sneak away, before you can even put the meal on their plate.\n\n\"Puffery\" is what some Tensegrity moves do. Unbending intent long form.  But there's other stuff in Tensegrity.  For when we can understand it. Not for now.\n\nSo Carlos wanted us to scoop up puffs in our hands, and put them on our energy pouches, in order to bring the double to us. \n\nHe wanted to solve the 4th gate of dreaming, using Tensegrity.\n\nI didn't understand that, so Little Smoke tricked me.\n\nIf you go back to my early posts you can see me theorizing  you could create a \"space invaders\" style game, and move everyone's assemblage points very rapidly.\n\nI still had Little Smoke.\n\nTurns out my assumption you could create that game, is based on faulty reasoning.\n\nBut what Fairy did, was fly around the room pointing out brighter puffs of color,  by riding on top of them in an amusing fashion. \n\nAnd then she'd reward me with her behavior when I scooped them onto my torso using my hands. She'd visibly fly over to a new one, to show she was pleased and wanted me to do that again. Eventually it was possible to \"clear\" the room.\n\nWhat she did not do, is show me the alternatives.\n\nSomeone else is doing that now. \n\nCould be Lily, but all I perceive is a woman's presence.\n\nShe taught me not to touch the puffs if I could avoid it.  Don't \"contaminate\" them.  Let them behave naturally.  Once you \"touch a puff\", you got it worked up for a while, and it won't behave naturally.  So don't.\n\nThen watch how they flow.  Don't interfere.\n\nJust watch.\n\nThis is only for orange zone.  It could be harmful to your learning in earlier stages.\n\nSo imagine you are watching the flow of the puffs of awareness inside your cocoon, and learned you can command them to go to a certainly location, with your gaze.\n\nBut not with a  hard gaze.  You have to learn the right gaze, by watching their movement. It's \"intent\" in some very pure form.\n\nYou can encourage them to one side of the luminous egg.  Release them, and watch them fill in evenly on the whole inside again.\n\nOr gaze at your torso, and get them to concentrate there.\n\nAt that point you realize, the dream visions we see floating in the air, are the edges of the puffs, when evenly dispersed.\n\n(Maybe).\n\nThey don't need the energy pouches at all.  The pouches are like pockets.\n\nBut you don't need pockets to carry stuff in your hands.\n\nOnce you get the hang of letting the puffs fill in smoothly, in the entire inside of the shell,  you discover something shocking.\n\nYou start to walk towards the outside of the shell, and your body becomes visible as a heavy yellow human figure.  Bright!\n\nIt pushes the puffs of awareness aside as it walks.\n\nIf you spray painted your naked body with white paint, puffed yourself up with 100 bee stings, and then shone a yellow light directly at your white painted body, in a dark room,  that's what it would look like. If it were walking through a very thick slightly pinkish fog.\n\nMaybe it's what your \"energy body\" looks like, if you don't stuff puffs into it.\n\nIt's the pockets, with nothing in them.\n\nOr the being who has the pockets.\n\nThe result of doing that is, you do not attract your double.\n\nYou go follow him, out into infinity.\n\nIt's not a good path for darkroom, because it leads back into sleeping dreaming.  It doesn't extend into the waking world.  You'll lose hours of time, and only have vague memories of wandering like the double.\n\nI also learned a technique called, \"Cobweb Physics\", which simply means, learning to feel the cobwebs in the air, and then learning how they behave.\n\nThe side effect of  that is during the daytime, you can still feel them.\n\nUnfortunately, sorcery isn't about \"cool visions\", so you can tell stories and get attention, like our Jewish magic guy from last week who pretended to be a comrade of mine, to get attention. \n\nHe fixated on my interest in Pleiades, and thought since he'd heard that before in the pretend magic of his Kabbalah cult, or had tried using it for a destination,  he could claim it was the same as what I was doing.\n\nBased on Pleiades...\n\nThe comrade types are the worst bad players of all! They oppress with sadness to get their way.\n\nHe didn't understand this place at all, after many months in here.  Didn't take  any time to learn.\n\nSorcery is not overlapping stories.\n\nIt's not getting the most weird stuff to happen, the way the drug sorcerers believe.  They believe sorcery is just about getting higher than anyone else.\n\nSorcery is the mastery of intent.  Only that.\n\nAnd intent is only mastered when you manipulate it directly, in heightened awareness.\n\nYou have to be playing with it.  Not exploring the results of it.\n\nThat's why Carlos told  us where to go in his last books. \n\nSo we couldn't go off to the side.\n\nReach the abstract first, then we can try other paths.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hmtsiag", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Wouldn\u2019t gazing be the most versatile and lucrative of them all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Odd that you ask.

Or to try to use some new psychology to explain it.\n\nThe problem is, we don't really have a brain.\n\nIt's totally hard to accept, but that's the full implications of what Carlos told us, in one of the introductions to his last 3 books.\n\nThat Causality is just an illusion created by our assemblage points being stuck on the blue line of the J curve.\n\nI won't go into that in detail, but you might say, \"Oh yea?!?  How about if I get an ice pick, and do what they do to frogs before they dissect them?\"\n\nI believe it's called \"pithing\" them, and you stick it into the back of their head, and up into the brain.\n\nIf there's no causality, how come a sorcerer would also be rendered brain dead by that method?\n\nWell... They could simply vanish before you finished doing that.  The Tonal body can vanish according to don  Juan.\n\nAnd I sure can't explain where it goes, when you go outside in a shapeshifted form and explore the world.\n\nAble to pick up a car with one hand.\n\nOr when you leap through the ceiling and land on a distant planet.\n\nSo I'm not saying I know how to vanish, or even if you really can as they say, but there's certainly weird goings on in advanced darkroom.\n\nCould be one of those old, \"if you die in the dream, you die in the waking world\" issues.\n\nBut you can simply vanish before you are \"pierced\".\n\nWhat's this to do with your practices?\n\nAlmost there.  But first 2 or 3 stories.\n\nTaisha was explaining about *intent* one day.  I can't remember where, but she said that her relationship to intent was so strong, she just opened her closet and there, right in the front, was the ideal thing to wear today.  She didn't have to stare at her wardrobe trying to figure out what was appropriate for this occasion.\n\nThen there's the 4th method to enter Silent Knowledge I posted about in the last few days.  Where you use the energy body to do it.\n\nIn my case I lay on my side after the puffs of colorful light gave me an \"offer\" to help, and found myself on a college campus, in the large main building.\n\nI was not only fully lucid, but the dream was absolutely stable, with no threat of \"running out of energy\" and waking up. And no threat of losing lucidity.\n\nAs don Juan said, \"Dreams that come from silence are always real.\"\n\nI don't know what that means, but once you start to follow instructions given to us by Carlos, and stop pretending your ordinary dreams are magic, you realize there are \"different feelings\" and \"features\" to different types of dreams.\n\nAnd most of the time those \"lucid dreams\" are both hard to hold for long, and hard to retain lucidity.  Even when you believe yourself to be lucid, because you like mental masturbation, you really don't have your \"purpose\" in mind.  You just know it's a dream, but you don't remember to find your hands, and don't experiment as you should, according to the rules in Art of Dreaming.\n\nYou're making shit up...\n\nBut when you get serious you'll realize that a dream that doesn't end, remains stable, and you have all of your purpose, and most of your sobriety, is a different \"thing\".\n\nIt's more \"real\".  And extremely rare until you learn sorcery.\n\nIn that dream I looked around for \"Silent Knowledge\".   I knew the energy body was going to help me, but didn't know how.\n\nAnd there I was in a huge multi-story college building.  I jumped off the balcony to get to the main floor, so I could find out more about the place.\n\nI ran into a receptionist behind some kind of \"information desk\".\n\nBut she was angry with me.  She had a large plastic screen up, some kind of Covid protection, couldn't hear me wel, and her speech was rather garbled.\n\nShe finally became angry with me, and threatened to track me down and kill me.\n\nI was still fully lucid, so I apologized and left.\n\nLater I ran into the bathroom area, saw a multi faucet tile structure where at least 8 people could wash their hands by taking a different position around it, and the water faucet spoke to me.\n\nIt told me I was looking for it. And began to give me \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nExcept it really made no sense.  It was in fact speaking about the biggest concern on my mind in that reality.  The receptionist who wanted to kill me.  I had decided her odd behavior reminded me of Cholita, and so she was a \"witch\".\n\nThe water faucet said, \"To kill a witch, use stench.  And juice.\"\n\nMade no sense so I sat up in bed, realizing I was not actually asleep at all.\n\nLater Mad prophet pointed out to me, that dreams do in fact use symbology.\n\nAnd since I had gone looking for Silent Knowledge I could turn on and off at will, I ended up with a water faucet.\n\nAnd, wasn't that the sink from Harry Potter in my picture?\n\nYes it was. But what was odd is she said, \"The polyjuice sink?\"\n\nI wasn't thinking to grab Harry Potter's sink.  I just needed a large one that was tile and ornamental.\n\nI believe that's the episode where they have something running around killing everyone, and they turn themselves into other students using a potion which stinks big time.\n\nSo in the dream version of SK, it told me I could solve my problem using pretty much the same thing in that Harry Potter movie.\n\nStenchy juice.\n\nAnd then I realized, I was on a college campus!\n\nHogwarts?\n\nThat sort of thing happens all the time in out of control dreams, but I was fully lucid and not actually asleep.  I'd entered in my dreaming body, but had never actually gone to sleep.\n\nI suppose one more story.  \n\nA day or so later, or earlier, I joked I should use the affection pass and Pandora's box to compress a puff into a phantom being, and have tea with it.  Use a puff to make a little table, and then pretend to have a little girl style \"tea party\", which actually has no tea.\n\nBut I was only joking with my IOB \"Fancy\".\n\nExcept that later on, after I had completely forgotten it, I noticed my room was now located in an alien forest.  The closest description would be an earthly forest which had burned down, leaving only the black tree trunks standing.  The entire place was black, except for the burnt trunks sticking straight up, evenly spaced so that you could walk around, but not in a straight line.\n\nMy entire room was surrounded by an alien forest.\n\nFor the sake of beginners, this was fully awake, walking around, eyes open, no drugs.  I could have flipped on the light switch in the room at any time.\n\nBut there I was, on an alien planet.\n\nA very young woman was sitting on the floor, as if on a very small chair, facing where I had actually joked around and stretched a puff into a little table.\n\nI'd forgotten I actually did that, as part of joking around with Fancy.\n\nAnd the young woman looked up disappointed.\n\nIt took  me a while to realize, that was my double doing what I had asked.\n\nHaving a tea party with me.\n\nThe woman had black hair, as I do.  If the double had decided to look like a young woman, because only young people have pretend tea parties,  and mostly only females do that, so it created a copy of \"me\" appropriate for that, it would have been just about right for the woman sitting there, waiting to have tea.  Me as a young woman.\n\nI've seen me as Cholita before (kind of too fat for Cholita), and Cholita as her older, and younger self.\n\nThe double can look any way it likes!\n\nAnd the double had not only remembered my joking, but even added it's own understanding of how things work.\n\nNamely that tea parties are for young females.\n\nBut the double has no brain. It's not associated with an organic body.\n\nAnd I'd forgotten I had even requested it to do that.\n\nIt wasn't until the next day when I wrote it down, that I realized what was going on.\n\nSo here's the takeaway.\n\nAny trace glow of awareness in the emanations, can get \"reskimmed\" into your new reality.\n\nThe double took me into dreaming to help me find SK.\n\nBut for whatever reason, some emanations associated with watching Harry Potter remained with some latent glow of awareness.  And it was enough to get incorporated into that dream world.\n\nThat's how SK mode works in the first place!  It's reached by focusing our awareness on the interplay of emanations in man's band.\n\nAnd the double doesn't need a memory. His memory is that interplay.  He can look inside it, and retrieve any memories he wants.\n\nAs silent knowledge.\n\nSo he both remembered I had requested a tea party, but also used that Harry Potter episode as a good place for me to go looking for Silent Knowledge. Which is pretty much crazy magic, like the Harry Potter movie.\n\nAnd Taisha lives in Silent Knowledge mode most of the time, so she doesn't actually have to figure out what to wear on a given day.  That information is available in SK.\n\nAnd SK causes reskimmnings of intent, to further advance the flow of information.\n\nThis should be at least partially understood by beginners who worry, \"If I shut off my internal dialogue, how can I think?\"\n\nYou've been brainwashed. Sorcerers don't view the world that way anymore.  That's what's holding you prisoner in the \"chicken coop\" of our society.  Food for some other being(s).\n\nSorcerers snatch \"knowledge\" out of the air when they need it!\n\nCarlos was witnessed \"showing off\" by allowing someone to select a topic he couldn't know about.  Maybe some difficult or obscure science.\n\nAnd he'd just read text off his palm, about that topic.\n\nHis \"knowledge\" was not kept in his brain anymore.\n\nIf you read the recent explanation to Taisha by Nelida or Clara and found in her new book, of how you bring out the double, it suggests not looking at the world the same way anymore and not caring about the results of your actions.  You don't think ahead and worry about outcomes. You simply act and when done, drop it.\n\nAnd it mentions several ways to get information you should not possess. Here's a piece of it:\n\n \\*\\*\\*\n\nSometimes omens tell you how to do something. As for example, which plant to pick for a particular ailment. Or they predict the outcome of a course of action. Naturally, other forces can tell you these things too.\"\n\nWhat other forces are those?\"\n\n\"The voice of seeing, for example. That comes directly from your energetic body. Or it may come from another entity that advises you. At any rate, it advises you from a place not accessible to your everyday physical body. And you have to open a channel to that place. \"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDoing so brings you the resources of the double, who absolutely has no brain.\n\nAnd yet, everyone's double is far smarter than their Tonal.\n\nIt's just not limited by  rationality, so it we don't think of it as \"smarter\".\n\nWe can believe we have a brain, and a subconscious, but another alternative is to realize there's only the interplay of the emanations in Man's band, controlling everything about us.\n\nIncluding our reality, and our physicality.\n\nBut please, don't anyone try \"pithing\" someone else to test the theory out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Some Short Musings On Memory, the Subconscious, and Dream Imagery", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"9ebzlm7qzwv81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=999c04020afc75906db1f9388aadb01d385887b9"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40107c5ae04cd9e189974025b6c51b5738cd01eb"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8772c1eab4280e6a3f324877358f33092d2c1ccf"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae68ed5f643e2a79d1361d9303238b2270622bb"}, {"y": 640, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ed3adf275d8298859466af24445a76ba816322c"}, {"y": 720, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d16820b6abce762734a46be9a227e9933cef68f8"}], "s": {"y": 1414, "x": 2120, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=2120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce676c8e08cbc5c8a2dc6d7ce64b25f398c74e79"}, "id": "9ebzlm7qzwv81"}}, "name": "t3_ucixjf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qUek1_zb7-ekfmMNRF7dHC2zqQpC4lHKYcXYZkwWUOM.jpg", "edited": 1651006292.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650996871.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=2120&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce676c8e08cbc5c8a2dc6d7ce64b25f398c74e79\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9ebzlm7qzwv81.png?width=2120&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce676c8e08cbc5c8a2dc6d7ce64b25f398c74e79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you take what Carlos told us about &amp;quot;Causality&amp;quot; literally, there&amp;#39;s no real world holding us down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not uncommon for new people to believe they can &amp;quot;explain&amp;quot; sorcery in terms of some new brain scan scientists did.

It&amp;#39;s not associated with an organic body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;d forgotten I had even requested it to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until the next day when I wrote it down, that I realized what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any trace glow of awareness in the emanations, can get &amp;quot;reskimmed&amp;quot; into your new reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double took me into dreaming to help me find SK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for whatever reason, some emanations associated with watching Harry Potter remained with some latent glow of awareness.  And it was enough to get incorporated into that dream world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how SK mode works in the first place!  It&amp;#39;s reached by focusing our awareness on the interplay of emanations in man&amp;#39;s band.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the double doesn&amp;#39;t need a memory. His memory is that interplay.  He can look inside it, and retrieve any memories he wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he both remembered I had requested a tea party, but also used that Harry Potter episode as a good place for me to go looking for Silent Knowledge. Which is pretty much crazy magic, like the Harry Potter movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Taisha lives in Silent Knowledge mode most of the time, so she doesn&amp;#39;t actually have to figure out what to wear on a given day.  That information is available in SK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And SK causes reskimmnings of intent, to further advance the flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This should be at least partially understood by beginners who worry, &amp;quot;If I shut off my internal dialogue, how can I think?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed. Sorcerers don&amp;#39;t view the world that way anymore.  That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s holding you prisoner in the &amp;quot;chicken coop&amp;quot; of our society.  Food for some other being(s).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers snatch &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; out of the air when they need it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was witnessed &amp;quot;showing off&amp;quot; by allowing someone to select a topic he couldn&amp;#39;t know about.  Maybe some difficult or obscure science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;d just read text off his palm, about that topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; was not kept in his brain anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read the recent explanation to Taisha by Nelida or Clara and found in her new book, of how you bring out the double, it suggests not looking at the world the same way anymore and not caring about the results of your actions.  You don&amp;#39;t think ahead and worry about outcomes. You simply act and when done, drop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it mentions several ways to get information you should not possess. Here&amp;#39;s a piece of it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes omens tell you how to do something. As for example, which plant to pick for a particular ailment. Or they predict the outcome of a course of action. Naturally, other forces can tell you these things too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What other forces are those?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The voice of seeing, for example. That comes directly from your energetic body. Or it may come from another entity that advises you. At any rate, it advises you from a place not accessible to your everyday physical body. And you have to open a channel to that place. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing so brings you the resources of the double, who absolutely has no brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, everyone&amp;#39;s double is far smarter than their Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just not limited by  rationality, so it we don&amp;#39;t think of it as &amp;quot;smarter&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can believe we have a brain, and a subconscious, but another alternative is to realize there&amp;#39;s only the interplay of the emanations in Man&amp;#39;s band, controlling everything about us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Including our reality, and our physicality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But please, don&amp;#39;t anyone try &amp;quot;pithing&amp;quot; someone else to test the theory out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ucixjf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ucixjf/some_short_musings_on_memory_the_subconscious_and/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ucixjf/some_short_musings_on_memory_the_subconscious_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1650996871.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i6erpmw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1651072521.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i6dh06g", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "And don't forget \"metaphors\".\n\nSorcerers like those!

They take children from poor people who can't feed them well and turn them into child prostitutes.  Later to serve as gangsters controlling the open prostitution around Buddhist temples late at night in the confessional booths stationed around the dark sides of the Temple.\n\nThey openly have female child prostitutes available to wealthy businessmen, in Tokyo. It's a local source of humor. \n\nThe \"Temple Girls\".  You pay for \"tea ceremony\", but they know that if the man is important it's ok for him to fondle you.  In fact, encouraged.\n\nIn Thailand they recruit farmer girls from up north, who are considered of a lower class. They tattoo their entire back with the Buddhist precepts, and put them to work in the local bars of Bangkok and Pattaya.\n\nBut even worse,  that whole system is built on damaging lies.\n\nHarmful to sorcery students.\n\nThey only think it's helpful because of the \"Armando Torres\" effect.\n\nWhere everyone is so tired of seeing Carlos attacked, that as long as someone says nice things about him they become popular.  \n\nBuddhism makes promises of \"superiority\", with \"endorsement\" from the system.\n\nPeople have a hard time noticing it doesn't actually work, because of so many wiling to pretend and exaggerate results.\n\nWe stop that in here, but they encourage it as long as it fits the desired narrative. Anything that doesn't is labeled as harmful to your dharma.\n\nOr whatever word they use.\n\nThe word itself is a lie. There's no such thing as what they seek to protect!\n\nWe're just a blob of awareness, which could have become anything at all. We chose a human birth, but we existed long before that as a free explorer.\n\nThere's nothing out there particularly interested in keeping us in a \"perfect\" human state.\n\nIt's a delusional very \"human\" point of view.\n\nWhich they can't understand.  Buddhists won't accept that humanness is a state we seek to escape.\n\nThe truth is, anything that puts wrong understanding into your mind deviates where your awareness flows when you practice the real thing.\n\nSo we end up with people reading about \"sunlight glitter\" trying to burn after images into the eye so they can pretend those are the same as \"colors\" seen in darkness.\n\nLet's take Buddhism specifics.\n\nSpirits are bad.\n\nEven though, The Buddha and Milarepa use lame stories of meeting spirits once or twice, as \"proof\" they have achieved something.\n\nIn Buddhism, you're supposed to ignore those if you aren't some religious icon.\n\nSpirits are the one thing we MUST join with, to move our assemblage point the way sorcerers do.\n\nIf you ignore the allies, they go away.  It's a net energy loss to them to come visit you if you ignore them.\n\nThe instructions given to Buddhists are DESIGNED to keep you prisoner in the green zone, worshipping your ego and bodily sensations. With the promise of a little throne to sit on.\n\nIf they taught real magic they'd go out of business!\n\nLook at this subreddit. The rate at which new people are willing to actually put in the same amount of time they read about in the books, such as gazing at leaves daily for hours, seems too \"hardcore\" for 499 out of 500.\n\nWe say our success rate is 1 in 100, based on people making it into the advanced subreddit.\n\nBut that ignores that most people don't \"join\" a subreddit.\n\nWhy bother if you can read it freely?\n\nSo I'm thinking 1 in 500 is more like it.\n\nAnd part of the problem is Buddhism.  Telling people it's peaceful to practice, and a small effort at meditation using their horrible techniques of substitute internal dialogues, will do the job in the long run.\n\nAfter several lifetimes.  \n\nWhich by the way, you don't get.  That's a Buddhist lie.\n\nAnd Hinduism also!\n\nThose are money making businesses. They don't care at all what happens to you.\n\nJust whether you're profitable to the organization.\n\nI'm afraid to some extent, the same thing has happened to our own \"factions\" 1, 2, and M.\n\nGroups created by Carlos, assigned to teach tensegrity.\n\nFactions 1 and 2 have new passes that couldn't have been designed by Carlos.\n\nMight be designed by Carol Tiggs, but if that's so they would have mentioned it.\n\nWouldn't they?\n\nAnd why isn't it working? Despite claims everyone is doing regular tensegrity and recapitulation, there's nothing exciting to hear about.\n\nNo magic.\n\nCarlos sought that!  But Cleargreen ignores it.\n\nAnd Faction M for Mexico is pushing horrible Rinpoche lectures, which are sure to doom  your ability to learn sorcery if you believe what they tell you.\n\nBuddhism is DESIGNED to hold you back from real magic.\n\nThey only want to produce the closed eye bliss variety.\n\nThat's just beginner's level, and anyone who remains there is doomed.\n\nAny woman can do everything the Buddha himself did, in the bathtub surrounded by candles and flowers.\n\nThey just don't make a regular practice of it, because they've been convinced you need the \"endorsement\" by men.\n\nIf that isn't evil, I don't know what would qualify.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cool Opportunity For Pretenders In Here!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xsug02exxt3b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 142, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsug02exxt3b1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=309056579be25aeae87e215bdaa74f83d5149995"}, {"y": 284, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsug02exxt3b1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f09546b8429d20ef4b94b374ad0328c0256fa72"}, {"y": 421, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsug02exxt3b1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=097f36edff46847ba755822e22fe0bd53e733dad"}], "s": {"y": 791, "x": 600, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsug02exxt3b1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd8d3bbe968c14ee4af31e7c99dba33c0353c6a8"}, "id": "xsug02exxt3b1"}}, "name": "t3_13ziy7a", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 37, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gCsR_yt6qn4kiHVp9WBRTsrXnFZLwKTQBKyM6XreF-o.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1685812047.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xsug02exxt3b1.png?width=600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dd8d3bbe968c14ee4af31e7c99dba33c0353c6a8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xsug02exxt3b1.png?width=600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dd8d3bbe968c14ee4af31e7c99dba33c0353c6a8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go for it!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And leave us alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know many of you don&amp;#39;t like the open battle I have going on with evil forces, such as Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which controls prostitution in Asian countries, pressures senile old wealthy Asian man to give up extremely valuable real estate to them in exchange for going to  heaven instead of hell, which they then use to influence politics in places like Tokyo or Taipei.

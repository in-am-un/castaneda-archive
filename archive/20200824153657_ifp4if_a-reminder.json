It&amp;#39;s more like, those emanations become active, and so later when you want to shift the assemblage point it can more easily move so as to include those ones which are already lit up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like putting tiny little LED lights in a vast pitch black warehouse.  Maybe one over each exit door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tiny little lights can help you move that direction.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brings up the possibility that Carlos designed Tensegrity to allow us to light up those emanations, without needing an IOB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the moves themselves can produce effects that trigger them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originally designed by an IOB if you ask me.  But it&amp;#39;s just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone would have to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the Tensegrity moves in order to figure out what&amp;#39;s going on, and then follow the results where they lead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example: The V spot pass always produces a mirror in front of me, and a being shows up to look at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;paisley&amp;quot; movements with the feet, where you make a big circle, and then a little circle, show off those lights Juan sees when he moves his hands in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see the feet doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it leaves traces on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone could follow that lead too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But people mindlessly repeat the movements without ever looking deeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The very tool Carlos gave us, for moving the assemblage point, stopped it from moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it became a social behavior. Just another item on the island of the tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they aren&amp;#39;t a viable source of dark energy and the workshop crowd went nowhere for decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would anger work to get dark energy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even grab the bastard (IOB) and smash her into the ground!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She won&amp;#39;t mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the interaction, and probably not the results of &amp;quot;a substance&amp;quot; being traded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it can certainly feel like a substance when you are experiencing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ifp4if", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ifp4if/a_reminder/g31ab7d/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1598544924.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1598544924.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g2zff7l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g2qb77z", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ifp4if/a_reminder/g2zff7l/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_g2zff7l", "created": 1598497229.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1598497229.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g2qb77z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g2q1y81", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yea.\n\nI suppose I'd have to look at what they write, to see if it sounds made up.

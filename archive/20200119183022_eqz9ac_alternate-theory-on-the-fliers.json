In a [paper](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1743/20170052) in the journal *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*,  Kolodny argues that early humans\u2014while teaching their kin how to make  complex tools\u2014hijacked the capacity for language from themselves.\n\nTo understand what Kolodny\u2019s getting at, I ask  Bovaird to walk me through the history of Stone Age technologies. He  starts by smashing an irregular, grapefruit-size stone between two  larger rocks. He picks through the resulting fragments, looking for a  shard with an excellent cutting edge.

No longer did toolmakers simply knock stones together to see what they  got; now they aimed for symmetry. Bovaird holds up his work in progress,  a late Acheulean hand ax\u2014the multi-tool of the middle-to-lower  Paleolithic, good for cutting meat, digging dirt, smashing bone. The  blade of this ax has a zigzag edge, with tiny, alternating flakes  removed from each side of the cutting surface. To achieve this level of  serration, Bovaird explains, he needs a precise understanding of how the  stone works, as well as the ability to plan his work many steps in  advance.\n\nSomewhere on the timeline between the long run  of the Oldowan and the more rapid rise of Acheulean technologies,  language (or what\u2019s often called protolanguage) likely made its first  appearance. Oren Kolodny and his co-author, Shimon Edelman, a professor  of psychology at Cornell University, say the overlap is not a  coincidence.

[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/alru3rhuwxzb1.jpg?width=1792&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06bbf6fbb490aa307d167e7638631293cfa95943\n\nThis is from a much older post, from back when I found \"Fancy\".\n\nMy childhood monster under the bed.\n\nFrom when I turned her into a new \"Ally\".\n\nI didn't have DALL-E to help make pictures back then, so I just now recreated this picture for my current animation.\n\nDALL-E is very far from being able to follow instructions, so pretty much you get random stuff you can't use.\n\nBut you can edit it in GIMP, and request \"pieces\" to assemble what you really want from. And DALL-E can make transparency format files (png).  So you can easily piece together individual elements.\n\nSuch as my Ally \"Fancy\" breaking through the windshield, or the trail of flames.\n\nDALL-E didn't draw this in one piece. It was more like 6 pieces I had to stitch together.\n\nBut it came out very accurate\n\nThe history of this picture is that I'd been lucky enough to play with the Allies of Carlos for more than two decades, although they were very scary at first.\n\nBut became very obedient once I stood up to them.  That is in fact how it goes with the Allies.\n\nNew people...\n\nProbably you didn't read ALL of the books, but if you read at least the first three you remember Genaro having to \"spin with the Ally\".\n\nDon't drool too much. That was just Genaro.\n\nYou can't go off into the wilderness waving your hand over the ground, find an ally, and then spin with it.\n\nYou might wrestle it more likely, but in fact you really only need to stand up to it.\n\nIn Taisha's case for example when she first went to stay with Don Juan, most likely in Zuleica's home near Fort Ortiz and not too far south from Los Angeles and Tucson right where there's a railroad station that's been around most of the last century,  she came to believe that don Juan had sexual designs on her and felt threatened.\n\nI'm afraid it's some kind of old or new seer hazing ritual, which does in fact serve to help women learn.\n\nCarlos did the same. Cholita says when she was imported from the peyote fields near Mexico city and brought straight to Carlos, he said \"I'll be intimate with you one way or the other.\"\n\nAnd Tony Lama was told he had to have sex with Carol Tiggs if he wanted to join the lineage and be the new male Nagual.\n\nWhen Carlos was dying and knew both Taisha and Florinda would be ditching Cleargreen, I was invited to have sex with Florinda.\n\nI presume that means I would have gone with them and Kylie, but there's no way to be sure.\n\nCertainly it wasn't my good looks and charm at work.\n\nCholita would definitely laugh at that idea.\n\nBut in fact, the lineages seem to have used that type of behavior both on men and women.\n\nBut especially on women.\n\nSo Taisha believed don Juan was going to sneak into her room at night and rape her, which left her frightened in her bed, in a dark room.\n\nThe IDEAL condition to run into your first Ally.\n\nWe try to set that up during darkroom, although minus the sexual \"antics\".\n\nWhich Carlos was widely criticized on for that behavior, by those who sought to finally destroy him after his death.\n\nBut in fact, women have sexier experiences in sorcery than the men even without men causing them.\n\nWomb dreaming especially seems to lead to \"visitors\" molesting them in bed.\n\nSeemingly real, but later they realize it was just an Ally capitalizing on their fear. In order to get energy.\n\nWhich is not a bad thing!\n\nIn fact, I long for the days when an Ally could scare me.\n\nBack then I could get things like the \"truck accident north of Tokyo\" to happen.\n\nJust by asking for it, and using one of the purple puffs to merge with my Ally \"Fancy\".\n\nYou first find an intense purple puff, hopefully with jet blackness around it.\n\nYou grab it with both hands, one on each side.\n\nIf you worry you can't feel it but can only see it, it's not going to work.\n\nBut try anyway.  Maybe by \"treating it as real\" you'll shift horizontally in the red zone, where all of your senses will become active in the second attention.\n\nStretch it wide like taffy, then Flip it up into the air like it was a blanket and you were tossing it onto the bed, trying to get it to spread out perfectly and fall down.\n\nBut as the puff falls, make your request.\n\n\"Freeway Overpass truck accident,  just north of Tokyo and high above the forest!\"\n\nAnd voila.\n\nYou get what you see here. Except, I just saw the overpass and had to call to my Ally Fancy to come near, so I could tell her what I wanted her to do.\n\nWhich was, go find a blue japanese truck and drive it over that ramp up high, and burst through the railing to die in a fiery crash at my feet.\n\n\"Right there in front of me, Fancy!\", I told her.\n\nI believe all she said was \"ok.\"\n\nWhich surprised me a bit, living with Cholita and all.\n\nI expected some argument over that.\n\nBut the result was far better than even Dr. Strange's doings!!!\n\nWe get to do magic FOR REAL.\n\nBut unfortunately we've seen our usual run of new bad players in the subreddit lately.\n\nIt never ceases.\n\nSo first know, you get to do things like this but won't be able to repeat them until much later.\n\nYou're being taught the same way Carlos learned.\n\nThat's how real magic works.\n\nYou follow a trail, blazed by people in the past.\n\nNo trail, nowhere to go.\n\nAnd people learned sorcery in the past, from powerful sorcerers.\n\nWith amazing magical shows.  Like you read about in the books of Carlos.\n\nAnd which you can't do by yourself.\n\nYou need outside help from a teacher.\n\nThe Allies love to play that role.\n\nAnd so while that night I could get my ally Fancy to stage that truck accident (it's close enough so that whatever details are wrong aren't important), the next night I could not.\n\nBut instead, while trying a night or two later I grew to the size of \"The Hulk\", went outside, and lifted Cholita's small foreign car in one hand.\n\nFor real.  Fully awake, completely sober, and barefoot with the lawn cold and wet, and my feet painfully stepping on little rocks Cholita scattered there.\n\nFor god only knows what purpose.\n\nSo new people who were exposed to too much Sufi pretend magic?\n\nWith Jinn and sorcerers who are more like superman?\n\nForget it!\n\nIt's not like that at all.\n\nAnd when people claim it is, you know they're frauds.\n\nSecond thing for bad players, don't try to use sleeping dreaming!\n\nThe women can.\n\nBut what are you going to gain by misrepresenting ordinary dreams as a path to sorcery, when they never were?\n\nYou quite simply ARE NOT going to follow the instructions Carlos gave us.\n\nI could lecture a new person for an hour on what those instructions require, and then they'll still tell me some ordinary dream that was nothing like that, as if they did well.\n\nSo forget about sleeping dreaming unless you have a womb and can follow womb dreaming instructions to the letter.\n\nIt makes no difference to anyone outside our Castaneda interests, if you had a vivid dream.\n\nThey do that too.\n\nBut if you tell them you did what you see here, fully awake, eyes wide open, completely sober, they'll blow a fuse.\n\nBecause clearly, this is real sorcery.\n\nNot some lame closed eye meditation half dream vision you twist around to match the false narrative your \"system\" gives you.\n\nThey use meditation bliss like a drug to convince you all of their delusional lies are true.\n\nAnd through self-flattery, you believe it.\n\nDo your dreaming AWAKE, and you won't regret it.\n\nWe aren't out to impress people, but at the same time you need to self-motivate.\n\nAnd if you kick the Buddha's skinny butt hands down, it's motivating!\n\nIf you get to the red zone and do real magic you'll already see that you passed all the Rinpoches and Yogis worldwide right by at the speed of a freight train.\n\nAnd can tell others how to do that.\n\nThe problem is, you actually have to do some real work to learn to be silent and you MUST use the Tensegrity or it will be 10 times harder.\n\nEven twice as hard is too much for nearly all people.\n\nTen times harder is impossible.\n\nNext thing to new people.\n\nIf I hear you repeating the words I used in a post,  but in your own tale of power and you're a beginner, it's so obvious you're making up stuff that I can't believe you think you can get away with that.\n\nBut new bad players rely on social bullying and self-pity to get away with lying, because you can do that everywhere else.\n\nThis place isn't like everywhere else. No one has a money making motivation. So fakers are a very bad thing, and would wipe out the subreddit if they weren't stopped.\n\nIt's only worth all this work in here if we succeed at creating REAL sorcerers.\n\nGroupies are worse than useless to this cause.\n\nBut if you want REAL magic that even beats Dr. Strange (at times), you're in the right place.\n\nIt's just not going to be \"cozy\" when you get there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Fully awake, completely sober, and barefoot with the lawn cold and wet, and my feet painfully stepping on little rocks Cholita scattered there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For god only knows what purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So new people who were exposed to too much Sufi pretend magic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Jinn and sorcerers who are more like superman?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like that at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when people claim it is, you know they&amp;#39;re frauds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second thing for bad players, don&amp;#39;t try to use sleeping dreaming!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what are you going to gain by misrepresenting ordinary dreams as a path to sorcery, when they never were?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You quite simply ARE NOT going to follow the instructions Carlos gave us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could lecture a new person for an hour on what those instructions require, and then they&amp;#39;ll still tell me some ordinary dream that was nothing like that, as if they did well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So forget about sleeping dreaming unless you have a womb and can follow womb dreaming instructions to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes no difference to anyone outside our Castaneda interests, if you had a vivid dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They do that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you tell them you did what you see here, fully awake, eyes wide open, completely sober, they&amp;#39;ll blow a fuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because clearly, this is real sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not some lame closed eye meditation half dream vision you twist around to match the false narrative your &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; gives you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They use meditation bliss like a drug to convince you all of their delusional lies are true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And through self-flattery, you believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do your dreaming AWAKE, and you won&amp;#39;t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t out to impress people, but at the same time you need to self-motivate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you kick the Buddha&amp;#39;s skinny butt hands down, it&amp;#39;s motivating!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get to the red zone and do real magic you&amp;#39;ll already see that you passed all the Rinpoches and Yogis worldwide right by at the speed of a freight train.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And can tell others how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, you actually have to do some real work to learn to be silent and you MUST use the Tensegrity or it will be 10 times harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even twice as hard is too much for nearly all people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten times harder is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next thing to new people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I hear you repeating the words I used in a post,  but in your own tale of power and you&amp;#39;re a beginner, it&amp;#39;s so obvious you&amp;#39;re making up stuff that I can&amp;#39;t believe you think you can get away with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But new bad players rely on social bullying and self-pity to get away with lying, because you can do that everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This place isn&amp;#39;t like everywhere else. No one has a money making motivation. So fakers are a very bad thing, and would wipe out the subreddit if they weren&amp;#39;t stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only worth all this work in here if we succeed at creating REAL sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Groupies are worse than useless to this cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you want REAL magic that even beats Dr. Strange (at times), you&amp;#39;re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just not going to be &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; when you get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "e149107a-34fb-11eb-a30a-0ed8846f051f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "17tny4a", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17tny4a/how_to_stage_insurance_fraud_north_of_tokyo/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/17tny4a/how_to_stage_insurance_fraud_north_of_tokyo/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1699807030.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k93f5za", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Stealthsilent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k91w16j", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_vdoi9", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Thanks for your encouragement!\n\nGoing to work requires effort.

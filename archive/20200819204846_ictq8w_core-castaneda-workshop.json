You already have everything you need inside of you. It\u2019s just that you haven\u2019t been trained to tap into and engage your inner power\u00a0and allow\u00a0its\u00a0energy to guide you in creating and living your life.\n\nAmerican author and anthropologist, Carlos Castaneda, starting with T*he Teachings of Don Juan*, wrote a series of books that describe his training with\u00a0his shaman-teacher, don Juan Matus, who taught him everything he knew about energy, how to cultivate it within ourselves and then use it in our everyday lives.\n\nThose 12 books have sold more than 28 million copies in 17 languages and have become the source for helping millions of people manifest the life of their dreams, by bringing the once closely held knowledge and wisdom of the Toltec shaman to anyone\u00a0who desires\u00a0an extraordinary life.\n\n \n\n#### Silence Inner Dialogue\n\nWhere many practices teach silent meditation, in this workshop\u00a0you will learn specific Magical Passes\u00ae;\u00a0movements\u00a0to ACTIVELY turn off your internal dialogue,\u00a0to get you into that other space \u2026\u00a0that part of you connected to your higher intelligence.\n\nBy reducing the noise, you will gain energy and clarity ... giving you the bandwidth to dream and create your\u00a0Ideal Life!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Start Dreaming Your Life\n\nNow that you have more energy and clarity ... you will learn the most effective ways to dream your life. Not the life of your parents, friends or peers; a life of your design. You will move away from fear and scarcity so that you can be, do and have whatever you desire.\n\nYou will become the architect of your life. You will envision\u00a0your true path of heart ...\u00a0Living Your Magical Life\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Put Dreams Into Action\n\nIt's far too easy to\u00a0get stuck in the deliciousness of the dream ... and then stumble and fumble in trying to make those dreams reality. Yet, the whole purpose of dreaming ... envisioning your life ... is so that you can live it in the real\u00a0world.\n\nYou will learn specific steps in order\u00a0to\u00a0expand past the\u00a0obstacles preventing you from living the Life of Your Dreams!\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6x81cv090i51.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff82187e50f43fb2b1824995d3bca2536fde1995\n\n#### Active Meditation\n\nInstead of passive exercises like seated meditation to silence the mind, the shamans of Castaneda\u2019s lineage use an active form of meditation, movements called Magical Passes\u00ae\n\nAfter many years of intentional efforts, Carlos Castaneda and his cohorts have succeeded in taking the Magical Passes\u00ae out of their ritualistic and secretive origin and surroundings, transforming them into revised sets of movement capable of being utilized by anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0uja1ws490i51.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e0119a602f396a9a5811d7706eff07bc2c0e58\n\n#### Unconscious Intelligence\n\nIf you are stuck in your life \u2026 it is because you are not yet able to connect to your unconscious intelligence, which appears when your mind is silent.\n\nMost people overthink, because they have not yet discovered and trust that more powerful part of themselves.\n\n*\"Whenever the internal dialogue stops, the world collapses, and extraordinary facets of ourselves surface, as though they had been kept heavily guarded by our words.\"* \\- Carlos Castaneda\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nm81v1f990i51.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bae7b0150c312affcac48cd37dff306dc41f56a\n\n#### Tools ... Not Rules\n\nThe world is so noisy, there seems to be no shortage of people telling you what to do and how to live your life. Do this. Don't do that. Follow these rules.\n\nYet, when you do try to follow them, they do not work. That is because\u00a0a one-size-fits-all formula never works.\n\nIn Core Castaneda, you will master ancient tools, passed\u00a0down through generations of shamans to help YOU\u00a0design and live YOUR\u00a0extraordinary life!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCORE CASTANEDA: Los Angeles\n\nA Powerful, Practical 3 day Workshop to help you expand past the obstacles keeping you from the Life of Your Dreams

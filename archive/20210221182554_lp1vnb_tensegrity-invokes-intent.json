That it invokes *intent*.\n\nThe energetic one is simple. It's just as Zuleica said in Eagle's Gift.\n\nYou can draw the colors you find in darkness by sucking them in.  Or by other methods.\n\nThis is why Tensegrity is said to \"redeploy\" energy. It moves it from the outside of our luminous cocoon, which is a circle around you as far as you can strain to reach with your arms and legs.  These days I've heard it's more like a blob than an egg. Humans have gotten droopy with old age.\n\nThe colors appear all around you in darkroom gazing, and Carlos even taunted us with this part of a long form where you jump up into the air to grab some light on the \"periphery\", and place it closer to center.  Just in case you wonder where all this nonsense about \"scooping colors\" came from. I got that question around a year ago in this subreddit, and had to find this tensegrity video to explain where it comes from.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\nIt's at 5 minutes, 22 seconds, but that link should go there by itself unless you have a weird browser.\n\nI like to return to that when explaining tensegrity, because Carlos wanted it that way.\n\nStanding not 3 feet away from me on my right, with no one else in between, he started a funny pantomime of a man greedy for purple blobs of light, searching above his head.  His eyes lit up when he found one, and despite being 72 years old he jumped up into the air impressively high,  grabbed one and placed it on his stomach. He had the satisfied look of a guy who just ate the $1.50 ham steak breakfast in a second rate Vegas hotel restaurant.\n\nExcept, Carlos preferred steak and eggs.\n\nIf you engage in darkroom gazing, don't neglect scooping colors onto your body.  It has a delayed effect, and brings out the double.  Assuming of course, they are visible to you. It won't do you much good, if you are merely pretending.\n\nThe double doesn't just come out and stand there, scaring the hell out of you with his face not visible.\n\nThey do that.  But it's not all they do.\n\nIf you have them interested while in the form where you cannot see them, they can reach their arm out to help you, when you are playing with the colors.\n\nBut in daylight, you can't yet see what the Tensegrity does.\n\nAnd so the part about it redeploying energy is only vague.\n\nPeople report the same kind of \"high\" you get doing yoga.  That's one of the results people have not missed.\n\nOr they say, \"It gives you energy!\"  \n\nThat's why Cholita does it. And has for the 23 years since Carlos died.\n\nBut so does coffee give you energy.\n\nAnd Hey!  Is that why you got excited when you read the books!?!?\n\nBecause it'll give you some exercise high?\n\nNo. It isn't enough.  Your tensegrity should allow you to scoop your hand near the wall and open up a fully visible curtain, revealing another world behind it.\n\nReally. No kidding.  Eyes open, fully awake, no drugs.\n\nLet's face it.  You aren't going to learn sorcery using Tensegrity and recap alone.\n\nJust look around.  Don't be like the lemming at the end of the line, with tens of thousands already having fallen off the cliff, and you're smiling at your buddies while talking about the \"path with heart\".\n\nOf course, lemmings don't actually do that. Even they aren't stupid enough to keep following the same failed path after thousands perished on it.\n\nToo bad workshop participants haven't noticed the past of total failure.\n\nMy thinking on this was, you simply need to look for \"second attention manifestations\" while forcing silence, doing the Tensegrity.\n\nI did a post on that.  And while it's true, it's not the whole explanation.\n\nI thought that was how Tensegrity could be made to work, because I did that at the workshop after Carlos died and saw a \"great band of emanations\" floating above my head.  Fully visible, and the room only had subdued lighting.\n\nBut now I think, I missed another important reason that worked.\n\nCarlos had just died. But we were still at it, working hard.\n\nIt was a gift from intent!  A little help, because it was obvious we were trying, despite the recent loss.\n\nIntent rewards effort, when certain rules are followed.\n\nAnd so Tensegrity invokes intent, when done with the right spirit.\n\nI use that in the darkroom to bring out my inorganic beings on a bad night.\n\nEach \"helped\" me design a specific long form, to summon them.\n\nHow they help is another story, but when I do those forms I get either Fancy or Mystery, and they're specific to the form I use.\n\nFor a while, I thought it was in the form.  In the specific moves.\n\nBut then, I remember how \"Little Smoke\" used to get summoned.\n\nOnce  just over a campfire, because Carlos pointed her out swooping like a moth.\n\nLittle Smoke likes the form of a moth. Maybe she even appears on a book cover or two?\n\nSpeaking of which, Fancy likes to appear as a gnat.\n\nCarlos got a nice moth.  I got a gnat.\n\nBut at least she's a chubby gnat.\n\nLittle Smoke was also summoned once in private classes, when Carlos released them to help us.  He simply mentioned them, and one swooped from the stop of the water cooler, to the left side of the room near the floor.\n\nAfterwards Carlos said, \"That was them!\"\n\nThe water cooler burped.  He said, \"See!\"\n\nThey like water.  Don't ask me why.  Imagine taking a nice hot shower on a cold morning, after playing with your inorganic being all night long.   And the shower droplets are going sideways! Some are as big as a gum ball.\n\nThat's them!\n\nAnother time, Little Smoke appeared as a talking coyote to help Carlos \"stop the world\".\n\nThey'll do that for you too!  \n\nThat is, if you REALLY stop the world, and don't make up a story about something else being the same.\n\nA common practice I'm afraid. People fixate on the \"bad ass\" things from the books, and their imaginations run wild.\n\nStopping the world is not like that. If you have even the slightest doubt, you did NOT stop the world.\n\nYou'll notice, trust me!\n\nAnd there was also the tedious ritual of preparing the smoking mixture, which summoned Little Smoke.  The *intent* of the ritual, led to an inorganic being.\n\nA way to summon intent which took over a  year!\n\nAll methods work.\n\nAnd the tensegrity is probably best done thinking that it invokes the *intent* of shifting the assemblage point.\n\nHere's an inspirational quote on that topic, but keep in mind, \"The spirit\" is *intent*.\n\nAnd that's all I'm saying here.   In this post. Don't be part of a morbid and ignorant audience of lovers of the unknown.  Learn to move your assemblage point though educated discipline, so you can reach silent knowledge.  That's where the  fun stuff happens!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan asked the old nagual what exactly the nagual Julian was doing to him. His question sounded more mature and intelligent than what he really meant. The nagual Elias answered it in terms totally unintelligible to don Juan at that time. He said that the nagual Julian was coaching don Juan, enticing his assemblage point to the position of reason, so he could be a thinker rather than merely part of an unsophisticated but emotionally charged audience that loved the orderly works of reason. At the same time, the nagual was coaching don Juan to be a true abstract sorcerer instead of merely part of a morbid and ignorant audience of lovers of the unknown.\n\nThe nagual Elias assured don Juan that only a human being who was a paragon of reason could move his assemblage point easily and be a paragon of silent knowledge. He said that only those who were squarely in either position could see the other position clearly, and that that had been the way the age of reason came to being. The position of reason was clearly seen from the position of silent knowledge.\n\nThe old nagual told don Juan that the one-way bridge from silent knowledge to reason was called \"concern.\" That is, the concern that true men of silent knowledge had about the source of what they knew. And the other one-way bridge, from reason to silent knowledge, was called \"pure understanding.\" That is, the recognition that told the man of reason that reason was only one island in an endless sea of islands.\n\nThe nagual added that a human being who had both one-way bridges working was a sorcerer in direct contact with the spirit, the vital force that made both positions possible. He pointed out to don Juan that everything the nagual Julian had done that day at the river had been a show, not for a human audience, but for the spirit, the force that was watching him. He pranced and frolicked with abandon and entertained everybody, especially the power he was addressing.\n\nDon Juan said that the nagual Elias assured him that the spirit only listened when the speaker speaks in gestures. And gestures do not mean signs or body movements, but acts of true abandon, acts of largesse, of humor. As a gesture for the spirit, sorcerers bring out the best of themselves and silently offer it to the abstract.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tensegrity Invokes Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"sucm03hihvi61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sucm03hihvi61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08c3f7a527ec7354131e69ef33cc57700b39495b"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sucm03hihvi61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d58bc2e55fcd6f82cd305a3a0682fb739f99d5a4"}, {"y": 214, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sucm03hihvi61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1d10fb633e8f19fb8a47b481ca57f4645139a8f"}, {"y": 428, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sucm03hihvi61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94107a2f3b2abfdc52e9945123012c8d7e121b81"}, {"y": 643, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sucm03hihvi61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca37a2f4cbbf8bcad871e2701bac83d862412892"}, {"y": 723, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sucm03hihvi61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff76f51dbe377b71664fe7cde2466451997d0e23"}], "s": {"y": 1206, "x": 1800, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sucm03hihvi61.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b98851ace73d731e39df1a24d45274aa3bd1ed39"}, "id": "sucm03hihvi61"}}, "name": "t3_lp1vnb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 20, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"267\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=322&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 267, "scrolling": false, "height": 200}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "3 Times Unbending Intent Long Form", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"267\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=322&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 267, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "sheeehan111", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pt7n2273_PU/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/sheeehan111"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"267\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=322&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 267, "scrolling": false, "media_domain_url": "https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/lp1vnb", "height": 200}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/INtYMK8sGjFWdFwtFj2QrKx-aXMflAj-55utsQdmY1k.jpg", "edited": 1613932297.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1613928354.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sucm03hihvi61.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b98851ace73d731e39df1a24d45274aa3bd1ed39\"&gt;Tensegrity and Recapitulation just aren&amp;#39;t going to get you  where you want to go!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to look at Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we tend to ignore the most powerful one.

He pointed out to don Juan that everything the nagual Julian had done that day at the river had been a show, not for a human audience, but for the spirit, the force that was watching him. He pranced and frolicked with abandon and entertained everybody, especially the power he was addressing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said that the nagual Elias assured him that the spirit only listened when the speaker speaks in gestures. And gestures do not mean signs or body movements, but acts of true abandon, acts of largesse, of humor. As a gesture for the spirit, sorcerers bring out the best of themselves and silently offer it to the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f79edeb57c35c261b9f0892086809d0ee7d2856b", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2562f4e90cb8b9b1343bfb633d0d54e36b73a5cb", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69d46aa151f94619fef8df683f98d420184d0684", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb58bd13fee1b5277d80dc70a957edf8269aeb4", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "_3SLIMHWFLwTypvnuOaJUYPqANWj5dR5MQLkUtw_PDI"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "lp1vnb", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 17, "send_replies": true, "media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "3 Times Unbending Intent Long Form", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"267\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=322&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 267, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "sheeehan111", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pt7n2273_PU/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/sheeehan111"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lp1vnb/tensegrity_invokes_intent/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/lp1vnb/tensegrity_invokes_intent/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1613928354.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "go9dcp4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "princejask", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_go9av7n", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_7zv7ysyk", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thank you.

You&amp;#39;re right at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a long way to go, to the star on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only silence can get you there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you need an &amp;quot;honesty checker&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And being able to scoop the things you see up into your hand, and deposit them on your torso, is a good start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll need more silence to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long can you go, without a single word popping into your mind?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t tell me minutes, or else there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do to help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer should be in seconds, and  unlikely more than 10.  3 is typical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But give me the honest answer.  Not one word!  Not even a &amp;quot;But...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you believe is Phantasmagorical?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not what you see!  At least, not once you start playing with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When one of them comes down from the ceiling and chases you around the room,  you&amp;#39;ll realize it&amp;#39;s not phantasmagorical!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And do yourself a favor upfront.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No fear.  None.  Anything you feel that you believe is fear, is actually a movement of that assemblage point, along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just feels like fear at first, because that&amp;#39;s the only way to move it, that we are familiar with, when we start out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why don Juan used to scare Carlos with shouts and such.  To get it started moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Embarrassment works too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_lp1vnb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lp1vnb/tensegrity_invokes_intent/gp3e90t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1614466766.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gp3b26h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SaltineCrackers", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1614465664.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_lp1vnb", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4qf6w", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "These colors...

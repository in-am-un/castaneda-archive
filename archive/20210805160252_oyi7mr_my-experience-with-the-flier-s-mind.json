what??? Is anyone going to believe this?  Has he lost it?\"\n\nBut I suppose if you came along after he was dead, and that's all you ever heard at workshops, you might have added it to your internal dialogue.\n\nPeople love to \"warn\" others, in lieu of having actual sorcery knowledge.\n\nI get attacked by it often.  \"The warner\" types.\n\n\"Inorganic beings are dangerous, you shouldn't be doing that!\"\n\nOr,\n\n\"We're supposed to be impeccable warriors. Magic is bad, you'll go astray like the old seers.\"\n\nOnce you've been \"warned\" a few times, you lose some respect for people who do that because you associate it with other bad things they do openly.\n\nLikely it's a sign of complete lack of sorcery knowledge.\n\nIt's as bad as someone who goes on about how great the Buddha was, while pretending to be interested in sorcery.\n\nThe Buddha was delusional!  And his magic was rather basic.  Except the fabricated parts added later by his organization.\n\nSomeone who can talk to Reni asked her about the fliers.\n\nShe's not exactly going to admit, \"Yes, we were lying all these years.\"\n\nInstead she only said they aren't emphasizing fliers at workshops anymore.\n\nEven Reni knows he made them up! She was standing in the back to his right, when he did.\n\nI should have watched her face more closely.\n\nI was too busy looking behind me, to see the other 50 people there and how they felt about it.\n\nNo one believed it.  Some looked so worried, I got the impression they thought it was, \"time to leave the cult\".\n\nThen later Carlos told Amy it was just a metaphor, and no one else was intelligent enough to get it.\n\nHe also used to do imitations of them licking someone's toes, which included a little frown when they hit some toe jam.  He even chewed, as if the energy licked up was a little too meaty to dissolve. Or they'd sucked up  a pubic hair by accident.\n\nAlways grinning like he was pulling a prank.

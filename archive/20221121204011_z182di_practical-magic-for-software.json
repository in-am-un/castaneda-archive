Here's a reminder.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puebez48rc1a1.jpg?width=332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d8172168f226a2b36eb521bc4e903c281275bfe\n\nSee how warm and fuzzy she is?\n\nIt's nearly \"Studio Ghibli\".\n\nBy the way, if you watch \"Howl's Moving Castle\" I can teach you to do everything from that cartoon, except put curses on people that make them old.\n\nBut Cholita could figure that one out.\n\nIt's a bit like watching Star Wars.\n\nYou think they have some Jedi magic that's not accurate, if they intended to copy our sorcery.\n\nBut then you \"realize how to do that\".\n\nSame for something as crazy as Japanese fantasy magic.\n\nYes.  You can do ALL of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Not as hard to do as you think!](https://preview.redd.it/z980xz5byc1a1.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad7760ed74c3bbe38dd78fd0a68dcf8b46eccb32)\n\nBut it would take a thousand years of potential sorcerers of the kind they have in that cartoon, to pull it off.\n\nI'm just saying, if you make it to the end of the J curve, you'll realize that's all \"doable\".\n\nNot that you would.\n\nMight be nice to fly around like Howl though, in a battle with the fliers perhaps.\n\nSo here's an example of practical magic that's more \"down to earth\".\n\nI was having trouble making Little Smoke's hoodie.\n\nI had little smoke in 3D form.\n\nPretty good now!  Needs some adjustment to her \"shine\" and such. And some \"metallic\" texture paint on the blue dots on her wings.\n\nBut otherwise anyone who read the books over and over and saw that would say, \"Hey!!!  isn't that...\"\n\nYes, she is.\n\nAnd don't doubt that's \"Little Smoke\".\n\nI know you shroom hopefuls love to think that Little Smoke is the smoking mixture.\n\nBut in fact, it's just an insect.  That moth.\n\nI had her living in my home a while.\n\nAnd in moth form she'd fly at my left shoulder during darkroom practice, tap me with enough force to push me forward on the bed, and I'd fall into the \"control room\" of reality.\n\nI would \"stop the world\" with her help. Be face to face with the raw emanations themselves.\n\nBut she also does talking coyotes that help people \"stop the world\", and even 4 inch tall ghost looking fairies with a slight blue tint to them who invent darkroom techniques for you.\n\nNot to mention little balls of golf ball sized smoke, flying around after Cholita. Probably why don Juan called her, \"Little Smoke\".\n\nCholita could command that ball with her eyes, and make it move solid objects.\n\nIt's a trick of course, but when the little objects move just because Cholita looked at them, it's hard to care \"who\" really moved the dish.\n\nIt was a moth!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i06tv9ikxc1a1.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ccdcb5e4116b75e9c3916b5b9a904ad47be4bfb\n\nSo yesterday I was frustrated with my own \"hair\", which you see as the reddish part on her head.\n\nAnd for a good half hour this morning I got a lecture from silent knowledge, on what I'd done wrong.\n\nBut I was in sleeping waking dreaming. That's a dream you go into with silence, and so don Juan said those are always \"real\".\n\nAs opposed to you are pretending to do 4 gates dreaming, and look for anything to misrepresent, so you can brag to your friends.\n\nThe real thing is... Real.\n\nExcept good luck \"bringing it back\" to this level of reality.\n\nAll I got was the gist of what my mistake had been, and a few actual \"keystrokes\" to fix it.\n\nSo the red \"hoodie\" now has the yellow one as it's basis.\n\nAnd far more \"triangles\" than I could manage to build by hand.\n\nIt'll be easy to delete the ones that don't match the red version, and tug on a few corners to get the final match to the picture on the cover.\n\nThere's one example of \"practical magic' using Silent Knowledge.\n\nAnd why Carlos suggested we become \"Readers of Infinity\".\n\nSo that even in your job when you need to know something, you can glance down at  your palm and read the answer right here.\n\nI saw Carlos do that many times.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false,

I believe going for dim sum was the reward for the &amp;quot;big success&amp;quot; of managing to deposit a check in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was too crazy to deposit it inside the bank, waiting through the line 3 times,  and too paranoid to do it at the ATM where people might be spying on her so they could steal the money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, if Cholita wanted money she only had to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that check meant more to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way for her to plan a trick like a moving dim sum plate, which in fact is likely impossible anyway due to the smoothness of the movement, and the fact that I was watching her the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can certainly show people  the after effects of an inorganic being!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But unless you scare the shit out of  them first, their assemblage points will be so locked in place at the blue line on that J curve that they will imply refuse to see Little Smoke herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if they do,  Little Smoke will lash out at them like a demon about to bite their head off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7v9vallfqy1a1.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9d80047bd4273bb980f18d4211335b4a4940f8ca\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7v9vallfqy1a1.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9d80047bd4273bb980f18d4211335b4a4940f8ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_z182di", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/z182di/practical_magic_for_software/ixmj5cs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1669306010.0, "media_metadata": {"7v9vallfqy1a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7v9vallfqy1a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0ab81ecfc458a664f522b7b5f7baba0ff5da269"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7v9vallfqy1a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6734ad373aececd19cfe2913ea2ffa99d4fde089"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7v9vallfqy1a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feb2bbce785c48cdc29962fe8e307b713c48f14f"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7v9vallfqy1a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ead9ca940cc6b8788d7f048e996f02b6f3b25083"}], "s": {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7v9vallfqy1a1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d80047bd4273bb980f18d4211335b4a4940f8ca"}, "id": "7v9vallfqy1a1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ixjxj2e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_z182di", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/z182di/practical_magic_for_software/ixjxj2e/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_ixjxj2e", "created": 1669248894.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1669248894.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]

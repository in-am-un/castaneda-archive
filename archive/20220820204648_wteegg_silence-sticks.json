He even had us bring them, and sit using them a while.\n\nBut it was hopeless to get anyone to work like that at home on a consistent basis.\n\nThe four foot wooden dowels sold at hardware stores are nice because you get 2 chances.  \n\nMine was 22 inches, so if later I wished it was a different size the remainder can be use to correct for mistakes.\n\nThe variety you make doesn't matter. The main thing is to lean forward, putting the emanations at the top of your luminous shell closer to the ones at the ankles, so the energy from below \"mixes\" with above.\n\nThe forehead rests on the pad as you force silence.\n\nThe angle of the head is ideal in case you drip blood from your nose, because of the intense effort you make.\n\nDon't think you won't!   People take that as me joking, but it's no joke.\n\nIf you're thinking it's horrible to force silence but there's still no bloody nose, then you aren't trying hard enough.\n\nBut the rewards are equally as intense!\n\nSo here's some advanced information:\n\nStep 1  Force out words, see puffs in darkness. Those are pieces of your energy body. REAL things.  If you don't do any tensegrity, it's unlikely any puffs will come visit you.  But you could also see an inorganic being manifestation. Those are also REAL.  Don't fall into thinking we're liking at imaginary things.  \n\nStep 2 Realize you didn't really force out words, but rather cut yourself a break.  So in an effort to actually get silent, you stop fantasizing all the time. And you gain access to shapeshifting.\n\nStep 3  Realize you were fooling yourself all along, and your mind is FAR from silent.  You endeavor to stretch that crummy \"2 minutes\" you though you had done, to all night.  Suddenly the floor and walls become visible with alien landscapes.\n\nStep 4  Realize that although it seems impossible, you were still ranting away in your mind.  You've NEVER been silent, not even for 5 seconds.  So you concentrate on something else, to remove the last traces of words and fantasies.  Tensegrity \"flow\" works.  While exploiting that on a daily basis, you find one night that by accident you are absolutely silent.  It's like being down at the bottom of a canyon, looking up at the world above on the cliff.  Now you're finally gotten a taste of silence.   It is in fact \"a thing\".  And you are no longer in your darkroom.  You're on an alien planet.\n\nStep 5  Realize that even if you are silent, you are still \"you\".  And \"you\" is imaginary.  So why are you still like that?  You try \"dropping rationality\", and find that you now skip from reality to reality, just by allowing a single thing to remain in your mind.  But it can only be ONE thing, even if the one thing is \"longer\" than a few inches.\n\nAs you continue, you start to access \"abstract realms\".  They seem perfectly fine while you are living in them, as a glow of yellow on a weird bent metal stick spinning through a river of shiny rocks and blobs of living matter.\n\nBut when you return, you can't describe any of it. That's the shock of the abstract. It's fine while you are there, but when you return to being \"you\", it can't be described at all.\n\nSilence sticks can get quite elaborate.  Jadey has one with \"feet\" on it, and probably better padding on top.\n\nIf you want a \"deluxe\" stick, try a wooden Escrima club.  They have to make those \"pretty\" to sell them, and they're made out of some incredibly strong wood.\n\nQuite a bit thicker than the pole you see here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Silence Sticks", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"hjgvv7wqwwi91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hjgvv7wqwwi91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82475d8dca7b032a401aa834fcbcddd8988169a9"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hjgvv7wqwwi91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13a3257a101381794e0c13300ef5c773b2dd968f"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hjgvv7wqwwi91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13297ba4dc741dcd8634d97301ff05aa3bf67d63"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hjgvv7wqwwi91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f484b650a4a050efc7ef3ad729bb9e6ccf170f19"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hjgvv7wqwwi91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41cdfce15045be7a169a953c8ecba606a8fac17b"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hjgvv7wqwwi91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=770e76b8f86ef54ef5576f80edb0a6f11132bf88"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hjgvv7wqwwi91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80b0fbcc5c9c5c94c5592c056146a0e74c087a88"}, "id": "hjgvv7wqwwi91"}}, "name": "t3_wteegg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kE52ey6FHSq5nKWZWmnbusWZ2sjhYvI073txMl2DEsY.jpg", "edited": 1661022676.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661021208.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hjgvv7wqwwi91.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80b0fbcc5c9c5c94c5592c056146a0e74c087a88\"&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t explain the pics, those are all from past posts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how to make one of those famous &amp;quot;Silence sticks&amp;quot; Carlos taught us to make in private classes.

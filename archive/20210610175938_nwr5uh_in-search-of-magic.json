There&amp;#39;s a left over high, but it&amp;#39;s not hallucinogenic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Role?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one who relies on them has ever learned real sorcery that I&amp;#39;m aware of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And most became horribly bad players, attacking anyone around them who didn&amp;#39;t agree they were already sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ones who seemed sober enough to go out in public, and told of their experiences, always had chaotic reports which were questionable, as if they might be making it up or using the drugs again and don&amp;#39;t want to admit it. Or counting ordinary dreams as sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with power plants is they cause your assemblage point to move down sideways.  The same way an illness pushes it sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The angle creates a groove, and you get stuck when you try to drop the assemblage point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You never make it past the red line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same that happened to Julian. He played around too much at the bottom of the J curve, and when it was time to move the assemblage point rapidly across the whole thing, he couldn&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose if someone couldn&amp;#39;t find colors at all in the dark room, they could use shrooms once.  But make it a powerful trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then don&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contradictory information:  La Gorda said they still have the pipe and the smoking mixture, and were going to use it later for an &amp;quot;unimaginable boost&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s something weird in a lot of what La Gorda said in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, she seems to be mistaken about what caused Carlos to have so much  success with power plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed inorganic beings, not the power plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those just moved his assemblage point to where his allies could help him out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after all that I said, if someone could figure out how to give people a darkroom boost that didn&amp;#39;t produce permanent damage, that would be wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#39;t a moral issue, it&amp;#39;s just practical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But THC isn&amp;#39;t going to do that.

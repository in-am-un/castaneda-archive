Or maybe, move your assemblage points.  And this story is absolute nonsense.   Yet stuff like this happens to me anytime I put in some effort, after 50 years of practicing Carlos\u2019 techniques.\n\nUsually I\u2019d just forget it, but this one seemed relevant to my last posts.  And there\u2019s a hint in here, that people who are very familiar with Carlos\u2019 books might pick up.  It\u2019s a very optimistic hint.   Carlos even seems to have taunted us with it in, \u201cThe Wheel of Time\u201d.\n\nStill, if you believe a word of it, you\u2019re crazier than Carlos was.   And if you do tend to believe in stuff like this, consider that he wrote how some dreaming worlds are only accessible to us from silence.  And some worlds are real enough that you can live and die in them.  Also, according to crazy Carlos, you can have memories that are buried and impossible to fit into linear time, unless your assemblage point moves back to the right location.\n\nI was playing with the lights you can see in the dark last night.  For a while I\u2019d been forming hypnogogic images of various beings, still trying to get them to take the form I wanted.  I got a few to form Disney like smiling Fairies I could hold in my hand, but I also got some bizarre creatures which appeared to be made out of pieces of wood, rock, straw, and sea shells.  Some looked quite angry.\n\nThey seem to have rebelled lately and the faces and forms they\u2019ve taken are a little disturbing.\n\nWorse, if you summon hypnogogic images over and over, the allies can\u2019t be far behind.  You\u2019ve brought dreaming into the waking world.   Keeping the beings thus formed on the other side of a window isn\u2019t their forte.  They like to interact.\n\nThe day before I\u2019d been in the grocery store and watched a box of Kleenex slide very slowly off another one, at the checkout counter. There was with no apparent reason. The box that moved was perfectly flat and level on top of the other.   It took 4 seconds to fall off.  I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. The person I was with said jokingly, \u201cYou have a Poltergeist?\u201d\n\nIn the parking lot, a black spot darted angrily from behind me to the front, then zoomed to the left.   It was trying to alter my path.  The speed and change of direction were impossible for an organic creature.\n\nThe images forming in the darkness last night became quite disturbing.  I feared one might try to press through the colored light and into the real world.  Out of precaution, I switched from forming images in purple clouds, to letting the cloud of color envelop me.  Zuleica had said it was entry to the second attention.\n\nI knew that Zuleica had taught this to Carlos in heightened awareness, but I figured that with enough silence, and the second attention activated, that ought to be good enough.  I was hunting for the sensations you can find near your stomach, about a foot or two out, and to the right about 4 inches.  Moving your arm in those sensations causes a luminous shell of sorts to form.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s \u201cthe\u201d luminous shell. It\u2019s just a shell, made out of luminous fibers.  Just the way that the hypnogogic floating heads are beings without an organic body, so they are \u201cinorganic beings\u201d. It\u2019s all semantics, but really fun when you get to perceive it.\n\nI achieved a very deep level of silence, while trying to produce the sensation that the purple cloud had enveloped me.  The level of silence was surprising, yet somehow familiar.  It was utterly peaceful, and my breathing became automatic. Only my stomach moved in and out.  The slight case of asthma I have from all the rain and pollen lately, completely vanished.\n\nAfter a minute or two of silence and automatic breathing, I felt a jolt. It was like the shock from someone putting an ice cube on your naked shoulder, when you didn\u2019t expect it.  But minus the touch and the cold.\n\nI had a flash of myself, decades younger.  I could feel what I felt then.  I\u2019d forgotten that feeling. I was exuding unwarranted optimism.\n\nI realized that my assemblage point had shifted.   The assemblage point is not a vague concept. It\u2019s something you can experience yourself, in total clarity.\n\nI was in a train station at the border with Mexico.  The paint on the building was a mid-yellow with rust or brown colored highlights.  I could see the shape of the details of the building both inside and out, and it was very familiar.\n\nThe act of looking around caused my assemblage point to shift back, and it all seemed like nonsense.   I\u2019ve never been to a train station at the Mexican border.   I didn\u2019t know if one even existed.\n\nI became silent again, and I could see one of the offices in the station. It gave me a feeling of happiness.  I remembered talking to someone there, someone who shared my crazy goals.\n\nI flashed forward to a place where people were gathered, in a large white room.  I knew we were surrounded by more landscaping than buildings. In some ways, it reminded me of the design of Carlos\u2019 compound in Los Angeles. It has a large open area in the center, with smaller structures surrounding it.  The open area in the middle has a large wooden layout for serving food, with drawers made entirely out of expensive looking wood and filled with shiny, heavy forks and spoons.  You could have some huge parties there.  Or even hold theater with an audience.\n\nBut this compound was far away from there. And far away from the train station too.\n\nA young man was demonstrating how to flick your fingers, and produce sparks in the air.  I\u2019d seen those colored sparks at night, while looking for the clouds of color. They come in blue, white, and red.  Seeing them is a common experience for people who learn to see the larger puffs of color, and it\u2019s likely to be the first light you see, which becomes strongly directional.  They even stick to things for a while so that you have to get up and go see what that really is. Nothing, that\u2019s what. It\u2019ll be gone when you get there.\n\nI tried to flick my fingers.  I\u2019d forgotten about that technique.  Carlos taught it to us a long time ago. I\u2019d never paid much attention to it.\n\nAn older man laughed quietly when he saw my attempt, and the younger man felt sorry for me. He corrected the position of my hand and showed me, 2 fingers and your thumb come together tightly, then snap themselves apart. It has to produce a pop of sorts.  I tried it again, and a host of sparks flew from my fingers.  They landed on a virtual flat surface, about 3 feet away from me.\n\nI realized, I know these people!   The shock snapped me out of it, and I found myself sitting up on the bed, eyes wide open, and awake.  My head had fallen down to my chest, and my neck was a little sore.\n\nEdited for mistakes, formatting, and to add some details.

Unfortunately, dreamer types can be low on self-control.\n\nThe women in Carlos\u2019 group mostly came from another situation.  One I knew had a husband in a band, and he traveled with her to Los Angeles. She abandoned him, to go live with one of the women in Carlos's group.

There was even a high class call girl attending workshops.  I used to joke with one of the other men who also thought she was amazing, that we should save up our pennies until we could afford her.  But the rumor was you needed $3000 minimum.\n\nThe gossip was that she was seriously considering joining.  But she had very wealthy clients.   One of the gossiping tendency women told me, Carlos didn\u2019t have the kind of money you\u2019d need to keep her around.\n\nAt the time, I\u2019d created a digital camera.  There weren\u2019t any back then, if you can imagine.  I cooked up a plan with my friend who also fancied the call girl, to use digital cameras to make women visually available to men over the internet.   Seems silly now, since women largely made their own selves available, once they got hold of smart phones.  But at the time it was revolutionary,  and at least a little bit wicked.\n\nCarlos got wind of it.  In one class he was talking about how if you look at porn too much, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll escalate.  He liked that word, \u201cescalate\u201d, and used it a few more times in other contexts.  He spoke it like it was \u201ctasty\u201d in some way.   Escalate\u2026   \n\nCarlos was a master of the English language. I can only imagine how good he was with Spanish.\n\nBut the basic idea was, it has to be more and more to satisfy you.   He stopped moving his head to look at the entire audience at one point, and looked directly into my eyes.  He said, \u201cEventually you\u2019ll be looking at pictures of women being choked. \u201c He blinked his eyes for emphasis.\n\nApparently, he didn\u2019t approve of exploiting women, but even so he picked up quite a few strays.   You can even see people pleading on the internet, trying to find a family member who joined with Carlos and is still missing to this day.  \n\nPeople who joined up were encouraged to break contact with all people they knew. I did that at age 18.  I moved away, and didn\u2019t contact anyone I knew for 17 years.   Then one day in class Carlos looked at me and said, \u201cIt\u2019s ok to go back to your family now.\u201d\n\nOne woman had a 10 to 12 year old daughter.  There were rumors about that in class.  Was the woman asked to abandoned her family, including the daughter?   I\u2019m kind of sketchy on the details, since I only got gossip.  But the gossip itself is the subject of this story. Not the actual details.\n\nShe brought the daughter to class one day.   The theory going around was, this was an attempt to keep them together. \n\nCarlos introduced her, and the topic of whether you could train a child to be a sorcerer while their perception was still relatively unbound, came up.  I can't remember whether Carlos gave a full lecture on it, but it was obvious he'd talked to some of the inner circle about it, and so I got the side chatter.\n\nShe did tensegrity with us. \n\nBut the disturbing thing was, how Carlos dealt with women in general.  At this point I'm starting to see, that's how don Juan\u2019s lineage did also.  If you read the Eagle's gift, it seems as if there\u2019s implied group nakedness fairly often.  Women get tangled up fussing over each other, men lift naked people and put them where they want.  Apparently, sorcerers are past some social considerations.\n\nAs for the daughter, I don\u2019t believe she practiced with us more than once, although it was a long time ago. She might have been hiding out in the corner with her mother another time.  I have fairly weak memories of seeing her with her mother, at a workshop.\n\nThe dark part was how some of the women reacted.  They openly worried Carlos might fully incorporate her into whatever lifestyle the other women had joined into.  One of the women asked me, \u201cDo you think he\u2019d do that?\u201d\n\nShe didn't say, \"do that\".  She said something else.   \n\nI said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d  But in fact, I hadn\u2019t a clue.\n\nEdited for formatting.

But at the time it was revolutionary,  and at least a little bit wicked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos got wind of it.  In one class he was talking about how if you look at porn too much, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll escalate.  He liked that word, \u201cescalate\u201d, and used it a few more times in other contexts.  He spoke it like it was \u201ctasty\u201d in some way.   Escalate\u2026   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was a master of the English language. I can only imagine how good he was with Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the basic idea was, it has to be more and more to satisfy you.   He stopped moving his head to look at the entire audience at one point, and looked directly into my eyes.  He said, \u201cEventually you\u2019ll be looking at pictures of women being choked. \u201c He blinked his eyes for emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, he didn\u2019t approve of exploiting women, but even so he picked up quite a few strays.   You can even see people pleading on the internet, trying to find a family member who joined with Carlos and is still missing to this day.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who joined up were encouraged to break contact with all people they knew. I did that at age 18.  I moved away, and didn\u2019t contact anyone I knew for 17 years.   Then one day in class Carlos looked at me and said, \u201cIt\u2019s ok to go back to your family now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One woman had a 10 to 12 year old daughter.  There were rumors about that in class.  Was the woman asked to abandoned her family, including the daughter?   I\u2019m kind of sketchy on the details, since I only got gossip.  But the gossip itself is the subject of this story. Not the actual details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She brought the daughter to class one day.   The theory going around was, this was an attempt to keep them together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos introduced her, and the topic of whether you could train a child to be a sorcerer while their perception was still relatively unbound, came up.  I can&amp;#39;t remember whether Carlos gave a full lecture on it, but it was obvious he&amp;#39;d talked to some of the inner circle about it, and so I got the side chatter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did tensegrity with us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the disturbing thing was, how Carlos dealt with women in general.  At this point I&amp;#39;m starting to see, that&amp;#39;s how don Juan\u2019s lineage did also.  If you read the Eagle&amp;#39;s gift, it seems as if there\u2019s implied group nakedness fairly often.  Women get tangled up fussing over each other, men lift naked people and put them where they want.  Apparently, sorcerers are past some social considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the daughter, I don\u2019t believe she practiced with us more than once, although it was a long time ago. She might have been hiding out in the corner with her mother another time.  I have fairly weak memories of seeing her with her mother, at a workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dark part was how some of the women reacted.  They openly worried Carlos might fully incorporate her into whatever lifestyle the other women had joined into.  One of the women asked me, \u201cDo you think he\u2019d do that?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t say, &amp;quot;do that&amp;quot;.  She said something else.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d  But in fact, I hadn\u2019t a clue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited for formatting.

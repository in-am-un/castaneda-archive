Insisting I ought to be very interested in it.\n\nWhen you hear something like that, you need to keep certain things in mind.\n\nIf you've been in here a while, it's not as hard.  You've seen men like that come and go many times, and also seen how their motives are eventually exposed.  You've come to realize the truth about magic.\n\n99% are willing to pretend it, if they can get the attention from groupies.  And money.\n\nConsider this:  A Chinese man in a traditional monk robe, doing \"Morning Chi Gung Exercises\" on YouTube.\n\nIf you've been honest and paying attention, you know that chi gung doesn't do anything.  It might be nice for old people, and that's the purpose in Mainland China.\n\nBut it moves a lot like our Tensegrity, and pretends that's doing something magical.\n\nBut if it were, where is anyone doing that?  Out of the vast numbers of chi gung practitioners.\n\nNowhere.\n\nSo that man, even if he looks authentic and kind, has never seen the results of what he's teaching.\n\nHe's willing to pretend his results, to get attention from other people.\n\nEven if he claims to be \"wise\".\n\nWould you do that?\n\nI sure hope not.\n\nSo back to the men running around the mountains.\n\nWhat you want to keep in mind is:\n\nSo what?\n\nAnd:\n\nHow can they be so talented it's not difficult for them?\n\nLet's take the \"so what\"?\n\nIt's a question to ask, to avoid \"glossing\".  Carlos covered the topic of glossing for months in private classes.  He tended to teach topically, as a flow of knowledge.\n\nAn interesting method, because it's how intent flows.  How the intelligence arising from the emanations notices the glow of a few, and makes it easier for that glow to spread into \"related\" emanations, so as to produce a new reality.\n\nWhat \"relates\" the emanations, is past usage.\n\nWhen you ask \"so what\",  you're trying to remove the glossing that makes you feel as if what you just heard has some meaning.  In the case of the men \"running around the mountains\", it's an appeal to the stories in the books of Carlos, where they \"ran around the mountains\".\n\nThese men are trying to pretend to be sorcerers, by getting off their butts and going hiking.\n\nAdmirable!\n\nBut it won't teach you sorcery.  So they won't be running around those mountains more than a few times before they realize nothing is happening.\n\nOddly, Carlos was very aware of this.  And took measures to reduce that kind of playing.\n\nWhy even \"run around the mountains\" at all?\n\nMostly, it was to get an Ally.  There's the old \"hot palm\" technique, there's hanging out in water holes looking for the mold of man.  There's a talking coyote.\n\nAnd I'm sure there's a lot more, including the times Carlos was chased by inorganic beings, while in the wilds.\n\nBut Carlos gave us an alternate path.  To get an ally.  A safe one, which we could all do from the comfort of our bed.\n\n\"The Art of Dreaming\".  It's actually a way to get an ally, so you can get the dark energy needed to move your assemblage point the way sorcerers do.\n\nAs a technique to bring out your double, it's totally lame.\n\nIf you want to bring out your double, just FORM it.  Go look at Jadey's new video of a tensegrity pass.\n\nOr at Affection for the energy body which she also has on her YouTube channel.\n\nTHOSE bring out the double.\n\nArt of Dreaming brings an Ally. It even explains how looking at your hands, then at objects, creates the sort of energy that compels the inorganic beings to send you a representative.\n\nThe other thing to consider so that you see past the glossing of \"men running around the mountains\", was how did they get so talented they don't struggle to learn?\n\nBut to understand that one, you have to succeed at darkroom.\n\nSo you fully realize how much work it takes.\n\nBut I do have an analogy.\n\nIf you get very good at darkroom and make the mistake of telling a friend, and once they stop exploding and getting excited and accept that maybe there's something different going on there, they'll likely, inevitably say, \"Then you need to prove this to the scientific world\".\n\nDespite the fact that the scientific world has never reacted well to anything new.\n\nAnd as Carlos said, \"No witch is interested in proving anything to anyone\".\n\nBoy can I attest to that! \n\nCholita knows  dark secrets, and won't even talk about them.\n\nThe attention she could get from others, is what everyone else seems to want first and foremost.\n\nBut she won't even speak about such things.\n\nIn the cases of witches, who are talented, that's possibly because the main thing they have to overcome is everyone telling them magic is a fraud, and witches are just pretending.\n\nThat's how witches have been brought under control, perhaps starting with the Jewish Prophets and their orders to kill all witches.  But now pervasive in society nearly everywhere.\n\nSo a witch weakens herself by exposing her doings to \"counter intent\".  To people who \"intend\" that magic is not real.\n\nTo the \"Dark Magicians\".\n\nMen have a different problem. It's so damned hard for them to learn real magic, that they can't afford any additional burdens.\n\nSuch as \"prove it\".\n\nAnd for what?  So you can go on a lecture tour the rest of your life, like the fake CIA remote viewing guy, where they conned the government by scribbling on paper and calling that remote viewing.\n\nHe made  a career out of that deception.  You can see him wisely explaining to the young ones, on YouTube.\n\nOr a better analogy.  A little kid climbs the impossible neighborhood mountain.\n\nAll the other kids don't believe it.\n\nSo they insist he has to \"prove it\".\n\nThey load him up with gear until he has a 50 pound backpack on his shoulders, and assign 3 \"monitors\" to go along.\n\nSo to prove he did what's nearly impossible for a small child he now has to repeat it with a 50 pound weight, and 3 critical kids following him along every step up the mountain.\n\nThat's the burden of men.  Due to lack of the same talent women have.\n\nThey can't afford to waste any energy at all.\n\nMaybe some super talented man will come along some day and \"prove it\"\", but I'm not so sure that wouldn't just result in his death.\n\nAccording to don Juan it would.\n\nSo to summarize, don't get taken in by \"implied magic\".  Ask for specifics.  Get the \"so what\".\n\nIt's never there if you look closely. Otherwise we'd all have heard about it.  Real magic is exciting and word would  spread fast.  Especially with the internet being available now.\n\nAnd always consider how very difficult it is, to actually learn sorcery.  Women have to fight the pressures to give up, and men simply have to work so hard, most humans aren't willing to put in that kind of effort.\n\nBut Carlos wanted us to succeed, even knowing from experience it would be extremely few out of his entire audience.\n\nSo he gave us at least 2 ways to get an ally.\n\nBecause in fact you must.\n\nHe didn't want us getting addicted to them, because that comes at a price.\n\nThe allies are tricksters.  They simply activate 2 of our own abilities, and take credit for it.\n\nThey mess with our natural ability to manufacture perfectly real looking phantoms.\n\nAnd they channel silent knowledge to us.  Earlier than we could do that ourselves.\n\nSo that you don't come to realize, you can in fact see anything you like during darkroom.\n\nIt just takes perfect silence and lack of self-pity.\n\nThat self-pity and grief fill our thoughts, so they have to go.  They always point one direction:  How to fix our insurmountable problems and get what we want.\n\nWhich can only be understood, up at the blue line on the J curve.\n\nWhen the assemblage point moves to the other side of the body, that blue line doesn't even make sense anymore.  And you're \"grief\" free.  To explore your actual abilities.\n\nThe ones hidden from you by blue line glossing.\n\nSo the other technique Carlos gave us to get an ally, is \"Stellar Hatch\".\n\nThat's a sun ally.\n\nIt doesn't come with the risks of the mountain / water hole type allies.  Who are said to want to kidnap the men.\n\nOf course, that whole story is ridiculous.  The Allies come from billions of light years away, projecting themselves using the same methods we do, to travel outside the galaxy.\n\nYour double can simply do that, if you transfer some logic and purpose to him, and then shrink your tonal away so that you can do the impossible.\n\nBut Stellar Hatch does indeed bring you an ally.\n\nNyei even teaches it as a technique, except that she seems to \"commune\" with the ally with her eyes closed.\n\nLike Maria Sabina.\n\nMyself, I like to see a solar corona burning a hole in my wooden floor.\n\nWe did \"hear of\" a third possibility to get an ally, but unfortunately the person \"teaching\" that didn't bother to tell us where it came from.\n\nAnd that person might be prone to make things up.\n\nWe're very lucky that neither Jadey nor Cholita, would make up magic to get money or attention.\n\nUnfortunately the same can't be said with any certainty, about everyone else Carlos put time into teaching.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Two Paths To Get An Ally", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 90, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"1kiuueded57b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 69, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=878679019bb95b2d0fd5830b0dd756c1c66563a3"}, {"y": 139, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc2000de9d8fd035caaa5176e0c9c2bf224a49a6"}, {"y": 206, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8981e7422f6880a942ac1a4de8146d5e6d6b4662"}, {"y": 412, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2c5539b7ffac1bbd45afd58c054201aa33f0852"}, {"y": 619, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee6797fd7d738636a7ed6d700395c8dca325df87"}, {"y": 696, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=338b03a59e6ed1b0c4913c29bad37d1530778bd1"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 1116, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb388b0cd07ee8b33850522fed026e728a1059e8"}, "id": "1kiuueded57b1"}}, "name": "t3_14e72fr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 37, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-5zlyx82_2GekW1EVVy-GzLXIh-rWm3RRQeQrVa-6x4.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1687255787.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=1116&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bb388b0cd07ee8b33850522fed026e728a1059e8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/1kiuueded57b1.png?width=1116&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bb388b0cd07ee8b33850522fed026e728a1059e8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had some guy in chat who claimed there were sorcerers &amp;quot;running around in the mountains&amp;quot; near me.

Her benefactor told her that when-ever she had finished her recapitulation, she would break the crate to symbolize that she no longer abided by the limitations of her person. \nShe said that stalkers use crates or earth coffins in order to seal themselves in while they are reliving, more than merely recollecting, every moment of their lives. \nThe reason why stalkers must recapitulate their lives in such a thorough manner is that the Eagle&amp;#39;s gift to man includes its willingness to accept a surrogate instead of genuine awareness- if such a surrogate be a perfect replica. Florinda explained that since awareness is the Eagle&amp;#39;s food, the Eagle can be satisfied with a perfect recapitulation in place of consciousness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_14e72fr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/14e72fr/two_paths_to_get_an_ally/jozgtn3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1687368024.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_14e72fr", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jp06tl2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jp01cv2", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "And don't forget, there's 3 of us in here who heard Carlos lecture two or three times a week, for years.\n\nHis \"private class\" students.

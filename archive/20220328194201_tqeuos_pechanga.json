So everyone made up whatever they wanted, and tried to use it to steal from fans of  his books.\n\nAnd they did!  It's obscene how dense the \"Castaneda copycat crime scene\" became.  Dozens holding their bag of stolen Castaneda fan money.  They were like thieves on the highway leading south from Los Angeles to the end of the Yaqui wars in Central Mexico.\n\nIt's good that places like Pechanga still exist, and you can visit there to learn a bit about our history.  It's 10,000 years old.\n\nEat your heart out, delusional Buddha.  \n\nBuddhism is NOT wise.  If you take a random wise saying and examine ALL of it,  you'll realize it's untrue, and only seems true because it appeals to greed.  \n\nMeanwhile, the real thing has always been in the Americas.  And while reading the books of Carlos Castaneda, you were reading about the cousins of the people who live at Pechanga.\n\nRuby Modesto, the first shaman I met at age 9, and likely the first Carlos ran into during his search for don  Juan,  used to say that men like don Juan were all over the valleys there.  The very ones you see in that picture.  But they were driven away by the incoming european populations.  \n\nFortunately, they left stuff buried under the dirt, everywhere you see in that picture.   Just never keep anything.  Always put it back.  An object from that period of time can transport a sorcerer back to there to relive an event, or pull things from that time period forward to our time.\n\nYes, it really works!  But  you have to be able to sustain Silent Knowledge.  Silent knowledge \"finds\" the events for you, and  then Silent Knowledge can transport you back there.  It can also help  you find objects buried under an inch of dirt, strewn across those valleys.  You'll perceive a \"sparkle\" as you pass over it.\n\nBut let me give you a useful tip. If you aren't literally surrounded by intense magic all the time, you can't pull off the \"sparkle on the ground\" trick.  Don't pretend your magic!  When you are able to do it, it will become obvious to you.  And you won't even be particularly interested, since there are 1 million more things you could do which are more interesting.\n\nAnd even better than buried artifacts are real sorcerers!  Long dead ones.\n\nIf you can manage to be silent enough to assemble other worlds , Pechanga is the place for you!  The intent of their old sorcerers still lingers there.  And in perfect silence you can pick it up and they'll return to the present to put on a show for you.\n\nJust don't worry. You can't be run over by \"spirit horses\". But even so, pick a nice large empty spot in the area next to the central bar so that if you want to run you still can.\n\nAnd don't bother the workers in the casino.  The indians from the reservation that used to be located right on that spot are too wealthy to take up a job there.  At best, you'll find a cousin who didn't get in on the money distribution from casino profits.  Better to go to local museums if you want to learn about the Luiseno.\n\nThe local indians don't like Castaneda followers, because they've made such horrible pests of themselves over the years.  If you find an indian down there who is receptive to outsiders, he's looking to con a gullible Castaneda follower.

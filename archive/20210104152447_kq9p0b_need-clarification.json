Just force yourself silent, and try to inject some \"activity\" into the light. Make it spin. Tell it a repetitious story.  \"Brush\" it with eye movements.  Speak sweetly to it.\n\nYou seeing animals probably means you have an inorganic being interested in you.\n\nUnless you smoke pot, in which case it's an after effect of the assemblage point being pushed sideways by the THC.\n\nYou can make use of this to do everything we do in darkroom gazing, but we have no one who's succeeded at that laying on the bed with eyes closed, so the path is not known.\n\nThere are many ways to learn sorcery. The only successful way we have in here, is darkroom gazing.  For now.\n\nAssuming you want, \"Holy Shit!!!\" results that is.  Of course you can use closed eyes to get small results.  Buddhists do that.\n\nBut try telling them you chased an angry witch through the solid bedroom wall last night, all the way down to Mexico, and they will become angry and accuse you of lying.  \n\nSo they don't really get anywhere interesting.\n\nThe problem with closed eyes, and especially laying down, is that you will fall asleep.\n\nEven if you don't for a while, and even if you succeed in getting into lucid dreaming, you'll eventually fall asleep, burying the entire thing in a cloud of doubt.\n\nBest (but harsh) advice I can give is, ditch the wife.  Get a 6 hour a day job.  Go to bed as soon as you get home, and wake up at night to practice darkroom gazing, at least 3 hours.\n\nSince that isn't possible, try to work out a relationship which isn't so controlling that you can't get up in the middle of the night, to go practice staring at demons in the dark.\n\nCholita and I have  that worked out.  She even helps out by slamming doors and objects, when I'm right about to accomplish something interesting.\n\nThe fright of the loud sound helps push me over the edge (move the assemblage point).\n\nAnd being a woman, she's a witch. So she visits me in the darkroom, in her dreaming double.\n\nYour wife can, most likely, also do that.  But without realizing it.  And probably very rarely.\n\nCholita is a special case. Her dreaming double likes to hang out where she is, instead of wandering around, lost in infinity. That's where most people's dreaming doubles are, most of the time.\n\nI suspect that's what interested Carlos,  about Cholita.

Just force yourself silent, and try to inject some &amp;quot;activity&amp;quot; into the light. Make it spin. Tell it a repetitious story.  &amp;quot;Brush&amp;quot; it with eye movements.  Speak sweetly to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You seeing animals probably means you have an inorganic being interested in you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you smoke pot, in which case it&amp;#39;s an after effect of the assemblage point being pushed sideways by the THC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can make use of this to do everything we do in darkroom gazing, but we have no one who&amp;#39;s succeeded at that laying on the bed with eyes closed, so the path is not known.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to learn sorcery. The only successful way we have in here, is darkroom gazing.  For now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming you want, &amp;quot;Holy Shit!!!&amp;quot; results that is.  Of course you can use closed eyes to get small results.  Buddhists do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But try telling them you chased an angry witch through the solid bedroom wall last night, all the way down to Mexico, and they will become angry and accuse you of lying.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they don&amp;#39;t really get anywhere interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with closed eyes, and especially laying down, is that you will fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;#39;t for a while, and even if you succeed in getting into lucid dreaming, you&amp;#39;ll eventually fall asleep, burying the entire thing in a cloud of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best (but harsh) advice I can give is, ditch the wife.  Get a 6 hour a day job.  Go to bed as soon as you get home, and wake up at night to practice darkroom gazing, at least 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since that isn&amp;#39;t possible, try to work out a relationship which isn&amp;#39;t so controlling that you can&amp;#39;t get up in the middle of the night, to go practice staring at demons in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita and I have  that worked out.  She even helps out by slamming doors and objects, when I&amp;#39;m right about to accomplish something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fright of the loud sound helps push me over the edge (move the assemblage point).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And being a woman, she&amp;#39;s a witch. So she visits me in the darkroom, in her dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your wife can, most likely, also do that.  But without realizing it.  And probably very rarely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is a special case. Her dreaming double likes to hang out where she is, instead of wandering around, lost in infinity. That&amp;#39;s where most people&amp;#39;s dreaming doubles are, most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that&amp;#39;s what interested Carlos,  about Cholita.  He saw that her dreaming double was available, making her a good partner for a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gave her to me he did!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null,

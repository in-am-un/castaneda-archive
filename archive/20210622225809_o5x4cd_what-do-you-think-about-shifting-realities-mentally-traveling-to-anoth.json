It&amp;#39;s tied down by obligations to other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I&amp;#39;ve learned to turn my dark bedroom into a dreaming copy.  I can still see the walls and furniture, dimly, but they can&amp;#39;t possibly be the real room because it&amp;#39;s absolutely pitch black dark in there. I sealed all light out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you gaze at the &amp;quot;phantom bedroom&amp;quot; you can watch for a color, associated with a cave dwelling spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fire demons it was, last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found the hue, gazed again at the details on the walls, and now I was looking at the inside of a cave made of hard rock.  Except the lighting was now normal. I was looking at actual rock, fully illuminated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In every nook and cranny of that cave, there was a bizarre demon head watching me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some old men, some strange aliens, some cooks, some barmaids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re crammed together in there, being of a &amp;quot;hive&amp;quot; type organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And their appearance is merely a projection.  We can&amp;#39;t fathom their actual look, so they come up with something we can handle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My spirit &amp;quot;Lily&amp;quot;, who introduced me to her friends in that cave, showed me how to make the cave/bedroom travel in space, so we could explore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, fully awake, eyes open, no drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to worry, &amp;quot;This can&amp;#39;t be possible! It&amp;#39;s crazy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be denied the experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that is the brainwashing given to us by our parents, so that we&amp;#39;ll ignore the monster in the closet and go back to bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trapping us in a life of self-pity and pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we can complete the reproduction cycle one more time, and die.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_o5x4cd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o5x4cd/what_do_you_think_about_shifting/h2s1gfn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1624462913.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1624462913.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h2tbieb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h2s0ck3", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Once you can travel into those other worlds, coming back into this one isn't so bad...if you know you can leave again whenever you want to.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h2tbieb", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you can travel into those other worlds, coming back into this one isn&amp;#39;t so bad...if you know you can leave again whenever you want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_o5x4cd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o5x4cd/what_do_you_think_about_shifting/h2tbieb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1624483274.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1624483274.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h6or4eb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "noneofyabusiness6", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h2s0ck3", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_detm42g3", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;but i'm sure you know there are --*finite* actual worlds \n\nWhat is your proof?

He told me the protector meant to give me a lesson; and to prove that he meant to give me a lesson and not to scare me away, he showed himself as a light twice.\n\nI said I still could not understand why Mescalito terrorized me if he had accepted me. I reminded don Juan that, according to his statements, to be accepted by Mescalito implied that his form was constant and did not shift from bliss to nightmare. Don Juan laughed at me again and said that if I would think about the question I had had in my heart when I talked to Mescalito, then I myself would understand the lesson.\n\nTo think about the question I had had in my \"heart\" was a difficult problem. I told don Juan I had had many things in mind. When I asked if I was on the right path, I meant: Do I have one foot in each of two worlds? Which world is the right one? What course should my life take?\n\nDon Juan listened to my explanations and concluded that I did not have a clear view of the world, and that the protector had given me a beautifully clear lesson.\n\nHe said, \"You think there are two worlds for you - two paths. But there is only one. The protector showed you this with unbelievable clarity. The only world available to you is the world of men, and that world you cannot choose to leave. You are a man! **The protector showed you the world of happiness where there is no difference between things because there is no one there to ask about the difference. But that is not the world of men. The protector shook you out of it and showed you how a man THINKS AND FIGHTS** *(my emphasis)***.  That  is the world of man! And to be a man is to be condemned to that world.** You have the vanity to believe you live in two worlds, but that is only your vanity. There is but one single world for us.

He told me the protector meant to give me a lesson; and to prove that he meant to give me a lesson and not to scare me away, he showed himself as a light twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said I still could not understand why Mescalito terrorized me if he had accepted me. I reminded don Juan that, according to his statements, to be accepted by Mescalito implied that his form was constant and did not shift from bliss to nightmare. Don Juan laughed at me again and said that if I would think about the question I had had in my heart when I talked to Mescalito, then I myself would understand the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To think about the question I had had in my &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot; was a difficult problem. I told don Juan I had had many things in mind. When I asked if I was on the right path, I meant: Do I have one foot in each of two worlds? Which world is the right one? What course should my life take?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan listened to my explanations and concluded that I did not have a clear view of the world, and that the protector had given me a beautifully clear lesson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;You think there are two worlds for you - two paths. But there is only one. The protector showed you this with unbelievable clarity. The only world available to you is the world of men, and that world you cannot choose to leave. You are a man! &lt;strong&gt;The protector showed you the world of happiness where there is no difference between things because there is no one there to ask about the difference. But that is not the world of men. The protector shook you out of it and showed you how a man THINKS AND FIGHTS&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(my emphasis)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.  That  is the world of man! And to be a man is to be condemned to that world.&lt;/strong&gt; You have the vanity to believe you live in two worlds, but that is only your vanity. There is but one single world for us. We are men, and must follow the world of men contentedly. I believe that was the lesson.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_o5x4cd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o5x4cd/what_do_you_think_about_shifting/h2r3w2r/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1624443292.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h2p7hwx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dopameany", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1624398587.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_o5x4cd", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_c461jqtb", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\"There is a world of happiness where there is no difference between things because there is no one there to ask about the difference.

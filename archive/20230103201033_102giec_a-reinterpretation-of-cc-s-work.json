I think that in modern times is necesary a examination about CC\u00b4s work in view of the new discoveries that have been made about him. I don\u00b4t know if you all are aware about the biography  \"La vida secreta de Carlos Castenda\" (The secret life of Carlos Castaneda)  written by Manuel Carballal in which he draws a very coherent timeline, motivations, sources of inspiration, errors and scandals about CC.  \n\nI think that, after evaluating the  points that I\u00b4m gonna list below we can intuit that the CC\u00b4s work practices and phylosophy is a mixture of a lot of different sources, experiences and traditions making a new system. I would like to put as an example the four gospels of the bible. They were wrtitten for educated greek speaking people, and each one portrayed Jesus in a diferente way. And at least some of the gospels didin\u00b4t claim that Jesus was the son of god. However those gospels were taken and use to construct a new interpretation and system of beliefs: christianism, in wich Jesus was the son of god sent for god itsel and the gospels were written by some of the apostles.\n\n I think Castaneda made something similar, he might had some real knowledge and maybe he even had some contact with mexican nahualism. Why do I say that Castaneda could had interactions with real nahualism? Because in Mexico theres a general conception of nahualism in wich the nahual turns into and animal to steal stuff but in the  prehispanic historical archives theres a lot of testimonials telling that nahuals where people who could control their dreams and that they in fact turned into animals, lights, and other stuff in their dreams. Also, theres  anthropological works from the last century that also state this and even myself met someone who told me that his grandmother was a tlamatini (this word means wisemen or wisewoman but, in modern times is synonymous of nahual in some areas of rural Mexico), a nahual, and that she never slept cause, when sleeping she would leave her body to met with other tlamatinis. The guy who told me this was from an indigenous and rural area in Mexico. So, Castaneda was the first one in talk about nahualism as it was practicing by real mexican nahuals and this make me think that he might had some contact with real nahualistic lineages wich he ended up using to construct, as I mentioned, a new system based in diferent sources, traditions and CC\u00b4s own ideas.\n\nI would like your opinion about this.

An example is the lizard stuff in the first book which he took from his homeland, the inorganic term that he took from someone else and, in fact, if you pay attention you can see that CC took inspiration from consolidated traditions like  buddhism (for example, stop de internal dialogue).\n\n2.-A lot of the people in his books wasn't real but fictional characters being Don Juan an example of that  and, in fact, Don Juan was based in different shamans and the same happens with a lot of his characters.\n\n3.- He made his books in the first time as a school assignment and  later as a response for his editor who was asking him to write more books because they turned out to sell very well $$$. \n\n4.- He lied about a lot of things in his life, what he did, where hi did it, how he did it, etc.\n\n4.- He took inspiration and a lot of the tensegrity poses not from Don Juan but from other sources  possibly martial arts.\n\n5.-At the end of his life he became kind of a scamer or sect leader.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Reinterpretation Of CC's work", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inventory Warrior"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_102giec", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_u0l21fet", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inventory Warrior", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "spoiler", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1672773033.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, I would like your opinion about something.

The day after this was first written.\n\nWe got our 3rd!  \n\nHe posted about Armando Torres (a huge faker) and masturbation.\n\nA masturbation obsessed Torres follower.  \n\nSo the law of 3's held up!\n\nCarlos warned us that attackers come in 3s.\n\nBeginners might find that really weird, but reality doesn't work as you believe.\n\nYou have to see that for yourself to comprehend what it means.\n\nSo to make this post useful, Carlos explained to his private classes that if he gained \"energetic mass\" with his students, then he got attacked from 3 sides.\n\nAnd it was so common, he just couldn't deny it.\n\nI did see that in classes, but I didn't believe such a weird claim. I couldn't travel freely between worlds back then (25 years ago), so I couldn't see all the eyes between worlds, watching for any unusual activity.\n\nIt's just that these days  I find myself doing  the impossible during practicing, and when I get to something so far past what I had expected,  I often find myself surrounded by inorganic beings.\n\nTheir cave materializes all by itself.\n\nLast night they did!  I had to joke with one of them, \"How long have you guys been there???\"\n\nThem showing up in their cave usually takes some taunting of them, or playing with them.\n\nThis is more like they \"notice\" what I just did, and come to take a look.\n\nBut it's not odd at all!\n\nThat's what \"The Art of Dreaming\" teaches  us.\n\nYou find your hands, gaze at them deliberately from inside a dream, and that creates the kind of energy which \"compels\" the inorganic beings to send a scout.\n\nIt's there in the collected books if anyone missed it.\n\nIt's why you MUST find your hands if you want to follow those steps.\n\nAnd it works too!  You can follow those instructions all the way to their world and learn from the dreaming emissary herself.\n\nI must have spent hundreds of  hours learning from her, just as Carlos did.\n\nSo \"something\" out there can notice unusual events, from the point of view of the type of energy released.\n\nStill not convinced?\n\nRemember from the books that on several occasions don Juan only has to mention the allies, and suddenly they're in the bushes making noises Carlos can hear.\n\nThey show up, just because someone spoke of them.\n\nSame happens for Taisha with her \"silence stick\".\n\nA policeman's nightstick sized pole, with a pad on one end for your forehead.\n\nShe uses it to summon her ally Phoebus.\n\n(Who our Jadey might have at this point.)\n\nBet most of you didn't know the silence stick was good for summoning the allies!\n\nBut how far away are Taisha's allies?\n\nIf they're like \"Fairy\", the entity who started this subreddit, they live BILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY.\n\nWhich by the way, you yourself can learn to cross in around 45 seconds.\n\nI posted the technique, and it works.\n\nIt's basically just \"Stellar Hatch\".\n\nSo we know:\n\n1    The allies can find you in sleeping dreaming if you produce the kind of \"rational energy\" inside a dream, which normally is not found there.  You brought your volition into a dream, and utilized it.  Deliberately.\n\n2   The allies can travel to you from billions of light years away, just because you mentioned them.\n\nAnd DO!  I don't go a single night without seeing many of them now. I have friends all over the universe.\n\nYou will too if you just follow the instructions that Carlos gave us.\n\nAnd an even weirder #3:  Carlos said he was having problems just from too many people speaking his name.

I couldn&amp;#39;t travel freely between worlds back then (25 years ago), so I couldn&amp;#39;t see all the eyes between worlds, watching for any unusual activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that these days  I find myself doing  the impossible during practicing, and when I get to something so far past what I had expected,  I often find myself surrounded by inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their cave materializes all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night they did!  I had to joke with one of them, &amp;quot;How long have you guys been there???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Them showing up in their cave usually takes some taunting of them, or playing with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is more like they &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; what I just did, and come to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not odd at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what &amp;quot;The Art of Dreaming&amp;quot; teaches  us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find your hands, gaze at them deliberately from inside a dream, and that creates the kind of energy which &amp;quot;compels&amp;quot; the inorganic beings to send a scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s there in the collected books if anyone missed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why you MUST find your hands if you want to follow those steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it works too!  You can follow those instructions all the way to their world and learn from the dreaming emissary herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must have spent hundreds of  hours learning from her, just as Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; out there can notice unusual events, from the point of view of the type of energy released.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still not convinced?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember from the books that on several occasions don Juan only has to mention the allies, and suddenly they&amp;#39;re in the bushes making noises Carlos can hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They show up, just because someone spoke of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same happens for Taisha with her &amp;quot;silence stick&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A policeman&amp;#39;s nightstick sized pole, with a pad on one end for your forehead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She uses it to summon her ally Phoebus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Who our Jadey might have at this point.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bet most of you didn&amp;#39;t know the silence stick was good for summoning the allies!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how far away are Taisha&amp;#39;s allies?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot;, the entity who started this subreddit, they live BILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which by the way, you yourself can learn to cross in around 45 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted the technique, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s basically just &amp;quot;Stellar Hatch&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we know:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1    The allies can find you in sleeping dreaming if you produce the kind of &amp;quot;rational energy&amp;quot; inside a dream, which normally is not found there.  You brought your volition into a dream, and utilized it.  Deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2   The allies can travel to you from billions of light years away, just because you mentioned them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And DO!  I don&amp;#39;t go a single night without seeing many of them now. I have friends all over the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will too if you just follow the instructions that Carlos gave us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And an even weirder #3:  Carlos said he was having problems just from too many people speaking his name. He was noticing the same thing that can call the allies!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we know:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4   Carlos said that when his students make energetic progress, a specialized type of inorganic being sends attackers his way, to try to stop it.

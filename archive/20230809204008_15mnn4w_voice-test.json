So I don't understand why you're thinking what I made is very different.\n\nIt seems \"inventory warriorish\" of you.   \n\nLike that's all you actually have. Your own interpretation of what you read. \n\nAnd you believe that's all there is to sorcery because for the last 50 years, that was in fact all anyone did.\n\nArgue about words. See who \"has the best understanding\".\n\nWhich is utterly pointless.  Understanding is useless for sorcery.\n\nThis is backed up by your complaint that I talk about being in private classes too often.\n\nYou're jealous, want to be in charge, and have no appreciation for finding a place where you can actually learn everything for real!\n\nI wish to god someone else taught directly by Carlos, would be in charge here!\n\nI wouldn't have to get up at 4AM everyday just to keep up with the unpaid work, and also hold a full time job.\n\nYou complain as if I actually want to be stuck with this horrible job of trying to get others to stop the pretending.\n\nI'm constantly attacked by men like you who would bury the magic in bullying.\n\nYou're pretty much as bad as it gets in our community.  \n\nYou don't explode in rage as quickly.\n\nBut it might actually be better if you did.\n\nInstead, you just nitpick and make tiny cuts.\n\nDeath by a thousand cuts.\n\nSo that you can suck up the sympathy if anyone contradicts you.\n\nYour not helpful to others, hostile, and with no actual interest in learning.\n\nIn your hands, we'd lose it all.\n\nHowever, I can tell you what's wrong with your picture.\n\nYou have no tilt, so you ignored that part in the books about how the tilt gives the illusion of a movement to the left.\n\nI got to see Carlos explain that in person, so maybe if I hadn't I wouldn't have noticed it in the books either.\n\nBut it's there.\n\nYou likely didn't read the last 5 publications, or else don't have good recall of them or you'd remember that the band of man is around a foot thick.\n\nLess in the picture Carlos drew.  \n\nYours might be 2 feet wide.\n\nI suppose that's so that you don't have to tilt it?\n\nYou have the assemblage point on the left, because you got confused by the descriptions.\n\nCarlos said it was OVER \"the LEFT shoulder blade\".\n\nOver meaning, it's a bit higher because the beam angles down towards the toes.\n\nBut whose left is it over?\n\nThe person's left.\n\nNot the viewers left, viewing the person from the front.\n\nCarlos showed us from the back, to avoid confusion.\n\nSaying \"left and right\" shoulder blade with the person facing you, is quite a problem.\n\nIt's like \"stage right\" versus the right  side of the stage.  They even had to make up a phrase, to clear up that confusion.\n\nStage right, is the left side of the stage to the audience.\n\nI'm told you like to pretend you can 'see' on discord.\n\nAs if \"seeing\" didn't mean moving the assemblage point all the way to the other side of the body.\n\nAlong the way you meet fully visible inorganic beings who teach you (with your eyes OPEN), you shapeshift for real, play with visible puffs of light the way Tensegrity teaches us, whitish light eventually materializes doorways to other worlds on your walls, into which you can physically walk and remain for hours.\n\nYou get to leap through the ceiling in your physical body, and zip into space at billions of light years per second.

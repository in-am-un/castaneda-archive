I was so confused because there is so much particular jargon here that I was very lost. I didn't really want to read the books, because that's a commitment and I'm a commitment phobe. But it became evident that I was holding myself back from any progress or deeper understanding if I didn't. One of my problems is I don't have a lot of time to physically sit and read, but I have time to listen when I'm driving to and from work, and when I am doing my chores and other small stuff. So audiobooks it is!\n\n[Here are the first three books on Spotify. ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RSDinAOs9N4EJyepmR67m?si=g5JwmcjpSfKPugMfvR0sLQ). It made it very easy for me to get a grasp on what was going on. These books are wonderful just for the story's sake alone. The rest of the books are on YouTube thankfully. It has become my daily habit to listen to these books every time I drive. I look forward so much to my drives now. I also sit outside every evening and listen for an hour while I gaze at my flowers on my porch. It has become a most healing practice. I have made it through seven books since the beginning of the year and the change in me has been lovely.\n\nYou'll start to notice little attitudes of yours shifting. You'll look at scenarios that you encounter in life differently. You start to understand the intent in yourself, but you really learn feel the intent from others. Everyone online in the subreddit talks about their dark room experiences which is so wonderful, however I have noticed the most delightful change in my day-to-day interaction with my fellow human. I am not as angry as I used to be. I don't feel like a victim anymore. I have way more patience than I ever knew was even possible. I also don't dwell and fret over past encounters that used to give me stress. I don't fret over future events that would give me anxiety. Peace of mind and well-being is one of the awesome outcomes. \n\nWhat this work does is change the way you view the world. It teaches you to utilize and reclaim your own power by shifting your awareness. It is worth it to put the time in to understand it.

I was so confused because there is so much particular jargon here that I was very lost. I didn&amp;#39;t really want to read the books, because that&amp;#39;s a commitment and I&amp;#39;m a commitment phobe. But it became evident that I was holding myself back from any progress or deeper understanding if I didn&amp;#39;t. One of my problems is I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time to physically sit and read, but I have time to listen when I&amp;#39;m driving to and from work, and when I am doing my chores and other small stuff. So audiobooks it is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RSDinAOs9N4EJyepmR67m?si=g5JwmcjpSfKPugMfvR0sLQ\"&gt;Here are the first three books on Spotify. &lt;/a&gt;. It made it very easy for me to get a grasp on what was going on. These books are wonderful just for the story&amp;#39;s sake alone. The rest of the books are on YouTube thankfully. It has become my daily habit to listen to these books every time I drive. I look forward so much to my drives now. I also sit outside every evening and listen for an hour while I gaze at my flowers on my porch. It has become a most healing practice. I have made it through seven books since the beginning of the year and the change in me has been lovely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll start to notice little attitudes of yours shifting. You&amp;#39;ll look at scenarios that you encounter in life differently. You start to understand the intent in yourself, but you really learn feel the intent from others. Everyone online in the subreddit talks about their dark room experiences which is so wonderful, however I have noticed the most delightful change in my day-to-day interaction with my fellow human. I am not as angry as I used to be. I don&amp;#39;t feel like a victim anymore. I have way more patience than I ever knew was even possible. I also don&amp;#39;t dwell and fret over past encounters that used to give me stress. I don&amp;#39;t fret over future events that would give me anxiety. Peace of mind and well-being is one of the awesome outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What this work does is change the way you view the world.

These bundles are quite peculiar, because they make seers feel a hue. One bundle gives the feeling of being beige-pink, something like the glow of pink-colored street lamps; another gives the feeling of being peach, like buff neon lights; and the third bundle gives the feeling of being amber, like clear honey.\n\n\"So, it is a matter of seeing a hue when seers see that the Eagle bestows awareness through its emanations,\" he went on. \"Religious men don't see God's love, but if they would see it, they would know that it is either pink, peach, or amber.\"\n\n\"Man, for example, is attached to the amber bundle, but so are other beings.\"\n\nI wanted to know which beings shared those emanations with man.\n\n\"Details like that you will have to find out for yourself through your own seeing,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no point in my telling you which ones; you will only be making another inventory. Suffice it to say that finding that out for yourself will be one of the most exciting things you'll ever do.\"\n\n\"Do the pink and peach bundles also show in man?\" I asked.\n\n\"Never.

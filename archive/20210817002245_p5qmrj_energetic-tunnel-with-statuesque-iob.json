This stuff has happened to me for a long time, and I&amp;#39;m just trying to figure it out :) thanks a ton for the help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you mind if I ask; is it &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; to sometimes be able to see a map of your area or text in dreams? Can that information mean anything? For example the &amp;quot;gomot eyes,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve also gotten one map with the label &amp;quot;Dream Team&amp;#39;s Vision.&amp;quot; And I&amp;#39;ve even found unknown phone numbers on my cellphone in dreams.

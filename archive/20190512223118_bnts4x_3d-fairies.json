People claim it\u2019s one random and completely different technique after another, arranged in no particularly useful order.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult criticism to answer, even if you take the time to actually practice his techniques and find out that they work.\n\nThe crux of Carlos\u2019 Sorcery is *intent*.  The problem with that is, what you expect influences what happens.\n\nAs a result, you never know if the amazing experience you just had was created by reading something a long time ago, or whether it\u2019s just the way things are, and anyone would have had that experience.    Doesn\u2019t matter that you have to work so hard that you sweat blood.    If the experience matches what Carlos described too perfectly, some doubt is possible.\n\nCarlos emphasizes the \u201cIntent of the Sorcerer\u2019s of Ancient Mexico\u201d, so he wasn\u2019t making it any easier to understand that issue.    In one of his books, Clara even describes producing your own shared dreaming world, building it up from a single object, until you have an entire town you can live in.\n\nA week or two ago someone asked me what cracking the joints does.  I never considered it before, but started trying it out at night.  At first, I had the same thing in mind as the person asking the question.  Does cracking the joints produce a specific effect or feeling, and does each joint have a different purpose?\n\nI tried to feel for differences, see the actual effect, and otherwise measure the benefit.\n\nI was on the wrong track.  Sorcerers make use of everything they have.  Cracking joints makes techniques work, when you were struggling to get them going.  It\u2019s something you\u2019ll automatically discover once you can see colors in the darkness, and summon dreaming images while awake.\n\nIt might simply be similar to stretching your arms before you attempt to pick up something heavy.  Cats even do that after they wake up, to get their body moving.  While we understand that their movements are designed to stretch their muscles, another way of looking at it is, it redeploys energy. How doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s available for use when it otherwise would not have been.\n\nI\u2019ve found that rolling the shoulders enough to get the joints to crack, as don Juan advised, makes colors in the darkness become more brilliant, and helps them form results.\n\nBut you can also use your hands, without cracking any joints.   Or your arm.   Any limb can be useful.\n\nHere\u2019s where our muscle memory comes in.  Remember that sorcerers use everything they can, as long as it helps produce the results they want (and doesn\u2019t harm anyone).  They don\u2019t decide something is \u201cinvalid\u201d, and therefore not usable, because invalid things fall into the category of \u201cnot-doing\u201d.  The more invalid, the better when it comes to not-doing.\n\nYour muscle memory has to be carefully interweaved with the visual system of the brain for best results.  You can feel what it\u2019s like to move the muscle, but some visual feedback is used to help correct the movement. Your brain knows how to swing a baseball bat, but it\u2019s expecting visual info to help adjust the path.\n\nIn the dark, there\u2019s nothing to see.  But even so, the muscle memory will produce a visual image for you, in the absence of enough light.  Perhaps it\u2019s the \u201cexpected path\u201d, and better than nothing.\n\nThis visual effect is noticeable when you\u2019re in the realm of seeing colors in darkness.  I mean, not when the lights first go off, and you worry nothing is going to be visible.  You have to be at the point of seeing some colors, before you would be likely to see the virtual movement.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s any use before then.  I would guess, there\u2019s no benefit to trying this, until you learn to see the colors.\n\nBut here\u2019s a technique you can try, once you do learn to see them.\n\nThe vaguest puffs aren\u2019t much use in this technique, nor are the distorted lines you can see everywhere.  Also, seeing perfectly, as in *seeing* the emanations and bundles, wouldn\u2019t help either. That\u2019s an entirely different realm.  You probably don\u2019t even have an arm when you\u2019re viewing that.\n\nBest results will be if you are in your room, in the darkness, can feel your body, and are seeing bright enough colors that you can\u2019t deny it\u2019s really odd.\n\nFind your brightest spot, and roll your shoulders the way you imagine don Juan was doing.  Lobster strike Tensegrity movement should be the guide for how far to roll them.\n\nIf the colors get brighter, you hit the jackpot!  You can use the rest of your body too.\n\nWhat you want are the dark spots that mix in with the brightest colors. Carlos described them as follows:\n\n\u201cAfter a moment I noticed that the mirror was reflecting more than the reflection of our faces and the round shape. Its surface had become dark. Spots of an intense violet light appeared. They grew large. There were also spots of jet blackness.\u201d\n\nPeople who write to me have verified the jet-black mixing with the colors.  Some report having watched that effect as a child.  And I\u2019ve noticed that the most interesting things form there, at the boundaries between black and purple.\n\nFind yourself a patch of very bright purple, and watch for the jet black to mix in.  I\u2019ve learned that the jet black doesn\u2019t always form, but when it does it has a rotating pattern.  It rotates clockwise, erasing the bright purple, and spawning off details at its edges.  It\u2019s like black ink mixing into purple, except that it never actually mixes. It just swirls and the colors replace each other.\n\nLast night the purple was intense for me, but the black was nowhere to be found. I placed my hand behind the solid purple and rubbed it in a circular movement, as if I could start some rotation through the hand movement.\n\nI don\u2019t believe the actual hand movement is important, but the muscle memory knows what that kind of motion can produce, and the jet black joined in with the purple.    Right away I might add.\n\nNote: If your colors form at a distance (similar to Carlos\u2019 \u201cwall\u201d technique), you need to use Zuleica\u2019s harp playing movement to pull them closer.  That can take many days of work, but once you do, the colors are far more accessible.\n\nWhen I realized that the rotating hand movement worked, I tried stroking the \u201cside\u201d of the colors.  They really didn\u2019t seem to have a \u201cside\u201d at the time. They were 2 dimensional patches of color.  But as soon as I stroked the side, the patch of flat color rotated a bit, as if someone had grabbed it and moved it, and left it floating in the air with an edge showing slightly.\n\nI rubbed that edge, and the jet black spun off a detail.  The purple and black boundary produced a line of text, which floated off into the air.  That\u2019s an example of Carlos\u2019 \u201creading off the wall\u201d technique.\n\nBut I wanted a chance to have help from inorganics, so I ignored that and watched for hypnogogic head details in the purple.  Two eyes and a mouth is usually enough to summon a little creature.\n\nI got lucky, it only took a few more minutes to get very nice-looking images to appear in the purple patch of color.   A hypnogogic head formed perfectly, with a pleasing cartoon face, and smiled at me.  I continued to stroke the side of the colors, and it rolled off, turning almost all the way around, as if it had mass.  The head became a whole being, although only a few inches long.  It was laying on my hand.\n\nThe roll was exactly what you\u2019d expect, if someone had hung a little toy in the air, and you stroked the side of it. It had to rotate; I was pushing on it with my hand.  But the act of getting it to rotate caused it to split from the patch of color, and take on its own existence.\n\nIt started to float away, so I grasped it in my hand.  My hand was slightly cupped, as if the creature were real, and might roll off without some support.\n\nIt looked like a child\u2019s toy made out of blue light, sitting on my hand.  And it was making faces at me.  Some looked a bit annoyed.\n\nI tried the \u201cbasketball\u201d technique Carlos showed us in one class. With my cupped hand holding it, I cupped the other hand over it.  I tried compressing it gently.  It got even brighter.  I blew into it, and the entire area of my hand started to glow white.\n\nI continued using my hand to make it move, holding it in my cupped left hand, and brushing against it with my open right hand.  It became more and more 3 dimensional, until it could easily have been a real object.\n\nAt the time all I could think was, is this how you manifest an object?  I looked around the room and realized, I had summoned waking dreaming. There were tiny scenes of people and places, floating around the room on the patches of color.\n\nMy assemblage point started to shift too much, and I had mini flashes of other places.  In each case, I lost awareness of my goal, and when I snapped out of it, it felt as if I\u2019d failed and fallen asleep.  I had to keep reminding myself, this is what happens when the assemblage point moves. It\u2019s a good thing.    You just have to try to be aware of the transition and not lose volition.  And don\u2019t get the idea you messed things up, when you were only gone for a few seconds!\n\nI refocused on the 3D fairy in my hand, only to find it was gone.  The room started to spin, and I found myself standing next to 4 walls.  They were yellow in color, spaced about 3 feet apart, and tilted at an angle. As far as I knew, they could have been 4 flat objects hanging from garment poles in my closet.  The arrangement was similar to how my shirts look, when I space them apart to select one.  But they were flat rectangles.\n\nUnfortunately, I had no body with which to explore.  All I could see was the 4 flat objects, hanging in space and glowing with that yellowish hue.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get my assemblage point to move back.  I realized I was stuck in what Carlos referred to as \u201cabstract dreaming\u201d.  It had been 5 hours since I started.  I couldn\u2019t believe that much time had passed, but it meant the sun would be up soon.  I\u2019d hit a dead end.\n\nI lay on my side to go to sleep, and found myself staring at the same 4 walls, all night long. I couldn\u2019t escape the vision.  I could wake up, but when I went back to sleep, I fell into that abstract dream. It was a silent dream, but also it was filled with some kind of tension, or mild pain.  It reminded me of feverish dreams I had as a child when ill.\n\nOne detail had changed when I watched the walls while asleep. They were now a gaudy red instead of yellow, and looked like real objects. I fancied I even saw some wood grain on them.\n\nNone of the techniques I described here are all that important.  None of us need more procedures.\n\nThe important thing is, use everything you have.  Don\u2019t forget that even a simple thing can produce a result, once you\u2019re capable of perceiving it.  Experiment away!  But remember, 3 to 5 hours is pretty much what\u2019s needed at first.  It\u2019s a horrible amount of time to invest in something that\u2019s \u201cimaginary\u201d. Or at least, that\u2019s what everyone would tell you, if they knew you were practicing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "3D Fairies", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_bnts4x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1557704860.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1557693078.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the criticisms of Carlos is that the techniques and concepts in his books were already written elsewhere, and he only added them to sell books.

It was shaped like a baby sea lion,  which means mostly a blob, and it was seemingly going to pull itself along the floor without obvious use of any legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t headed towards my feet. In fact, it was laying on a man made surface, like a floor in a kitchen. Or it could have been light colored dirt packed very tight together, to make a floor.  The floor was a very whitish yellow.  I tried to see if the creature was green or mud colored, as Carlos  had said, but it wasn&amp;#39;t solid enough looking to judge a color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its mouth was open, and it seemed about to snack on something at my position.  Or it wanted to make a comment.  I couldn&amp;#39;t tell which.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was in another realm!   It wasn&amp;#39;t in my room.  I could switch back and forth between perception of my room, and the perception of that place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the thought, &amp;quot;So that&amp;#39;s why I haven&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; fliers. They&amp;#39;re over &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;  I had the feeling that I was over &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about where &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; could be, and decided It didn&amp;#39;t make any sense. So I went back to what I was doing.   I don&amp;#39;t believe in the fliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bnts4x/3d_fairies/en9e7u2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1557699715.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_bnts4x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "est8dr6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_est6s1m", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Another benefit of doing this while walking around is that you can learn to see those dark energy waves when you move your hand.\n\nThose are a measure of your silence level.

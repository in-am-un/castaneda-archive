It is the topic of \"The Rule\". I think that we all have read Carlos' book \"The Eagle's Gift\" (or the most of us).\n\nIn that book it is stated very precisely that the Rule is at the same time a Map and a Myth. \n\nFor me it seems more like a law, the way laws of physics are in the physical world, the Rule is the law of the energetical world.\n\nRecently, I was wondering and even actively discussing it with fellow practitioners - Is it still applicable? If it is really a law about people's party aligning their energy configurations and venturing into Infinity, it should be still valid. Carlos describes a finite matrix of energy types, and a principle on how they bind together.\n\nOkay, people would say \"Well, times have changed, there is Cleargreen, no more lineage..\". Okay. But let's explore this more deeply. Would gravity cease to exist only if we would stop to use it? The answer is obvious, no. And then - would 16 human energy configurations and basic principles on them binding together would cease to exist after Carlos has left the world? Obviously, no.\n\nThe question is, could this information be used practically, not in a manner of philosophical discussions. What are your opinions, could modern day warriors align into new parties and start new lineages?\n\nArmando Torres, who is a controversial figure to me, says so. He had told that Carlos' hidden goal was to disseminate the knowledge and let the Intent assemble new parties, starting new sorcerers lineages from scratch.\n\nBelow I will post some excerps openly available on facebook. I would be glad to hear your opinion's on this, and specifically, Dan's if he will be willing to comment on my post.\n\nP. S. I am not associated/affiliated with Armando or his associates. Nor I am taking any of this information for granted. My goal here is to discuss the Rule topic and the information provided. If you ask my personal opinion, I am 50/50 about Armando's book and him being associated with Carlos Castaneda. I have my own doubts here. But the information seems curious to evaluate.\n\n\"Three-Pronged Naguals\n\n\"The Rule is final, but its design and configuration are in constant evolution. But unlike evolutionists, who view the adaptations of life as a haphazard accumulation of genetic mutations, seers know there is nothing random about the Rule. They see how a command of the Eagle, in the form of a wave of energy, shakes the lineages of power from time to time, producing new stages in sorcery.\n\n\"A more exact way of describing it, is to assume that all possible variations of the Rule are contained in a womb of potential, and what changes over time is the degree of knowledge the sorcerers have of that totality, and what emphasis they put on particular portions of it. Such periods of change are recurrent, and they are represented by the number three.\"\n\n\"Why three?\"\n\n\"Because the old Toltecs associated the number three with dynamics and renewal. They discovered that ternary formations - formations based on the number three announce unexpected changes.\n\n\"The Rule dictates that, from time to time, a special kind of nagual will appear in the lineages; a nagual whose energy is not divided into four parts, but instead has only three compartments. Seers call them 'three-pronged naguals.\"\n\nI asked him how they where different from the others.\n\nHe answered:\n\n\"Their energy is volatile, they are always moving, and because of that they find it difficult to accumulate power. From the point of view of the lineage, their composition is faulty; they will never be true naguals. In compensation, they lack the timidity and reservation that characterize the classic naguals, and they possess an unusual capacity to improvise and communicate.\n\n\"We can say that three-pronged naguals are like the cuckoo birds incubated in other birds' nests. They are opportunists, but they are necessary. Unlike the naguals of four points, whose freedom it is to pass unnoticed, those of three points are public personalities. They disclose secrets and cause fragmentation of the teachings, but without them, the lineages of power would have been extinguished a long time ago.\n\n\"Among the new seers, the Rule is that a nagual leaves a new party as a descendant. Some, due to their enormous energy surpluses, are able to help organizing a second or third generation of seers. For example, the nagual Elias Ulloa lived long enough to create his successor's party and to have an influence on the following one. But this does not mean a fork in the lineage; all those groups were part of the same transmission line.\n\n\"On the other hand, the three-pronged nagual is authorized to transmit his knowledge radially, which does lead to a diversification of lineages. His luminous cocoon has a disintegrating effect on the group, which breaks the lineal structure of transmission and foments a desire for change and action in warriors, and an active disposition to be involved with their fellow men.\"\n\n\"Was that what happened to you?\"\n\n\"That's what happened. Due to my luminous disposition, I don't have any qualms about leaving kernels of knowledge behind, wherever I go. I know that I need an enormous quantity of energy to fulfill my task, and that I can only obtain it from masses. For that reason I am willing to broadcast the knowledge far and wide, and transform and redefine its paradigms.\"\n\nThe Portion Of The Rule For The Three-Pronged Nagual\n\n\"As you know, my teacher became aware of the Rule for the three-pronged nagual when he tried to analyze certain anomalies in the new group. Apparently, I could not get in tune with the rest of the apprentices. Then he paid me sufficient attention to see that I masked my energy configuration.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that Don Juan's seeing had been mistaken?\"\n\n\"Of course not! What was mistaken was his looking. To see is the final form of perception; there are no appearances, so it is not possible to be deceived. However, due to the pressure that he had exerted on me for years, my energy struggled to mold itself to his. That is common among apprentices. Since he was divided into four compartments, I also began to manifest a similar energetic weight in my actions.\n\n\"Once I was able to shake off his influence (it took me almost ten years of arduous work), we discovered something astonishing: My luminosity only had three compartments; it didn't correspond to an ordinary, modern person, who only has two, nor to a nagual. This discovery caused a great commotion in the group of seers, since they all saw it as a portent of profound change for the lineage.\n\n\"Then Don Juan went back to the tradition of his predecessors, and dusted off a forgotten aspect of the Rule. He told me that the election of a nagual cannot in any way be considered as a personal whim, since it is the spirit who chooses the successor of a lineage at all times. Therefore, my energetic anomaly was part of a command. Faced with my urgent questioning, he assured me that a messenger would appear in due time and explain to me the function of my presence as a three-pronged nagual.\n\n\"Years later, during a visit to one of the rooms in the National Museum of Anthropology and History, I observed a native dressed in the old-fashioned Tarahumara costume, who seemed to have the most absorbing interest in one of the exhibition pieces. He examined it from all sides and demonstrated such a total concentration that it made me curious, and I went closer to look.\n\n\"When he saw me, the man spoke to me and began to explain the meaning of a group of excellent, painstaking drawings sculpted into the stone. Then, while I meditated on what he had told me, I remembered Don Juan's promise, and realized that this man had been an envoy from the spirit, who had passed on to me the portion of the Rule concerning the three-pronged nagual.\"\n\n\"And what does that portion say?\"\n\n\"It affirms that, just as the party has an energy matrix of the number seventeen (two naguals, four female dreamers, four female stalkers, four male warriors, and three scouts), a lineage, which is formed by a succession of parties, also has a structure of power, of the number fifty-two. The Eagle's command is that every fifty-two generations of four-pointed naguals, there will appear a three-pronged nagual who serves as a cathartic action for the propagation of new four-point lineages.\n\n\"The Rule also says that the three-pronged naguals are destructive to the established order, because their nature is neither creative nor nurturing, and they have the tendency to enslave all those who surround them. It adds that, to achieve freedom, these naguals should do it alone, because their energy is not tuned to guide groups of warriors.\n\n\"Like everything in the world of energy, the block of fifty-two generations is divided into two parts; the first twenty-six concerning themselves with expansion and the creation of new lines, the rest oriented towards conservation and isolation. This pattern of behavior has been repeating itself millennium after millennium, so sorcerers know that it is part of the Rule. \"As a result of the activities of a three-pronged nagual, the knowledge becomes widely known, and new cells of four-point naguals are formed. From that starting point, lineages recapture the tradition of transmitting the teachings in a lineal form.\"\n\n\"How often do three-point naguals appear?\"\n\n\"Approximately once per millennium. That is the age of my lineage.\"\n\nThe Task Of The Seers Of Today\n\n\"Upon verifying the Rule of the three-pronged nagual, Don Juan deduced that, inevitably, the time of a new breed of warriors was at hand; I have called them the modern seers.\"\n\n\"Are there any peculiarities in the luminous composition of those warriors?\"\n\n\"No. In every era, man's energy pattern has been very homogeneous, so the organization of the party is the same. However, the warriors of today are experiencing a slide towards green in their luminosity, which means that they are recovering characteristics of the old seers. This is something unforeseen, although it is for sure covered by the Rule.\n\n\"The true difference between seers of the past and those of today is in their behavior. At the moment, we are not subjected to the same repressions as in previous eras, and therefore sorcerers have fewer restrictions. Clearly, this has a purpose: Popularization of the teaching.\n\n\"I have lived a moment of renewal. My task is to close the lineage of Don Juan with a golden key, and to open up possibilities for those who come later. That is why I have said that I am the last nagual of my lineage, not in an absolute sense, but in the sense of radical change.\"\n\nAt this point, Carlos took a break in his presentation and reminded me of a conversation we had when we first met.\n\nAt that time, I had asked him to tell me tales of power. He replied that he could not refuse what I was asking, but to hand over those stories without any directions would have been to trivialize them.\n\n\"I hope what you have seen during these years fulfills your expectations. I did what I could, considering your limitations as well as mine. I know you have already begun to train your dreaming double, and that guarantees that you can continue by yourself; your double won't leave you alone until you arrive at your totality. The theoretical part is finished, and it is time to give you a last gift.\"\n\nThe tone of Carlos' voice as he spoke these words, somewhere between familiar and\nsolemn, made me concentrate all my attention.\n\n\"The final teaching says that in connection with intent, every person, whoever it may be, who approaches the nagual, has his place inside the total context of the Rule. So you are not alone; sorcerers are expecting something from you.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked, a little confused.\n\nHe explained:\n\n\"All warriors have a task. Yours is to fulfill what the spirit told you to do; that is your path to power.\"\n\n\"And what is that task?\"\n\n\"Well, your personal mission is something your benefactor will communicate to you some day. However, in accordance with the Rule of the three-pronged nagual, I am following a long-term strategy devised by Don Juan, which commits you to my teacher's intent.\n\n\"What is expected from you is that you say to those who surround you: 'You are free, you can fly by yourselves! You have the necessary information, what are you waiting for? Act impeccably, and see how energy finds a way.'\n\n\"Warn everyone that with the culmination of Don Juan's lineage, the knowledge is wide open. Each warrior is responsible for himself, and can provide himself with the minimum opportunity, which is to organize his own party.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Rule", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_g4zx4a", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3tl0tnl8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1587412602.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a topic which bothers me for quite a long time.

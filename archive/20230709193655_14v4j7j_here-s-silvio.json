She says I'm too \"scandalous\". \n\nAnd Cholita has powerful friends.\n\nHowever, Carlos found it necessary to do the same in private classes.

It's a well known mental illness.\n\nAnd likewise, they get \"magic fever\", and see an easy way to make money without having to have a real job.\n\nLike \"The Nagual Carlos Castillejos\".\n\nThey're shameless!\n\nCastillejos bothers me more because he's indirectly associated with Miles, and I want to keep Miles honest by putting pressure on the connecting link.\n\nSo I made a rule.\n\nIn the 90s there was great interest in making a movie from the books of Carlos.\n\nThere was already Soledad the witch, spending lineage wealth to influence Hollywood.  \"Money for Movies\" was her motto.\n\nI'm pretty certain she cause Star Wars, and the writers admit it was taken from the books of Carlos.\n\nUnfortunately, that's been \"scrubbed\" from the internet. You'll find ludicrous theories on where Star Wars came from, even on wikipedia. When the writers themselves explained it.\n\nThe world tried to erase Carlos.\n\nIt's revenge time!!!\n\nCarlos joked about the movie, saying he was having a hard time deciding because he feared Anthony Quinn would play don Juan.  Carlos had a connection to the director Fellini, and Fellini liked to use Anthony Quinn.\n\nAnd then in what seemed to be merely a joke, Carlos suggested who was once \"the most handsome man in the world\" should play him.\n\nRobert Redford.\n\nThus giving me permission to use that character, and be above any criticism by bad player men.\n\nBut it wasn't as much of a joke as one might think.  The movie \"Tell them Willie Boy is Here\" was filmed at Morongo, and while visiting the set I was told Carlos Castaneda had come to watch too.\n\nSomething he was always rumored to do, out at Morongo.  Especially at Festival time.\n\nCarlos started his search for don Juan out at Morongo.\n\nI extended the Robert Redford \"permission\" from Carlos, to include ANY character from that movie.\n\nSo that no one could criticize details.\n\nOne of the witches picked out this man for Silvio.\n\nI only tweaked it as much as a makeup department could do for an actor.\n\nCame out ok I believe!\n\nFree free to criticize, and I won't get angry.

As impossible as it seems. It's not really all that difficult.\n\nIt's done with the tonal \"shrunk\", so that body mass is no longer an issue.\n\nBut if I animate that, I'll need a Josefina!

She whispered that there was someone out there waiting to meet me. The patio was pitch black. I could hardly make out the silhouettes of the others. **Then I saw the dark outline of a man standing a few-feet away from me. My body experienced an involuntary jolt.**\n\n Don Juan spoke to the man in a very low voice, saying that he had brought me to meet him. He told the man my name. After a moment's silence, don Juan said to me that **the man's name was Silvio Manuel, and that he was the warrior of darkness and the actual leader of the whole warrior's party.** Then Silvio Manuel spoke to me. I thought that he must have had a speech disorder - his voice was muffled and the words came out of him like spurts of soft coughing.\n\n He ordered me to come closer. As I tried to approach him, he receded, just as if he were floating. He led me into an even darker recess of a hall, walking, it seemed, noiselessly backwards. He muttered something I could not understand. I wanted to speak; my throat itched and was parched. He repeated something two or three times until it dawned on me that he was ordering me to undress. There was something overpowering about his voice and the darkness around him. I was incapable of disobeying. I took off my clothes and stood stark naked, shivering with fear and cold. \n\nIt was so dark that I could not see if don Juan and the two women were around. I heard a soft prolonged hissing from a source a few feet away from me; then I felt a cool breeze. I realized that **Silvio Manuel was exhaling his breath all over my body**. \n\n**He then asked me to sit on my clothes and look at a bright point which I could easily distinguish in the darkness, a point that seemed to give out a faint amber light. I stared at it for what seemed hours, until I suddenly realized that the point of brightness was Silvio Manuel's left eye. I could then make out the contour of his whole face and his body.** The hall was not as dark as it had seemed. Silvio Manuel advanced to me and helped me up. To see in the dark with such clarity enthralled me. I did not even mind that I was naked or that, as I then saw, the two women were watching me. Apparently they could also see in the dark; they were staring at me. I wanted to put on my pants, but Zoila snatched them out of my hands.\n\n The two women and Silvio Manuel stared at me for a long time. Then don Juan came out of nowhere, handed me my shoes, and Zoila led us through a corridor to an open patio with trees. I made out the dark silhouette of a woman standing in the middle of the patio. Don Juan spoke to her and she mumbled something in reply. He told me that she was a southerly woman, that her name was Marta, and that she was a courier to the two westerly women. Marta said that she could bet I had never been introduced to a woman while I was naked; that the normal procedure is to get acquainted and then undress. She laughed out loud. Her laughter was so pleasing, so clear and youthful, that it sent chills through me; it reverberated through the whole house, enhanced by the darkness and the silence there. I looked to don Juan for support. He was gone and so was Silvio Manuel. I was alone with the three women. I became very nervous and asked Marta if she knew where don Juan had gone. At that precise moment, **someone grabbed the skin of my armpits. I yelled with pain. I knew that it was Silvio Manuel.** He lifted me up as if I weighed nothing and shook my shoes off me.

She whispered that there was someone out there waiting to meet me. The patio was pitch black. I could hardly make out the silhouettes of the others. &lt;strong&gt;Then I saw the dark outline of a man standing a few-feet away from me. My body experienced an involuntary jolt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan spoke to the man in a very low voice, saying that he had brought me to meet him. He told the man my name. After a moment&amp;#39;s silence, don Juan said to me that &lt;strong&gt;the man&amp;#39;s name was Silvio Manuel, and that he was the warrior of darkness and the actual leader of the whole warrior&amp;#39;s party.&lt;/strong&gt; Then Silvio Manuel spoke to me. I thought that he must have had a speech disorder - his voice was muffled and the words came out of him like spurts of soft coughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He ordered me to come closer. As I tried to approach him, he receded, just as if he were floating. He led me into an even darker recess of a hall, walking, it seemed, noiselessly backwards. He muttered something I could not understand. I wanted to speak; my throat itched and was parched. He repeated something two or three times until it dawned on me that he was ordering me to undress. There was something overpowering about his voice and the darkness around him. I was incapable of disobeying. I took off my clothes and stood stark naked, shivering with fear and cold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so dark that I could not see if don Juan and the two women were around. I heard a soft prolonged hissing from a source a few feet away from me; then I felt a cool breeze. I realized that &lt;strong&gt;Silvio Manuel was exhaling his breath all over my body&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He then asked me to sit on my clothes and look at a bright point which I could easily distinguish in the darkness, a point that seemed to give out a faint amber light. I stared at it for what seemed hours, until I suddenly realized that the point of brightness was Silvio Manuel&amp;#39;s left eye. I could then make out the contour of his whole face and his body.&lt;/strong&gt; The hall was not as dark as it had seemed. Silvio Manuel advanced to me and helped me up. To see in the dark with such clarity enthralled me. I did not even mind that I was naked or that, as I then saw, the two women were watching me. Apparently they could also see in the dark; they were staring at me. I wanted to put on my pants, but Zoila snatched them out of my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two women and Silvio Manuel stared at me for a long time. Then don Juan came out of nowhere, handed me my shoes, and Zoila led us through a corridor to an open patio with trees. I made out the dark silhouette of a woman standing in the middle of the patio. Don Juan spoke to her and she mumbled something in reply. He told me that she was a southerly woman, that her name was Marta, and that she was a courier to the two westerly women. Marta said that she could bet I had never been introduced to a woman while I was naked; that the normal procedure is to get acquainted and then undress. She laughed out loud. Her laughter was so pleasing, so clear and youthful, that it sent chills through me; it reverberated through the whole house, enhanced by the darkness and the silence there. I looked to don Juan for support. He was gone and so was Silvio Manuel. I was alone with the three women. I became very nervous and asked Marta if she knew where don Juan had gone. At that precise moment, &lt;strong&gt;someone grabbed the skin of my armpits. I yelled with pain. I knew that it was Silvio Manuel.&lt;/strong&gt; He lifted me up as if I weighed nothing and shook my shoes off me. Then he stood me in a shallow tub of ice-cold water that came up to my knees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remained in the tub for a long time while all of them scrutinized me. Then Silvio Manuel lifted me up again and set me down next to my shoes, which someone had neatly placed next to the tub.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s with Silvio Manuel grabbing people by the nape of the neck and the skin of the armpits?

It seems to discourage, rather than motivate new people, to focus on anything beyond finding colors and using tensegrity to play with the puffs.\n\nBut it's good to understand how sorcery works.\n\nSo here goes:\n\nPhysicists are not wrong about everything we see being made out of something much smaller.\n\nFor a while, they even theorized that at some level everything was made from superstrings.\n\nI can't recall what happened to that, but it may have been a woman adding #11 to their list of 10 things, and messing it all up.\n\nNow everything seems to be made out of donuts, when I try to check the latest.\n\nI'm fine with that!  I can't eat them, but I do LOVE donuts.\n\nSo whatever our reality is made out of, it's not what we think it is.\n\nWe get stuck at our level of comprehension, obsess over it, and it all seems very \"real\" to us.\n\nAnd who cares if \"solid matter\" is mostly empty space?\n\nDoesn't have any effect on our daily life.\n\nExcept, that's by choice. Not by design.\n\nOur original design was to be more \"flexible\" than we are now.  We seem to have been designed to produce a doppelg\u00e4nger of ourselves.  One with nearly infinite power.\n\nOur dreamer.  The one you can bring out into the real copy of reality (the one our physical body has come to like).  When you bring it out (and you will if you follow instructions), it's quite simply another \"you\".\n\nAn \"evil twin\" perhaps.\n\nBut what on earth is that one \"made out of\"???\n\nAnd trust me on this one, Cholita has a doppleganger and it can poke you in the arm.\n\nI doubt it could punch as hard as the real Cholita, who is Howard Lee trained.\n\nBut just the fact that her double can walk right through a solid wall while you watch, and poke you on the arm and you feel it, is scary enough for me.\n\nAnd seems to indicate, we don't really know what's going on.\n\nIt has no solid matter...\n\nSo what's really up is, we're made out of superstrings.  The physicists were right all along.\n\nOr at least, they had a good analogy.\n\nIn our case, the strings are called \"The Emanations\", and you can literally \"see them with your own eyes\".\n\nIf you belong to a magic system that's all theory and \"wise sayings\", ditch it.\n\nIf you can't see it, and do it, and can only drool when you hear about their guru who supposedly can do it, then run as fast as you can.\n\nGive the Guru a little kick on the shin for me, on the way out.  Not a lot.  Just enough so that he no longer \"owes\" you, and has paid for his crimes.\n\nAs a sorcerer if you don't do that, you might have to go back later for payback.\n\nReal magic is...   Real!\n\nSo it turns out, everything is made out of something that can be perceived by us, as strings stretching every which way into infinity.\n\nCarlos said none of the strings touch, but I can't see in that much detail.  Looks like they're not only touching to me, but engaged in rude public embracing and hugging.\n\nThey get so close together that the glow of awareness flowing through them, like electricity, spills to the next and pretty soon you have thin \"smoke trails\".\n\nAnd not just filaments of light.\n\nNow keep in mind, the view of the \"emanations\" can't really use the eyes.\n\nThey're too tiny and weird to show up with a photosensitive device like eyeballs.\n\nYou can only perceive them in \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nIt's telepathic knowledge, beamed into your mind by the emanations themselves.\n\nI know that sounds nuts, but consider that we're made out of those too.\n\nSo the ones we have just know about themselves, and what methods of viewing them individually are possible.\n\nIf you get a gift from intent in the form of a lesson about the emanations, you'll see a few isolated ones right there, in front of you.\n\nIt's like a parent setting an infant's toy in front of them.  Maybe it just teaches colors, and the baby only has to push the big blue button to hear, \"Blue!\"\n\nIn a chipmunk voice.\n\nIf he pushes the red button, he hears \"Red!\" in the voice of a lion.\n\nThe force of \"intent\", or \"The Spirit\" wants to teach us.\n\nSo it does things like that.\n\nAnd you might find yourself with 4 \"emanation\" fragments, right before your eyes.\n\nNow that's very \"far out there\" when you perceive it, and impossible to describe in the same way as the infant toy with the big buttons.\n\nBut somehow you touch each of the 4, to see what happens.\n\nAnd each one contains a TINY feeling.\n\nA fragment of feeling so small, you can't even describe it.\n\nIf you put 1000 together, you might simulate the feeling of your finger sliding on oil, on glass.\n\nBut it would take MANY of them, to produce anything you could actually describe.\n\nAnd how you \"touch\" them to activate the feeling, is not actually that physical.\n\nThat's not to say that if you are an accomplished sorcerer, you can't summon a view of  the emanations and use your fingers to alter reality.\n\nYou can!\n\nBut even that is not really what's going on. It's just a \"convenient method\" you can learn, to change things at that level.\n\nSo our reality is created by what Carlos scientifically described as \"Zillions\" of emanations.\n\nOut of the zillions, only some of them will be the ones you are \"touching\", as in that example I gave of the 4 choices intent might present you, so you can learn about them.\n\nYou \"touch\" them with the only thing you have:  Awareness.\n\nThat awareness the Eagle encased in an egg, when he created you.\n\nNow the tonal you, your physical body version, can focus it's awareness and \"touch\" the emanations.\n\nBut so can your doppelganger.  The other you.\n\nAnd even cooler is, you can split that doppleganger you into at least 8 pieces, each one retaining enough \"sentience\" to function in some limited fashion, as a \"being\".\n\nUsing Pandora's box tensegrity pass,  you can even form \"Golems\".  Phantom copies of your dreaming double, which only use a tiny bit. But which are sentient.\n\nAnd hopefully \"evil\".  Otherwise, what's the fun?\n\nBut if you like, you could make an angel.\n\nThus when you talk about the emanations and how we touch them, it gets very complicated to figure out what the possible results are.\n\nThat's why shapeshifting is so confusing.  Are you in the physical body half?  Or in the half belonging to that doppelganger?\n\nYou can't tell!  You simply walk smoothly from being in the physical half into some kind of beast, and go outside to play.\n\nAt no point do you dramatically transform, fall over, pass out and have a bad dream.\n\nYou just change into something else, probably not even realizing that, and when you go play in that form you notice it's not really the normal \"you\".  Perhaps it can lift an entire car in your driveway, with one  hand.\n\nI've done that!\n\nCholita possibly dropped something important under her car, I got  tired of worrying about it, so I left the darkroom to go outside and look.  It's hard to practice darkroom when you are worried about something.\n\nIt seemed reasonable at the time to just lift the car and look, rather than stoop down that low on the cold hard driveway.  It was the middle of the night.\n\nI didn't even realize that wasn't possible.\n\nAnd so you might yourself do something similar, come back to your dark room still not noticing anything unusual, turn on the lights and go have some water.\n\nNo transition.  And no explanation for how that happened.\n\nIt's confusing once you get down to the level of the emanations, and all the possibilities there are to manipulate and experience those.\n\nBut the key point here is it's your awareness, the only thing you really possess, charging up specific emanations like it was electricity charging up a machine, which produces the feeling that things are real and you are somewhere, in some kind of a body.\n\nIgnoring that you can be in as many as 9 places at once if you split the awareness of the double, we can look at how the awareness goes out and creates a reality and a body for us.\n\nThat's the picture that comes with this post.\n\nAnd I didn't mean to say we can discuss that here.  That we can \"look at this as an interesting topic of discussion\".\n\nI surely can't do that.  I have no idea how to explain any of this.\n\nI meant, you can literally look at it with your own eyes.\n\nOnce you get so silent that the world goes away.\n\nIn darkness, it's a lot easier.\n\nThe darkness will be replaced by a view of infinite lines stretching every which way.\n\nIf you gaze at the lines, you start to see \"details\".\n\nA little view of a ghostlike town materializes, barely perceptible.\n\nIf you can retain your lucidity, not get \"irrational\" so that you stop judging things, you can relax, and that ghostlike reality will become more solid looking.\n\nBut if you go \"irrational\" you can fall asleep on the spot, still standing up with your eyes open, and it becomes a full on dream. As real as anything.\n\nBut of course, you're now in sleeping dreaming and a complete idiot.\n\nSo you might find you suddenly have a \"best friend\" standing right there, in an amazing Cinderella costume.\n\nYour ally!\n\nI don't recommend going there too often.\n\nBest to stay in the middle.  Don't stray off to the sides of the J curve.\n\nFrom the middle of that J shaped path you can go up or down, to make \"major\" changes to reality.\n\nAnd one is to view the emanations in their \"raw\" form, sort of like that picture.\n\nThe emanations go randomly in all directions. They don't look like a Star Trek warp speed view of space.\n\nThat was just the best I could find on short notice.\n\nNow watching those raw emanations and looking for \"twinkles\" of another reality starting to form in them, if you get lucky some cat outside your darkroom will decide the neighbor cat has disrespected him, and you'll get a very creepy moaning sound.  The angry cat in heat sound.\n\nThat's pretty scary if you are in darkness, playing with supernatural forces.\n\nThe fright will knock your assemblage point even looser than it is, and a huge burst of your awareness will focus on that sound, to see if it's dangerous.\n\nAll without you consciously doing that.\n\nAnd if you are very silent, and have been at this a long time so that fright is only good for a half second, you can see your awareness actually flow across the emanations to cause them to form a new reality.\n\nIn the case of this picture, it lets you see right through the solid wall so you can find the source of that scary noise outside in your front yard.\n\nYou'll get to see, visibly, how awareness flows into the emanations, and why that causes a change in reality.\n\nAll without a single \"Sacred Scroll\"!\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What is Emanation Skimming?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qc4flkrs5hp91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb20d6d2bcc90be32616bcc583bf91b8870d9e9d"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17868c0252bcfaf660cdbb0364df7b850ad88cea"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2761845db7e41e4240b5fcac7f1753c5d7d9ac15"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c5f4ba289402b41419b80ded137e3c6237c95e4"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a29be2b972d53f96304190beb905afcc27eb1640"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4194627ed2bdc83bcda34ae7e2db5f8bc194d087"}], "s": {"y": 1200, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faeb7f2b167795932d7a78df748558ff09799573"}, "id": "qc4flkrs5hp91"}}, "name": "t3_xle440", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/dceNSI-cschfKcWnhC19d10wjxtLPqPHN9J3Fb1t-hY.jpg", "edited": 1663884336.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1663882537.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=faeb7f2b167795932d7a78df748558ff09799573\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qc4flkrs5hp91.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=faeb7f2b167795932d7a78df748558ff09799573&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made the picture for the advanced subreddit, where it explains what&amp;#39;s going on here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a bit too advanced for this subreddit.

And no explanation for how that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s confusing once you get down to the level of the emanations, and all the possibilities there are to manipulate and experience those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the key point here is it&amp;#39;s your awareness, the only thing you really possess, charging up specific emanations like it was electricity charging up a machine, which produces the feeling that things are real and you are somewhere, in some kind of a body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignoring that you can be in as many as 9 places at once if you split the awareness of the double, we can look at how the awareness goes out and creates a reality and a body for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the picture that comes with this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;#39;t mean to say we can discuss that here.  That we can &amp;quot;look at this as an interesting topic of discussion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I surely can&amp;#39;t do that.  I have no idea how to explain any of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I meant, you can literally look at it with your own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you get so silent that the world goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In darkness, it&amp;#39;s a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The darkness will be replaced by a view of infinite lines stretching every which way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you gaze at the lines, you start to see &amp;quot;details&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little view of a ghostlike town materializes, barely perceptible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can retain your lucidity, not get &amp;quot;irrational&amp;quot; so that you stop judging things, you can relax, and that ghostlike reality will become more solid looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you go &amp;quot;irrational&amp;quot; you can fall asleep on the spot, still standing up with your eyes open, and it becomes a full on dream. As real as anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course, you&amp;#39;re now in sleeping dreaming and a complete idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you might find you suddenly have a &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; standing right there, in an amazing Cinderella costume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your ally!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t recommend going there too often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best to stay in the middle.  Don&amp;#39;t stray off to the sides of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the middle of that J shaped path you can go up or down, to make &amp;quot;major&amp;quot; changes to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one is to view the emanations in their &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot; form, sort of like that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emanations go randomly in all directions. They don&amp;#39;t look like a Star Trek warp speed view of space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was just the best I could find on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now watching those raw emanations and looking for &amp;quot;twinkles&amp;quot; of another reality starting to form in them, if you get lucky some cat outside your darkroom will decide the neighbor cat has disrespected him, and you&amp;#39;ll get a very creepy moaning sound.  The angry cat in heat sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty scary if you are in darkness, playing with supernatural forces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fright will knock your assemblage point even looser than it is, and a huge burst of your awareness will focus on that sound, to see if it&amp;#39;s dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All without you consciously doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you are very silent, and have been at this a long time so that fright is only good for a half second, you can see your awareness actually flow across the emanations to cause them to form a new reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of this picture, it lets you see right through the solid wall so you can find the source of that scary noise outside in your front yard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll get to see, visibly, how awareness flows into the emanations, and why that causes a change in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All without a single &amp;quot;Sacred Scroll&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "f2d3e494-6005-11ea-be90-0ed931fcda17", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "xle440", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xle440/what_is_emanation_skimming/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/xle440/what_is_emanation_skimming/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1663882537.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ipu9u54", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ipt96t0", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Never pretend your magic and you'll learn eventually, if you want to.\n\nAll the \"traps\" out  there for chickens who want to escape from the coop, so they don't just sit around waiting to be food, are based on a willingness to pretend.\n\nBuddhists pretend, and so they never get past the green line.

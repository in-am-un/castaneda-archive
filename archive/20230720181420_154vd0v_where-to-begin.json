We've been here around 4 years, and it's a known fact.\n\nEven though, learning in here is just the same amount of time you'd have to put in, to compete as a surfer in Huntington Beach. Not win. Just qualify for a contest.\n\nIt's the same amount of time to learn to play trumpet in a lounge act in Vegas, if you only have 6 months to learn the trumpet from scratch.\n\nOr the amount people who love basketball as a hobby put in playing with their buddies each night.\n\nOnly 1 in 100 will do it.\n\nThen on top of that, MOST of those will figure out what magic really is, actually see some themselves, be forever changed in that they know everything else out there is a total scam.\n\nBut they'll give up anyway.\n\nSorcery is not \"cozy\".  Sorcery realms get less and less human, and there's no company there unless you get lucky and know someone else who's serious.\n\nWhich is as I estimated, 1 in 500 who pretend to be interested.  So the chances of having any companions on the path, is close to 0.\n\nThere are spirits for friends,  and it's guaranteed you'll have those.\n\nBut they're kind of weird. \n\n Jadey and I trade a magical squirrel back and forth.  A pet of the witch Cholita.\n\nBut he's more of a prankster than a friend.\n\nWe got him from Carlos Castaneda and he took a fancy to Cholita, because she's completely mad.\n\nSo bottom line, if you find it hard to figure out from all the material in here you have no chance at all to learn.\n\nAnd since this isn't a business, and no one makes money in any way, we have no motivation to welcome dead weight and pamper them as you ask.\n\nFor that you should go to the fake magic subreddits like Dzogchen, Zen, Daoism, Astral Travel, Magick, Bardon and too many more to even name them.\n\nIn those, someone has their hand out looking to take your money. \n\nSo you get welcomed with open arms there.\n\nYou'll never learn any real magic, but most people are happy to just pretend they have some so they can get attention.  We fight that battle to keep those out of here, weekly. With an average of 3 who have to be kicked out for attention seeking by pretending success.\n\nThe ideal student for sorcery was described by don Juan in Mexico City, at a restaurant that had outdoor seating.  Probably in the 70s.\n\nCarlos and him were eating there, and there was a small crowd of children who would run over when a Businessman left the lunch table, and eat any left over food.  \n\nThey even licked the plates.  The restaurant owner knew that was their only food, so as long as they didn't break anything he let them do it.\n\nCarlos felt sorry for the children.\n\nBut don Juan said, didn't Carlos tell him that the highest achievement of man, was to become a sorcerer. For real?\n\nCarlos said yes. And he still believed that.\n\nSo don Juan told him, the businessmen are hopeless.  They'll never be able to learn sorcery.\n\nIt's the kids licking the plates who have the best chance.

All techniques, with magical effects so you know what you&amp;#39;ll get, if you put in the practice time to learn to remove your internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for now, only 1 in 100 who subscribe to this subreddit are willing to do enough work to learn. We&amp;#39;ve been here around 4 years, and it&amp;#39;s a known fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though, learning in here is just the same amount of time you&amp;#39;d have to put in, to compete as a surfer in Huntington Beach. Not win. Just qualify for a contest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same amount of time to learn to play trumpet in a lounge act in Vegas, if you only have 6 months to learn the trumpet from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the amount people who love basketball as a hobby put in playing with their buddies each night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only 1 in 100 will do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then on top of that, MOST of those will figure out what magic really is, actually see some themselves, be forever changed in that they know everything else out there is a total scam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;ll give up anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is not &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot;.  Sorcery realms get less and less human, and there&amp;#39;s no company there unless you get lucky and know someone else who&amp;#39;s serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is as I estimated, 1 in 500 who pretend to be interested.  So the chances of having any companions on the path, is close to 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are spirits for friends,  and it&amp;#39;s guaranteed you&amp;#39;ll have those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re kind of weird. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jadey and I trade a magical squirrel back and forth.  A pet of the witch Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#39;s more of a prankster than a friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got him from Carlos Castaneda and he took a fancy to Cholita, because she&amp;#39;s completely mad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So bottom line, if you find it hard to figure out from all the material in here you have no chance at all to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since this isn&amp;#39;t a business, and no one makes money in any way, we have no motivation to welcome dead weight and pamper them as you ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that you should go to the fake magic subreddits like Dzogchen, Zen, Daoism, Astral Travel, Magick, Bardon and too many more to even name them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In those, someone has their hand out looking to take your money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you get welcomed with open arms there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll never learn any real magic, but most people are happy to just pretend they have some so they can get attention.  We fight that battle to keep those out of here, weekly. With an average of 3 who have to be kicked out for attention seeking by pretending success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ideal student for sorcery was described by don Juan in Mexico City, at a restaurant that had outdoor seating.  Probably in the 70s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos and him were eating there, and there was a small crowd of children who would run over when a Businessman left the lunch table, and eat any left over food.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even licked the plates.  The restaurant owner knew that was their only food, so as long as they didn&amp;#39;t break anything he let them do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos felt sorry for the children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don Juan said, didn&amp;#39;t Carlos tell him that the highest achievement of man, was to become a sorcerer. For real?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos said yes. And he still believed that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don Juan told him, the businessmen are hopeless.  They&amp;#39;ll never be able to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the kids licking the plates who have the best chance. They already know this reality is shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false,

Now you practice this inner silence in increasing intervals, like you\u2019re working out at the gym.\n\n2) Darkroom. Get some blackout curtains, aluminum foil, and sleep masks that have cups to keep your eyelashes from touching. Cover up all electronics that you don\u2019t want to turn off, cover up openings with the foil and masking tape you can easily take off without ruining the walls. You should not be able to see your hand in front of your face. The face mask is there just in case you cannot make a complete darkroom.

It takes a while to move the assemblage point enough to \"feel the flow of the tensegrity\".\n\nIf you get a collection to produce results, you can create other \"collections\".\n\nThe idea is to \"follow instructions precisely\", just for your own protection from yourself.\n\nAnd then to \"play with it\".\n\nIn my case I have several \"series\" of passes I do, for various results.\n\nOne bathes me in pure intense colors I know where to find, on the outside of my luminous container.\n\nIt's stunning!  Imagine pouring pure intense colors over yourself which  you \"snatched\" out of the darkness.  And then moving them around with you palm to alter reality right in front of you.

I suppose beginners don&amp;#39;t realize, those &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; are sentient. Alive and aware.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I became interested in experimenting with drumming because the tensegrity alone, along with the forced silence, did not make the poufs appear.&lt;br/&gt;\nYou mentioned that it might be a good idea to move the assemblage point, so I started doing this in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not dispute that the pouffes are alive, conscious. It&amp;#39;s just that, despite the great effort I put into practice, they are still missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Think of them more like those cartoon &amp;quot;minions&amp;quot;. Minions will do what you like. They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;all in&amp;quot; for any evil plans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I had such experiences right after the darkroom, but they took place in my dream. When I was completely exhausted, I fell asleep. These were dreams in which I met creatures like minions or colorful jelly beans. Dream was very fun and I did all kinds of things with them. Most of it was laughter and fun. Even though the experience was interesting, I still try to get it with my eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If you want &amp;quot;the puffs&amp;quot; to help you, you have to do what they like. Give them a reason to help. You&amp;#39;ve been kicking their ass your whole life. So you need to learn how to spend &amp;quot;quality time&amp;quot; with your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The question is how to do this? There is not much room for maneuver in the darkroom, forcing silence and doing tensegrity. It doesn&amp;#39;t work for me yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You sat there in &amp;quot;grief and worry&amp;quot;, playing the drum and wishing it would work. For dubious reasons I might add.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Speaking of my attitude, I was expecting something to happen, that I would move my assemblage point somewhere else where the magic would become real. However, this is just a description of it after the fact. At the moment, I did not expect any effects, if I force silence, I quench all expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; So it&amp;#39;s ok, but you have to take that into account. That part of how shamanic drumming works, is &amp;quot;who is doing the drumming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- At some point, I have the feeling that I am not playing. That I just watch while the stick strikes itself. It is a pleasant state, but then there is physical body sensation and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;surrendering&amp;quot; your internal dialogue in part, to someone who you believe has more power than you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- what do you mean ? Who is someone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Try finding tensegrity moves which can be done, beating the drum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I can&amp;#39;t imagine making tensegrity moves while playing the drum.

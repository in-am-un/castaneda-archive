If you keep insisting and force yourself to shut off the internal dialogue, the pain will even pull you along sideways, which will loosen the assemblage point, and let it drop more than you realize.\n\nBut you'll be sideways, so you won't derive the pleasure from having it move down to the green zone, which is the first goal.\n\nSometimes pain leads to unusual rewards.\n\nI was pretty much attacked by an angry witch yesterday.  It was Cholita, but usually she flees from me, and I hide if she doesn't, so we don't conflict.\n\nBut she ran away to the mountains to \"escape the radiation\" in the low lands, and I had to go jump start her car.\n\nWe ended up at dinner together.\n\nI picked up so much dark energy, that when it was time to practice, I found myself just a smudge on a large piece of grey cloth.  Seemed to be a coat.\n\nI was stuck focusing on nothing but a round spot on the coat, which corresponded to  intense pain in my stomach.\n\nCold be something as simple as Cholita has covid. She's an anti-vaxer, but not for political reasons. Just doesn't trust the government.\n\nI dealt with the intense pain by trying to force myself silent enough for my assemblage point to move down, but it was hopeless.\n\nThe huge cloth shrunk in size in stages, until after a couple of  hours, it was small enough to pull away with my hand.  I tossed it to the ground, inside the second attention, and Cholita was standing there waiting.\n\nShe took me down the J curve as if it were a passage way or corridor.\n\nAnd demonstrated how women can sneak through, by focusing on the walls instead of the details. Given a destination, they can sort of form their own passage to that point, even if they don't have the sorcery skills to do that yet.\n\nOut of that pain, I got even better results that night.\n\nStill hurt like hell though!\n\nAnd this morning, I got lost on the road, just blocks from my home.

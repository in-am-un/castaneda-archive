And although dopameany's user name is obviously a bad player indicator, I didn't remember him except as possibly being a guy who liked to downvote my stuff in the background, because he had American Indian blood, and I made him unhappy.\n\nI asked Techno who he was, and techno looked it up and said what I just said, and commented he hadn't been banned yet so there's nothing to do but see.\n\nIt seems that both dopameany and stoopid believed  running guy's claim that he'd arranged a debate with me (I never heard even a single word about it, probably because running man knew I'd obviously tell him he was insane, and go away.\n\nSo dopameany was hung out to dry.  He'd already put up this glorious post proving that native shamanism was superior, but there was no \"after the show party\".\n\nWhen I commented here and it was obvious he hadn't actually scored any points, his head started to explode. And he found more and more \"proof\" to post.\n\nOddly, a technique running man used before his first ban.  Flood the place with only his posts.\n\nHow much running man was controlling dopameany would be interesting, but such people are never self-aware enough to fess up after the fact.\n\nIt's so easy to say, \"my bad!\".  How come they never do it???\n\nProof of what, Dopameany was trying to post,  and for what, I can't figure.\n\nHis native American privilege?\n\nMakes no sense to me.  If you want to learn, have at it. But don't cause trouble for others.\n\nNone of his nutty posts seems to have satisfied him, so he finally went for an \"outside authority\", thinking Sadhguru would set us all straight.\n\nWhich is a little odd, because I used Sadhguru in a picture of frauds.\n\nAnd the post titles dopameany used, were basically the opposite of what I've been telling people, to try to get them free from nonsense.\n\nThat there's NOTHING out there.  Dopameany posted that sorcery is all over the place and easy to find.\n\nI have to think running man was manipulating him even more than is obvious.\n\nMaybe dopameany is quite young?  Like, 14?\n\nBut running guy is no genius. I suspect that's half his problem.  Besides the mental illness.\n\n(trying to get them all to go harm people somewhere else).\n\nDopameany posted 4 topics not really appropriate for this subreddit (the first was sort of ok, but hurt his point of view rather than helping it).\n\nHe even got the word, \"white\" in one of them, an obvious attempt to raise the racist stakes by showing how even a white man bows to the power of native americans.\n\nI didn't look at the post, but that seems to have been the intent.\n\nHe's jumping from one thing to the other, to prove he deserves respect in here.\n\nSo dopameany isn't worth anyone feeling sorry for him.\n\nHe's only here to hurt people. He will NEVER decide to actually learn, and if he pretended to, I pity whoever tries to help him by answering questions.\n\nThe shamanism subreddit seems to be filled with \"dabblers\", who are taking a bit of this, a bit of that, and making their own new, great, \"system\".\n\nAs part of their rise to power.\n\nSo if they ask you, \"Isn't this just like the red chakra?\", and you tell them the truth, there are no chakras, that's all made up, they explode and threaten murder.  Then, oddly, they calm down in the next sentence, and try to force you to see their point of view.\n\nIt's like an abusive husband, threatening hiss wife with violence, and then giving her a hug afterwards.\n\nBullying will continue to work in the world of magic, until people realize it's important to stand up to it.\n\nNever back down!  Never stand on the sides!  If you're worried you don't understand, then just ask the bully a question designed to find out his motives.\n\nWe all hung Carlos out to dry on his death.\n\nYou got a second chance.  Value it. It's not free (Cholita and I pay the price for it).\n\nNow, if someone else had posted this post about his shaman idol, it would have been well received.\n\nWe get those sorts of \"topic of interest\" posts all the time.\n\nI might even have gone to find Lowell Bean's anthropology book on shamans, and how they talk.    He was a contemporary with Carlos, at the same Indian reservation Joanie Baker took Carlos to.\n\nBut when the post has a clearly bad motivation behind it, namely attention seeking, that's when it gets into trouble. \n\nEspecially with an aggressive title designed to stick a pin in an imaginary someone else.\n\nAnd it must be called out!\n\nIt's very difficult to maintain this place such that it's capable of teaching magic to new people.\n\nI'm not here of my own free will.  If I can't help here, because it's taken over by bad men, I have to leave.\n\nSo women...  I'm sorry that you don't like male fighting, but unless you want to help suppress bullies (women can do it so much better), please think more clearly about what's going on in here.  If we look the other way for aggressive behavior, that will be the end of this place.  And you'll have to go back to Facebook surfing.\n\nThe beginners are what I worry about.\n\nThese 3 probably took down at least 2 people from the shamanism subreddit who just recently came to look here. I got beat up for a while, just to give them the chance to look in here.\n\nThese 3 are murderers in my book. It's that serious to me.\n\nTo Carlos also. When one of his talented female students was kidnapped by her brothers, he started saying she was dead.\n\nShe came to visit in her energy body.  It was brown.\n\nThat's when he'd comment she was dead, possibly so she could hear.\n\nHowever, his private classes took it as delusional behavior, because he was  upset her family had \"deprogrammed\" her.\n\nThat's what we're up against here.\n\nThe only question I have after all this, is did Running man hold the \"debate\" anyway, and declare victory because his opponent (supposedly me) was too afraid to show up?\n\nI kind of think that is likely to have happened.  He started out with that made up thing about him teaching the proper  use of power plants in this subreddit, and being persecuted because I was jealous of his profound knowledge.\n\nHe also held an entire conversation with me that never took place.  Where he believed I had agreed to debate him, so he could restore his reputation and get back into this subreddit.\n\nI suspect he could easily debate himself.\n\nCholita does.  \n\nBut she never seems to win the debates.  And when it goes badly for her, I suspect Minx steps in to comfort her. (for real).\n\nNext time, running man, get yourself a lizard to sit on your shoulder, and debate that in my place.\n\nWhile sipping devil's weed tea.\n\nYou could hit it on the head saying, \"Bad Dan!\" when  you think it's debate points are bad.\n\nYou might get a crossover audience for that one!", "edited": 1630937577.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hbt34qi", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I missed some details in my account of how dopameany came to mount this racist attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want anyone thinking he just got picked on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last week some complained to me that in private chat, one of the three men involved in this plot was trying to lure them to some bizarre ranting subreddit of running man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be darkroom, but &amp;quot;better than Dans&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think his grand launch failed, and it&amp;#39;s just videos of his sickly looking face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When that didn&amp;#39;t work, I started to  hear that stoopidengine was planning some kind of group participation event, and wanted people from here to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was asked whether to block him, or keep an eye on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, with the same 15 minutes as dopameany&amp;#39;s first post (I didn&amp;#39;t look), I got a bizarre private chat request from him, saying something like, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s about to begin, stoopidengine is almost ready.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get beat up in private chat all the time, so I refused it.

He was a contemporary with Carlos, at the same Indian reservation Joanie Baker took Carlos to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when the post has a clearly bad motivation behind it, namely attention seeking, that&amp;#39;s when it gets into trouble. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially with an aggressive title designed to stick a pin in an imaginary someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it must be called out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very difficult to maintain this place such that it&amp;#39;s capable of teaching magic to new people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not here of my own free will.  If I can&amp;#39;t help here, because it&amp;#39;s taken over by bad men, I have to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So women...  I&amp;#39;m sorry that you don&amp;#39;t like male fighting, but unless you want to help suppress bullies (women can do it so much better), please think more clearly about what&amp;#39;s going on in here.  If we look the other way for aggressive behavior, that will be the end of this place.  And you&amp;#39;ll have to go back to Facebook surfing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The beginners are what I worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These 3 probably took down at least 2 people from the shamanism subreddit who just recently came to look here. I got beat up for a while, just to give them the chance to look in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These 3 are murderers in my book. It&amp;#39;s that serious to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To Carlos also. When one of his talented female students was kidnapped by her brothers, he started saying she was dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She came to visit in her energy body.  It was brown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when he&amp;#39;d comment she was dead, possibly so she could hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, his private classes took it as delusional behavior, because he was  upset her family had &amp;quot;deprogrammed&amp;quot; her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re up against here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only question I have after all this, is did Running man hold the &amp;quot;debate&amp;quot; anyway, and declare victory because his opponent (supposedly me) was too afraid to show up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of think that is likely to have happened.  He started out with that made up thing about him teaching the proper  use of power plants in this subreddit, and being persecuted because I was jealous of his profound knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also held an entire conversation with me that never took place.  Where he believed I had agreed to debate him, so he could restore his reputation and get back into this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect he could easily debate himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita does.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she never seems to win the debates.  And when it goes badly for her, I suspect Minx steps in to comfort her. (for real).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time, running man, get yourself a lizard to sit on your shoulder, and debate that in my place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While sipping devil&amp;#39;s weed tea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could hit it on the head saying, &amp;quot;Bad Dan!&amp;quot; when  you think it&amp;#39;s debate points are bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might get a crossover audience for that one!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pikehk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pikehk/magic_is_real_and_the_native_americans_have_it/hbt34qi/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1630935916.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1630935916.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hbssltz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1630929886.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hbssdi3", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "continued.\n\nBut schizophrenic men only destroy things.\n\nrunning guy has no qualms about lying, and convinced techno I'd agreed to debate him.

Never learned anything other than getting high and running around with whatever buddies he can come up with.   Believed he had a \"benefactor\", meaning some bad man took advantage of him.\n\nCan't get an honest answer out of him, but possibly Reni and Carol didn't have enough money, so they were doing Jungian shadow therapy.\n\nrunning must have taken some therapy, and on the basis of that came here pretending to be a friend of Carol, which initially got him lots of attention. Until he started posting bizarre stuff, like how you should lay across a grave with a knife to your throat, so you could pretend  you completed the \"shamanic death\" technique.\n\nThat's a bogus placebo technique sold by phony shamans, and which gives people who won't do any actual work, something to brag about in subreddits.\n\nIt's an intense mess out there!\n\nNaturally running got kicked out of here. He couldn't control himself.\n\nSo he went elsewhere and tried to get revenge.\n\nWhich included trying to pretend he had something of his own like darkroom, setting up a delusional subreddit with nothing but pictures of him, giving what I presume to be \"lessons\"j. He privatge chatted and tried to take people from here to his new subreddit.\n\nstoopidengine  came along later and also got tossed out for bad behavior.\n\nHe was never interested in learning at all.  Just came to cause trouble.\n\nSince being tossed out he's been hassling the shamanism subreddit, pretending to have knowledge.   And possibly trying to produce phony \"credentials\" based on having some Indian blood.  Racism in other words.\n\nI go all over the place hoping to \"rescue\" people from the river of filth out there.   We need 500 here, just to get one sorcerer.\n\nThere truly isn't anything at all in the other subreddits but repeats of the same old nonsense,  with no one actually expecting a magical system to produce magic.  Some in those are actually looking for magic, but the rest will attack. Because implying there's no magic  there hurts their self-image.  They aren't actually after magic. They want human attention and money.\n\nNaturally stoopidengine didn't like someone over there advocating that shamanism ought to actually produce what it claims.\n\nHe tried just being very annoying and horrible, the typical troll approach. Pretended he'd never been in here, ignored all previous arguments where he lost, and went back to thinking up anything h could, to be too horrible to tolerate.  He's like a big dog on a chain, growling and barking at people walking past his yard.  Because people are so timid about standing up to bullies, that technique works well, if you have a subreddit with MODs who are sleeping. Like the shamanism subreddit.\n\nWhen that didn't work, he started to hint around that since I wasn't native american, I had no knowledge.  We have a new person who seems aware of his claim to have some of that blood, so I suppose it's on his list of \"credentials\", the same way running man constantly looks for new pretend reasons everyone should admire him.  All his \"special\" teachers, and so on.\n\nI hope beginners can see through all this.  We're only here to teach actual magic, but as Carlos learned, you get attacked constantly for doing that.\n\nThe guy who posted this  has been lurking a while, doing mischief.  Fancies himself a native american, and thus looks down on what we're doing, not actually valuing magic.  Like those other 2, he wants attention and respect for something he hasn't actually done.\n\nWhen I didn't give up in the shamanism subreddit (we got a couple of promising new people), stoopid did some research, discovered running man, and decided to do some \"trickster\" stuff.\n\nBad men with no sorcery knowledge like to bully others, to produce fake attention for phony magic, and one thing they commonly do is justify harming others by claiming they're trickster sorcerers.  There were some in private classes too.\n\nSo he found some post he thought was appropriate, and commented there using my user name tag (the u/name thing).   So I'd get a notice to go there. He arranged for running guy to comment on his comment, and running guy tried to \"rehabilitate\" his reputation, by making up a new story of why he got tossed out of here.\n\nIt amounted to, his wonderful drug knowledge made me feel bad because I was teaching wrongly how to use drugs, so he got tossed out.  The drug sorcerer types like to promote themselves in that way, and I suppose he might even have convinced himself that story is true. He seems to be moderately schizophrenic.\n\nCholita does the same. If she feels bad for doing something obviously wrong, it's so painful to her schizophrenic cross wiring of her brain, she creates a delusion to \"solve\" the delima.\n\nSo stoopid and running guy cooked up a scheme to get me to come argue with them in the shamanism subreddit.\n\nRunning guy seemed to be controlling stoopid, which is surprising.  And between the two of them, they enlisted this poster, dopameany. \n\n I think that in order to create that alliance, running guy cooked up a  scheme to give it a racist theme, which appealed to dopameany and stoopid both.  \n\nNot sure why running guy got native american approval in this situation.\n\nBut he got control over those 2.

Never learned anything other than getting high and running around with whatever buddies he can come up with.   Believed he had a &amp;quot;benefactor&amp;quot;, meaning some bad man took advantage of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t get an honest answer out of him, but possibly Reni and Carol didn&amp;#39;t have enough money, so they were doing Jungian shadow therapy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;running must have taken some therapy, and on the basis of that came here pretending to be a friend of Carol, which initially got him lots of attention. Until he started posting bizarre stuff, like how you should lay across a grave with a knife to your throat, so you could pretend  you completed the &amp;quot;shamanic death&amp;quot; technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a bogus placebo technique sold by phony shamans, and which gives people who won&amp;#39;t do any actual work, something to brag about in subreddits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an intense mess out there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally running got kicked out of here. He couldn&amp;#39;t control himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he went elsewhere and tried to get revenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which included trying to pretend he had something of his own like darkroom, setting up a delusional subreddit with nothing but pictures of him, giving what I presume to be &amp;quot;lessons&amp;quot;j. He privatge chatted and tried to take people from here to his new subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;stoopidengine  came along later and also got tossed out for bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was never interested in learning at all.  Just came to cause trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since being tossed out he&amp;#39;s been hassling the shamanism subreddit, pretending to have knowledge.   And possibly trying to produce phony &amp;quot;credentials&amp;quot; based on having some Indian blood.  Racism in other words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go all over the place hoping to &amp;quot;rescue&amp;quot; people from the river of filth out there.   We need 500 here, just to get one sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There truly isn&amp;#39;t anything at all in the other subreddits but repeats of the same old nonsense,  with no one actually expecting a magical system to produce magic.  Some in those are actually looking for magic, but the rest will attack. Because implying there&amp;#39;s no magic  there hurts their self-image.  They aren&amp;#39;t actually after magic. They want human attention and money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally stoopidengine didn&amp;#39;t like someone over there advocating that shamanism ought to actually produce what it claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tried just being very annoying and horrible, the typical troll approach. Pretended he&amp;#39;d never been in here, ignored all previous arguments where he lost, and went back to thinking up anything h could, to be too horrible to tolerate.  He&amp;#39;s like a big dog on a chain, growling and barking at people walking past his yard.  Because people are so timid about standing up to bullies, that technique works well, if you have a subreddit with MODs who are sleeping. Like the shamanism subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When that didn&amp;#39;t work, he started to hint around that since I wasn&amp;#39;t native american, I had no knowledge.  We have a new person who seems aware of his claim to have some of that blood, so I suppose it&amp;#39;s on his list of &amp;quot;credentials&amp;quot;, the same way running man constantly looks for new pretend reasons everyone should admire him.  All his &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; teachers, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope beginners can see through all this.  We&amp;#39;re only here to teach actual magic, but as Carlos learned, you get attacked constantly for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy who posted this  has been lurking a while, doing mischief.  Fancies himself a native american, and thus looks down on what we&amp;#39;re doing, not actually valuing magic.  Like those other 2, he wants attention and respect for something he hasn&amp;#39;t actually done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I didn&amp;#39;t give up in the shamanism subreddit (we got a couple of promising new people), stoopid did some research, discovered running man, and decided to do some &amp;quot;trickster&amp;quot; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad men with no sorcery knowledge like to bully others, to produce fake attention for phony magic, and one thing they commonly do is justify harming others by claiming they&amp;#39;re trickster sorcerers.  There were some in private classes too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he found some post he thought was appropriate, and commented there using my user name tag (the &lt;a href=\"/u/name\"&gt;u/name&lt;/a&gt; thing).   So I&amp;#39;d get a notice to go there. He arranged for running guy to comment on his comment, and running guy tried to &amp;quot;rehabilitate&amp;quot; his reputation, by making up a new story of why he got tossed out of here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It amounted to, his wonderful drug knowledge made me feel bad because I was teaching wrongly how to use drugs, so he got tossed out.  The drug sorcerer types like to promote themselves in that way, and I suppose he might even have convinced himself that story is true. He seems to be moderately schizophrenic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita does the same. If she feels bad for doing something obviously wrong, it&amp;#39;s so painful to her schizophrenic cross wiring of her brain, she creates a delusion to &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; the delima.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So stoopid and running guy cooked up a scheme to get me to come argue with them in the shamanism subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Running guy seemed to be controlling stoopid, which is surprising.  And between the two of them, they enlisted this poster, dopameany. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that in order to create that alliance, running guy cooked up a  scheme to give it a racist theme, which appealed to dopameany and stoopid both.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure why running guy got native american approval in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he got control over those 2. His real plan was to &amp;quot;debate&amp;quot; me with techno moderating, where supposedly he&amp;#39;d defeat me in a debate, prove his superiority, and be welcomed back to the subreddit to take his rightful place as a powerful sorcerer. Which I suppose shows why  schizophrenic women are good for a sorcery group, but schizophrenic men are poison to it.  Cholita&amp;#39;s delusions are actually helpful to me.

BORING!\n\nI want demons and angels flying overhead and portals opening up on solid walls, allowing me to walk right inside.\n\nIt'll happen!\n\nFor beginners, don't drool too much.\n\nThere's an evil \"trick\" here.\n\nTo break the laws of physics, it seems you have to be mostly in your double.\n\nSo it's kind of like you are walking into a dream.  And your physical body is fine with that.  You don't fall over and harm yourself.\n\nIt just \"all works out\".\n\nAnd of course in a dream, even in the \"real world\", anything can happen.\n\nPlus there usually seems to be no one around to show off to.\n\nWhich is covered in the books.  Carlos and La Gorda at the bridge.\n\nOr Carlos at the ticket office.\n\nSo let's analyze.\n\nCan you shapeshift into a monster and prank people?\n\nAfter all it's April Fools day!\n\nUnlikely.\n\nThat's the sad truth.\n\nThat's not to say it's impossible to shapeshift into a skunk and knock on someone's front door.\n\nBut the double is in his own copy of reality, and by rough estimates from Carlos (which he didn't like giving), there's 10,000 alternate copies of reality at the blue line if you shift right from the center of Man's band, another different 10,000 at the green line, and more at the red line, and so on.\n\nAnd another 10,000 if you shift left, into \"the spiritual\".\n\nSo perhaps you can't simply \"beat someone over the head with a new reality\".\n\nThey have to have shifted their assemblage point also, or they won't perceive it.\n\nThat's partly what makes a witch and a sorcerer such a good combination.\n\nThe witches get an audience they don't normally have access to.\n\nThe old seers didn't like that part of needing a sorcerer to perceive their evil doings,  so they used scary tricks to get normal people (hopefully who had it coming) to shift down to the green line.\n\nFright will do it.\n\nThey set up a scary situation, waited for someone to come by, and once the person was afraid they sent their allies over to make matters even worse.\n\nIf the \"victim\" got even a glimpse of an inorganic being, their assemblage point would shift even further until they had 12 scary demons laying on top of them, holding them to the ground.\n\nIt's in that story of the 4 old seers who buried themselves under the big rock, to use it as a trap.\n\nOnce fright let their victim catch a glimpse of an inorganic being, which then got more real and caused their assemblage point to shift even further, the old seers could feast on their energy.\n\nLikely along with the allies, who also got a \"fix\".\n\nSound odd?\n\nNot really. If you saw \"Star Wars\", Yoda taught us how to do this.\n\nMore than once, with the addition of cartoons.\n\nHe sent poor Luke into a scary cave, telling him it was strong with the dark side of the force.\n\nIf he'd told him it was strong with Fairies, you could have expected a different result.\n\nLuke got in there, felt something odd, got out his lightsaber to protect himself, and Darth Vader managed to materialize.\n\nLater he found out, it was just him.\n\nA phantom.\n\nIf he'd listened to Yoda and left his weapon before going into the cave, he probably wouldn't have had such a frightening experience.\n\nYoda was trying to teach him not to give in to fear, so he could see what was actually going on.\n\nI hope someday we can figure out how the hell Star Wars got to be  a source of teaching for our community.  But it is!\n\nThere's another \"trick\" available to us, but I haven't figured it out yet.\n\nIf you \"shrink the tonal\", the double seems to be able to drag it along.\n\nSo that you can travel in the double, and \"wake up\" at the new location.\n\nPhysical body teleported!\n\nI've done it, but only for around 15 feet.\n\nMy entity Fancy tried to convince me this is how Native Americans could run at 500 miles per hour, which is actually documented in an account of the old west my father had in his weird library.\n\nWhich was very large for a home library.\n\nThe playboy magazines were hidden behind his favorite books, hoping we'd notice those as we stole the playboy.\n\nAh, the good old days.\n\nKids these days just bring up XHamster.  I can't imagine the effect that's going to have on their minds.\n\nBut outdoors there isn't just \"one\" thing.\n\nIt's not just phantom views caused by moving your assemblage point.\n\nThere are inorganic beings who live here, on planet.\n\nLittle Smoke (AKA Fairy) does not.\n\nShe's 46 billion light years away.\n\nBut her \"puffs\" can do what our puffs can do. Travel anywhere, and retain enough sentience to interact with us.\n\nThe inorganic beings who live here don't have to project themselves that far.\n\nAnd seem to just wander around like a small column of white or black smoke.\n\nCarol Tiggs gives account of that in some lecture notes.\n\nShe was curious if the other people would see a little storm cloud moving along the sidewalk, headed their way.\n\nNope.\n\nBut Carlos warned us about those.  He said if you had sweaty skin, they could steal energy from you.\n\nWhich is interesting, because Fairy can manipulate water.\n\nAnd when Fairy and Minx tried to \"save Carlos\" from his death, kidnapping him into their world, they used water to threaten him.\n\nCarlos knew that if he fell off the rocks he was hopping on, into the water, he was doomed.\n\nThat odd relationship they have to water allows them to make teapots gurgle to give \"agreements from the world around us\".\n\nOr water coolers burp.\n\nFairy can even make water in the shower flow at 45 degrees sideways.\n\nOr prevent a drop of water that's forming on a faucet, from falling.\n\nUntil it reaches what I estimate to be the 2 ounce mark, which might possibly be her limit on pushing physical matter.\n\nEven so you get a BIG water drop.   The size of a gold ball, almost.\n\nI'd LOVE to know if normal humans whose assemblage points haven't shifted, will perceive those things.\n\nYou might say, \"How could they not, if it's really happening!\"\n\nSeeing as how the water really is moved, and it's not just in a phantom copy of reality.\n\nWell, people CAN refuse to see that kind of thing.\n\nIf you get to see it, you'll find yourself \"ignoring it\" automatically.\n\nYou sort of shake your head slightly and convince yourself it was just a fast dream.\n\nAnd it's totally forgotten in around 60 seconds.\n\nWe filter our perception!\n\nCholita is the one who could experiment on other humans, and maybe she does.\n\nBut she won't talk. Someone did a big guilt trip on her, to never ever do magic others can see.\n\nBut other people are fine with the after effects.\n\nSo you can see Cholita move an object, and then someone else comes along and picks it up from the new location.\n\nYet they never notice that she moved it.\n\nAnd you can't question them.\n\nThey'd assume you were nuts.", "edited": 1680386489.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jel6hrx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see that stuff, but I&amp;#39;m a bit of a glutton.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just &amp;quot;note it&amp;quot;, and ignore it mostly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be a mistake, since you have to &amp;quot;treat things as real&amp;quot; to get the assemblage point to shift sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why it will be AWESOME when we get 10 real sorcerers, as defined by reaching to where Carlos instructed us to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Readers of Infinity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except...

Carlos and La Gorda at the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Carlos at the ticket office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s analyze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you shapeshift into a monster and prank people?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all it&amp;#39;s April Fools day!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the sad truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say it&amp;#39;s impossible to shapeshift into a skunk and knock on someone&amp;#39;s front door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the double is in his own copy of reality, and by rough estimates from Carlos (which he didn&amp;#39;t like giving), there&amp;#39;s 10,000 alternate copies of reality at the blue line if you shift right from the center of Man&amp;#39;s band, another different 10,000 at the green line, and more at the red line, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And another 10,000 if you shift left, into &amp;quot;the spiritual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So perhaps you can&amp;#39;t simply &amp;quot;beat someone over the head with a new reality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have to have shifted their assemblage point also, or they won&amp;#39;t perceive it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s partly what makes a witch and a sorcerer such a good combination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches get an audience they don&amp;#39;t normally have access to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers didn&amp;#39;t like that part of needing a sorcerer to perceive their evil doings,  so they used scary tricks to get normal people (hopefully who had it coming) to shift down to the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fright will do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They set up a scary situation, waited for someone to come by, and once the person was afraid they sent their allies over to make matters even worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the &amp;quot;victim&amp;quot; got even a glimpse of an inorganic being, their assemblage point would shift even further until they had 12 scary demons laying on top of them, holding them to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in that story of the 4 old seers who buried themselves under the big rock, to use it as a trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once fright let their victim catch a glimpse of an inorganic being, which then got more real and caused their assemblage point to shift even further, the old seers could feast on their energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likely along with the allies, who also got a &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sound odd?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not really. If you saw &amp;quot;Star Wars&amp;quot;, Yoda taught us how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than once, with the addition of cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sent poor Luke into a scary cave, telling him it was strong with the dark side of the force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;d told him it was strong with Fairies, you could have expected a different result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke got in there, felt something odd, got out his lightsaber to protect himself, and Darth Vader managed to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later he found out, it was just him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A phantom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;d listened to Yoda and left his weapon before going into the cave, he probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have had such a frightening experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yoda was trying to teach him not to give in to fear, so he could see what was actually going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope someday we can figure out how the hell Star Wars got to be  a source of teaching for our community.  But it is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; available to us, but I haven&amp;#39;t figured it out yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you &amp;quot;shrink the tonal&amp;quot;, the double seems to be able to drag it along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you can travel in the double, and &amp;quot;wake up&amp;quot; at the new location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Physical body teleported!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done it, but only for around 15 feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My entity Fancy tried to convince me this is how Native Americans could run at 500 miles per hour, which is actually documented in an account of the old west my father had in his weird library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was very large for a home library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The playboy magazines were hidden behind his favorite books, hoping we&amp;#39;d notice those as we stole the playboy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ah, the good old days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kids these days just bring up XHamster.  I can&amp;#39;t imagine the effect that&amp;#39;s going to have on their minds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But outdoors there isn&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just phantom views caused by moving your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are inorganic beings who live here, on planet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke (AKA Fairy) does not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s 46 billion light years away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But her &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; can do what our puffs can do. Travel anywhere, and retain enough sentience to interact with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic beings who live here don&amp;#39;t have to project themselves that far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And seem to just wander around like a small column of white or black smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs gives account of that in some lecture notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was curious if the other people would see a little storm cloud moving along the sidewalk, headed their way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos warned us about those.

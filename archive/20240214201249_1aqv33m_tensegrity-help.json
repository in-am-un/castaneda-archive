Too much &amp;quot;book deal mind&amp;quot; in doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And intent always works better if you drop what you wanted, right after you state it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But until your assemblage point can move far enough to see the puffs, there&amp;#39;s no chance of perceiving Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the  Nagual Julian couldn&amp;#39;t force don Juan to perceive his &amp;quot;monstrous man&amp;quot; ally, without tapping him on the shoulder to push his assemblage point down a few inches. If you re-read that story, you&amp;#39;ll always find that Julian had to manipulate don Juan before an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chances are all humans already have their own Ally, but have figured out how to completely block out the sight of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s their &amp;quot;shields&amp;quot; at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blocking the &amp;quot;monster in the closet&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in my opinion, if you move to where the puffs are clearly visible Fairy will show up soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Minx...

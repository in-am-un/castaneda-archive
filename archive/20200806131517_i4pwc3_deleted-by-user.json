She once decided to seduce me for a little while, to make up for nearly a year of torture.\n\nI've never felt anything like that.\n\nBut Amy, after years of being that kind of lover, was cut out.  She had to share him with others.\n\nSo at the end she was hanging out as just one of the apprentices, with rumors of her being cut out available even to Cholita.\n\nAnd then he even died on her before she ever got to see real magic.\n\nWhat else would she do but write that book?\n\nThe Nagual breaks the group up when he leaves.\n\nIt's part of that knock of the spirit myth.\n\nCarlos adopted me and ended my newsletter writing.\n\nI suspect he knew I'd go back to it, when he confided in me that he was dying, and no one believed him.\n\nHe repeated it twice when he saw that I had nothing to say after the first time.\n\nHe knew I wouldn't let that stand.\n\nIt also fits with the rule.

Margaret also attended one of UCLA's faculties and left Los Angeles in 1966. In her book \"A Magical Journey with Carlos Castaneda\" (1997), she gives a lot of contradictory facts and reflections that make it difficult for the reader to conclude on her own attitude to Castaneda's work. However, in the controversial BBC's movie on Carlos (\"Tales From The Jungle,\" 2007), Margaret openly states that her husband did do the field work in Mexico: \"I know they went on those trips and everything. And I know that it's true.\" She confirms her words with letters and postcards she received from Mexico during Carlos' trips. Another interesting fact is that Castaneda's adopted son C.J. remembers how he took part in his father's trips, confirming the encounters with an old Indian. He also refutes Richard de Mille's statements, saying that the latter was \"absolutely wrong\" because C.J. saw with his own eyes \"boxes and boxes and boxes of field notes\" at his father's house in Westwood.\n\nRichard de Mille (1922\u20132009) \u2014 American psychologist, journalist, writer. Born in a well-known Hollywood family, in 1950's he played an active role in the Scientology movement as a close mate of Ron Hubbard. Then he became disillusioned with the leader's personality and left the organization. De Mille became famous for his aggressive and purposeful criticism of Castaneda's works after reading The Teachings of Don Juan in 1975 (when the author had already departed from public scientific discussions). In every possible way, he annoyed the UCLA anthropologists' community by demanding to withdraw Castaneda's PhD (that obviously was never done) and persecuted the researchers who supported Castaneda. Despite the evident groundlessness and openly manipulative nature of his criticism, the popular press named him the principal debunker of \"Castaneda-Mystifier.\" His favorite techniques of tampering \"evidences\" consist in selective taking words out from other authors' books to identify \"plagiarism\", taking phrases out of context to illustrate his own arguments, and imposing his own opinion in interviews or statements quoted in parts, even if their author generally stated otherwise. He uses the same manipulative techniques when commenting on Castaneda-Wasson correspondence, pushing the reader to the desired conclusion. Mixing together true and fake facts, rumors and gossip, de Mille occasionally reveals to the general public some valuable pieces of information, in particular, photocopies of Castaneda's unique field notes, the very existence of which he had vehemently denied before.

Not a real shaman, but a Yaqui sorcerer. Carlos never worked with a real shaman (\\*in the sense that not a shaman of a public ethnic community), he worked with a sorcerer don Juan. You can tell when don Juan and Carlos never talked about healing people. That's not what they were doing. Later on while you're here, I can show you something that Carlos gave me, perhaps. Carlos sought me out and he said he was having trouble with his field notes, he could not figure things out, what to do. He was trying to get a doctorate PhD at University of California at Los Angeles and he had heard of a talk I had given in Berkeley, at the university here. This is the early 1960s. And I had talked about \\[the\\] reality in the upper Amazon and shamanism. \n\nSo he came to meet me at a meeting of the American anthropological Association in San Francisco. He wanted to know more about what I was talking about. So he told his incredible stories and we asked him if he could write them down. So he started writing a little bit and then we said that's right, bring another, bring another one and so on. So soon he had almost a book-length coming with these and they were very, very exciting stories. And he had a great sense of humor by the way, a very funny man. When Carlos was visiting me we would often talk about how there were in my opinion, as I learned in the Amazon, this kind of reality you enter, the real reality that you enter with the altered state of consciousness, the ecstasy or the trance, and the other reality. And he and I arrived to an agreement that we would call one non-ordinary reality and the other ordinary reality.\n\nSo that was fine. That was the time when Carlos really was trying to get his PhD at UCLA and by writing these various chapters and so then I... knew a West Coast editor of a major publisher in New York that we would help him get them published in New York. Well, they got sent to the publisher and then merely \u2013 Impossible. So it came back to Carlos. Carlos had to wait a few years and then University of California Press published it. He still had a good reputation then. Now Carlos entered another phase. He entered the phase of his dream period (\\*since 1974). He decided to live his life within the framework of non-ordinary reality. Things he experienced and he wrote about would be reinterpreted in terms of non-ordinary reality. For example, if you had a bad week or good week, at the end of \\[the\\] week, he and a few women who were now his students, would reanalyze the week in terms of non-ordinary reality, what really happened. And to me, that was a mistake because he got disconnected from the other reality. \n\nSo he wrote a number of books which got him into trouble because people could see the similarity of those books and things they'd read elsewhere. He was reinterpreting those things that he'd read elsewhere and discovering the non-ordinary aspect of it. \n\nAnd then an American writer who I won't mention the name of decided to make a career out of attacking Carlos (\\*it's about Richard de Mille), even claimed that I had made up the Yaqui sorcerer who used the *Datura* to change consciousness. And then years later he apologized in print because finally somebody \u2014 I think a man in Switzerland sent him this reference to this Mexican book on ethnobotany that said that the Yaquis did use the *Datura* ointment in that way. But by the time I had nothing more to say to this man. So Carlos was attacked, but Carlos really didn't care. He was having a great time and unfortunately died... very early in his life.\n\nCarlos once told me that he saw in Los Angeles on a bridge over the freeway a saying he liked very much: \"Death is the greatest journey of all \u2014 that is why they save it for last.\" But anyway, he was a very misunderstood man. But he also did not attempt to defend himself, he was just doing his thing. But he had his effect, what he did was not teach anybody about shamanism, really. What he did was surprise a lot of people that a barefoot Mexican Indian could challenge the greatest philosophers of France and Europe. And that was a kind of joke that Carlos liked.\n\nMichael Harner, Founder of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g235viw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Harner on Carlos Castaneda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Carlos] had two phases in his life.

You can tell when don Juan and Carlos never talked about healing people. That&amp;#39;s not what they were doing.

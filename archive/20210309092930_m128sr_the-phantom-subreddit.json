It's reddit.intent.](https://preview.redd.it/oou3r5z5r1m61.png?width=313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81c842dc429ed981c6f2b21b1a6ff44865b40a4c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should have realized this.\n\nThere is now a phantom subreddit. Best way to think of it is, it's like \"reading off the wall\".\n\nReading off the \"net\" perhaps?'\n\n*Intent* plays at any level.  It wants to help, even if you're not doing the \"best\" thing.  So it helps Jehovah's witnesses sometimes, despite having an imaginary goal. And you could accuse Buddhists of being somewhat the same, since some of their core beliefs are not true, and they have no knowledge of the assemblage point.  And  yet, who would deny they discover stupendous things in meditation?\n\nSo, there's a phantom subreddit. You discover it by waking up from sleep with your assemblage point far sideways. Once awake, you get a \"notification\". And being so twisted by the horizontal shift of the assemblage point, you just look at the post, not realizing it simply materialized once you decided to read it. Nasty little details like, \"This makes no sense!\", don't occur to you, until the assemblage point slides back to the middle.\n\nYou might even get a cup of coffee along with the post, as if you just woke up and are catching up on the latest.\n\nIt actually has posts! But very few.  And \"flair\" labels.\n\nThe two posts I saw would certainly get the spoiler mark here, but I tried one out and it was absolutely true. It worked. Amazingly too.\n\nI can't post about it here. It would be harmful to new people, who tend to be a bit, \"squirrely\".  Meaning, they'll chase the nuts they believe are easier to get, rather than trusting the proven ones. And fall off a high branch to get them sometimes.\n\nThe dangerous post had a \"recap\" flair, but oddly was about  micro vortex puffery.  For locating those micro vortexes Carlos mentioned in private class notes. It seems, the head turning with gaze in recap uses micro puffery to find memories.\n\nAnyone remember where that list of vortexes is, in the posts here? I'd like to test if they become visible.\n\nThe other post was more bizarre. It claimed that Cleargreen is like the sorcery guild, and the attention seeking Castaneda fans who can't seem to want actual magic, and are happy with inventory, are typical of \"licensed\" Men of Knowledge.\n\nAnd Men of Knowledge do a useful purpose in society, the same as Buddhism evolved services such as funerals and weddings.\n\nBut without seers, Men of Knowledge become powerless. They need someone to tinker with their rituals, so that they invoke intent.\n\nAnd this part is the hardest to accept. It's too bizarre.\n\nThe books are a map.  They started from the bottom with Men of Knowledge, then evolved to explain seers in the later books.\n\nMost readers got off the bus with the first books, even if they read the later ones.\n\nSo they are fixated on wishing they had their sorcery guild certificate, so they could earn money and respect with men of knowledge type services.  *Seers* they are not, but like funerals, the world needs such things.   In the world of Buddhism, everyone knows the monk who handles social services and rituals is not the \"enlightened\" one.  But he's part of that spectrum.\n\nCleargreen is supplying the sorcery guild certificates in the form of facilitator certificates.\n\nAnd currently there's the same thing going on, as there was when the sorcery guilds were formed way back in the Olmec times.\n\nA war.  Only resolving that issue will create some stability.\n\nFor example, eastern bloc wants to be \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nFine.\n\nBut it's not the same as seers.  Seers are only interested in magic, not in rituals.\n\nThis is all a bit too \"Cholita\" for my taste, so I'll leave it at this.\n\nShe used to tell me things like this while we were driving.  When I couldn't understand her, she'd say, \"Don't you see it?!!\"\n\nShe'd glance off into the air at an angle as if showing me.  Once or twice, she even lifted her hand and wiggled her fingers in the air at her face level, and slightly to the right, to show me where it was.  And commented, I had just talked to her about one of the details you could clearly see right there.\n\nWhen she realized I didn't understand, she sighed angrily, dropped onto the seat, and crossed her arms.  She went silent for a while.  I could see she was trying to figure out if I was right, or she was right, but realized both were true.\n\nI forgot one interesting thing from the recap post.  It explained why petty tyrants help sorcerers.\n\nPetty tyrants cause the same type of energy loss as past memories do, requiring recapitulation to get that back.\n\nBut it's so recent, it's easy to get that energy back just by resolving the annoyance in your mind.  Because you are distracted by it.  And if you want to do sorcery that evening you have no choice but to work that out and get back the energy. Which is relatively easy to do, and also teaches how not to get so distracted the next time.\n\nBUT, the result is a \"stir up\", which causes the assemblage point to fluctuate a little horizontally as it moves, enhancing your view of that depth.\n\nIt's a tiny bit easier for intent to gift you as a result.\n\nSo you seem to get rewarded for dealing with petty tyrants well, but in fact, it's the vibration of the assemblage point that causes it.\n\nThe vibration is merely you noticing the energy that got trapped, and then not resolving it.   But attempting to, until it's finally recovered and you \"understand\" the situation.\n\nAll of the facts are recent with petty tyrants, so you can do a complete recap relatively easily, in just minutes or hours, instead of weeks for childhood memories.\n\nThat's why recap only works well if you struggle to remember all of the details of the memory, which takes serious effort and hurts a bit. You have to \"resolve\" the conflict to get back the energy.  Have the feeling you \"understand\" why it happened.\n\nIt's also why all the recap in the Castaneda community has not resulted in magic becoming visible to them while doing it.  As I posted in pics recently, recap is magical, and a complete path.  It causes magic in your face!\n\nBut not when done in a mentally lazy fashion.\n\nWhich is the downfall of the Castaneda followers.  Laziness.\n\nThat's the downfall in all fields.  The best people tend to be the ones who work the hardest.\n\nNot the ones who are clearly most talented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Phantom Subreddit", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 106, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"oou3r5z5r1m61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 82, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oou3r5z5r1m61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55db93b18619aa4359560cf5ddf3093ab787d49b"}, {"y": 164, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oou3r5z5r1m61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=293ba380a985f8b7ccf756a9062b69490e4475cc"}], "s": {"y": 239, "x": 313, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oou3r5z5r1m61.png?width=313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81c842dc429ed981c6f2b21b1a6ff44865b40a4c"}, "id": "oou3r5z5r1m61"}}, "name": "t3_m128sr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/y8V8yQxBRolPgrDL0J-4tfJ6SKSdXG7Mkccib_1c8s4.jpg", "edited": 1615324086.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1615278570.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oou3r5z5r1m61.png?width=313&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=81c842dc429ed981c6f2b21b1a6ff44865b40a4c\"&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t talking reddit.com here.

People pay to fly them all over Asia, because they can do anything with computers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most only ask, &amp;quot;How can I use it to make a living?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you give them something outside their expertise, they soon refuse to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran into an amazing autistic Chinese man in northern Taiwan.  Shinchu was it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did all the work for the company.  But was the kicking boy.  If you wanted to blame someone, you blamed him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because his social skills are sub part for Asia.  Autism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did when I visited that company was notice him, and ask him to sit next to me at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His social status changed instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later I tried to convince him to let me teach him hardware description languages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once he knew that, he&amp;#39;d know everything there is to know about computers. Everything else rides on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, he was more interested in the &amp;quot;testing girls&amp;quot; at his company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At his job level he got the shit jobs, which included debugging difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When meant, he got to hang out in the &amp;quot;girls test room.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The appeal of which was obvious. Chinese women are not like American women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of that 2 week visit, I had endless beautiful chinese girls bring me candy and treats, including the head engineer for that department, who had a PhD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m face blind, so I didn&amp;#39;t realize it was her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I looked up after she handed me a candy bar, and realized from her hair and glasses it was her, she giggled, while covering her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An invitation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_m128sr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/m128sr/the_phantom_subreddit/gqc6oxo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1615304483.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gqbk75b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1615293245.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_m128sr", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;Anyone remember where that list of vortexes is, in the posts here?

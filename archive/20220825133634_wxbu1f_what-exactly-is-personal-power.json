It's don Juan in the books, Carlos who searched for decades, with access to everyone since he was famous, and me too.\n\nAnyone who finally has real magic goes nuts trying to get more information on it, so they go looking for people who also have it, thinking those guys have had it longer, so they could help you learn how to use it.\n\nIf you learn real magic, you'll be curious like that too except you have this place.\n\nIf you had nothing, you'd search everywhere.\n\nI did that too!\n\nThere's absolutely nothing real out there.  Not in anything you mentioned.  Those guys are all con artists, who want your money.\n\nThey may not know that themselves.  They know they have no magic, but they believe someone somewhere else does, so it's ok for them to pretend they do.\n\nAs don Juan explained, \"It's all folly out there\".\n\nEven the Buddha was a con artist.\n\nLao Tsu also.  The so called modern founder of Daoism.\n\nA total con artist.\n\n\"The Dao\" is not true.  That's not at all how the universe works.\n\nAnd the Buddha was too delusional to have even a clue what meditation can become.\n\nHe got stuck in our beginner's level, at the green line on the J curve.\n\nThen decided to cash in by selling magic lessons.\n\nHe had 4 greedy disciples, who ended up \"franchising\" the rights to cheat others with their Magic lessons.\n\nAll you have to do to verify this, is go look around honestly.  Because of Google.  It's now possible to see for yourself what's really going on.\n\nLook in this subreddit. Everything is out in the open, with clear instructions, lots of successes, and no one wants money.  We even have pictures!\n\nYou can't find anything at all like that, for any other \"system\".\n\nIf you can't accept this, you almost surely won't get anything out of this subreddit.\n\nI have 25 years experience trying to teach.\n\nYou actually have to do real work to learn sorcery, and as long as  you think there's other magic you could do instead, which is less work, you'll never get serious in here.\n\nAnd also, believing the things you mentioned have magic, but never having seen any actual reason to believe that, is a sign of lack of sobriety.\n\nSo start looking around for real!\n\nYou  won't find that your \"sources\" for magic, like the buddhist guy, like this subreddit.\n\nThey'll hate it.  Warn you against it.  Tell you it's made up the first time.\n\nWhen you point out it's not one guy in here, it's many, then they'll claim spirits are dangerous.\n\nIf you ask them how they know that, they won't be able to  explain why.  It's just what they were told.  They won't have any believable stories to tell you about spirits, which aren't covered fully in here.\n\nTry them!  If they'll even look for real, they ought to get very excited to see this place.\n\nNow ask yourself.\n\nIf someone really has magic, how do they react to a place that has more, of a kind they don't know yet.\n\nThey LOVE it.\n\nThey don't try to argue against it, unless they're pretending and don't really have any.\n\nNaturally, if the Buddhists are right the christians are wrong.\n\nIf the Daoists are right, the Hindus are wrong.\n\nThey all contradict each other.  One sees, \"Lucifer\", which is the basis of all of western magic.\n\nBut the other's never seen him at all.  They have a different \"bad guy\".\n\nWe're the only one that can explain all of that, and why it contradicts each other.\n\nIt's all very obvious and right in your face.\n\nIt's all pretend out there.\n\nBut not in here where if you follow instructions, you'll blow away the Buddha in just months.\n\nClearly. Hands down.\n\nAnd no one has anything to gain in this subreddit, by lying to you.\n\nEverywhere else, they do have a reason to lie.

Not in anything you mentioned.  Those guys are all con artists, who want your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They may not know that themselves.  They know they have no magic, but they believe someone somewhere else does, so it&amp;#39;s ok for them to pretend they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan explained, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all folly out there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the Buddha was a con artist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lao Tsu also.  The so called modern founder of Daoism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A total con artist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Dao&amp;quot; is not true.  That&amp;#39;s not at all how the universe works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the Buddha was too delusional to have even a clue what meditation can become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got stuck in our beginner&amp;#39;s level, at the green line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then decided to cash in by selling magic lessons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had 4 greedy disciples, who ended up &amp;quot;franchising&amp;quot; the rights to cheat others with their Magic lessons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you have to do to verify this, is go look around honestly.  Because of Google.  It&amp;#39;s now possible to see for yourself what&amp;#39;s really going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look in this subreddit. Everything is out in the open, with clear instructions, lots of successes, and no one wants money.  We even have pictures!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t find anything at all like that, for any other &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t accept this, you almost surely won&amp;#39;t get anything out of this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 25 years experience trying to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You actually have to do real work to learn sorcery, and as long as  you think there&amp;#39;s other magic you could do instead, which is less work, you&amp;#39;ll never get serious in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, believing the things you mentioned have magic, but never having seen any actual reason to believe that, is a sign of lack of sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So start looking around for real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You  won&amp;#39;t find that your &amp;quot;sources&amp;quot; for magic, like the buddhist guy, like this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll hate it.  Warn you against it.  Tell you it&amp;#39;s made up the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you point out it&amp;#39;s not one guy in here, it&amp;#39;s many, then they&amp;#39;ll claim spirits are dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ask them how they know that, they won&amp;#39;t be able to  explain why.  It&amp;#39;s just what they were told.  They won&amp;#39;t have any believable stories to tell you about spirits, which aren&amp;#39;t covered fully in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try them!  If they&amp;#39;ll even look for real, they ought to get very excited to see this place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now ask yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone really has magic, how do they react to a place that has more, of a kind they don&amp;#39;t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They LOVE it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t try to argue against it, unless they&amp;#39;re pretending and don&amp;#39;t really have any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, if the Buddhists are right the christians are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Daoists are right, the Hindus are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all contradict each other.  One sees, &amp;quot;Lucifer&amp;quot;, which is the basis of all of western magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the other&amp;#39;s never seen him at all.  They have a different &amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re the only one that can explain all of that, and why it contradicts each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all very obvious and right in your face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all pretend out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not in here where if you follow instructions, you&amp;#39;ll blow away the Buddha in just months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly. Hands down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no one has anything to gain in this subreddit, by lying to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everywhere else, they do have a reason to lie.

Like trying to get a little kid to look around the big park, instead of running straight for the slides.\n\nI did find one new thing: Smears of intense red color which vanish in a few seconds.  Carlos had in fact mentioned those in the past, but they were violet.\n\nMaybe \"warnings\" are also the sort of thing that can manifest when gazing southeast?  Carlos always preferred that direction for summoning *intent* in private classes.\n\nAnd it's not just visual stuff you can summon?\n\nThank you!   I didn't know about that. It's partly why I decided to comment.  So I could point that out.\n\nAs I recall, someone wanted something from the subreddit. An outsider.    Wasn't a big deal, but certainly there was marginal motivations behind it.\n\nI had a clear view of someone's face.  Can't recall it now.  A giant face materialized, asking for something.\n\nThe pretense was interest.  But the true motive was something else.  Something needy, but not something actually harmful.\n\nWhat we call a \"small fry bad player\" in here.  They don't specifically attack anyone, but their interests are unrelated to this subreddit, very fussy,  and you have to hurt their feelings to get them to stop posting distracting stuff.\n\nI got a suggestion from somewhere.  \n\nHas to be Techno, Juann, or Lidotska or it will be risky, and there are plenty willing to write nonsense in their place.\n\nWe have a couple of others who could do a good job of it also.  \n\nBut if anyone at all wants to do it, I won't hold it against them.\n\nI just can't imagine what someone could gain.  \n\nThis situation is unique.  I suppose you're thinking in terms of someone earning money, or promoting something for their future benefit, even if it's hard to specifically say what that benefit could be.\n\nSo in the case of a meditation subreddit, there will be all kinds of people with future plans to get a little meditation franchise for themselves, and earn some money and respect.  Might even be good at writing something about meditation, since meditation is largely non-specific and it doesn't matter much what you say about it.\n\nAnd in a university setting it's \"publish or perish\", so you'd get plenty who are just starting out there, to jump at such an opportunity.\n\nBut there's nothing like that here.  Nothing for anyone to gain.\n\nCastaneda sorcery is a hated activity, an enemy of our social order because it threatens its core beliefs.\n\nAnd this subreddit is surrounded by absolutely disgusting phonies, all of whom would love to write something to get more customers.\n\nAre you going to include phony input from profiteers?\n\nIf it's from outside this subreddit, and not from Cleargreen or Miles, that's precisely what it will be.  Might even be \"intellectual\" sounding.\n\nBut it'll still be crap that misleads people who read it.\n\nAnd I can't imagine anyone wanting to  have their writing in the same publication with someone who's changed his name to \"Eaglefeather\",  \"Cloudfoot\", or \"Nagual\".\n\nOr who takes money for mental masturbation advice, never actually teaching real sorcery to anyone at all.\n\nIt would be like writing an article on childcare, in a publication with Jeffery Epstein's opinion on the same topic included.\n\nOnly phonies would try to gain something like \"authorship\" from sorcery.  What's the point of authorship, if not to seek the attention and approval of others?  \n\n\nEspecially when you might be in the company of a charlatan.\n\nAnd press?  Does this subreddit want outside advertisements?\n\nIn fact, new people coming through here are a pain in the ass. \n\n100 come  and you're lucky if 1 tries it out.  And 10 will waste as much of your time as they can get away with.\n\n I can't imagine the nightmarish beings we'd get in here, who read an \"Ontology\" publication.\n\nThey'd be like the Europeans in Castaneda's private classes, standing in the back discussing ontology and deconstruction.\n\nAll gone.  No effort ever made on their parts.

Like trying to get a little kid to look around the big park, instead of running straight for the slides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did find one new thing: Smears of intense red color which vanish in a few seconds.  Carlos had in fact mentioned those in the past, but they were violet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe &amp;quot;warnings&amp;quot; are also the sort of thing that can manifest when gazing southeast?  Carlos always preferred that direction for summoning &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not just visual stuff you can summon?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!   I didn&amp;#39;t know about that. It&amp;#39;s partly why I decided to comment.  So I could point that out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I recall, someone wanted something from the subreddit. An outsider.    Wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal, but certainly there was marginal motivations behind it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a clear view of someone&amp;#39;s face.  Can&amp;#39;t recall it now.  A giant face materialized, asking for something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pretense was interest.  But the true motive was something else.  Something needy, but not something actually harmful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we call a &amp;quot;small fry bad player&amp;quot; in here.  They don&amp;#39;t specifically attack anyone, but their interests are unrelated to this subreddit, very fussy,  and you have to hurt their feelings to get them to stop posting distracting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a suggestion from somewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has to be Techno, Juann, or Lidotska or it will be risky, and there are plenty willing to write nonsense in their place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a couple of others who could do a good job of it also.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if anyone at all wants to do it, I won&amp;#39;t hold it against them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t imagine what someone could gain.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This situation is unique.  I suppose you&amp;#39;re thinking in terms of someone earning money, or promoting something for their future benefit, even if it&amp;#39;s hard to specifically say what that benefit could be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the case of a meditation subreddit, there will be all kinds of people with future plans to get a little meditation franchise for themselves, and earn some money and respect.  Might even be good at writing something about meditation, since meditation is largely non-specific and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter much what you say about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in a university setting it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;publish or perish&amp;quot;, so you&amp;#39;d get plenty who are just starting out there, to jump at such an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s nothing like that here.  Nothing for anyone to gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda sorcery is a hated activity, an enemy of our social order because it threatens its core beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this subreddit is surrounded by absolutely disgusting phonies, all of whom would love to write something to get more customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you going to include phony input from profiteers?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s from outside this subreddit, and not from Cleargreen or Miles, that&amp;#39;s precisely what it will be.  Might even be &amp;quot;intellectual&amp;quot; sounding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;ll still be crap that misleads people who read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I can&amp;#39;t imagine anyone wanting to  have their writing in the same publication with someone who&amp;#39;s changed his name to &amp;quot;Eaglefeather&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Cloudfoot&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Nagual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or who takes money for mental masturbation advice, never actually teaching real sorcery to anyone at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be like writing an article on childcare, in a publication with Jeffery Epstein&amp;#39;s opinion on the same topic included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only phonies would try to gain something like &amp;quot;authorship&amp;quot; from sorcery.  What&amp;#39;s the point of authorship, if not to seek the attention and approval of others?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially when you might be in the company of a charlatan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And press?  Does this subreddit want outside advertisements?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, new people coming through here are a pain in the ass. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;100 come  and you&amp;#39;re lucky if 1 tries it out.  And 10 will waste as much of your time as they can get away with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t imagine the nightmarish beings we&amp;#39;d get in here, who read an &amp;quot;Ontology&amp;quot; publication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d be like the Europeans in Castaneda&amp;#39;s private classes, standing in the back discussing ontology and deconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All gone.

I intend to keep editing this as I remember more aspects of what I used to do.\n\nI spent a lot of time in the total darkness or with a little light from my window. I was always alone. Even as a baby, I would be left to \"cry it out\" when I cried, and I remember watching the shadows move on my ceiling and terrify me while I laid in a crib.\n\nI had a lot of sickness and trauma, things that pushed me, automatically and helplessly towards places that others might need a long involved marathon of baby steps to reach.\n\nOne part of it was that I was \"homeschooled\" but utterly isolated from society, books, movies, tv shows, music, anything. So I was largely self taught with very few resources, no element of talking with others as a part of my process, and a lot of silence.\n\nIn fact I did not speak for a year or two during puberty, and it was a big deal how I and others were surprised at the deep voice I had when I began to speak again.\n\nI had long hair that I eventually grew down so far that it went below my ass. It was part of myself, it was part of my pride and dignity. It was a symbol of resistance against the abusive mother I had. It grew with me through time spent at a different rate while in my sickbed. Time longer than our clocks and calendars. Eventually I cut that hair when there was a chance my sister could lose her hair from treatment for uveitis. I cut my hair to make a wig for her, but she ended up keeping her hair. I haven't had long hair since then, for many reasons...one of which being I want my new length to be a symbol of dignity that I don't have yet.\n\nI taught myself math, and by age 12 I had taught myself algebra, geometry, trigonometry and some calculus. I was obsessed with it, and would hallucinate numbers on my walls. I would count the letters in words and the words in sentences, find patterns and rearrange things to find aesthetically pleasing quirks in the numbers. I used to shuffle playing cards and look at the numbers that came out and then shuffle them again and repeat that. I could not stop the math, and it was hurting me to do. Migraines, cluster headaches, and physical stress. Anorexia - 5'8\" 85lbs at age 13. It was like the movie Pi, where eventually the protagonist takes a power drill to his head to end the numbers.\n\nInstead for me, I had a deep spiritual experience, became marked with a quarter-sized gray spot of hair in the middle of my head, and chose to put away math and change to philosophy and psychology.\n\nAnother thing is that when I was four years old, I got a wish from the local Make-a-Wish foundation, and got the first consumer PC with a CD-ROM drive in it, that ran windows 3.1. From that point on, I was alone in a sickbed or a chair and in a room with a computer. It lived in my bedroom with me and from a young age I started to feel like there was a persistent and personalized 'ghost in the shell' that developed over time in each computer I used. I would often reformat my computers and the quirks about them would remain through reformatting, so it wasn't a data thing. I grew up alongside the internet. This has evolved into a more recent obsession with gazing at my cell phones, or using my computer as an extension of my mind, and part of my spiritual journey. I've been told that I spend enough time with these things (hundreds, thousands of hours) that I could be making 'power objects', although I haven't read up on that much yet.\n\nI had sleep disturbances in both directions. Either extreme insomnia, with the longest time awake being 13 days straight, or things like comas where I would be in bed and unable to be woken up for days or weeks at a time. Late in 2019, I averaged 3 hours of sleep per 72 hours of being awake for an entire month. Other times I will be assaulted by sleep attacks, something my sleep doctor suspects is narcolepsy, where I'll remain asleep for 10-14 hours afterwards. Currently I've got a mix of long sleeps and 24-hour days mixed with long wakes and 48-72 hour days.

I haven&amp;#39;t had long hair since then, for many reasons...one of which being I want my new length to be a symbol of dignity that I don&amp;#39;t have yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I taught myself math, and by age 12 I had taught myself algebra, geometry, trigonometry and some calculus. I was obsessed with it, and would hallucinate numbers on my walls. I would count the letters in words and the words in sentences, find patterns and rearrange things to find aesthetically pleasing quirks in the numbers. I used to shuffle playing cards and look at the numbers that came out and then shuffle them again and repeat that. I could not stop the math, and it was hurting me to do. Migraines, cluster headaches, and physical stress. Anorexia - 5&amp;#39;8&amp;quot; 85lbs at age 13. It was like the movie Pi, where eventually the protagonist takes a power drill to his head to end the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead for me, I had a deep spiritual experience, became marked with a quarter-sized gray spot of hair in the middle of my head, and chose to put away math and change to philosophy and psychology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that when I was four years old, I got a wish from the local Make-a-Wish foundation, and got the first consumer PC with a CD-ROM drive in it, that ran windows 3.1. From that point on, I was alone in a sickbed or a chair and in a room with a computer. It lived in my bedroom with me and from a young age I started to feel like there was a persistent and personalized &amp;#39;ghost in the shell&amp;#39; that developed over time in each computer I used. I would often reformat my computers and the quirks about them would remain through reformatting, so it wasn&amp;#39;t a data thing. I grew up alongside the internet. This has evolved into a more recent obsession with gazing at my cell phones, or using my computer as an extension of my mind, and part of my spiritual journey. I&amp;#39;ve been told that I spend enough time with these things (hundreds, thousands of hours) that I could be making &amp;#39;power objects&amp;#39;, although I haven&amp;#39;t read up on that much yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had sleep disturbances in both directions. Either extreme insomnia, with the longest time awake being 13 days straight, or things like comas where I would be in bed and unable to be woken up for days or weeks at a time. Late in 2019, I averaged 3 hours of sleep per 72 hours of being awake for an entire month. Other times I will be assaulted by sleep attacks, something my sleep doctor suspects is narcolepsy, where I&amp;#39;ll remain asleep for 10-14 hours afterwards. Currently I&amp;#39;ve got a mix of long sleeps and 24-hour days mixed with long wakes and 48-72 hour days. I have a &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/S1dY1eu\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ockzp6/my_phones_camera/h46613f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625521523.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ockzp6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h4ebo2c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h4dxmox", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "The marijuana \"flattens\" the second attention, and fragments it into chunks.\n\nIt's a sideways push mostly.\n\nNot useful when you get to the red line.

If it feels unreasonable, that&amp;#39;s how hard you have to work at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, not  so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the king of unreasonable efforts, due to my profession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a single page in the H.264 specification which I wanted someone to read for me, to get their opinion on a single sentence there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could not find anyone willing to read it, once they took a look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reward was $500, but I doubt it would have mattered if it was $1000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It read like the &amp;quot;architect&amp;quot; guy from the Matrix had written it.  The guy with the pen and all the monitors, who likes to say, &amp;quot;Assiduously&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very concise computer style speak.  Painful just to try to finish a single sentence, and yet, always impeccably accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Towards the end, I went back to just seeing yellow clouds and swirls until it became too bright outside to continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only worry I have for you is, this is too much talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either it&amp;#39;s make believe and you don&amp;#39;t realize it, or your talent levels will create special problems we haven&amp;#39;t encountered before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talent isn&amp;#39;t always manageable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is amazingly talented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hopeless for making use of what&amp;#39;s in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be methodical. Try to duplicate one of every 4 pictures on the J curve.  Do what the picture shows.  To make sure your assemblage point is moving along the correct path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope we can add sounds and smells to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null,

When I was younger, part of what happened to me was having boiling water poured over my body that was in an unrousable sleep, or coma. This happened more than once. Ever since then, I'm always hot, I prefer cold places, I overheat easily, I feel like I'm hot every time I'm sick, and I feel like I'm sick every time I'm hot.\n\nAdd these together and I can hardly handle 5-10 seconds in the full brightness and heat of the outside sun.\n\nStanding and doing repeated physical motions like sweeping my arms around would be prohibitively painful because of my accumulated injuries.

To paint a picture, I&amp;#39;m approved for an in-home nurse who will come help me bathe once I get vaccinated for covid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Light, especially overwhelmingly bright light like the daytime sun can be a trigger for epilepsy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heat is a problem as well. When I was younger, part of what happened to me was having boiling water poured over my body that was in an unrousable sleep, or coma. This happened more than once. Ever since then, I&amp;#39;m always hot, I prefer cold places, I overheat easily, I feel like I&amp;#39;m hot every time I&amp;#39;m sick, and I feel like I&amp;#39;m sick every time I&amp;#39;m hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add these together and I can hardly handle 5-10 seconds in the full brightness and heat of the outside sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standing and doing repeated physical motions like sweeping my arms around would be prohibitively painful because of my accumulated injuries. How can I still practice without the movements?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ockzp6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ockzp6/my_phones_camera/h3zcvi8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625364525.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h3xk6f4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1625328550.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ockzp6", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/g6rp3g/cellphone_energy/", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h3xk6f4", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/g6rp3g/cellphone_energy/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/g6rp3g/cellphone_energy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ockzp6/my_phones_camera/h3xk6f4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625328550.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ockzp6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

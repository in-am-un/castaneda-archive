And also a Yaqui, which is me.\n\nBut it's actually not practiced by any native Americans. They lost the real magic and only repeat lame rituals.\n\nWould Carlos have used don Juan for his PhD thesis?\n\nNope.\n\nSo don Juan led him to believe it was Yaqui.  It worked well, because don Juan lived in Mexico at the end of the bus route from LA, where the Yaqui wars had ended.\n\nTo keep him happy, he taught him the old \"Men of Knowledge\" ways.\n\nThose were the lame sorcerers in the Olmec empire, who were so bad they had to get a license in order to practice. they were bakers, mask makers, dancers, and healers.\n\nAnd they used rituals and drugs. They could not *see*.\n\nThose are in fact the very \"bad players\" who try to take this place down all the time.\n\nPeople who want to make money off sorcery, but don't want to put in the time to learn it.\n\nSo Don Juan was actually teaching him what NOT to do.\n\nAnd Don Juan warned him.  He said he was going to teach him an alternate view of reality, so that he could compare it to his normal view, and find the middle.\n\nThe truth is in the middle, not in either point of view.\n\nOnly after the first 4 books, did what really happened come out.\n\nSorcery is learned in the orange zone.  Don Juan hit him on the back, pushed him into the orange, and taught him there.\n\nAnd naturally, Carlos could not remember any of it. He believed  the \"man of knowledge\" stuff was what he was being taught.\n\nEven we get to remember only \"some\" of the orange zone, but not as much as we believe.\n\nThat's because we go there ourselves.  So we can trace the memories back.\n\nBut if we got slapped on the back to go  there, we wouldn't remember it also.\n\nThe \"Man of knowledge\" stuff is pretty much useless, except to understand why shamanism can't do any real magic these days.  They just follow the rituals and take the drugs.\n\nIt's kind of shameful!\n\nThey don't seem to realize you don't need the drugs at all, and in fact those hold you back.\n\nIt's why some native Americans get so angry when they see the books of Carlos.\n\nThey can't do that.  No one can, as far as they know.\n\nAbout Art of Dreaming:\n\nIt's too advanced for any of us.\n\nCarlos wrote it, because it's seductive.\n\nAnd he wanted to pass it on.\n\nBut before you even try that, you need to be able to get fully silent, for hours at a time.\n\nCarlos put a lot of work into learning silence, before he even tried those techniques.\n\nNo one ever makes that work, because no one will follow the instructions.\n\nIt's too hard. They just want attention, and it sounds super cool, so they pretend to be doing that.\n\nBut if you want to make that work, I can arrange it!\n\nI did make it work, up to the 4th gate.  I did the 4th gate over and over, trying to wake up in the \"real world\".\n\nUntil Carlos told me to stop that and do what we were doing in class.\n\nBut you won't like the amount of work it takes to make that book work.\n\nEagle's Gift is the most relevant book.  That has all you need to know.\n\nAs far as I know, no one has even passed the 2nd gate, using that book.\n\nOr I never met anyone who did.  They just skipped it.\n\nYou can't skip any of the gates!!!\n\nEach one prepares you for the next.

And also a Yaqui, which is me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s actually not practiced by any native Americans. They lost the real magic and only repeat lame rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would Carlos have used don Juan for his PhD thesis?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don Juan led him to believe it was Yaqui.  It worked well, because don Juan lived in Mexico at the end of the bus route from LA, where the Yaqui wars had ended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep him happy, he taught him the old &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those were the lame sorcerers in the Olmec empire, who were so bad they had to get a license in order to practice. they were bakers, mask makers, dancers, and healers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they used rituals and drugs. They could not &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are in fact the very &amp;quot;bad players&amp;quot; who try to take this place down all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who want to make money off sorcery, but don&amp;#39;t want to put in the time to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Don Juan was actually teaching him what NOT to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Don Juan warned him.  He said he was going to teach him an alternate view of reality, so that he could compare it to his normal view, and find the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is in the middle, not in either point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only after the first 4 books, did what really happened come out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is learned in the orange zone.  Don Juan hit him on the back, pushed him into the orange, and taught him there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And naturally, Carlos could not remember any of it. He believed  the &amp;quot;man of knowledge&amp;quot; stuff was what he was being taught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even we get to remember only &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; of the orange zone, but not as much as we believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because we go there ourselves.  So we can trace the memories back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if we got slapped on the back to go  there, we wouldn&amp;#39;t remember it also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Man of knowledge&amp;quot; stuff is pretty much useless, except to understand why shamanism can&amp;#39;t do any real magic these days.  They just follow the rituals and take the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of shameful!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t seem to realize you don&amp;#39;t need the drugs at all, and in fact those hold you back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why some native Americans get so angry when they see the books of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t do that.  No one can, as far as they know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About Art of Dreaming:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s too advanced for any of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wrote it, because it&amp;#39;s seductive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he wanted to pass it on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before you even try that, you need to be able to get fully silent, for hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos put a lot of work into learning silence, before he even tried those techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one ever makes that work, because no one will follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s too hard. They just want attention, and it sounds super cool, so they pretend to be doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you want to make that work, I can arrange it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did make it work, up to the 4th gate.  I did the 4th gate over and over, trying to wake up in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until Carlos told me to stop that and do what we were doing in class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t like the amount of work it takes to make that book work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift is the most relevant book.

Gave me a demonstration of her coming to me, then her not there, then her coming again.  I had some emanations visible (whitish light of the orange zone), and had been playing with it with my hands, to make it manifest little sparkles.\n\nSo it was eventually \"flat\" in front of me, like a tiny beaded curtain.

Maybe just a few inches in diameter, and the beads weren't pushed out more than 1 inch.\n\nIt was almost like a drop of water hitting a perfectly sill pond, and  the round deformation that came.\n\nI'd been manifesting things with my fingers, and the \"drip\" into the emanations did the same.

What fun!!!\n\nIf any of you can get silent enough to reach brilliant puffs, you're almost there!\n\nThe whitish light is just around the corner. Or I should say, just under the bottom, and back up the front.\n\nSo how long did it take to see the puffs?\n\nThat's how long it might take to see the whitish light.\n\nAnd then, you are almost \"there\".\n\nYou discover that the whitish light can do just about anything.\n\nEspecially remote viewing.  Or if you prefer, \"translocation\", where you are in your bedroom, but also you are somewhere else.\n\nIf you can find little dream visions in the red zone, that's along the same lines.\n\nSo you sit watching the whitish light, trying to see a scene in it, and eventually you realize you can't make a scene appear.\n\nThe scene shows up when you don't give a damn.\n\nYou can't be interfering!\n\nWell... You can, but it's  unpleasant to work so hard.\n\nAt some point you just \"know\" the scene is there.\n\nAt first, you feel foolish. There's no scene there!  Why are you fooling yourself.\n\nBut you back off again (become as silent as when you \"knew\"), and again you're certain a scene is there.\n\nAnd suddenly it \"blooms\" into being.  Fully vivid!\n\nIt's silent knowledge!\n\nYou don't realize that right away but over time you learn what that \"feels like\", and you sit up on pillows in the darkness, and just \"feel\" that.\n\nKnowledge.\n\nNo words, no thoughts.\n\nYou just KNOW it.\n\nOddly, that's when you can manifest objects one after the other.\n\nYou just *know*, there's a surprise on the side of the bed, if you read your hand down where you can't see it, and pull it out in a manner that suggests you are holding an object.\n\nAnd you are!\n\nToss it on the bed, and try again.\n\nThe object might even bounce!\n\nYou guys are not that far away from it!\n\nThen, you might wonder, \"Are we there yet?\"\n\nAnd the answer seems to be, \"Almost\"!!!!\n\nHere's some passages to show what silent knowledge is good for, from the death of Julian part of the books:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan then said that he had given me different versions of what that sorcery task consisted. He said it would not be presumptuous of him to disclose that, from the spirit's point of view, the task consisted of clearing our connecting link with it.\n\nThe edifice that intent flaunts before us is, then, a clearinghouse; within which we find not so much the procedures to clear our connecting link, as the **silent knowledge that allows the clearing process to take place**. Without that silent knowledge no process could work, and all we would have would be an indefinite sense of needing something.\n\nHe explained that the **events unleashed by sorcerers as a result of silent knowledge** were so simple and yet so abstract that sorcerers had decided long ago to speak of those events only in symbolic terms. The manifestations and the knock of the spirit were examples.\n\nDon Juan said that, for instance, a description of what took place during the initial meeting between a nagual and a prospective apprentice from the sorcerers' point of view, would be absolutely incomprehensible.\n\nIt would be nonsense to explain that the nagual, by virtue of his lifelong experience, was focusing something we couldn't imagine, **his second attention**\\- the increased awareness gained through sorcery training- on his invisible connection with some indefinable abstract. He was doing this to emphasize and clarify someone else's invisible connection with that indefinable abstract.\n\nHe remarked that each of us was barred from silent knowledge by natural barriers, specific to each individual; and that the most impregnable of my barriers was the drive to disguise my complacency as independence.\n\nI challenged him to give me a concrete example. I reminded him that he had once warned me that a favorite debating ploy was to raise general criticisms that could not be supported by concrete examples. Don Juan looked at me and beamed.\n\n\"In the past, I used to give you power plants,\" he said. \"At first, you went to extremes to convince yourself that what you were experiencing were hallucinations. Then you wanted them to be special hallucinations. I remember I made fun of your insistence on calling them didactic hallucinatory experiences.\"\n\nHe said that my need to prove my illusory independence forced me into a position where I could not accept what he had told me was happening, although it was what I silently knew for myself. I knew he was employing power plants, as the very limited tools they were, to make me enter partial or temporary states of heightened awareness by moving my assemblage point away from its habitual location.\n\n\"You used your barrier of independence to get you over that obstruction,\" he went on. \"The same barrier has continued to work to this day, so you still retain that sense of indefinite anguish, perhaps not so pronounced. Now the question is, how are you arranging your conclusions so that your current experiences fit into your scheme of complacency?\"\n\nI confessed that the only way I could maintain my independence was not to think about my experiences at all.\n\nDon Juan's hearty laugh nearly made him fall out of his cane chair. He stood and walked around to catch his breath. He sat down again and composed himself. He pushed his chair back and crossed his legs.\n\nHe said that we, as average men, did not know, nor would we ever know, that it was something utterly real and functional- our connecting link with intent- which gave us our hereditary preoccupation with fate. He asserted that during our active lives we never have the chance to go beyond the level of mere preoccupation, because since time immemorial the lull of daily affairs has made us drowsy.\n\nIt is only when our lives are nearly over that our hereditary preoccupation with fate begins to take on a different character. It begins to make us see through the fog of daily affairs.\n\nUnfortunately, this awakening always comes hand in hand with loss of energy caused by aging; when we have no more strength left to turn our preoccupation into a pragmatic and positive discovery. At this point, all there is left is an amorphous, piercing anguish, a longing for something indescribable, and simple anger at having missed out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "It's Not So Far!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 34, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"va52pitsy8z71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 26, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/va52pitsy8z71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508e3a7518ec6a6aaedabc2a30c27c6141996388"}, {"y": 53, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/va52pitsy8z71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2121e4003da2e9826417d7ded5a0256a595a4d3b"}, {"y": 79, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/va52pitsy8z71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1658d52c783ea4b7183c726acac462d3dd2f49dc"}, {"y": 158, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/va52pitsy8z71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005f66fe0c1c9433956d3029e1e0b4b948967e0d"}, {"y": 237, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/va52pitsy8z71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97eae9357998e9360b997f661a992dfea1855b74"}, {"y": 267, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/va52pitsy8z71.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=978f0d6ae6596b845e46b24047c1759725c08120"}], "s": {"y": 423, "x": 1707, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/va52pitsy8z71.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a850621d507a25bcdeac3060fcf09260e1783f6"}, "id": "va52pitsy8z71"}}, "name": "t3_qsnhap", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/T4QysTYAs8eB0Adh3oASPL_cq8rGtMwqh_W-kn0MkCE.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1636758756.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/va52pitsy8z71.png?width=1707&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9a850621d507a25bcdeac3060fcf09260e1783f6\"&gt;Somewhere, very late at night, with no Cholita to barge in...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It  turns out, darkroom gets you to the final goal very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to actually do it...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been playing with reading from infinity as Carlos advised us, and like to call it &amp;quot;continuous seeing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it can be full visual, but  usually you just &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; one thing after the next, even &amp;quot;knowing&amp;quot; the scenes referenced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not like La Gorda, who seemed proud her inorganic beings were no longer real people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She liked them to be just a &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What fun is that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily showed me the &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot; La Gorda was talking about.

Photographed with a fake  halo around his head, while he wears his \"worship me\" Rinpoche robe.  And smiles like the Buddha signaling to everyone how blissful and superior his life now is.\n\nThat Rinpoche outfit looks like something the grumpy Dr. Who might have worn when he first emerged and was totally confused.\n\nFaction #M has officially failed.\n\nThat's a pity. I had hopes they'd get someone who actually put in some work down there in Mexico rather than do nothing but worry about how to steal money.\n\nFor those who don't know, Carlos was a tricky guy.\n\nHe created \"factions\" in his private classes and inner circle.\n\nI watched him do it for years.\n\nFor example, he created a \"split\" in cleargreen, producing cleargreen #1 (ours), and cleargreen #2 (Aerin and Miles).\n\nI'm afraid #2 is already headed in the direction of pretending. They've broken into 2A and 2B.\n\nI've got Cholita, and Miles and Aerin can't get along???\n\nLet's swap Cholita and Aerin, and see how they do then!\n\n2A seems to be making up new passes without any understanding to do that, and 2B has associated with that con artist Patricia who pushes fake Naguals and Mantak Chia, the Daoist con artist.\n\nHopefully they'll stop and turn back.\n\nAt the time back in the 90s when Carlos created the factions,  I was watching and not quite understanding why he did it.\n\nI must admit, it seemed malicious to me.\n\nBut, \"ruthless\" and \"malicious\" are hard to separate.\n\nThe best I could figure is that he wanted to have barriers between groups of people, to prevent one group from corrupting (infecting) the other.\n\nWe knew those barriers!\n\nThose who lived through it.\n\nI for example know I have to stay away from the other factions.\n\nBut Cholita not so much.  She's a scout.  And possibly knows of a faction we're totally unaware of, the one involved in importing art from Mexico.  The lineages accumulated wealth?\n\nJadey can also cross barriers, but perhaps has too much common sense to get mixed up with the death defier.\n\nNot only did Carlos create barriers, but he gave out official \"authority\" to one or two in each faction.\n\nSuch as adopting Aerin as his granddaughter.\n\nOr offering to sell Pandora to me, Felix, and Corey.\n\nFelix and Corey were lost.   Felix to greed, and Corey to self doubt.\n\nSo even his \"blank checks of authority\" didn't guarantee anyone would keep at it.\n\nThe blank check he gave Howard, totally flopped. Howard is largely responsible for the \"Carlos went bad\" beliefs in our community.\n\nNow it's clear why Carlos created the factions.\n\nHe did it so that he'd have the best chance one of the various groups would succeed, and lead others to actually do real work.\n\nThat was his problem.\n\nNo one would work hard and follow the very specific instructions he left us.\n\nJumping jacks is not \"hard work\".\n\nI do that just for fun as the sun comes up!\n\nOk, not jumping jacks specifically.  I skip rope.\n\nBut you get the idea.\n\nMindless Tensegrity is not going to turn you into a seer!\n\nIt won't lead to sorcery, unless you do absolutely SILENT jumping jacks.\n\nWe've identified perhaps 8 total factions, including things as exotic as the guy who interviewed Maria Sabina, studied magical surgery, but then disappeared. Darned if I can ever remember his name.  I should, because Carlos brought him around us so we'd know who he was. And his wife got lured in even \"closer\".\n\nOthers have tried by reminding me of his name, but it just disappears.\n\nBruce even made a movie about the bloodless surgery thing. And Carlos described his investigations on several occasions, including reading a newspaper with your foot.\n\nSomething Carlos did with his torso and books piled on it by the witches.\n\nSee...  This stuff is crazy magic!\n\nBut it's still hard to keep track of all of the factions.\n\nAs I was typing this, I remembered Tony.  Also a potential faction, but lost to the evils of Buddhism and it's \"official endorsement of superior beings\".\n\nWhat Carlos couldn't give.  \"Official endorsement\".\n\nJust like Faction M has succumb to.\n\nAnother faction everyone knows without realizing it,  is faction H for Hollywood. Soledad and her \"money for movies\".\n\nAnd Star Wars. The books of Carlos, in parallel storyline for movies.\n\nIt's clear however, you can scratch Mexico off the list of organizations that might eventually teach real sorcery and stop ripping people off.\n\nUnless someone down there overthrows whoever is involving others in this kind of clueless delusion.\n\nThis is Olmec sorcery. It's THOUSANDS of years older than Buddhism.\n\nAnd actually results in magic.\n\nBuddhism only results in egotistical delusions and suffering for the rest of your life.\n\nWhich is the only one you get, despite what the con artist Hindus teach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Verde Claro (Mexico Cleargreen) Goes Evil", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Buddhism"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"lz9kfz4nl2ra1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 162, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lz9kfz4nl2ra1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e89f06f8375d25a97fa41237dcfc22a0216f1f"}, {"y": 324, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lz9kfz4nl2ra1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=560b8547e1ebee78f17b4aff35015758665bbf00"}, {"y": 481, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lz9kfz4nl2ra1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc35013e515a4ccf82405c13165dd31f466225b5"}], "s": {"y": 600, "x": 399, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lz9kfz4nl2ra1.png?width=399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8bf9b02d8a2c5a8190abeb682dfc574f0c33914"}, "id": "lz9kfz4nl2ra1"}}, "name": "t3_127kbg0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Buddhism", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tBahwbYyYW4Ye2MPAJgUAtUJub0PGWyN8hOy2j0ZedI.jpg", "edited": 1680295829.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1680266662.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lz9kfz4nl2ra1.png?width=399&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b8bf9b02d8a2c5a8190abeb682dfc574f0c33914\"&gt;\\&amp;quot;Eventos de Budismo\\&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.verdeclaro.net/\"&gt;http://www.verdeclaro.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out the delusional Rinpoche sucking up attention.

All the people of knowledge known to me were the same children and ate leftovers and licked plates in the same way. I felt uncomfortable. My pity for these children was due not at all to the fact that they had nothing to eat, but to the fact that, in my opinion, they were doomed by their world to mental inferiority. And then Don Juan declares that each of them has access to what I consider to be the highest of all possible human achievements - any of them can become a man of knowledge.\n\nAs my good friend says, to any attempts to draw his attention to something outside the physical world: if I need magic, I will simply pay the most famous guru in this field. It seems to me like a natural filter, if a person has no intention, no mood for the unknown, then all the \"magic\" turns into a colorful wrapper that can be bought from public gurus.

All the people of knowledge known to me were the same children and ate leftovers and licked plates in the same way. I felt uncomfortable. My pity for these children was due not at all to the fact that they had nothing to eat, but to the fact that, in my opinion, they were doomed by their world to mental inferiority. And then Don Juan declares that each of them has access to what I consider to be the highest of all possible human achievements - any of them can become a man of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As my good friend says, to any attempts to draw his attention to something outside the physical world: if I need magic, I will simply pay the most famous guru in this field.

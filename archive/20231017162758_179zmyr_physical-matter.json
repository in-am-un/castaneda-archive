Any parallel computer programmer can tell you that.\n\nYou can't \"not use\" any part of a large parallel processing machine which has no enables and no clocks!  And no \"output\" later in the process which isn't connected to another input.\n\nBut that's a bit technical.\n\nAnd if you look up that idea, it was some 90s made up thing.  Which bit the dust.\n\nJust the way \"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day\" was made up by Harper's magazine, back in the 30s or so.  To help out a ground meat company.\n\nTruth be told, breakfast is the least important meal.  Except maybe for small children.  Who have to eat in the middle of the night even, from time to time.\n\nBut Cleargreen went with that nonsense!\n\nCarlos was probably just happy to see them taking it seriously and trying to explain \"why it works\".\n\nRather than it never working at all, and no one expecting it to.\n\nTo this day, I wonder if anyone at Cleargreen really believes any of this?\n\nDoesn't seem like it to me.\n\nCarlos even tried \"You only live twice\" to inspire people, which is from an early sexy James Bond movie. \n\nCarlos probably would have accepted Elves and Fairies as an explanation also, if it got people to be more serious.\n\nSorcerers are storytellers.\n\nIf you like you can equate that to \"bald faced liars\" once in a while.  It's true. They'll make up anything if it helps apprentices get serious and learn the real thing.\n\nAnd I can assure you, when you learn to move your assemblage point by yourself without any other thing doing it, something you can only learn by working hard daily using a reliable technique like Darkroom, you come to find you are SURROUNDED by dreams and stories filling the air.\n\nThus \"Sorcerers are storytellers\" because it becomes obvious to them, all of reality is just a story.\n\nThat said, here's what ChatGPT said about why one universe might not be able to interact with another. Or to rephrase it, why you can switch \"stories\" to live in:\n\n**\"Separation by Extra Dimensions**: In some multiverse theories, the different universes are separated by extra dimensions or some other mechanism that prevents them from interacting with each other in meaningful ways. These extra dimensions or separation mechanisms act as barriers, keeping each universe isolated. \"\n\nI just wanted to point out, the idea that a certain bundle of emanations doesn't interact with another bundle located at a distant position of the assemblage point, isn't totally bizarre.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of what you end up with if you keep thinking about existence in detail.\n\nBut there's that nagging problem with physical matter.\n\nThose who pretend their sorcery are fond of ignoring physical matter.\n\nWhen Carlos says you go into the 3rd attention \"pants, boots and all\", they fantasize taking their $1000 sneakers along with them.\n\nInto the second attention?  Sure.  You get to go in there physically.\n\nBut not once you get rid of the luminous shell.\n\nI'm afraid, no physical matter is going with you.\n\nThat's a complete misunderstanding of what physical matter is.\n\nYou'll have boots for sure!\n\nBut you have boots in dreams too.\n\nGenaro in his double, which was pretty much every time you read about him in the books, had Huaraches and a Sombrero he could fly like a kite.\n\nEXCEPT...\n\nHe wasn't \"real\". Didn't have any physical matter associated with that manifestation.  It was his double.\n\nIn fact, I'm not sure the Sombrero did either.\n\nJust remember the basket don Juan gave to Pablito, which came alive and tried to bite him.\n\nOr Vicente's 3 plants Carlos watered, and suddenly there were 3 seemingly real people broken down on the road, hassling him the same way scouts do in dreaming.\n\nAll seemed absolutely real.\n\nEven the talking lizard which don Juan took from a bag, with it's mouth sewed shut with rude stitches.\n\nThat was just Minx, the Devil's weed Ally!\n\nSeemed perfectly real to Carlos, but that's the wonder of sorcery at work.\n\nSo what you have to realize is, physical matter is in the range of some \"organizing\" bands of emanations which give form and structure to the reality we choose to perceive.\n\nGreat bands of emanations, perhaps adjacent to our own.\n\nBut certainly those are INSIDE our luminous shell, or else we'd be like one of those universes, which can't interact with another.\n\nWho knows who many \"great bands of emanations\" there are?\n\nIt's likely infinite.\n\nBut we only have 8 within our perceptual capabilities.\n\nAnd we don't long to bring along physical matter from those other ones.  Because it's totally unknown to us.\n\nBut while here, in this bundle of emanations, physical matter and the laws of physics are absolutely consistent.\n\nWe grow fond of stuff.\n\nAs Carlos said, the illusion of consistency gives rise to the misunderstanding of \"causality\".\n\nA major belief in the physics world, which also has it's doubters.\n\nWe can't just push physical matter around as we like using sorcery.\n\nBecause in this bundle of emanations it behaves according to rules.\n\nIn another bundle, the rules are different.\n\nAnd once you are freed from your luminous egg, the goal of sorcerers, the rules are vastly different.\n\nSo can you take physical matter along with you, in your sorcery journeys?\n\nIt's a complete misunderstanding of what reality is.\n\nIt's almost like asking if you can take your home office electrical outlets along with you, when you move to a far away country with no electricity.\n\nSo you can keep your cell phone charged.\n\nNo, you can't.\n\nThose run from a gigantic infrastructure.  They aren't \"stand alone\" items.\n\nYet anyway.\n\nGive technology some time, and we'll surely have \"portable power outlets\".\n\nJedi power packs.\n\nMaybe you'll just peel off the back paper on your brand new outlet, and stick them where you like.\n\nBut your physical matter will still always have to remain here.\n\nNote: That doesn't mean you can't get some \"help\" to transport your physical body, in this world.\n\nBut that's a topic none of us has explored yet.\n\nI still firmly believe that sorcerers 100,000 years ago could get the earth itself to transport physical matter for them.\n\nBecause I saw it during Silent Knowledge.\n\nBut, maybe that was in a galaxy far, far away?\n\nNo way to know at our level.\n\nKnowledge isn't necessarily \"truth\", because truth is relative to a specific bundle of emanations.\n\nJust like physical matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Physical Matter", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"lyse6is6qrub1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74f87f356666da551a304ed0a1c0e538423e420f"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e4bd7e8ede0dcde159726a39f3c0631d41b4c5b"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b144bbdb50b74d9d9c843642629e7d462010c781"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bacc6a1955643dba36da210ea6989b3e0640db39"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a9e71e2285d5f1f42ddd2d02959ac5821a4ec3"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3967bc6bb456957e1667ed4454d33141650b9a38"}], "s": {"y": 2160, "x": 2160, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf4b34f1688146a609bee05aac56103565d60438"}, "id": "lyse6is6qrub1"}}, "name": "t3_179zmyr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 31, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9N7wPbyuhgCtK9iqVQnoyZSI6NiBZKMft-OnMsQIv3A.jpg", "edited": 1697555252.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1697552878.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=2160&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cf4b34f1688146a609bee05aac56103565d60438\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/lyse6is6qrub1.jpg?width=2160&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cf4b34f1688146a609bee05aac56103565d60438&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really didn&amp;#39;t like it when Cleargreen workshops back when Carlos was still around started using the excuse of &amp;quot;You only use 10% of your brain&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if Sorcery teaches you to use 100% of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That can&amp;#39;t have been Carlos&amp;#39; idea!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For starters, we use 100% of our brain.

Don Juan is talking about the rolling Force and how the Sears noted that their allies gaps were different than the human gaps in our Shield. That is why the allies can resist the rolling Force for much longer than humans can. He mentioned how the Sears started to pattern their gap on that of the allies. Is that the ultimate goal of moving the assemblage point?\n\nGood Answer:\n\nI don't think you can really define an \"Ultimate Goal\" of moving the AP. There are so many different things that can be experienced and accomplished. You go down paths and learn things at different levels that may seem significant that moment and insignificant the next. To look for an \"Ultimate Goal\" outside of practice when we are just musing on a chat site is the epitome of the traps that happen at this Blue Line of Reality. We are just talking smack here. It matters very little inside the Darkroom when things get interesting. Just don't let this kind of prattle dilute your efforts and prevent you from getting to work!\n\nMy own Overview:\n\nWe have a \"Flair\" for \"Inventory Warriors\", meaning those who believe they can memorize silly rules like, \"The shine of the eyes is how gazing works\", or \"Teapots can gurgle as an affirmation from the world around you.\"\n\nA \"Tata Kachora\" supporter came here to show off his vast knowledge.\n\nExcept that those \"facts\" are nonsensical.  Just like Tata.\n\nFirst of all, it was Little Smoke who made the teapot gurgle.\n\nCarlos demonstrated it for us in private class!\n\nThe Allies can move water.\n\nI've seen it over and over myself!

Don Juan is talking about the rolling Force and how the Sears noted that their allies gaps were different than the human gaps in our Shield. That is why the allies can resist the rolling Force for much longer than humans can. He mentioned how the Sears started to pattern their gap on that of the allies.

There are so many different things that can be experienced and accomplished. You go down paths and learn things at different levels that may seem significant that moment and insignificant the next. To look for an &amp;quot;Ultimate Goal&amp;quot; outside of practice when we are just musing on a chat site is the epitome of the traps that happen at this Blue Line of Reality.

The Trickster element adds a layer of unpredictability and anarchy to his persona, allowing him to continually disrupt norms and challenge the status quo\u2014both musically and philosophically.

His disciplined and forceful drumming serves as the rhythmic backbone of Killing Joke's music, embodying the warrior-like qualities of focus and relentless engagement.\n* **Man of Knowledge: Geordie Walker** Geordie Walker, the guitarist, fulfills the role of the Man of Knowledge. With his intricate riffs and unique tonal sensibilities, he stands as a repository of 'knowledge,' contributing to the band's idiosyncratic aura and musical depth.\n* **Man of Action: Paul Raven** The late Paul Raven, the bassist, morphs into a Man of Action tinged with elements of mischief. His dynamic, robust bass lines act as a driving force that transmutes conceptual creativity into tangible soundscapes.

assemblage point to shift sideways.\n\nWomen can do that, as a result of their period.  It's part of what makes them so talented.\n\nBut you'd have to study a bit more to understand about assemblage point shifts in \"depth\", and horizontally.\n\nA depth tunes in a new realm of reality.\n\nHorizontal tunes in the permutations of it.  There's as many as 20,000 at a given \"depth\". Depending on how you rate a \"variation\".\n\nBut if you are 5 inches horizontally,  it's possible you aren't even visible to others who are in the middle.\n\nCertainly in  your double that's true.\n\nSo if you are good at \"seeing things\", and that interferes with darkroom, then switch to something where \"seeing things\" is a huge bonus!\n\nRecapitulation.\n\nThis isn't one path.

I named her \"Stella\".\n\nYou should ALWAYS greet spirits who go to the trouble of appearing for you. It takes energy for them to do that, and if you don't respond it's a net loss to them.  So that eventually they don't show up anymore.\n\nBut really, \"Stella\" is just a tiny piece of awareness I lured down from a Star.\n\nWe don't mess around in here.\n\nOur magic is from before money, before cities, and even before agriculture.\n\nBefore people could read.\n\nAnd so before bad men started making up pretend magic so they could steal from others.\n\nIt was designed by the Olmecs over thousands of years, unbroken.\n\nOne old sorcerer, and one very young apprentice given to him as a child.\n\nA \"youngling\".\n\nI've theorized that aspect of \"The Jedi Training\" came from our witch Soledad, who had a hand in Star Wars because she had left over lineage money.\n\nThe lineage was surely very wealthy.\n\nIf not, the Star Wars writers at least admitted it was taken from the books of Carlos.  It's in the wiki.\n\nYoda even quotes don Juan a few times in the movies.\n\n\"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.\"\n\nAnd \"For my Ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is!\"\n\nAnyway, the point I'm trying to make here is this magic was discovered by specific people who had absolutely no way to profit or gain from lying about it.\n\nEverything else surviving in the world (in public view) was created to steal money.  Even if it contains a tiny bit of left over magic from long ago.\n\nAnything you read in the books of Carlos and the witches, and anything said during the Tensegrity movement videos, is something you can see for yourself.\n\nCarlos even left his 2 allies (2 billion year old spirits) to us, and one of them created darkroom.\n\nAfter driving me mad in Asia to force me to come here, with her evil little friend \"Minx\".  Who still lingers in my home due to the witch Carlos trained and paired me off with.\n\nYou can read about it in here.  The Ally \"Fairy\" (AKA Little Smoke) started perfecting it once I found this place.\n\nIt's in early posts.\n\nBefore darkroom was created, I  used all of the techniques Carlos had taught us.  Both before for 3 decades, and then once I was in private classes and had access to Carlos a couple of times a week.\n\nBut that's too much work for new people.  People's eyes glaze over when I describe how much time I put into practicing.\n\nSo darkroom was needed.   A single \"complete path\".\n\nWhich the women don't need to follow.  They have alternatives the men can't use.\n\nBut darkroom, as simple as it is,  is already too much for most to try.\n\nWe get only 1 in 100 who subscribe to this subreddit, who actually make an effort.\n\nBut we have a decent success rate due to 7000 passing though here in the last 4 years.\n\nHere's what Stella looks like when I'm practicing, and she's teaching:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=1889&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4622e4535e553f1ddf11ab7b1b633963f3371dc", "edited": 1685132442.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jlqnquk", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave us stories to go with each Tensegrity movement.

So that eventually they don&amp;#39;t show up anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, &amp;quot;Stella&amp;quot; is just a tiny piece of awareness I lured down from a Star.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t mess around in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our magic is from before money, before cities, and even before agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before people could read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so before bad men started making up pretend magic so they could steal from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was designed by the Olmecs over thousands of years, unbroken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One old sorcerer, and one very young apprentice given to him as a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;youngling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve theorized that aspect of &amp;quot;The Jedi Training&amp;quot; came from our witch Soledad, who had a hand in Star Wars because she had left over lineage money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lineage was surely very wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, the Star Wars writers at least admitted it was taken from the books of Carlos.  It&amp;#39;s in the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yoda even quotes don Juan a few times in the movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;For my Ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point I&amp;#39;m trying to make here is this magic was discovered by specific people who had absolutely no way to profit or gain from lying about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything else surviving in the world (in public view) was created to steal money.  Even if it contains a tiny bit of left over magic from long ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything you read in the books of Carlos and the witches, and anything said during the Tensegrity movement videos, is something you can see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos even left his 2 allies (2 billion year old spirits) to us, and one of them created darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After driving me mad in Asia to force me to come here, with her evil little friend &amp;quot;Minx&amp;quot;.  Who still lingers in my home due to the witch Carlos trained and paired me off with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can read about it in here.  The Ally &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; (AKA Little Smoke) started perfecting it once I found this place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in early posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before darkroom was created, I  used all of the techniques Carlos had taught us.  Both before for 3 decades, and then once I was in private classes and had access to Carlos a couple of times a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s too much work for new people.  People&amp;#39;s eyes glaze over when I describe how much time I put into practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So darkroom was needed.   A single &amp;quot;complete path&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which the women don&amp;#39;t need to follow.  They have alternatives the men can&amp;#39;t use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But darkroom, as simple as it is,  is already too much for most to try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get only 1 in 100 who subscribe to this subreddit, who actually make an effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we have a decent success rate due to 7000 passing though here in the last 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what Stella looks like when I&amp;#39;m practicing, and she&amp;#39;s teaching:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=1889&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f4622e4535e553f1ddf11ab7b1b633963f3371dc\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=1889&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f4622e4535e553f1ddf11ab7b1b633963f3371dc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_13sgu3u", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13sgu3u/hooks_to_reality/jlqnquk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1685131741.0, "media_metadata": {"0xb279okz92b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 79, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0547c826060973d69fdfaccd13255f44f7300ecb"}, {"y": 159, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe0e3b1a8c7b0fc0f0a05bbc3f0c5dbf0f476880"}, {"y": 236, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c26aee20aa1ae3118767f4f020cc0c8f6850ae70"}, {"y": 473, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84360369f8804b9f1fb3a1e132536081e35cad29"}, {"y": 709, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=835fca3ebd2b1785adeaddf708dcaca7c07802b8"}, {"y": 798, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28bba10ca28ae166bd4736327726b0b8bcd390b2"}], "s": {"y": 1397, "x": 1889, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0xb279okz92b1.jpeg?width=1889&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4622e4535e553f1ddf11ab7b1b633963f3371dc"}, "id": "0xb279okz92b1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 14}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jlq75zj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "magnetons", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1685123668.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_13sgu3u", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_miudztkk", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I have a million questions, but id imagine i need to answer those myself.

Some of the techniques are very similar (in fruits) to meditation, yoga, etc. like purifying the self, dissolving the tensions that give rise to emotional emanations and loops, but also the sense of sinking deeper into realty, towards source, and all the wiggly sensations we resist and crack through on the way. \nMy question I guess is - and why I\u2019m writing here (given the layers of intent) - is whether this is a serious path to take, whether it\u2019s neglecting the \u201cmiddle earth\u201d realm of living duty, in other words, spiritual materialism and bypassing type things, and all this regarding my own bias on it (lol)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13sgu3u/hooks_to_reality/jm5rw97/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1685418713.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_13sgu3u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

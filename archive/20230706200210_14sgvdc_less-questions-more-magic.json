Later you&amp;#39;re just used to it and have to look for it to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Losing &amp;quot;the self&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t mean what a beginner would think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They got infected with Buddhism, so they think about the &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; even more when they think about being free from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just mentally put the &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; up on a little throne, and believe that&amp;#39;s now egoless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to entirely forget it exists at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of like a lion isn&amp;#39;t thinking about whether his butt fur has shit stuck on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or whether his last kill was too small, so the other lions don&amp;#39;t respect him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s an unfortunate side effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get AMAZING magic, right in your face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no longer care about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just take it for granted, as &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as don Juan told Carlos once.  That if he could move his assemblage point, answers would just flow from him as questions do now, when don Juan was saying that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And boy do they flow!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using a &amp;quot;presentation method&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s endless answers to anything that&amp;#39;s been bugging you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But randomly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you don&amp;#39;t give a damn...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw 4 old seers last night. Instead of the usual one wrinkly man I&amp;#39;ve seen in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking, &amp;quot;Holy shit!!!  What&amp;#39;s in back of them?  Are they near the cenotes?  Or south where the Aztecs built Mexico City?  And how old are they? Are they all men?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I thought, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s worth noting.  But obviously you can see those guys anytime.   I&amp;#39;ll look again later. I have more important things to see right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now, I can&amp;#39;t recall at all what I thought was more important than viewing the old seers, across thousands of years of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not even a hint of it is left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though I did watch cartoons a bit, wondering if I could completely get out of &amp;quot;storyboarding&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT was insisting storyboarding was difficult, but had to be done to make good cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather just copy them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only got 1/4th of a cartoon at the max.  And it wouldn&amp;#39;t stay fixed on the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully one day, a group of 4 people can sit in a home theater and watch cartoons on the wall. In absolute darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All seeing the same one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can recall more details.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_14sgvdc", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/14sgvdc/less_questions_more_magic/jr25e4t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1688756327.0, "media_metadata": {"l6xrj8wgalab1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 99, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l6xrj8wgalab1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91e012d80f124c1d5353013dcd4bece89e39f00f"}, {"y": 198, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l6xrj8wgalab1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62f993169afe1c46b2f7d5302f6bda2b01837b0a"}, {"y": 294, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l6xrj8wgalab1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478140931d6bb363c06e4d77e2cbc57c61a62e3e"}], "s": {"y": 431, "x": 468, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l6xrj8wgalab1.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2ee7d9354efaefa97d3937e4e69e825c854cebc"}, "id": "l6xrj8wgalab1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1688756327.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jr1x2nn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Fine_Ad3410", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jr0l4wd", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_eor92y5x", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The opportunities are limitless and every step of the way there is a book deal mind.

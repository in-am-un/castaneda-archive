So I switched gears last night and started experimenting with a different technique.\n\nI would sit in a position that was comfortable enough to allow me to fall asleep, but not enough where I could do it for a long time. What I wanted to do was fall asleep, but then naturally wake up, soon after, due to discomfort.\n\nThis actually worked, and it allowed me to fall asleep multiple times last night. What I was trying to do was become more familiar with the state that occurs between waking and sleeping and see if I could catch a glimpse of it.\n\nAfter doing this 4 or 5 times, I found myself staring at a green fairy! I swear, my intent had nothing to do with finding fairies last night, but there it was floating in mid air. Maybe I've been reading too many of /u/danl999's posts :)\n\nAnyway, it wasn't a traditional looking fairy. It wasn't feminine, wispy, or angelic. It didn't have curvy lines, bright colors or a sly smile. It was: Male. Green. Fairy. Those 3 distinct words popped into my mind when I saw it.\n\nIt had a human-like body and wore a green outfit. The outfit was similar to a military uniform, but it was made of corduroy. I say this because it had vertical lines going down the length of the outfit, and it made me think of that material.\n\nThe head had no facial features at all. It was circular, with a box-shaped appendage on the front, and antenna sticking out the top of the box. It had shoulder length hair that was styled in a frizzy perm, which I thought was odd, since it claimed to be male. Maybe it was an 80's rockband fairy, LOL! It also had white, translucent wings that appeared to be cookie-cuttered from a \"make-your-own-fairy\" kit.\n\nIt was pretty bizarre, and you know, the more I write about it, the more alien I remember its appearance being. It's like some presence threw a bunch of parts together and tried to pretend it was a fairy. I don't know why it needed to convince me of this.\n\nI tried to interact with it, but it wouldn't move or acknowledge me in any way. The visual was quite large, as it took up about 60% of my visual field. It lasted maybe 10 - 15 seconds, and then it disappeared. I woke up and wrote down what I saw.\n\nIt was such a fleeting thing, that I didn't make too much of it at the time, but that opinion changed as my night progressed.\n\nI had a minor success, so I decided to quit and lay down in a normal position and go to sleep for real this time. At some point in the night, I found myself chasing after my daughter in a dream. She had stolen something trivial, like a granola bar, and I was trying to get it back. It was a ridiculous scenario, and I started to realize I was in a dream. Normally this would give me lucidity and control of the dream, but something quite different happened ...\n\nThe dream started to reduce in size, and I could see the room I was sleeping in. The dream became a window that faded slightly and moved to the top right corner of my vision, like that picture-in-picture feature that some TVs have. I was able to see both the dream being played out and the room I was sleeping in.\n\nThen out of nowhere, I felt a hand grab my left shoulder! I think at that moment my mind split. Because conflicting thoughts started running through me. On one hand, I was completely terrified, but on the other, I wanted to see where this would go. So I stayed still and waited. The hand let go, and it was replaced by a feeling of someone's body standing very close to me, on my right side.\n\nI tried to wait this out too, but I guess the terror was too much because I screamed \"GO TO SLEEP!\" and the feeling immediately disappeared. However, I have no idea why I said this. I was scared, but I don't remember thinking that I should say this.\n\nTo be honest, I can't even be sure I was the one who said it either. The words just came out of somewhere and were screamed very loudly. The phrase itself doesn't even make a whole lot of sense to me. Why would I say that? Maybe I was trying to change dreams, I am not sure.\n\nOn it's own, the fairy didn't feeling all that important, but the two experiences together make me think this was of some significance. I am going to keep at the new technique and see if anything else occurs.\"\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20210204085812/https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/evj4af/a\\_green\\_fairy\\_appeared/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210204085812/https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/evj4af/a_green_fairy_appeared/)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_keals05", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;A Green Fairy Appeared&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; was the original title of this post.

You encountered an alien intelligence.\n\nRemember this: Don Juan: Sorcerers take their dreams as real.\n\nAnd, anything can be a not-doing.k  Not-doings shift the assemblage point.\n\nI'd also say, there are indeed phantom images. Hypnogogic images produced by your mind alone.\n\nBut if you focus on them, your assemblage point drifts towards heightened awareness. Along the way that releases energy that's just too tempting for inorganic beings.\n\nAnd so I suspect, it's inevitable that phantoms get taken over by real inorganic beings, if you play (interact) with them enough.\n\nCholita won't like this.

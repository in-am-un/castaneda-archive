Great Bands of Emanations\n\nDays later, in his house in southern Mexico, don Juan continued with his explanation. He took me to the big room. It was early evening. The room was in darkness. I wanted to light the gasoline lanterns, but don Juan would not let me. He said that I had to let the sound of his voice move my assemblage point so that it would glow on the emanations of total concentration and total recall.\n\nHe then told me that we were going to talk about the great bands of emanations. He called it another key discovery that the old seers made; but in their aberration they had relegated it to oblivion until it was rescued by the new seers.\n\n\"The Eagle's emanations are always grouped in clusters,\" he went on. \"The old seers called those clusters the great bands of emanations. They aren't really bands, but the name stuck.\n\n\"For instance, there is an immeasurable cluster that produces organic beings. The emanations of that organic band have a sort of fluffiness. They are transparent and have a unique light of their own, a peculiar energy. They are aware, they jump. That's the reason why all organic beings are filled with a peculiar consuming energy.\n\n\"The other bands are darker, less fluffy. Some of them have no light at all, but rather a quality of opaqueness.\"\n\n\"Do you mean, don Juan, that all organic beings have the same kind of emanations inside their cocoons?\" I asked.\n\n\"No. I don't mean that. It isn't really that simple, although organic beings all belong to the same great band. Think of it as an enormously wide band of luminous filaments; luminous strings with no end. Organic beings are bubbles that grow around a group of luminous filaments. Imagine that in this band of organic life some bubbles are formed around the luminous filaments in the center of the band. Others are formed close to the edges. The band is wide enough to accommodate every kind of organic being with room to spare. In such an arrangement, bubbles that are close to the edges of the band miss altogether the emanations that are in the center of the band which are shared only by bubbles that are aligned with the center. By the same token, bubbles in the center miss the emanations from the edges.\n\n\"As you may understand, organic beings share the emanations of one band. Yet seers see that within that organic band, beings are as different as they can be.\"\n\n\"Are there many of these great bands?\" I asked.\n\n\"As many as infinity itself,\" he replied. \"Seers have found out, however, that in the earth there are only forty-eight such bands.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of that, don Juan?\"\n\n\"For seers it means that there are forty-eight types of organizations on the earth, forty-eight types of clusters or structures. Organic life is one of them.\"\n\n\"Does that mean that there are forty-seven types of inorganic life?\"\n\n\"No, not at all. The old seers counted seven bands that produced inorganic bubbles of awareness. In other words, there are forty bands that produce bubbles without awareness. Those are bands that generate only organization.\n\n\"Think of the great bands as being like trees. All of them bear fruit. They produce containers filled with emanations, yet only eight of those trees bear edible fruit- that is, bubbles of awareness. Seven have sour fruit, but edible nonetheless. And one has the most juicy, luscious fruit there is.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yaycl2299jbb1.jpg?width=1235&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7f3cff8bad6fe7c0ca8e7ee81950ab1c6bc8362", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Preliminary \"Great Bands\" Superimposed On Tensegrity Policewoman", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 134, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"yaycl2299jbb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 54, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yaycl2299jbb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b598b887e15385f72eb68fe1141f7050dc12eb3"}, {"y": 108, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yaycl2299jbb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed3fd71b2fd04171cd76e1196912c2fb815ab94"}, {"y": 160, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yaycl2299jbb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7fe2235e4d6c9df26a03c4242f19d9fd4927f9a"}, {"y": 321, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yaycl2299jbb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7322c50e493a566940f4a60c082bfca0eb670f60"}, {"y": 482, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yaycl2299jbb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=977338ead53bbd755de716fe7cd65a1f3425f42e"}, {"y": 543, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yaycl2299jbb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96cbfcb64fa99c9ae19087b0be6d4e03578a417f"}], "s": {"y": 621, "x": 1235, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yaycl2299jbb1.jpg?width=1235&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7f3cff8bad6fe7c0ca8e7ee81950ab1c6bc8362"}, "id": "yaycl2299jbb1"}, "668t8ne59jbb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 103, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/668t8ne59jbb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b63e92d782b69247858c6128508586ea49c1f5aa"}, {"y": 207, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/668t8ne59jbb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aee8db34442f58f26398aabd42f54cd4cc6b213"}, {"y": 307, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/668t8ne59jbb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd50cf02283c69a6edb0c184708f29ce6d8ab79"}, {"y": 615, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/668t8ne59jbb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2419dab22a118a21a8628b2ac0cdb91785cc4995"}, {"y": 923, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/668t8ne59jbb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7b45b7847232047030ec75a8bf752c658f36c54"}], "s": {"y": 991, "x": 1030, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/668t8ne59jbb1.jpg?width=1030&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b3038baac3648d7bdb62612327dd04848e6b3f3"}, "id": "668t8ne59jbb1"}}, "name": "t3_14xo2pe", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Sib3yK1aR6V41Q8imTEfGNEm1DehJqm1gleCxBDB9ks.jpg", "edited": 1689168795.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1689167120.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/668t8ne59jbb1.jpg?width=1030&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9b3038baac3648d7bdb62612327dd04848e6b3f3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/668t8ne59jbb1.jpg?width=1030&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9b3038baac3648d7bdb62612327dd04848e6b3f3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m diagraming the luminous egg and the slices in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I had to read from the books, and found out why I assumed the emanations were infinite lines:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Think of it as an enormously wide band of luminous filaments;

Compared to what he showed in private classes.\n\nIt's almost as if this egg shape is in the middle green zone.\n\nSo don't anyone go \"inventory warrior\", like Carlos Castillejos, and think memorizing facts has anything at all to do with sorcery.\n\nInventory facts from the books, are only used to try to dominate others, so you can steal from the public at large.\n\nTo \"win points\".\n\nAnd it's pointless.\n\nNow imagine if I put the Robert Redford version of Carlos in the egg, and he's 6'4\" or so.\n\nI suppose I'll move Tensegrity woman up a tiny bit.\n\nBut here's a theory.  The egg shape is everywhere a \"normal\" person might be able to reach with their fingers or toes.\n\nAt the bottom, there's not much hope to extend any further than to push your toes out and bend your ankles. So the bottom is closer to the feet, than the top is to the head.\n\nBut up above, the arms can reach up.  And also you can stand on one leg and bend the body, to reach even higher.\n\nThink that doesn't work?\n\nNext time you reach for something on a shelf a bit too high, see how you do it!\n\nThen add on stretching yourself into an infinite line, done by the new seers, and my believe that the Stellar Hatch pass does that.\n\nSo speculation:  Modern man's egg is a bit shorter, as don Juan mentioned, because they don't look up at the stars as much as ancient man did.  Ancient man stretched their eggs a bit higher, because of where they focused their attention.\n\nWe're mostly looking down, because if we look up most of the time we just see the ceiling in a room.\n\nSo (theoretically), the top is going to be significantly higher than one might expect if you've been looking at Leonardo Da Vinci's diagram too much.\n\nHe just has a big circle.\n\nI don't believe I'll make the egg skinnier to match this assemblage point beam picture.\n\nI'll assume that the first picture he drew (the one I matched the shape to), was the most accurate.\n\nBut I will \"justify\" moving her up a bit higher in the egg, based on the beginning of Stellar Hatch gazing down 2 stories, to find some shiny outer coating to send into outer space.\n\nLooking down 2 stories might be how the old seers turned into trees.\n\nThus, looking down likely also stretches the cocoon down a bit further than the toes can actually reach.\n\nI'm also going to make the \"cheese slice\" less than 1 foot wide in the case of TPW (tensegrity policewoman).\n\n1 foot doesn't leave enough room for 7 more slices inside the egg, unless some are a lot more narrow.  But we don't have that information.\n\nAnd the one Carlos drew, if you8 consider proportions, seems to actually be a little less than 1 foot thick.\n\nOn the other hand, if you had \"the terminator\" in that egg, a 1 foot thick slice might seem right, if you consider the J curve lecture Carlos gave.\n\nHow far he moved his finger left and right of center of the band.\n\nIt was closer to 3 inches either way.  Not the 6 you'd assume for a 1 foot thick slice.\n\nBut the way the finger had to angle on the body to get to the other side, which is due to the tilt, still doesn't perfectly agree with a full 1 foot thick.\n\nSo I'm going to match it to the picture, instead of the text description from the books.\n\nIs all this pointless?\n\nAbsolutely not!  If you get too close to the edge of the band of man, you lose consciousness.  Or go into \"slumber\" as don Juan described it.\n\nHe said that women can move to that edge and slide along it, which gives them the ability to slip directly into dreams.\n\nAfter matching the picture's ratio, I got 0.8'.\n\n\"Around\" a foot thick as he stated?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lfcuzbpzqbb1.jpeg?width=472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7175dbf76e06ae50e29c6fdffebb369be902acf7", "edited": 1689263248.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jrt8o15", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the Egg with Assemblage point beaming at a correct angle, drawn by Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please notice this is a narrower egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to try to get the egg shape &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; is not possible.

Not the 6 you&amp;#39;d assume for a 1 foot thick slice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the way the finger had to angle on the body to get to the other side, which is due to the tilt, still doesn&amp;#39;t perfectly agree with a full 1 foot thick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m going to match it to the picture, instead of the text description from the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is all this pointless?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not!  If you get too close to the edge of the band of man, you lose consciousness.  Or go into &amp;quot;slumber&amp;quot; as don Juan described it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that women can move to that edge and slide along it, which gives them the ability to slip directly into dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After matching the picture&amp;#39;s ratio, I got 0.8&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Around&amp;quot; a foot thick as he stated?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

Don't blame me. Blame the Inorganic being!](https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02d34bc1ff887b581761bfa0f47c0e13813d814)\n\nI needed access to Dance Home, in my dreaming self.\n\nBut my forte is dreaming awake, not lucid dreaming.\n\nAnd it took me intense effort at least 6 hours a day for a year, to get enough lucid dreaming to travel to Dance Home.  Back when Carlos was still alive and there was a reason to learn to travel there in dreaming. \n\nI even had to \"travel\" the whole way, from floating above my home 50 miles away.\n\nCities are nice from that high up, especially downtown Los Angeles!\n\nBut I always got distracted on Santa Monica Blvd.  And that's another story.\n\nSo how, if you are doing dreaming awake during darkroom, do you travel to Dance Home in Los Angeles, into a phantom copy?  Something normally done in lucid dreaming by women.\n\nNot so much by men...  They're idiots with delusions of power. Which oddly, they sometimes manage to pull off.\n\nMake a phantom Dance Home in your darkroom?\n\nThat won't work.\n\nI needed to meet a witch there.\n\nHad to be the real Dance Home.\n\nEven if it was hard to \"tune it in\" to the real copy.\n\nThat's not an issue.  You learn about that at the 4th gate of dreaming. Or while shapeshifting for that matter.\n\nBack when I tried to cross that \"forth Gate\", but kept waking up in phantom versions of my bedroom, I should have just said, \"Well screw this!  One bedroom is as good as another to the double!\"\n\nExcept, to \"cross the 4th gate\" you have to be a good little sorcerer, and obey don Juan.\n\nMust be the REAL copy of your bedroom. He even said you had to \"verify that\".\n\nOne night after the 10th \"wake up\" into a copy, not realizing it in one case until I took a shower and drove almost all the way to work, I gave up on 4 gates dreaming.\n\nAnd since then I haven't been very \"big on it\".\n\nFor starters, NO ONE IS DOING IT!\n\nThey just lie and lie and lie, and misrepresent ordinary dreams, the way Astral Travelers do.\n\nThat's death to sorcery!  When you pretend your magic just to get attention, people give it to you!  As long as you reciprocate.\n\nAnd you become \"entitled to respect\" for your \"dreaming skills\". Which you don't have at all...\n\nYou become like all the other systems with their pretend crap magic. Everyone supports each others lies and pretending, in the name of the good of the system.\n\nDo it for the Buddha!!!\n\nNo thanks.\n\nIt's why no serious \"Astral Traveler\", even the ones \"Certified by Monroe Institute\" can ever learn sorcery.\n\nThey're ruined for life by pretending.\n\nYou practically have to be hungry orphans, licking the plates of the wealthy businessmen at the outdoor seating area of a restaurant in Mexico City, to learn sorcery.  Don Juan explained that to Carlos in one of the earlier books.\n\nThe business men's spoiled kids at home pretending to be princes and princesses, have no chance to become \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nAt least according to don Juan.  And naturally he was still tricking Carlos back in that story.\n\nNo one wants to be a miserable \"Man of Knowledge\", unless they are clueless.\n\nWe want to be *SEERS*.\n\nBut to teach Carlos, don Juan went back to the time of the ancient Olmecs and taught him about the profiteers in the world of sorcery. The Men of Knowledge.  Who became our modern \"shamans\".  Not sorcerers however. Just run of the mill shamanism.\n\nWe also don't want to be that.  Unless you like the rambo headband and already have a \"native american\" name picked out for yourself.\n\nDon Juan merely wanted Carlos to learn the \"man of knowledge\" view of the world, compare it to his, and then \"sneak through the middle\" to become a *seer*.\n\nSo I ask you...\n\nCan't we learn what the new seers did, and \"sneak through the middle\" of that too?\n\nWho says we can't grow beyond our masters?\n\nBeats me.\n\nBut I had a future appointment to keep at Dance home, in dreaming, and I didn't want to go back and re-learn 4 gates dreaming.\n\nSo I complained to my inorganic being \"Fancy\".\n\nShe gave me a way to \"sneak through the middle\".\n\nI was flabbergasted!\n\nI commented to her, it was amazing!\n\nShe replied, \"I showed that to you more than a year ago!  You just ignored it.  I suppose you didn't understand that a 'dream bubble' has no actual size.  It took a crying baby to get you to pay attention.\"\n\nWell... The IOBs probably never actually talk.\n\nBut it seems as if they do.\n\nI have a proposal.\n\nLet's recover ALL of the workshops and private classes.\n\nAnd bring them back in cartoon form.\n\n100% accurate.\n\nIt's going to take very powerful sorcerers to do that.  We have to have at least 3 who have mastered, \"re-run\" technology.\n\nBut we have the techniques already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sleeping Dreaming Awake (No Kidding!)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qu2muhwg0qg91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=722b2a54bbd4aaa4f98b57d8074ff5c02092ed69"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7a84f702d987b88620dc2a6ca73980eb30589c"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=192a8ac0c7cfb3ef35c0e6f0745fd768d0af0e4e"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d72489464d7acb0b19fd7fdce04b4cb01754742"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c8eb3f1ab1e185ad1e2b20d611a997a2e1a29fb"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f097619d0eb1fd8303467d097637601586968c0f"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02d34bc1ff887b581761bfa0f47c0e13813d814"}, "id": "qu2muhwg0qg91"}}, "name": "t3_wk96ae", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/esb6sHVQTnj0C7PgSPoNRoaaggq9EfTHYw47cx5uNZU.jpg", "edited": 1660068012.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1660065922.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qu2muhwg0qg91.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f02d34bc1ff887b581761bfa0f47c0e13813d814\"&gt;Look...

You're \"stuck\".\n\nIt's because you created horizontal shift \"flat spots\".\n\nThings you \"know\" you can do down there, and so when you're \"passing through\" on the way to the orange zone, you \"notice\" them.\n\nAnd you get shifted horizontally.\n\nThe known procedure for that is to \"play with it as if it were real\".\n\nThe most dramatic I know of is to stretch a puff like it was taffy, to around 2 feet wide or larger, and then toss it into the air, to become a \"road\".\n\nAnd it does... Believe me.  There's no imagining or visualizing here.\n\nIf you throw it high, you can make an \"overpass road\".\n\nToss it only 5 feet up, and it'll settle down to a dirt road through the middle of your darkroom.\n\nYou may have to \"smooth it\" like a wide ribbon, before it takes on perfect visual form. Just rub your palm across it, as far as you can in each direction.\n\nA trick!  But I hope you figure out why that's a trick on your down.\n\nTricky or not, it works.  Oddly, the road becomes illuminated as if it were midday outdoors!  Maybe on a slightly hazy day though.  \n\nWhat's happening there is, a horizontal shift.\n\nAnd as you do that, your \"rationality\" is lost.\n\nYou have a frigging dirt road running through your darkroom, about the level of your hips!\n\nI mean, come on!  That ought to get you a little excited.  Or at the least, it ought to make you worry a car will come along and run you over.\n\nBut you don't.  The normal reaction is,\"Hey ally of mine, can you show me anything to do with this dirt road?\"\n\nAnd believe me, they will...\n\nThat's like asking Popeye's friend Wimpy, if he can show you what to do with hamburgers.\n\nSo rationality, even at the shallow depth of the red zone, has a strong effect on how much you are in a \"dream\".  Which seems to correspond to a horizontal shift.\n\nLet's assume, it's the percentage of dreaming double being used.\n\nAnd  that guy is nuts!  Not a hair of rationality in him.\n\nIt's a good portion of the reason we can't remember most dreams.\n\nThey make no sense at all!\n\nThe ones we CAN remember, likely have a higher percent of \"rationality\".\n\nOr \"reason\" if you like.\n\nThose are both perhaps, the bi-product of the tonal's awareness being stuck in our physical organs, where stuff tends to be \"mechanical\", and repeatable.\n\nSo the tonal awareness has taken on a sort of \"glow of respectability\".\n\nHe's a rational guy!\n\nIf not, his mom will kick his ass.\n\nNow, this isn't useful to a beginner.\n\nYou just need to tell them, when they first discover \"puffs\",  \"Yes, little Timmy!  Play with the puffs!!  Treat them as real.  Make friends with them.  And they'll help you out and become more real, just as you asked them to.\"\n\nSorry, I went 60s TV on you.  \n\nIt's that 50 inch I bought which comes with YouTube TV reruns.\n\nBut it's true, for a beginner, you just tell them \"play with the puffs!\"\n\nLater, that's a bad idea.\n\nBecause out in the deep orange zone, you get \"stuck\" also.\n\nTo many fun things to do!\n\nWhen little Timmy is in the red section of the huge park,  everything was designed for fun.  And nothing actually \"leaves the park\".\n\nThere's only one entrance, and one exit.\n\nSo you tell Timmy to play with everything he sees, but not too much. He needs to move on each night, to see what's outside \"red park\".\n\nOver in Orange park, it's not enclosed.  There's exists EVERYWHERE.\n\nOver there, it's best to \"stay on the path\".\n\nBecause the purple gazebo at the end of orange park road is amazing...\n\nHowever, that gazebo is enclosed.  Once you get in there (Silent Knowledge), you are so comfortable, you lose the desire to go explore.\n\nAt least, it seems that way to me at this point.\n\nWhat you might want, for \"practical magic\",  is to explore the exits to orange park just short of the Gazebo.\n\nIt's like there's dozens of really cool exits, right by that gazebo.\n\nOne to travel to any location  you can visualize on earth.\n\nOne to travel to alternate copies of yourself, known as \"cyclic beings\".\n\nOne to leap to distant planets, even outside our universe.\n\nHey, I did all of those!  \n\nSo don't assume I have a list from Carlos, and I'm just reading it off. \n\nWe don't believe in \"sacred scrolls\"!  Those are for pretenders.\n\nYOU can do those crazy things too.  And many more.\n\nAnd out there, at the \"really cool exits\" to darkroom, what seems to control whether you can go through some is your rationality.\n\nSome of them can only be entered in your double.\n\nYour physical material is no good.  The guards at the exit gates check that.\n\nNot all of them. Some can be used in your full on physical body.\n\nBut leaping to a distant star?\n\nThat physical matter kind of makes that very hard. Especially when your speed reaches millions of light years per second, as evidenced by watching entire galaxies go by you in seconds.\n\nAnd \"splitting the room in half\" like this picture in this post, shows the \"rationality effect\" on that very deep position of the assemblage point.\n\nLeft side of the picture is the Tonal's awareness dominating.\n\nSure, you need the double at that point or the room would be only darkness.\n\nBut the tonal is fully \"in charge\".\n\nYou can't walk into the right side of the picture, for real, with that much tonal.\n\nIn fact, it's not even visible until you \"reduce\" the rationality nearly completely.\n\nRight on the edge of forgetting what you were doing and just \"going with the flow\", and slightly past that where you \"forget to notice what things are\",  that dreaming half of the room becomes visible.\n\nThere's a tiny black out, so watch out.  Not quite a blackout, but you enter into your double with 0 rationality, so when you come back, you disregard it.\n\nYou have to force the memory to resurface by not doubting it, and then with a tiny bit of rationality added, you can recall it clearly.\n\nAnd go in there deliberately!\n\nIt can be a dream bubble, a weird miniature being on the floor waving to you, or just about any hellish dream image you can imagine.\n\nLike in \"Eraserhead\".\n\nYou could do that too.  I like the dancing girl, but not the cotton stuffed in her cheeks.\n\nBut don't any beginners even think of messing with \"rationality\"!\n\nYou aren't going to become a \"teacher\".  Give it up please???\n\nIt's just mental masturbation to tell yourself, \"yes, now I will drop rationality.  Professor collins has said, in an excellent research paper, that to drop rationality all you need to do is deconstruct...\"\n\nYou get the picture.  Carlos used to taunt the europeans be engaging them in such discussions in private classes. He seemed to be \"toying with them\". But they were too dense to notice.\n\nAt least, it's masturbation until you get to the deep orange zone.  Then over there, you'll understand what \"rationality\" means.  Based on your attention and where it focuses.\n\nIf you \"pretend it\", you'll kill your chances to learn.\n\nBack in the red zone or earlier, just \"play with the puffs, Timmy!\"\n\nIf you can, get Lassie to help.  Your IOB.\n\nDarn TVs...\n\n[https://madlyodd.com/do-you-remember-little-timmy-from-lassie/](https://madlyodd.com/do-you-remember-little-timmy-from-lassie/)\n\nAdvanced people: Once you ditch Gru, you have to control the Nazi scientist more if you want to enter sleeping dreaming.", "edited": 1660083556.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ijn1167", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s starting to look like, there are two things to control in darkroom, to get fun stuff to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Internal dialogue, so your assemblage point can drift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;rationality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rationality seems to be like a slider from tonal, to nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From you, to your dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t recall enough &amp;quot;inspirational quotes&amp;quot; from the books to insure that&amp;#39;s absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if that&amp;#39;s the case, and those with experience in the red zone can tell you that horizontal shifts down there make things very bizarre, we might conclude that at any level you can get &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; of the dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get more and more spectacular results, but at the expense of your rationality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stay right in the middle of the J curve, with no horizontal shift, you can move along it the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you play too much down in the red zone, you can get permanently unable to move out of there.

I just don&amp;#39;t see any other reason to fold them, if you aren&amp;#39;t planning to store them somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day we&amp;#39;ll have &amp;quot;bizarre tensegrity&amp;quot; posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any tensegrity done in a strong dreaming state, but while fully awake, gets very strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_wk96ae", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wk96ae/sleeping_dreaming_awake_no_kidding/ijv0q4s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660228286.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1660228286.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ijs4zcu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660170535.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ijq1jnc", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1660171803.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wk96ae/sleeping_dreaming_awake_no_kidding/ijs4zcu/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_ijs4zcu", "created": 1660170535.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ijq1jnc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660142019.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ijn333g", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That's nothing.

The findings raise new questions about the  settlement of early peoples on the continent.\n\nMichael Waters, distinguished professor of anthropology and director  of the Center for the Study of the First Americans at Texas A&amp;M, and  colleagues from Baylor University and the University of Texas have had  their work published in the current issue of *Science Advances*.\n\nThe team found the numerous weapons -- about 3-4 inches long -- while  digging at what has been termed the Debra L. Friedkin site, named for  the family who owns the land about 40 miles northwest of Austin in  Central Texas. The site has undergone extensive archaeological work for  the past 12 years.\n\nSpear points made of chert and other tools were  discovered under several feet of sediment that dating revealed to be  15,500 years old, and pre-date Clovis, who for decades were believed to  be the first people to enter the Americas.\n\n\"There is no doubt these weapons were used for hunting game in the  area at that time,\" Waters said. \"The discovery is significant because  almost all pre-Clovis sites have stone tools, but spear points have yet  to be found. These points were found under a layer with Clovis and  Folsom projectile points. Clovis is dated to 13,000 to 12,700 years ago  and Folsom after that. The dream has always been to find diagnostic  artifacts -- such as projectile points -- that can be recognized as  older than Clovis and this is what we have at the Friedkin site.\"\n\nClovis is the name given to the distinctive tools made by people  starting around 13,000 years ago. The Clovis people invented the \"Clovis  point,\" a spear-shaped weapon made of stone that is found in Texas and  parts of the United States and northern Mexico and the weapons were made  to hunt animals, including mammoths and mastodons, from 13,000 to  12,700 years ago.\n\n\"The findings expand our understanding of the earliest people to  explore and settle North America,\" Waters said. \"The peopling of the  Americas during the end of the last Ice Age was a complex process and  this complexity is seen in their genetic record.

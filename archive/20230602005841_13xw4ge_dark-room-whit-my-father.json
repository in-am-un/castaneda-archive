Sitting up on the light pole on the street, screaming a warning at me continuously.\n\nIt was the blue jay who lives near the huge avocado tree next door.\n\nUsually if you speak to a bird that's as close to you as that one was, it takes off just to make sure you aren't about to shot it with a BB gun or something.\n\nKids do that.\n\nBut it stood its ground, and looked towards Cholita inside the house.  Still squawking at the top of its lungs.\n\nWhen I got in I asked Cholita if she'd pissed off the blue jay.  It's the one I had to rescue from being inside the fire place.\n\nCholita's favorite spot for curses and spells.\n\nCholita played dumb, like I was talking crazy.\n\nBut a week later, there was the blue jay horribly murdered on our lawn.

Like the pictures in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the double women was working at a  Home Depot store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was building a custom camera for Harvard University.  I needed to buy some weather proofing spray.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Home Depot had self-checkout stands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was studying one of those trying to figure out if it was a windows based machine, on a linux device.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always hope for Linux.  Like everyone else, I hate Microsoft...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A young woman working there saw an old man puzzled by the self-checkout, and came over to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stuck her hands into my view to get my attention as I was looking down at the machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had amazing blue/green painted fingernails, the way very young women often do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She asked, &amp;quot;Do you need any help?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a big pervert and looking at those 21 year old hands, I joked &amp;quot;I ALWAYS need help...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;#39;t realize was, she was a double woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked up to see if she got the joke, and that&amp;#39;s exactly what I saw.  What&amp;#39;s on the cover of that paperback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve since heard the same thing happened to Taisha or Florinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No head!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just that burst of filaments of light, where her face ought to have been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So be prepared for very cool weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The books are 100% true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10b6rz8/which_book_should_i_read_first/j48thgq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1673652416.0, "media_metadata": {"9a3oimm2qxba1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 181, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9a3oimm2qxba1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4ad294a82b8bb45ed72d829a8b6636f3163e1d4"}], "s": {"y": 350, "x": 208, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9a3oimm2qxba1.png?width=208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69eb9ff560f4d9c02541c142f6865825681e8c00"}, "id": "9a3oimm2qxba1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_10b6rz8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j48kqiz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "koskopol", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1673648895.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j48ghy9", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_26cz33yx", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "thank you, i agree holding the physical copy is much more enjoyable.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j48kqiz", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;thank you, i agree holding the physical copy is much more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_10b6rz8", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10b6rz8/which_book_should_i_read_first/j48kqiz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1673648895.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j48ghy9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1673647221.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10b6rz8", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "A Separate Reality is always my vote.\n\nIt\u2019s rather difficult to find Casteneda\u2019s works in public libraries. \n\nSomebody always seems to steal them.\n\nBut ask your librarian to source them for you through interlibrary loan.

We don't want it to become so real, we can't leave and go back to our Cholitas waiting at home.\n\nBut some worlds are stable all by themselves.\n\nMeaning, those worlds have their own energy!\n\nThey're the famous \"energy generating worlds\".\n\nAnd those are far easier to maintain.

Something you knew as a child, but forgot.\n\nDream worlds have \"hues\".\n\nAnd you can return to some, when you are still a child, by looking for the hue.\n\nIt just materializes around you, once you \"spot that coloration\".\n\nHere's also a \"useful tip\".\n\nSome things you can do in darkroom which are super cool, work best when you have been \"resting\".\n\nWhen you haven't been moving around.\n\nI'm not talking about laying down and closing your eyes.\n\nJust, sitting up on pillows looking at the darkness for \"stuff\", can be more powerful for summoning something like SK, than walking around.\n\nBut doing tensegrity, is more effective than resting.\n\nNot walking around.

What we need is a teacher to convince us that there is incalculable power at our fingertips. What a strange paradox!

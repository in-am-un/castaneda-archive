I can turn on the lights in my room at any time, go get a drink, and I\u2019ll probably only lose 15 minutes.\n\nIt takes a while to move the assemblage point back, but not as long as it takes to get it there that night.\n\nThe classification of \u201cInorganic Being\u201d really just means, a \u201cbeing\u201d, with no organic body.\n\nI suppose it could even include beings you manifested yourself. Except that those would also be \u201cphantoms\u201d.\n\nIn either case, there\u2019s no need to worry.\n\nCarlos taught us to tell the difference.\n\nPhantoms can\u2019t hold up to a stare. They mutate and dissolve.\n\nBeings with awareness do not go away. They get more intense.\n\nI\u2019d like to add, there are classic inorganic beings, such as don Juan\u2019s, \u201cThe little smoke\u201d.\n\nCholita has that one. At least sometimes.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it was another entity she has, my \u201clittle fairy\u201d, but I\u2019ve seen a little puff of smoke follow her around, and push things out of place.\n\nIt\u2019s literally a \u201clittle smoke\u201d. Don Juan never explained why he called it that, but everything else turns out to be simple.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve seen \u201clittle smoke\u201d several times.\n\nBesides classic \u201cinorganic beings\u201d, there are humans who have transformed themselves into the 3rd attention. Those have no organic body also.\n\nBut there are also \u201cblue scouts\u201d.\n\nAnd duck-like creatures that follow Taisha and Florinda to workshops.\n\nIt\u2019s a mistake to think there\u2019s only one type of inorganic being, and it should behave like the little smoke.\n\nCholita brought Minx back from Washington. I can\u2019t figure out what that thing is. You can look him up in here.\n\nLately, when I finish moving my assemblage point to the end of the J curve, and try out some lucid dreaming, I immediately run into Cholita\u2019s dream. Minx likes to hang out there.\n\nEach type of inorganic being gives off a different feeling.\n\nSome are so subtle, you wouldn\u2019t even call them a feeling. It\u2019s more like the absence of a feeling, or sound. And yet, with something obviously solid and real, thrashing around in front of you.\n\nBut other creatures give off strong feelings.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if the feeling is because they cause your assemblage point to move, just by watching them, or if they are something else.\n\n2 days before Cholita ran away again, I was chasing what I thought to be \u201cthe nagual\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I thought that, except that don Juan talked about it like it was a \u201cthing\u201d, which put the idea into my head.\n\nAnd so when I ran into the gremlin like thing, and the feeling it gave off was of absolute mystery and bliss, I assumed this might be a manifestation of \u201cthe nagual\u201d.\n\nProperly the Nagual is all that is part of us, and is not contained in the Tonal.\n\nIt\u2019s the delusional, impossible, useless stuff that our agriculture based society found threatening.\n\nThey tossed it out so well, that to even suggest it exists is madness.\n\nThey bully it out of their children, ruthlessly.\n\nAnd yet, there it was. That thing that was removed from our lives.\n\nIt was running around my bedroom, leaping onto the dresser and the bed frame.\n\nAt the time, the room was so distorted, the dresser was on the east wall near the ceiling, and my bed was below the floor.\n\nBut I still saw it hopping on the furniture, like a mischievous gremlin.\n\nOnce I saw it, I coveted it.\n\nThere\u2019s no way you wouldn\u2019t!\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t reach it. It was always just out of reach.\n\nAnd worse, in trying to catch up with it I was drawn further and further into the second attention.\n\nCholita tried to follow me a couple of days in a row.\n\nThis realm is just past a thick second attention fog which is so misshapen that it produces images at every point. Objects, places, people. Anything can show up, when you focus on a piece of that fog.\n\nIt presents a barrier.\n\nSeems a lot more fun than the \"wall of fog\", which kept Carlos out of there.\n\nI suppose things are different for us, doing it under our own power.\n\nIt\u2019s a barrier Enlightened people won\u2019t pass. Or at least, these days gurus believe enlightenment stops there, at the door to the deepest reaches of the second attention.\n\nThey actually give instructions to their students on what is ok to perceive, and what is not.\n\nAnd the instructions are designed to put you onto your own little throne, to be worshiped by your followers.\n\nThat\u2019s what most people want. Even the ones who are supposed to be \u201cenlightened\u201d.\n\nSince there's no such thing as permanent enlightenment, they're lying from the start.\n\nBut it's ok in the Asian social order, which is Senpai dominated to the extreme. It would be morally wrong if your enlightened leader could become senile.  So he just can't!\n\nOk???\n\nThe Hindus aren't as daft about it.  First of all, they're already senile.\n\nNo problem.  Meditation does that to you.\n\nAnd they agree you have to keep it up, to keep your gains.\n\nBut they've mostly become impotent these days.\n\nJust selling breathing techniques and such.\n\nYou can see a guru who\u2019s stopped there, in my picture.\n\nHe\u2019s \"found the ultimate\". If it\u2019s the ultimate, then there\u2019s nothing more.\n\nHe isn\u2019t even aware you can pass through that wall.  And why would he?\n\nThere's enough money and food right there, on that throne.\n\nCholita in her dreaming double knew it was possible to enter, because she saw me in there.\n\nActually, she's likely seen me stuck in that stuff for a week or two.  While in there, I can't possibly notice her visits.\n\nMaybe she was just surprised to see me walking around, and tried to follow.\n\nBut in her dreaming body, she gets scattered. What you see there is as close to what I saw as I can paint with a computer. It really did happen like that.  The head even became green and expanded like that.\n\nI don't add details I didn't see.  Some are impossible to portray, but I do my best.\n\nCholita was fine, all broken to pieces.\n\nBut she couldn\u2019t move. It\u2019s hard to go anywhere, broken into pieces like that.\n\nI supposed she drifted back and left the room when she realized she could not follow.\n\nBut I wouldn't have noticed. I was reaching out as hard as I could, to encourage that little creature to come back and sit still for me.\n\nAs I tried to catch up with the gremlin, I realized that I was going deeper and deeper into the second attention. That\u2019s where the gremlin lives. Deeper inside than I can go.\n\nIt became too thick for me.\n\nI suspect he only came out to lure me further in.\n\nIn some ways, that square tunnel is merely the J curve.\n\nBut past the bottom, and coming up the top.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=1618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca64eaa007b24b01a860dcc471ba2e84d3b93f2c](https://preview.redd.it/ebfi4gp2kcz41.jpg?width=1618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca64eaa007b24b01a860dcc471ba2e84d3b93f2c)\n\nNow you can see the difference between most Hindu or Buddhist meditation systems, and sorcery.\n\nThe gurus stop and remain on their thrones.  If they're lucky, they get a huge book deal, and a Temple in Malibu.\n\nThat\u2019s all they wanted. A good buzz, and plenty of attention from other people.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe that, take a visit to India.\n\nEdited twice", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Hunting Gremlins in the Second Attention", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Illustrations"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 90, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"06lsputvgc651": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d4f601a5f0ea7359ea2d671503e8e9d6fdfd648"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f18cabd53e4c0e86b498b7117d24c65eae7fa808"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73aafbdd65d9f161f0f05ea3079210175289aaa8"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=160b297508313202426175d632b2148705ff360f"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ef5e729424c3f0f72b36c00c099df55919d34df"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04bb149cf08443a235f7c89beae1e3685f06c64b"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=091aa1d3af6614e9da4e43819b21998637c62e77"}, "id": "06lsputvgc651"}}, "name": "t3_hdguap", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 12, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Illustrations", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/dWJGRt9BYNgoh4EIH8h5vJnShm4S1ddZ8XXPzPbKjik.jpg", "edited": 1596826704.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1592781872.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=091aa1d3af6614e9da4e43819b21998637c62e77\"&gt;No, this is not as weird as it gets.

But you're around the same age as him. And he can't get a wife.

She&amp;#39;d stop a random person while shopping, and point out that I could not get an erection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I proved it to her, gently.  Look here. I already have one because you were bending over like that in those, what is that panty hose???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita doesn&amp;#39;t mind honesty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as it turned out, that had been a very bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita became obsessed with what she now believed to be the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me, she was very aware. And she knew who I was!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow I had reached out with my evil sorcery powers, to kidnap her, and force her to be  my wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I was earning millions, writing about her on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She decided the only solution was to get me a substitute wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so from then on, she doesn&amp;#39;t point out that I can&amp;#39;t get an erection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead she tries to sell me to unaccompanied women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her sales pitch goes like this:  You aren&amp;#39;t very pretty.  But you&amp;#39;re around the same age as him. And he can&amp;#39;t get a wife.

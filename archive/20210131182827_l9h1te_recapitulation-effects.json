And your recap won't be very effective.](https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8154c47674c7d1f8a303d11ee4a9a5686550c91e)\n\nHow is it that people can practice meditation for 20 years, and get nowhere?\n\nIf that sounds like it has \"gall\", just go look around in the meditation forums.  And point them to the things being done in here.  They should either understand it, or rejoice to see it. But instead, they will lynch you.\n\nWhat goes wrong is, someone tells them to ignore the visions they have during meditation, and \"just keep going down\".\n\nThe same is true with recapitulation.  You have to notice when the second attention comes out,  when inorganic beings manifest, when you translocate,  and when the dreaming double finally shows up in the vicinity.\n\nThere's an order to that, keep it in mind.\n\nI suppose the key to this is the same as the key to a child playing in the bathtub, with his little toy submarine.\n\nOr a little girl with her ducky/squirt gun.\n\nThink back to the endorphin rush you got, moving your little toy though it's imaginary stories.\n\nA true high came over you.  The same kind of high people get from Codeine.\n\nOr from reading the books of Carlos Castaneda.\n\nIt's the daydreaming high!  A natural reward, to encourage that type of behavior.\n\nEspecially in children, who have incomplete understandings of the things they see, and benefit by thinking about them more and imagining the possibilities.\n\nCan a child actually visibly see the scenes in his bathtub adventure?\n\nYes!  But it's in the second attention. He sort of switches \"bodies\" to view that scene.\n\nIt's not the same as waking dreaming, but it's very close.\n\nThat's what you want to find in recap. And in fact, recap restores that ability to adults.\n\nI don't want to alter the rules you use during recap, so follow the instructions you found closely.\n\nBut keep an eye out for the fun stuff.\n\nI left one out of that picture.\n\nTunnels.  Entries to the inorganic beings realm.\n\nA tunnel can manifest in front of you, just the right size for you to stand up and walk in.\n\nJust gaze in there.   And try to remember the kind of dedication to remembering the scenes from the list, which triggered it.  Was it the smooth breathing?  A better way of sweeping the head? Slower, faster?  Deeper breathing?\n\nProbably, it was the concentration on the scene, which caused your internal dialogue to stop for long enough to shift the assemblage point.\n\nHow much time did it take to get there?  I'm afraid to say, recap is like dark room gazing.\n\nThe coolest stuff happens at the 3 hour mark.\n\nWhat sort of environment were you in?  That can help too.\n\nCloset?  Crate?  On chair in room with full sunlight, in dim light?  Arm chair?\n\nWe don't want to modify the procedure we've been given for recap.\n\nI'm sure someone could turbo charge it, with some changes.\n\nBut it's not a good idea.\n\nIt's been tested for hundreds of years.  Even a slight modification might be bad from some practitioners.\n\nIt's easy to get a wrong idea in your head, and go off the path on intent.\n\n\"The *Intent* of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico.\"\n\nIt's the only viable intent we have. Any other intent, any addition from another teaching, or person outside Carlos and the witches,  will harm your progress.\n\nBut within the rules there's a wide range of variances.\n\nFigure out which varieties of recapitulation procedures and setup produce the \"fun\" stuff.\n\nGo for that.\n\nA quick memory.  When asked about recapitulation, Carlos would never answer in private classes.\n\nHis face took on an odd smile, as if he was worried about breaking something.  He'd glance at the witches, they'd look surprised and reluctant, and then Taisha would answer the question.\n\nBut almost as if she were afraid of disturbing something already in progress.\n\nEnd of memory.  Cholita has more, but she won't talk.\n\nNow for things that can go wrong:\n\n1 )  Spending forever making the list, when you could have started as soon as the list had 1 item.\n\nTrust me. The list only expands. It's never complete!\n\n2 ) Abuse in the past becomes a barrier and you don't want to do it.\n\nFear is the first enemy of a man of ...\n\nWell you know the story.   Just walk it off.  Pretend like your high school sports couch won't take no for an answer, and keep jogging around the loop.  You have 1000 more laps to go!  \n\n3 ) Can't find enough memories when you know there are more.\n\nGo to the grocery store. Start at the first isle.  Look at every item on the shelf, to see if you remember how that item was used in your life.  Now remember who was there. Where you were.\n\nCream of wheat cereal?  \n\nLaundry bluing?\n\nMetal Hair curlers?\n\nThe more bizarre the store, the better.\n\nYou get the idea.  If you don't fully get it, head for an antique mall. Or the flee market where every table is like the Island of the Tonal.\n\nAnd go to every place you ever lived, and walk around to every place you went while there.  Look at all details, even the smallest.\n\nLook at the dirt on the side of the road.  Look where children look.\n\nBring a recorder, or if you can manage to write while doing something else, the way Carlos could, bring a pad of paper and a pencil.\n\nGo to every park you can remember. Every swimming hole.  Every place you and your friends played, in the ditch behind the toy store or school.\n\nGo back to your schools!  Walk around there if it's allowed. If not, walk the outside.\n\nGet a dictionary.  It's ok to get a small travel dictionary.\n\nLook at every single word, starting with the As.  See if it triggers more memories.\n\nIf you do all of this, your daydreaming ability will be fully restored by the time  you get to the Ms.\n\nAnd the phantoms in the dark room will become solid and real looking.\n\nYour dreams will become so vivid, they will give you more opportunities to remember to find your hands.\n\nThe benefits of recapitulation are endless.  The dreaming double can even come around, right into the same room you are in.\n\nCommonly he first shows up, where you are, as a shadow stepping in from the light.  But in \"another realm\".\n\nIt's the \"other realm\" part that will make you ignore it.\n\nDon't!\n\nRemember the first rule of sorcery:  Everything you perceive is taken as real.   Even dreams.\n\nWe try to eliminate the \"real / not real\" prejudices that were imposed on us as children.\n\nThose block reality!  They don't enhance or protect it.\n\nOnce the double makes a guest appearance, try to get it to happen regularly.\n\nAnd between the two of you,  you will find the abstract and clean your link to intent.\n\nIntent is our new leader.  Carlos assigned us the task of finding it, so we would know what to do next.\n\nIt's a complete path.\n\nSo what went wrong out there?\n\nNo one told them what to look for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Recapitulation Effects", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"uyyy8bvp9pe61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a542b79820f7b7a2fad88578fd5966e9fd4a1855"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ae4de8a9d3833536f36264cee55e128267f8aa"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c804eeb8c57e4d531953a57e805f52d1788fca4f"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddc4427f953a2d48024ee2cc45e6b4b581b04764"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a01c8257cd8e5951c74b95b3c68bce6cb714c90c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f1c799b862ea00e4d55ff50bcbbd17feab1b482"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8154c47674c7d1f8a303d11ee4a9a5686550c91e"}, "id": "uyyy8bvp9pe61"}}, "name": "t3_l9h1te", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6lS5uUIUSAGalmKmltqlRj4mMuR-jzAiyrxs8KEHqnA.jpg", "edited": 1612116355.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1612114107.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uyyy8bvp9pe61.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8154c47674c7d1f8a303d11ee4a9a5686550c91e\"&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t look for it, you won&amp;#39;t find it.

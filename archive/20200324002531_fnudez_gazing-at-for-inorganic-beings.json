I'll then repeat \"I release all attachments\u201d.\n\nThe funny thing is yesterday as I was doing this and releasing it, as a response, it shortly tried to come back just at a lower volume, more of a background volume... and kind of say to me \"I'm not bothering anyone, I'll just sing quietly back here, don't mind me\". LOL But I was able to make it stop. Just interesting how it almost seemed to have a life/personality of it's own.\n\nI spent quite a bit of time relaxing every muscle of my body very thoroughly.  After meditating and doing some visual work I sat in silence, not much happened.\n\nThe being that always hops on the bed, I sometimes can feel it during sitting meditation but it\u2019s manifestations are as far as I can tell, not as current and noticeable as when I lay down.\n\n# After about 1.5 hours I finally laid down and continued the inner silence.\n\nI could feel it hop on the bed, and I telepathically told it, I'm here and present.  Maybe in the past I wasn't ready to communicate, but here I am, and I am ready now.  I do NOT invite you to jump into my body, but there has got to be a way for us to communicate.  I understand humans have had contact with your kind throughout history, so ... help me here, how does this work? I know it's gotta be telepathic, so I open my telepathic perception, so that I may better *see* you.\n\n# I intended the opening of my telepathic eye.\n\nI then could feel it crawl up subtlety and my eyes were barely opened, and also in a gazing mode, I originally just wanted them closed, but was realizing they were barely opened. When they were like this, I could see blackness it was also very subtle, to the point where I was doubtful if it was anything, or just nothing. However it FELT like it was something.  As it manifested immediately after I did this, and felt it crawl up the bed.\n\nIt was a smokey blackness that was right over my chest and manifesting upwards and straight over my face.  Similar to when my eyes are closed and I see the white light and blackness moving it around and taking over it and doing random stuff.  Except it was right over my face, it felt like it wanted to be menacing, but I wasn't going to entertain it as anything like that.  I would close my eyes fully, I could still see it, but I saw it best when I allowed my eyes to open just barely, and sort of gaze, like when you un-focus your eyes, so it's like you're using the back of your vision instead of the front of your vision.\n\nIt was like a smokey dagger, meaning it\u2019s face, if it was it\u2019s face over mine, was no wider than may 3 inches.  Smokey blackness just moving upwards, but not continuing to manifest above a point.  So it was over my chest and over my face, and also directly on top, also no more than 3 inches away. After a while I could feel it move towards the foot of the bed, and heard it jump off the bed (again an inner-audible sound heard with ear plugs on, it\u2019s actually a sound AND feeling).\n\nWhen it jumped off the bed, the smokey display I was witnessing was no longer present, it was just regular darkness of the room without anything else.  I couldn\u2019t really feel it moving around the room, I could only hear it make a noise like 2 or 3x, which was the same sound it makes when jumping off the bed.  Then it jumped back on the bed, but it wasn't straight over my face, as I couldn't see that again... I visualized my 3rd eye to be a huge eyeball just floating above my chest, staring in the direction that I last heard it, to let it know that I was FULLY intending to *see* it, without any fear or anything to prevent me. EYE WIDE OPEN buddy.\n\nIt seemed to get annoyed, and left the room.... I felt like it was going to another room to try and feed off someone else, so at that point I did a meditation where I surrounded everyone with balls of light that was tethered to me, so any attempt to feed on them, would be feeding off of me, and FORCE it to interact with only me.  It kind of felt like I could tell who it was messing with, as I was sort of able to intuitively visualize the blackness over their body, trying to feed off them.  As I scanned the house asking myself, where is the activity?\n\nSo I began meditating to suck it's energy into my solar plexus chakra.  (I don't think I was very effective, but I was trying, and hopefully exercising my luminescent *will* fibers) It didn't respond immediately, but it did end up coming back into the room and hopping back on the bed.  More or less not much more happened after this that was notable/noticeable.\n\n# I\u2019m posting this for 2 reasons.\n\n1. This was the first time I had deliberately seen it as the black wispy shadow over my face.  OK, well I have perceived something of it before, but first deliberate attempt without fear and full focus.\n2. I\u2019m curious if anyone has any ideas of what else I might try, to try and get some kind of better communication/contact out of it.\n\nNote:  The sucking of it's energy is my attempt to push/pull on it's energy, as I didn't note, but I was doing a breathe meditation where I would try to siphon it's energy or pull it towards me, and on the exhale I would push more loving energy or light energy towards it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI DID have some pretty active dreams last night, the prime emotion that ended up eliciting out of me was\u2026 sympathy that I was feeling deeply.  I\u2019m thinking this is the emotion they opted for tonight.\n\nThe night before, it was a dream where my car was stolen for the 2nd time (in the past month) which made me angry, especially as a plethora of dream characters manifested to continue the distraction game, and I was having none of it.\n\nAnyway, and insights/ideas would be appreciated, thanks for reading!", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Gazing at/for Inorganic Beings", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_fnudez", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_5rco1mpq", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1585006515.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1585005931.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Last night I meditated between 2-4 AM&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of a friend telling me they used this, I\u2019ve adopted it and started saying \u201cI release all attachments, I release all judgments, I release the past entirely, I release all plans, I am in no hurry\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has helped me to achieve inner silence a lot faster, so thought I would mention it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, one of the trickest parts of the flier mind is playing a song after all other thoughts have ceased.

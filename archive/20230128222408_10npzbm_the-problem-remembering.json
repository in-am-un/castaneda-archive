So they don't realize what they did.\n\nAnd since none of those other systems is even aware of the assemblage point, naturally there's nothing in any of those to help women figure out what's been going on.\n\nWorse, the \"Prophets\" ordered all witches murdered as soon as they were detected.\n\nWomen are a threat to poor sorcerers.\n\nBut a huge bonus to real ones.\n\nA woman in need of soothing her biology will even make it all the way down to the red lie on the J curve, if that's what it takes to soothe her monthly pain.\n\nBut don't you shapeshift down there?\n\nExactly.\n\nA woman can literally shapeshift to relieve the pain.\n\nBut that's another topic. One we don't understand very well yet.\n\nThe main point of this post, is that I was doing too many animation tutorials on Youtube just now, lost concentration during the \"bendy bone\" rigging presentation, and needed something relaxing for a while.\n\nSo I \"extracted\" these 2 experiences from last night.\n\nThe woman, because I have no idea who she was.\n\nCould have been Cholita, but Cholita isn't shy about just walking right in through the east wall.\n\nWasn't an inorganic being, because she moved at full speed and was absolutely stable.\n\nI could almost see where she was currently located, through her background.\n\nIf I'm lucky she'll visit again tonight.\n\nThe other experience shown there was interesting because I saw just what you see there.\n\nOr at least, it's as close as I can get without spending too much time on it.\n\nWhen I'm doing animations, I will. Because you can recycle stuff through many angles and sizes.  And the results of your efforts became \"drag and drop\" for anyone in the future to use.\n\nSo it's worth being accurate.\n\nBut not with stills.\n\nI suppose because I had seen something similar which became fully solid just a night or two ago, I was presented with a new \"magical object\" designed to be \"impressive\".\n\nSilent Knowledge is \"topical\".\n\nOnce you have a \"presentation method\".\n\nAnd \"Impressive Magical Object\" can be the presentation method!\n\nLikely if on a given night you have a super cool \"presentation method\" that gives you a thrill, you can assume that same presentation method will be in effect the next night until you deliberately select a different one.\n\nAnything can be a \"presentation method\".\n\nAnything...\n\nYou could read tea leaves in a cup.  I wish some witch would learn to do just that!\n\nOr read the tarot cards using silent knowledge.\n\nOr listen to the wind rattle leaves during one of those Santa Ana wind storms they have in Los Angeles.\n\nOr my current favorite, play with magical objects.\n\nIf the presentation method is \"cool abstract stuff floating in the air\",  then the next thing silent knowledge requires is the \"topic\".\n\nIn my case I saw this amazing sight, turned around to see what the rest of the room looked like now, and forgot I even saw it.\n\nI was facing the north wall when it materialized, I turned around out of guilt to see if the south wall was displaying text as Carlos had instructed us to do, and when I saw nothing forming text on the south wall I began to walk away. Towards my water bottle.\n\nAt which point I had a nagging thought.\n\nHey...\n\nDidn't I just see???\n\nYes, I did!\n\nWhen I turned around the magical sun like burst was still there in the air.\n\nI thought to myself, \"How you can you forget a sight like that in 5 seconds?\n\nBig mistake.\n\nI'd just selected the \"topic\". I even asked.  Like an idiot!\n\nDon't pose any questions when in silent knowledge, unless you want it to be taken seriously.\n\nSo the topic was now \"forgetting\".\n\nI turned around to see if I'd forget, and I did. But just before it was too late I turned back to look at the object again, and it was there.\n\nI nearly lost all memory of it in those few seconds.  I was even surprised to see it, when it returned.  \"Oh, so that's what I was so excited about.  Yes, it is indeed lovely!\"\n\nI genuinely felt that, just seconds after I'd seen it earlier, and forgotten it.\n\nBut as long as I knew which direction to return to, the object was back.  If I had forgotten the direction, I suspect I'd have never found it again.\n\nI went back and forth just because it was so hard to believe.\n\nOne of my Allies suggested, \"The direction is also part of how the emanations get skimmed.  You already knew that!  And so is the curve of your back.\"\n\nThen I got a silent knowledge presentation on everything I'd recently forgotten.  Including the physical body's relationship, to how hard it was to recall.\n\nIt was so exciting I wanted to run to my computer.\n\nBut I didn't.\n\nSo it's all forgotten now.\n\nBut what good is this to you, if you can't get there yet?\n\nIt's for your protection.  People despise Carlos, and will say or make up anything to destroy his reputation.\n\nI even have a few idiots in here, downvoting my posts. As if they can do harm that way, to make themselves feel better.\n\nBecause the books of Carlos make everyone else look lame. Including the ones pretending to be following him.\n\nAnd looking lame costs them money.\n\nSo one of the \"arguments\" the worst of them came up with, was how come there's so much more after \"Second Ring of Power\"?\n\nHow could Carlos possibly have \"forgotten\" all of that?\n\nIsn't it more likely he wanted to write more books so he just made up some new stuff?\n\nWell that's obvious nonsense once you can do what you see in that picture, knowing NO ONE FROM ANY OTHER SYSTEM CAN.\n\nThey've got nothing!  Even the idea of keeping your eyes open makes their eye twitch out of anger.  They realize it is in fact very lame to have to sit with your eyes closed during meditation. Fake even.\n\nBut they won't wise up.  They aren't honestly interested in magic.\n\n\"Master\" or not.\n\nAnd they'll say stuff like, Carlos made it all up.  Completely ignoring that you can duplicate it all, and they can't.\n\nAnd as Carlos joked, \"I'm not that intelligent!  There's no way I could make all this up.\"\n\nBut until you see how everything is interconnected from the very first book to the last, and explains all religions and all magical systems,  going so much further than those that they all seem childish, that argument isn't satisfying.\n\nSo just remember this.\n\nIt's very easy to forget magic.\n\nIt's natural to forget it.\n\nOtherwise, I suppose everyone would be doing it already.\n\nEven children.\n\nBut as children discover magic, their parents \"wipe\" it from their mind with chastisement and bullying.\n\nIn a \"friendly and helpful\" manner.\n\nAnd since our tendency is to forget sights from other levels of the J curve,  perhaps by design, any discouragement regarding magic is enough to seal the deal.\n\nObliterate it from your mind, until it finally becomes automatic to do so.\n\nWe suppress most of what we perceive.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Problem Remembering", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"o7cfvs7sruea1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f5ada9c2b6d91a415614f935a8e51bb059a8c4d"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f49b2471c66f977fa526e3099694201a260dfdc1"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29206ba9e8e7e9aeef3f1c08399ea14380fb7214"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0bc3fa19979f92b0f3e68b2f206bd834a6613a4"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e3b9a7b52dc10168b57f83510c7596fe0ed17f4"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89eb657b42c43baee2f55d1e92e44dd2c56e17e8"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d06797da9e2a827e10e5131bc2eee5fa7bbdea83"}, "id": "o7cfvs7sruea1"}}, "name": "t3_10npzbm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3lPErSdVsUcaKz4OPt6ZLJs7tAGusdFNfBCB-dBbToM.jpg", "edited": 1674941602.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1674941048.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d06797da9e2a827e10e5131bc2eee5fa7bbdea83\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/o7cfvs7sruea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d06797da9e2a827e10e5131bc2eee5fa7bbdea83&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t honestly say that not being able to remember your sorcery experiences is actually a &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is in fact good news over which you should celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means you&amp;#39;ve moved into at least the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, keep in mind, I&amp;#39;m not talking about any horizontal shifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A horizontal shift at any level on the J curve, produces stuff that&amp;#39;s VERY  hard to remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s so bizarre, that&amp;#39;s not really something you&amp;#39;d worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s those &amp;quot;rational&amp;quot;

it from their mind with chastisement and bullying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a &amp;quot;friendly and helpful&amp;quot; manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since our tendency is to forget sights from other levels of the J curve,  perhaps by design, any discouragement regarding magic is enough to seal the deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obliterate it from your mind, until it finally becomes automatic to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We suppress most of what we perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "10npzbm", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10npzbm/the_problem_remembering/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/10npzbm/the_problem_remembering/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1674941048.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6ah29k", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1674946087.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j6aa78k", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "A really good AI would notice this subreddit, and read EVERYTHING.\n\nAnd compare it to all other systems.\n\nSo that we got an honest recommendation to tell other people.\n\n\"The AI says you're full of shit, and Castaneda is probably not full of shit.\"\n\nIt has in fact spit out stuff like that in regards to other things.\n\nCorrected some misunderstandings that led to arguments.\n\nI'm not sure whether people accepted it or not.\n\nBut in fact, \"the truth\" of politics and science, is not up for grabs as everyone claims.\n\nYou can look at the facts and draw very valid conclusions.\n\nPeople just won't.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j6ah29k", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A really good AI would notice this subreddit, and read EVERYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And compare it to all other systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that we got an honest recommendation to tell other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The AI says you&amp;#39;re full of shit, and Castaneda is probably not full of shit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has in fact spit out stuff like that in regards to other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Corrected some misunderstandings that led to arguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure whether people accepted it or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, &amp;quot;the truth&amp;quot;

It's only recently been becoming obvious to me.\n\nUp at the blue line everything pretty much sucks endlessly, but we convince ourselves it's going to be better someday. We have little fairy tales in our minds, to keep us believing we'll all live happily ever after.\n\nOur grandparents who know we won't, still take part in making the grandkids kids feel optimistic and hopeful.  And those delusions will take them at least into their mid 20s.\n\nAt which point they'll still believe everyone else is having a good time, so it must just be them and they need to work on it.\n\nNot dump it all.\n\nIf you use some meditation technique to escape to the green, it feels like a revelation there!\n\nIt doesn't suck!\n\nBliss, visions, the ability to shift left and see God, Angels, and Heaven.\n\nOr shift right into visions of physical activity, sex, violence.\n\nRemote viewing is possible up at the green too, making you feel more powerful than other people.\n\nYou can't really change up there, but you can view alternatives and confuse  yourself into thinking that viewing them, is the same as having changed yourself.\n\nIt's the green zone.  \n\nPeople get slimed, it goes to their head, and they declare themselves \"Master\".\n\nMostly because to get to the green they learned some technique from some very dishonest people, such as the Buddhist system, which is cashing in on that green zone effect through all sorts of made up claims about what it represents.\n\nAbout how you are now immortal and godlike, because you escaped some curse from the universe, such as \"re-incarnation\".\n\nComplete nonsense, but when you consider it in bliss with visions of God, it seems like it might be true.\n\nAnd self-flattery settles that argument for you.\n\nBut it's just beginner's stuff you constantly experience in dreams, half awake, or with shamanic drumming, or when soothing yourself by just about any method.\n\nThe red zone which comes next is where \"meaning\" comes into play.\n\n\"Meaning\" alters reality down there!\n\nUp in the green zone, reality isn't actually altered unless you go off into a vision.\n\nBut in the red zone you can manufacture a clown car on your floor, complete with tiny clowns inside. And it's REAL.\n\nYou can make anything!\n\nOr turn into any creature.\n\nEach \"transformation\" needs a shift of the assemblage point, and so there are tricks and feelings and realizations both to get it to shift horizontally down there, and also to \"fine tune\" the new reality you are making.\n\nIt's \"very meaningful\" down in the red zone.

It&amp;#39;s only recently been becoming obvious to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up at the blue line everything pretty much sucks endlessly, but we convince ourselves it&amp;#39;s going to be better someday.

Otherwise you are very unlikely to notice anything.  The assemblage point moves very slowly in the beginning.\n\nAnd what you don't notice, won't come into focus.\n\nIt's like the meditation guy who sees the room with his eyes closed.  But then, he's been told to ignore that.  Just to make sure, he heads to his \"shrine\", talks to his friends there, and they say, \"Yea, that's really cool when you can see the room through your eye lids.  Doesn't happen  often.  But as you know, it's not important.\"\n\nWrong, wrong, wrong!!!!\n\nMeanwhile, the meditation police arrive at the shrine and they inform him he'll have to wait another month before he can complete his \"teacher course\", because he hasn't learned not to brag about inconsequential meditation experiences, such as seeing the room with your eyes closed.  He still has a bad attitude.  He's not a \"team player\".\n\nJust don't let the same thing happen to you!  There's all the cool stuff I could both remember, and fit in that picture.\n\nBack then I was doing 6 hours a day at times, and even ended up switching rooms physically, with no apparent explanation.\n\nDuring recapitulation inorganic beings will visit you.  It's pretty obvious why.  You are invoking scenes of memories, with the idea of continuing until you can actually view them, as if in a real dream.   The goal is to be standing there watching the memory, the way one might stand in a dream and watch the activity.\n\nOnce  you focus your attention from object to object like that, it \"compels\" the inorganic beings to send a scout.\n\nAnd good thing! You probably won't get past the red line in the J curve diagram, without some \"dark energy\".\n\nIn fact, at first you'll find that you \"blank out\".  That is, if you do 3-6  hours at a shot.   You'll be smoothly turning the head left and right, and breathing deeply, and suddenly you'll notice you stopped in the middle.  And you were gone.  For how long, you can't be sure.  But you can sort of figure out which way the head was going, so you continue.\n\nThen you find, you can't even complete that sweep. It takes 4 tries, each time interrupted in mere inches of head movement, by blanking out.\n\nBlanking out means, the assemblage point moved too fast and you didn't have time to refocus your awareness.  If your awareness is not focused on anything, you go blank.\n\nYou'd go blank less often if you made friends with the magical treasure chest, just above your head.\n\nThat's an inorganic being, \"interacting\" (playing).  In the darkroom, where you seek purple puffs of light, they play on the puffs.\n\nOutdoors when you sweep your palm parallel to the ground to locate one, they play with your palm.  They make it hot, as you were told it would be.\n\nI suppose if you locked yourself in a cave and pretended to be conducting an orchestra, they'd play through the sounds.\n\nThey don't care how they interact with you. If you have nothing else going on, they'll simply threaten to bite you in half.\n\nSo what they do in a recapitulation situation is, they play with the memories.\n\nYou'll get \"false memories\".\n\nSome false memories are simply a horizontal shift of the assemblage point.  They are a natural consequence of remembering, and continuously focusing the awareness on your memories.\n\nKeeping it focused prevents the internal dialogue from doing it's usually worrying, so the assemblage point is able to shift.  It's not unlike Zuleica's daytime power hunt, which keeps your attention focused on the search for power.\n\nIn the darkroom of course, we fight the internal dialogue like a boxer. We're looking to knock it out, so we don't have to keep fighting.\n\nBut in recap it's the memories that suppress it.  If you find yourself forgetting to recapitulate, and you start fantasizing again, then simply psycho analyze the internal dialogue,  and recapitulate that too.  You want to keep your focus continuously on memories, and avoid fantasizing or going inward to listen to the internal dialogue.\n\nIf an inorganic being interacts with you, just keep it going as long as you can.  I had one pretend to be a box I had from childhood, filled with jewels and precious coins.  Not that I actually had one of those.  But I was so certain of the memory, that I could even \"see\" the box.  I didn't notice, I was \"seeing\" it a bit too much!  In that state, you are relatively stupid.  Similar to how you are in dreaming, even if you manage to get lucid.\n\nYou're still an idiot, who fails to notice that your \"Friend\", following you along in the dream, has turned into a cat.  You just accept that.\n\nWhile trying to remember where I had put that magical chest, I recalled that there was a shelf just above my recapitulation crate.  Of course, there wasn't. But I was absolutely certain there was.  I even knew how many feet of clearance were between the top of the crate, and the shelf.  And that you could stand on the tan couch (I didn't have one), to reach the magical chest.\n\nAnd finally, I could actually see the shelf.  Visually!\n\nThat's what you want to do.  Say hello to the \"magic chest\", and if you can make out the visual details of the \"magic shelf\" also, you'll get more dark energy.  If you get it to come by the next day, request it to be something else.  Eventually it will.\n\nTranslocation can take place during recap many ways.\n\nMy favorite is a \"tunnel of light\", which is perhaps better described as second attention fog.\n\nAs with all translocation, the assemblage point has to have moved all the way to the bottom, to where you can see \"whitish light\" on surfaces.  Don't be surprised if you blank out, and your finger has to wake you up.  You'll feel your hand raise, as if in a Dicken's Tale, and your finger will point into the tunnel of light all by itself.\n\nActually, that's your dreaming double helping out.  It does the same thing in the darkroom when you reach behind a wall to grab something that isn't really there.\n\nYou can of course end up doing dreaming awake, by actually seeing the scenes as vividly as any dream.\n\nAnd you can do shared dreaming. I never had anyone around back when I was doing enough to have this happen. Cholita hated me back then too, and happily she also lived 100 miles away.\n\nIn our current arrangement, with her often just 20 feet away, I'm certain Cholita would show up to watch dreams with me.\n\nSame thing La Gorda and Carlos did.\n\nIf you \"relive\" the scene, that's an even deeper movement on the J curve. It's just shy of \"stopping the world\".\n\nSo please, pay attention during recap.\n\nYou have 2 things to pay attention to.  The memories, and doing a good job of uncovering every detail.\n\nBut you also have to pay attention to the weird stuff that happens. Don't just write it off as your own imagination.\n\nAnd if you find my magical chest filled with jewels, please return it to me.\n\nSome darned IOB has been running around with it for at least 55 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "The Effect of Recapitulation on the Assemblage Point", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"lcxsr0tcxka61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lcxsr0tcxka61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8115dd6d175d0a0f94fd8e316149d0c2ee835c8"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lcxsr0tcxka61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53a6110a2b09100605af4bf7ecd0da9cf60a9161"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lcxsr0tcxka61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe8942e00867200af568d71fd21bf84ac4abbc34"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lcxsr0tcxka61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2535060d5425903e43b61d228987a3bc1a7fcb"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lcxsr0tcxka61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba35166642b935ed3352b9c348dc5bba0914b773"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lcxsr0tcxka61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c858dc24970d20b061b09903876af261316b9061"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lcxsr0tcxka61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a43ebb28fe052386981ecc314523c931f17ed22"}, "id": "lcxsr0tcxka61"}}, "name": "t3_kun54n", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 36, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qvEc4e83Awk3i1zjmEO7VygxeeLwVfomH28kgShWPPk.jpg", "edited": 1610319255.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1610313196.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lcxsr0tcxka61.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5a43ebb28fe052386981ecc314523c931f17ed22\"&gt;If you look at the J curve pointers, you&amp;#39;ll see that recap is a \\&amp;quot;complete path\\&amp;quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can remember, everything which goes on in the darkroom goes on in recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly the assemblage point moves to all the same locations, and the same things happen at each.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, to experience that you need to do it at least 2 hours at a time.

It could be a more economical use of time, to get charged up with recap, and then go to the darkroom.  Skip the middle man, so to speak.\n\nYes, re-runs are worlds only accessible from silence!   And Carlos was up to his ears in recapitulation caused re-runs, in one of the books. Eagle's Gift?\n\nReally, this WHOLE thing is very simple.  All of sorcery!\n\nI can't yet put my finger on it, but consider that recap seems like an entirely different thing, than other things from the books. People complained it was a never ending series of new techniques.  And each time Carlos brought out a new book, they'd accuse him of adding more new techniques.\n\nBut they're all the same!  Recap brings out the dreaming double, because it moves the assemblage point. So you get Carlos watching the scenes as an observer, you get La Gorda there with him, and you get them reliving things from the past.\n\nThose all happen to me in the darkroom, with Cholita's help.\n\nWho, by the way, has lost her blue hoop, and she very much wants it back!  She was frantic in the middle of the night, but I couldn't get her to tell me what it looks like so I could help her find it.\n\n&gt;Or until deciding to lay down and then go smoothly into lucid dreaming.\n\nUnproven theory:  There are 2 ways to become lucid in an ordinary dream.

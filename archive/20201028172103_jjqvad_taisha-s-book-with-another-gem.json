Fancy had been trying to explain it to me, but I was too dense to get it.\n\nI \"discovered\" it on my own, which caused her to flock over and rub it in.\n\nShe was pretty much making the \"I told you so\", face.\n\nIt was so blatant and lasted so long, even including a few frames animating at twice the normal speed, that I had to look back at her again and ask, \"What??????\"\n\nI didn't get it yet.\n\nDon't crush the cobwebs!\n\nTickle them, sure.\n\nBut don't sweep your hand around, like a kid with  a stick who's found a big spider web.  You **know** what happens to a big beautiful spider web, if you stand a child next to it with a stick.\n\nThe back of your right hand is most sensitive, if you are right handed.  Maybe towards the outer edge too.\n\nIt's the little hairs on there.  They're designed to feel your skin getting too close to a cave wall, before the flesh is damaged.\n\nAnd so, we have an excellent center of sensitivity all along the side of the hand opposite the palm, which presumably might be clutching some food you found in the cave.  Just because you're clutching a tasty giant bug in your hand, doesn't mean you don't still need skin protection from the cave walls.  So the back of the hand it is!\n\nWave that part of the hand around gently, as if feeling for a cobweb while not wanting to break it. Curvy like, all around a given point in space.  I showed this movement in my post on how to stick a demon to the back of your hand.\n\nLet's pretend the cobwebs are too dusty to stick, so it's easy to feel one with the back of your  hand.\n\nBut you can't push right through. You have to loop the hand while turning the wrist, so the back of the hand is always facing the cobweb.\n\nSitting cross legged, do the finger wiggling thing Zuleica recommended, trying to stimulate the assemblage point.  Don't be afraid to try different hand motions or directions.  I even like to scoop down on it, like petting a cat on it's back, stroking down with alternating hands.  But always return to the harp movement, it seems to work best for feeling things.\n\nI like to try other movements, because I'm never absolutely certain I'm on the right spot.    More grandiose movements have a better chance of touching the right spot, in case you were off a bit.\n\nWhen you do indeed feel something \"as thick as water\", go cobweb hunting slightly to the right of that point, and a little closer to the body.\n\nIt's the \"apron\" area of the luminous shell. Where all the tiny fibers are hooked.  On the right, because that hands needs to wave and twist freely, to follow the cobweb all around it's sides.\n\nIf you feel one, play with it until you can feel where it's attached.  Some other part of your body will get a little tingle, like an ant is crawling there.\n\nIf you don't break the cobweb you can do that as long as you like.  The tingle on the skin will be reluctant to show up with each movement of the back of the hand, but there will be enough of them to puzzle the mind.  I'd guess, if you're having a good day you'll get one every 3 seconds.\n\nWhen you realize it's reliable you'll be thinking, how is that possible???\n\nYou just summoned the second attention, to help out!\n\nIf you perceive something that can't be, the second attention tries to make it manageable.\n\nYou found a \"flaw\" in our reality, which is essentially just created for our convenience.\n\nA bubble to create the Tonal.\n\nIf the Tonal is not complete enough to explain something, the second attention contributes more.\n\nA very tiny bit more, unfortunately.  But more is better!\n\nYou'll get to see the luminous shell.\n\nNot all of it, like a big glowing ball.  That would be a huge addition!\n\nJust enough to perceive the fine little fibers that are hooked like an apron.\n\nCholita's can stretch out to more than 4 feet long! I even used to follow her using those, at Whole Foods.\n\nBefore she decided to find me a wife there, so she could be free of me.  I got tired of watching her walk up to 50 year old ethnic woman with huge breasts, explaining I wasn't much to look at but I had money and liked Asian and Black women.\n\nAs for what you'll see at first (not at Whole Foods), imagine yarn and cotton strings tied to a belt, all died yellow, white, brown, or dark grey, waving around in the air at your waist in a weird sort of absolute silence.  Like a zero gravity environment with a mild breeze.\n\nYour silence has become external at that point, the way Taisha says in that same book.\n\nIt's creepy for sure.\n\nEdited twice\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Taisha's Book with Another Gem", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_jjqvad", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1603908527.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1603902063.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lidotska found this.

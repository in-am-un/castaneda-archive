You can drive down away from there, parallel to the freeway, and find some no one cares about.  If you want to see a Devil's Weed, google Malki Museum, Banning, California, and then use street view.  I don't believe you can pass the front gate, which would allow seeing the row of Devil's Weed that's been there a very very long time.

We don't know for sure, but the witches said in the early 90s, they were worried that don Juan had gotten trapped in the second attention, instead of making it to freedom.\n\nIf so, that would be because his next generation was broken.\n\nDon't worry about don Juan.

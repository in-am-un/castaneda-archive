I am a dreamer, so I am a Grau. Sometimes I use that name, either as Grau-Donner, or Donner-Grau, depending on my mood.\" Later in the interview, on the same topic, she states: \"Dreaming and stalking form a nearly indivisible unit of action. A sorcerer has to practice both of these aspects, and yet, one is better at one or the other. Besides Castaneda, my closest cohort is Taisha Abelar. The sorcerers paired me with her from the very beginning. She is a stalker. To me, she looks like a dreamer--she is tall and thin and ethereally beautiful. She is sweet and patient and good-natured. And yet, she is the most agressive being I know. She gets things done with minimal effort and fuss.\"\n\nTo the question, \"How many people are in your group?\", she says: \"Not enough. There were sixteen sorcerers in the nagual Juan Matus's group. Together, they had the mass and energy to perform astounding feats. Our group, comprised of Castaneda, Taisha Abelar, myself, and a few other elusive, mysterious people I am not at liberty to name, has too few.\"\n\nThe next question was, \"What happened to the people Carlos Castaneda wrote about in his books?\" Florinda answers: \"We are often with the little sisters--Lydia, Josefina, and Rosa--and the Genaros--Nestor, Pablito, and Benigno--either in Mexico or Los Angeles. However, their pursuits are different from ours. They are struggling to formulate and attain concrete goals extremely similar to the goals of the sorcerers of antiquity. For instance, Nestor, a practical botanist, wants to find a plant or clump of plants in the tundra which, according to the sorcerers' calculations, are over 300,000 years old. He wants to find them and sell them to the Japanese pharmacologists for their regenerative properties. He thinks that those plants will enhance the sexual potency of men.\"\n\n\"The women are equally involved in pursuits of this nature. Another example: Lydia wants to find a sorcerers' cure for AIDS, slowly emptying a sick person's body from the virus invasion by transmitting it to a tree. La Gorda had an attack of such intense self-importance in 1985 that she believed she was the only one of us who could lead us to freedom. She died in a futile attempt to reach beyond her energetic capabilities. Soledad is extremely well situated as a movie producer. She uses her arts in sorcery to gather money for her projects. Her motto is: Dollars from any source for movies.\"\n\n\"When La Gorda died, Carol Tiggs (the nagual woman) returned, which means to us that the sorcery configurations of don Juan's world are no longer applicable to us. We are on our own. Our group is composed of Carlos Castaneda, Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs and myself. Since we cannot see eye to eye with the concrete interests of the other apprentices, we have found ourselves in the odd situation of being explorers in a new territory, trying to find viable directions.\"\n\n\"Carlos Castaneda's readers will soon hear from him. Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs, and I found that it was imperative that Carlos send his manuscript on the art of dreaming to his agent for publication. Carlos finished writing it years ago, but believed that it was too outlandish for consideration. Taisha, Carol, and I disagreed vehemently and succeeded.\"\n\nIn response to the question of why the nagual is the leader, Florinda claims: \"Carol Tiggs, as the nagual woman, could very easily be the leader of our group. However, it is a sorcerer's belief that women are universes in themselves. As universes they have no interest whatsoever in leading other universes! Sorcerers also believe that maleness is an extension of femaleness. Therefore, it is antithetical to the spirit of womanhood to lead. The nagual is not quite a leader; he is the person who lends the sorceresses sound mindedness, sobriety, and purpose. He can do this because of the heavy conditioning he suffered under the hands of the previous nagual.\"\n\nSource: [http://sustainedaction.org/Chronologies/chronFlorindaV.htm](http://sustainedaction.org/Chronologies/chronFlorindaV.htm)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Weird Hobbies", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"hee4qxufuvq71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=163a072215e30c41b4384edb25f6c914c33ad584"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64df9d094724d3aa41dc108093fd5faeb5613830"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5a9362f34bc769005f5eda665ad030c76a04b4"}, {"y": 359, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06cf5c253098716cf3a4d6e62329b64fa31c74db"}, {"y": 539, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a91e95fa93ff5f50cbabbb160f2aeaee99d4a43b"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3535d2f03125087693fd9be6d7b3a1d5cbdf1336"}], "s": {"y": 652, "x": 1160, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=1160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03d2a7a58595466d50f554642fb3156255ae2917"}, "id": "hee4qxufuvq71"}}, "name": "t3_pze3xm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/MeNuYBh-4jwOokbXBl0FNCYnxCyAoAxoy2gX1stgnWs.jpg", "edited": 1633113280.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1633113086.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=1160&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=03d2a7a58595466d50f554642fb3156255ae2917\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hee4qxufuvq71.png?width=1160&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=03d2a7a58595466d50f554642fb3156255ae2917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to make sure Cholita is safe where she&amp;#39;s gone to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, she&amp;#39;s in LA where she likes it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a magazine article Techno put in our collection.

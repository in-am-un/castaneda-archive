All dead. Because there&amp;#39;s nothing to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad men who came in here, tried to steal attention and got kicked out, have formed at least 6 other reddit groups.  They all die and are empty, fairly fast.  Because they have nothing to discuss other than each others pretending.  A boring topic for sure.  In the end all of those turn into one man hanging out waiting for someone to stumble into his dead group so he can manipulate them for attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for sorcery groups.    No magic, no reason to keep meeting like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll make yourself a victim thinking like that.  You have to do this yourself.  You can&amp;#39;t lean on another person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are of course, such groups for Buddhism, Daoism, and such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, no one can fault you for thinking the normal process to learn is to find people who can teach, and even better if it&amp;#39;s in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joining a &amp;quot;Dzogchen&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;magick&amp;quot; group seems like common sense, and a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s because their magic is pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are &amp;quot;pretending&amp;quot; groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might as well take up &amp;quot;dungeons and dragons&amp;quot; role playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real sorcery is TRAMATIC.  A &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; group would be rippled to shreds in short time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, only 1 in 100 will even actually put in effort to learn to try, and of those very few go on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between the words of don Juan, and our experiences in here, formation of an actual sorcery group is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a misunderstanding to thing such things have existed in the past.  They never did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such a thing is a produce of money.  And business.  Not real sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tm8fhx/i_wonder_if_theres_an_english_speaking_castanedas/i1xmi0w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1648131761.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_tm8fhx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i22fahk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Pwn0_o", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1648217538.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_tm8fhx", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3aomfh7e", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Inorganic beings seem to be the best teachers, they teach in an obscure way atleast from our state of \"normal awareness\" and it's not something that can provoke language to explain the process as it unfolds.\n\nTime can equate to wisdom, would you rather learn from a human with an over inflated ego and dubious intentions?

All movements can be performed with your fingers or using Teflon balls. All points of influence are more likely not points, but areas. It is necessary to search and grope them yourself. During these passes, the left leg may be bent for comfort.\n\nPoint 1. The point of impact under the knee joint (point 1 in the figure). Just vibrate - either with your fingers or with a ball.\n\nPoint 2. We draw our fingers (or a ball) back and forth along the groove between the two tendons of the left ankle (area 2 in the figure).\n\nPoint 3. We embrace the ankle with both hands on the inside of the left leg (region 3 in the figure). In this case, the thumbs are placed on the back of the Achilles tendon, and the remaining fingers lie on top of the ankle. Gently squeeze the foot with both hands. The correct effect on the ankle tendons should result in the left toe moving slightly.\n\nPoint 4. We exert continuous pressure on the area of \u200b\u200bthe left leg where the muscle joins the bone (point 4 in the figure).\n\nPoint 5. We put the left foot on the edge of the foot. We gently tap the point on the back of the heel (1 time) with the little finger of the right hand, the point in the middle of the sole with the ring finger, the point in the front of the sole (the part that is closer to the fingers) with the index finger (see point 5 in the figure). The rhythm of tapping is: 1-2-3, pause. The first two points are simply tapped, and at the third point we hold the finger for a moment longer. We do this several times.\n\nPoint 6. Point of influence under the knee joint (point 6 in the figure). Vibrate - either with your fingers or with a ball.\n\nPoint 7. Impact point - Zu-san-li point (E36) (point 7 in the figure). This point is easily defined as follows: place the palm of the left hand on the right knee. The place where the ring finger points, and there is a point of influence. Vibrate - either with your fingers or with a ball.\n\nPoint 8. We exert continuous pressure on the point in the middle of the thigh, on the side, on the tendon (point 8 in the figure).\n\nAfter performing these movements, it is necessary to perform several circles with the left foot, as if spinning the pedal. This is necessary for the distribution of tendon energy throughout the left body.\n\nAfter that, you can do a similar massage of point 3 for the right leg. Only now we grip the ankle with both hands on the inside of the right leg. At the same time, the hands are parallel, the thumbs are placed on the back of the Achilles tendon, and the remaining fingers lie on top of the ankle. Gently squeeze the leg with both hands several times, while gradually raising the grip up the shin to the knee. Having reached the knee, we transfer the hands to the starting position on the ankle and repeat the movement. We do this several times to calm the right body.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescription of areas specific to the foot [http://groups.msn.com/NavigatorsofInfinity/shoebox.msnw](http://groups.msn.com/NavigatorsofInfinity/shoebox.msnw) :\n\nMapping the Body - Hannover 2001\n\nWe did this pass before \"The Night Butterfly.\"\n\nSit down in\u00a0the most comfortable position you can find.\u00a0( Left foot first then right )\n\n1.\u00a0Massage / Rub the area of mystery on the sole of foot.\u00a0Right hand on left foot.

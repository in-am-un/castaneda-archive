Turns out he didn't like the fantasy part, but was willing to speculate:\n\n**Departure:** If we were to pick a port of departure in the 1600s, Guangzhou (also historically known as Canton) would be more probable than Hong Kong. In the 1600s.\n\n**The Vessel and Route**: The mention of a Dutch ship is not entirely out of place. The Dutch were active in maritime trade in the 17th century, including routes that connected Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Chinese junks (large ships) were also known to travel far and wide, though primarily within the Asian region. If our hypothetical sorcerer sailed on a Dutch ship, it's plausible he could have traveled from China to the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), and from there, across the Pacific, possibly to the Spanish colonies in the Americas.\n\n**Mexico as a Destination**: Mexico, particularly Acapulco, was a significant part of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade that lasted from the 16th to the 19th century. This trade connected the Spanish colonies in Asia (primarily the Philippines) and the Americas. Goods, people, and ideas traveled along this route. If a Chinese individual ended up in Mexico during the 1600s, the galleon trade route would be the most probable explanation. While most Chinese migrants in this period were recorded in the Philippines, it's not entirely impossible for some to have traveled further to the Americas.\n\n**Chinese Historical Figures in Mexico**: By the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a more pronounced Chinese presence in parts of Mexico due to migration during that period. The statues you've seen might be connected to this later wave of Chinese migration. Alternatively, they could be a modern homage to the diverse influences and peoples that have shaped Mexico over the centuries.\n\n**Daoism and Mesoamerican Beliefs**: If we're to play with the notion of a Daoist Kungfu sorcerer, it would be fascinating to imagine the potential cultural and spiritual exchanges between Daoist beliefs and Mesoamerican indigenous religions. Both traditions have rich cosmologies, understandings of balance, and reverence for nature. A blending or mutual appreciation of these spiritual traditions would make for an exciting narrative.\n\nWhile the specifics of your scenario might be more rooted in fiction than fact, the broader strokes touch on real historical connections and migrations that shaped the early modern world.

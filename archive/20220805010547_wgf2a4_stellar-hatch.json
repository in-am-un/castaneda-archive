If you listen to the explanation of the pass, you'll find that Carlos is describing exactly what you will see.\n\nAnd what it does.\n\nAnd back then, we didn't realize, you literally WILL see that.\n\nAnd it's intense, not imaginary.\n\nSo what Carlos has done is hand us a phantom room created by the old seers, for us to reconstruct, in precise detail.\n\nAnd that'll connect us back to them.\n\nWe'll be \"sharing\" their phantom realm.\n\nThis goes over the head of beginners, but sorcerers can manufacture phantom realities which become so real, you can go live in them.\n\nThe phantom people in there, eventually develop their own thoughts.\n\nDown in Tula in Mexico, there's a village like that, created by the oldest member of our group.  8000 years old.\n\nYou create such places one object at a time, as I've been attempting with my energy tunnel, and then \"Dream Bubble Station\" around it.\n\nI'm doing that for several reasons, one being to lure back some 100,000 year old sorcerers.\n\nBut it's a pretty simple process, I've posted other examples.\n\nI just didn't realize Carlos had handed us a bunch of such phantom rooms, hidden in the tensegrity.\n\nI suppose it'll take an animation to show what this stellar hatch \"looks like\" when done properly.\n\nAnd also, the realization that while \"expecting\" and \"trying\" creates a dirty link to intent, so that you won't be able to summon intent to match the descriptions Kylie gives in this video, there's a \"secret\" behind it all.\n\nFor how to \"expect\", without a dirty link to intent.\n\nYou just do it over and over and over again, over months, until you are sick and tired of it.\n\nSo you no longer care.\n\n\"Not caring\", cancels out \"expecting\" and \"trying\".\n\nSo you get a clean link to intent, through repetition.\n\nWow.  Wait until we get this one to work as a group.\n\nWe'll end up back 5000 years ago, surrounded by scary sorcerers wearing loin cloths.\n\nAnd people are afraid of inorganic beings!\n\nI just hope hanskey is right, when he says he thought he heard one of the witches say most of the original \"old seers\" were women.\n\nThen the loin cloth doesn't seem so bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the way, if we keep going we can chat stuff like, \"See you at the old woman's hut tonight?\"\n\nAnd we'll really be able to head to the 5000 year old old woman's hut in eastern Mexico.\n\nI'm not sure if we have to brave the loins on the way...

You just rotate the view or zoom as needed, and run it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But meanwhile, I&amp;#39;m trying to memorize this form perfectly so I can try to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; it exactly as Carlos describes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really have enough time to keep watching it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I know the movements, but I&amp;#39;m not clear on where the ball first goes, then goes next, or what the hatch does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t tell at all what this pass looks like, from watching it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You MUST hear Kylie&amp;#39;s explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, the cartoons will be MUCH BETTER, because you can see the ball of light hooking to the back of the neck, and being tossed off, the hatch on the chest being put back, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos would have loved having the power to animate these!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could watch it twice, in animation form that includes the ball,  and &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; this pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to watch it twice without animations, won&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those learning this pass  should keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will see EXACTLY what they describe!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your ball of energy might vary in color, size, and texture from theirs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it will be FULLY VISIBLE, and very bright if you have enough dreaming energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you might say, &amp;quot;Yea, but that&amp;#39;s imaginary.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NO!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who the heck out there can visibly see anything they like??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one!  And no &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If people could do that, we&amp;#39;d all know about it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be like a childhood warning.  &amp;quot;Now honey, you know you can see anything you think of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But YOU will!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;anything you want&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s REAL things, like your energy body, which we have learned to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you gain the ability, even faintly, you can repeat as many times as you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And each time the sight of the ball traveling will get more and more vivid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because doing the form, and seeing the results like real objects, moves the assemblage point very far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can stop daydreaming, and thinking to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, this pass leads to all sorts of cool, &amp;quot;dark magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ball is a piece of your energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are sentient, and can be left places to accomplish tasks, returning when the task is completed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No kidding, I&amp;#39;ve seen that done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wgf2a4/stellar_hatch/ij8bi5v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1659819343.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wgf2a4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ij23eao", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1659709769.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iizurim", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I need to work out a deal with cleargreen so that people who subscribe to their videos, can view them inside the cartoon environment.

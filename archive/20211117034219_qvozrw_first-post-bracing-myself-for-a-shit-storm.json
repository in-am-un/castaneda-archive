I typed this out earlier today, considering if I should send it or not out of rookie-anxiety, but coincidentally someone posted something about a \"4th gate dream\" without having read enough to realize that what they seek is not going to be found here. So i thought i ought to, because what i have to say is directly related to that. This is also coming from a newbie, albeit one who's actually interested in THIS, specifically.\n\nI see people post absurd questions on other subreddits all the time. Something that could be easily googled and figured out with a tiny little bit of research. But they prefer to believe that someone out there is going to give a quick answer and that'll immediately solve their personal puzzle.\n\nIt's like if i was asking someone something about quantum computing: even if i get a clear, correct answer, how can I expect to grasp the knowledge when i don't even remotely understand how quantum computing works? It's just dumb. Lots of reading to do and even then that's just a fraction of the work.\n\nI may get shit on for what I've written here, and I am prepared for that, but i come here in humility and ask for the benefit of the doubt if my intent seems off.\n\nAnyway, I'll try not to grab an excessive amount of your attention in the meantime. But the length of this post clearly betrays that.\n\nI've been lurking around here for about a year before I thought I\u2019d finally post. I first got into the books in 2018 and have since read everything up to Power of Silence. Since I discovered this subreddit I've read probably 85% percent of the wiki and regularly read new posts and comments. And as far as I can tell, i've only just scratched the surface.\n\nI\u2019m not going to put much weight on this - but in 2015, as a young adult, I experienced mushrooms for the first time and was pretty shook, in a sort of exhilaratingly positive way, at the other world that had opened up before my eyes from that and the following experiences.\n\nWhile I was fascinated by it, it was also extremely disorienting and depressing to face such an immense and abstract contradiction to the world as I had known it up to then. When I was shown these books and the knowledge they related, I saw exact parallels with my otherwise unexplainable experience. They were clearly helping me navigate the wild perceptions that psychedelics had shown me.\u00a0\n\nFor a while I thought - if the onslaught of the information I witnessed through power plants doesn\u2019t eventually kill my physical body, I would've likely withered and rotted from the inside out, reducing my existence to a clouded and maddened frenzy to fill my emptiness.\n\nBecause I was still a tiny, piece of shit human being, being faced with this unfathomably abstract vastness. It was aggressively humbling.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI haven\u2019t begun practicing in the darkroom (hence why I was reluctant to post and risk speaking out of my ass, which I may still), but I\u2019ve become fairly familiar with this world, based on what I got from my intent to develop a sober perception of this knowledge through the books and this sub.\n\nI've talked about ME a lot already, but I figured I'd give a bit of background information to seem a little more credible, as well as give some context. That might backfire, I don't know. I'll get to the point.\n\nIt seems like this community is sort of - dim? - lately. There aren\u2019t a lot of openly vocal practitioners, and you're frequently met with resistance anywhere else you try to mention this stuff. Some of you are said to have gone to private classes, which is huge, but the vast majority of people here, and any newcomers who have any real interest or potential, are basically all starting out blind.\n\nIn a way, we're all starting off neck deep in the river of filth.\n\nA few posts back, I saw Dan a little let down in the comments. He mentioned that we\u2019re failing or something. But honestly I don\u2019t think so.\n\nTo revive and preserve this lineage from where we stand now is, to say the least, a formidable task. When you compare and consider the forces acting against the lineage, and those for the lineage.\n\nSocial media, Netflix, overly accessible fast-food, dating apps, despondent trolls trying to tear it down, every other possible thing to browse on the internet, porn, to name a few. Sugar and cum are more abundant and potent than ever. It\u2019s as if the river of filth is overflowing. Likely cause it is.\n\nTO DISCLAIM this is not at all a rant to validate the warrior-types approach or anything like that. But we certainly don\u2019t have an easier time practicing when we\u2019re weighted down by all sorts of addictive distractions. But it truly doesn't really matter how you conduct your life and I don't think that any single one of these things will impede progress in sorcery.\n\nBut the combination of them, and the greater sensation-chasing lifestyle that virtually everyone is accustomed to by default eventually turns your blood into molasses.\n\nThat's just where the majority of us start i guess.\n\nEspecially if you have no other way into this realm. The vast majority of people are so deeply entrenched in the river of filth, they\u2019re now scuba diving in piss oceans and making underwater hotels out of shit and dead coral reefs.\n\nBut from what my unauthorized perspective can gather, guys seem to be doing basically everything right.\n\nThe only thing is, I think new people who are genuinely curious need another way into this world that isn\u2019t something like banging their head against a wall until they\u2019re silent and seeing puffs. I'm talking like new new people.\n\nAt some point in the books, dreaming is said to be one of the crowning stones of sorcery. For some average Joe to discover a completely alien world such as this, and right off the bat try to go for the Big Prize, is a little ambitious in my opinion. Not that it can't be done, but smaller steps could be taken first to unravel our attachments to the inner dialogue, which might in turn yield better results all around.\u00a0\n\nLike if you want to get good at sudoku but have never played, you\u2019d start with a simple puzzle, not some master level shit. You\u2019ll just wrack your brain and tire yourself out for no good reason. Proper technique, strategies, and even tricks can be acquired first, making the process a lot less wasteful, energy-wise. We don\u2019t really have any certified sudoku masters to directly show us these techniques though, which is a bummer.\n\nClearly, some even come here just wanting to do crosswords or play Battleships, not even taking a minute to realize it\u2019s the sudoku spot.\n\nIt should be clarified somewhere what is actually achieved from this practice/discipline/art, cause obviously people are misconstruing this completely, and very often. But that isn't yet presented anywhere in a detailed and organized organized way.\n\nThere is a massive process of unlearning that needs to be done (cleaning the link?) before people can even interpret most of what is being presented on this sub and in the books.\u00a0\n\nI want to say I got lucky in my encounters with power plants, I want to say I got a boost, but that is still TBD because I can also see how reckless it is to willfully disintegrate your original worldview for one like this, while still operating within it.\n\nRegardless, as someone who has experienced even that, it took me, is currently taking me, consistent effort just to not revert to my old ways of thinking. This is likely what most people have to go through if they want to progress here, i imagine.\n\nIt took the apprentices we read about years to develop even the most basic skills, and with real guidance at that.\u00a0\n\nAnd maybe this is just my take on it, but Carlos could also be pretty dense early on in the books.\n\nSo as long as we have our human form, we are bound to act like imbeciles - even if it\u2019s only once in a while. And few, if any of us, will get as far as really losing it.\n\nSo I started working on a project that I think could benefit this community. I\u2019m be going through all of the books once again to extract the most fundamental aspects of the written knowledge. So much of what\u2019s in there is fluff for an attractive narrative (I reckon it was probably necessary to make it marketable - the only feasible way to get the info out into the world?).\n\nCombined with the information and approaches developed on this subreddit, and finally informed by actual practice, I\u2019m basically aiming to compile and organize a comprehensive yet distilled version of the world that Carlos laid out.\n\nIt\u2019ll be a complete written document, because for the sake of communicability to those who come \u201cuninitiated\u201d (for lack of a better term), I think it necessarily has to be condensed into this form. But that being said, it would make minimal use of language to focus strictly on topics, keywords, and ideas that most essentially comprise the world of sorcery - as raw as possible to avoid confusion. It would essentially bring together the most pertinent information we can collectively provide and organize it so it functions as a bare-bones instruction manual.\n\nMost of it will be short quotes pulled from the books (and the wiki/posts) supplied with brief explanations about their place in this world. The goal would be to grant the new reader a reconceptualization of their perception, so the knowledge could then be accessed unimpeded by misconceptions (cleaning and reorganizing the Tonal).\n\nIt would be succinct, not overly intellectualized, never dogmatic. Essentially pragmatic.\n\nIdeally, I\u2019d want to be bouncing this off of the many capable heads in here to ensure that this whole thing stays in line. This document would be free and designed to be accessible to as many as possible, and for the sake of it\u2019s integrity - not be profited from by anyone. I alone can\u2019t say what that means, so I see it as a potentially collaborative project that should be co-authored by this community. I don\u2019t regard myself as an authority on any of this yet. While I\u2019m basically just a decent wordsmith, I know this could only be properly achieved with the cooperation of others who have already invested themselves more than myself.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, I just see this as something worth attempting to preserve and share.\n\nCause it would be a damn shame if this was lost.\n\nOr worse yet - gentrified somehow.\n\n\u00a0", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "First post - bracing myself for a shit storm", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_qvozrw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_1iav60g", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1637116939.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry in advance if this is lengthy and wordy.

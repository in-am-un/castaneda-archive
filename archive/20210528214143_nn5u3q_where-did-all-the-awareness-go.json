There was a little stream of water every foot or so, continuously falling down the wall without splashing.\n\nThe internal dialogue was stuck at the top above where the water comes from, and my tendency to fantasize with images in the mind was down at the bottom, below where the water landed.\n\nThat's why it was easy to hold the silence.\n\nA waterfall...\n\nObsessive silence forcing shifts the assemblage point sideways. It's inevitable.\n\nWe do have to do that, but don't assume you aren't \"bent out of shape\" in the process.\n\nI had shapeshifted.\n\nThat was a shapeshifted view of what silence is.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Where did all the Awareness go?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_nn5u3q", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1622234205.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1622230903.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a little understood topic in the Castaneda world, possibly because some wasn&amp;#39;t covered in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone tell me what publication has the &amp;quot;planet of the liver&amp;quot;, and so on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me when I say Cholita will remember the planet of the liver topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes like this (and has a mystery we don&amp;#39;t understand):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were created as bubbles over a range of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were free to roam the dark sea of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We not only had no body, but never  had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(So much for re-incarnation...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were so new, we hadn&amp;#39;t yet experienced many &amp;quot;bundles&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;clusters&amp;quot; of emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While exploring freely, we collided with this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the intent of it.

I wrote copiously. I could say without exaggeration that I threw dozens of manuscripts into the garbage can because they didn't fulfill an indispensable requirement that don Juan had described to me as the mark of something that is acceptable by infinity.\r  \n\r  \nHe had said that everything I did had to be an act of sorcery; an act free from encroaching expectations, fears of failure, hopes of success; free from the 'cult of me'. Everything I did had to be impromptu; a work of magic where I freely opened myself to the impulses of the infinite.\r  \n\r  \nOne night, I was sitting at my desk preparing myself for my daily activity of writing. I felt a moment of grogginess. I thought that I was feeling dizzy because I had gotten up too quickly from my mat where I had been doing my exercises.\r  \n\r  \nMy vision blurred. I saw yellow spots in front of my eyes. I thought I was going to faint. The fainting spell got worse. There was an enormous red spot in front of me. I began to breathe deeply, trying to quiet whatever agitation was causing this visual distortion.\r  \n\r  \nI became extraordinarily silent, to the point where I noticed that I was surrounded by impenetrable darkness. The thought crossed my mind that I had fainted. However, I could feel the chair, my desk. I could feel everything around me from inside the darkness that surrounded me.\r  \n\r  \nDon Juan had said that the sorcerers of his lineage considered that one of the most coveted results of inner silence was a specific interplay of energy, which is always heralded by a strong emotion. He felt that my recollections were the means to agitate me to the extreme, where I would experience this interplay. Such an interplay manifested itself in terms of hues that were projected on any horizon in the world of everyday life, be it a mountain, the sky, a wall, or simply the palms of the hands. He had explained that this interplay of hues begins with the appearance of a tenuous brushstroke of lavender on the horizon. In time, this lavender brushstroke starts to expand until it covers the visible horizon, like advancing storm clouds.\r  \n\r  \nHe assured me that a dot of a peculiar, rich, pomegranate red shows up, as if bursting from the lavender clouds. He stated that as sorcerers become more disciplined and experienced, the dot of pomegranate expands and finally explodes into thoughts or visions, or in the case of a literate man, into written words; sorcerers either see visions engendered by energy, hear thoughts being voiced as words, or read written words.\r  \n\r  \nThat night at my desk, I didn't see any lavender brushstrokes, nor did I see any advancing clouds. I was sure that I didn't have the discipline that sorcerers require for such an interplay of energy, but I had an enormous dot of pomegranate red in front of me. This enormous dot, without any preliminaries, exploded into disassociated words that I read as if they were on a sheet of paper coming out of a typewriter. The words moved at such tremendous speed in front of me that it was impossible to read anything. Then I heard a voice describing something to me. Again, the speed of the voice was wrong for my ears. The words were garbled, making it impossible to hear anything that would make sense.\r  \n\r  \nAs if that weren't enough, I began to see liverish scenes like one sees in dreams after a heavy meal. They were baroque, dark, ominous. I began to twirl, and I did so until I got sick to my stomach. The whole event ended there. I felt the effect of whatever had happened to me in every muscle of my body. I was exhausted. This violent intervention had made me angry and frustrated.\r  \n\r  \nI rushed to don Juan's house to tell him about this happening. I sensed that I needed his help more than ever.\r  \n\r  \n\"There's nothing gentle about sorcerers or sorcery,\" don Juan commented after he heard my story. \"This was the first time that infinity descended on you in such a fashion.

One is over the liver and gallbladder, another is over the pancreas and spleen and the third one is over the kidneys and\nadrenals. These three pouches serve as reservoirs of energy. The pouch to the right, over the liver, they believe to be the center of quick, immediate action. The pouch to the left, over the pancreas, was considered the center of feeling, and the third, the one over the kidneys and adrenals, was thought to be the center of sustained and purposeful action. After beckoning intent, the next logical step, according to the seers of antiquity, was to fill the two frontal pouches of the human body as a conglomerate of energy fields. Hence the name of the second magical pass, \"Pouring Intent Into Two Pouches Of The Body\". Their consideration was that intent must precede anything that we do. In order to cross out of our phylum, we must first set up the intent to do so, by pouring intent on the two pouches for feeling and immediate action.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nCarlos Castaneda's Tensegrity\r  \nVolume Two:\r  \nRedistributing Dispersed Energy\r  \n\n\nPass #8:\r  \nPulling And Wrapping The Internal Fibers Of Energy\n\n\r  \nOur 8th pass is called \"Pulling and wrapping the internal fibers of energy\". Seers support the idea that the totality of the universe is composed of energy fields that could be described almost in the visual \r  \nsense as resembling luminous threads of infinite length. Seers saw that such energy fields can never be broken. That they could only be \rstretched and bent. With this rather complex magical pass, seers aim at pulling and stretching thread-like energy fields that exist inside the luminous sphere in order to buttress areas which they consider to be essential for withstanding the redirection of dispersed energy such as the areas around the shoulder blades and shoulders where ganglia are heavily concentrated. Another area of equal value is the area of the knees and ankles, on which all the physical support of the body rests. \r  \n\nFirst both arms are raised as if they were holding two thin vertical fibers. The left arm is placed on the right shoulder, and the right arm is immediately placed behind on the right adrenal. Notice that both hands must be kept as if they are pulling two invisible vertical cords. The first is a tug onward. And the other one is a backward tug that counterbalances the first one. A deep breath is taken with the first and an exhalation is made on the second. The the left hand wraps the invisible cord around the back of the neck, and comes down to rest around the area of the pancreas and the spleen. Then the right hand wraps the invisible cord around the back of the neck, and \r  \ncomes to stop at the left clavicle. The back of the left fist touches the left adrenal and the same movement of tugging forward with an inhalation and pulling backwards with an exhalation is done. The \r  \nright fist holding the invisible cord moves around the back of the neck and comes to rest over the liver and gallbladder. The left fist and it's invisible cord wrap around the back of the neck from the left to the right and come to rest over the pancreas and spleen. The arms are brought down and the forearms are raised again holding another set of invisible vertical cords and the same movements are performed again \r  \nstarting with the right arm pulling the invisible cord that goes over the left shoulder to the adrenals. When the full movements have been repeated and the fists are held over the pancreas and liver, they are pulled forward to the initial beginning position. The right leg is raised with a bent knee and the invisible cord is tied over the knee \ronce from the outside to the inside of the leg, one more time from the \r  \ninside to the outside of the foot, and it ends with a final turn from \rthe inside to outside of the raised knee. The right hand is held in \rthe initial position of this movement while the left ties the invisible cord on the left knee in a mirror image of what was done \r  \nwith the right leg. When the clenched hands are in the initial position, they are brought together over the solar plexus, forcefully interlocking the knuckles and creating a pressure in the hands over the solar plexus. A deep breath is taken. The pass ends by exhaling \rand bringing the open hands to the sides with the palms up.\r  \n\r\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n***Pomona Not-Doing Workshop - February 7th &amp; 8th, 1998:***\n\nAt one point Carol said, \"You people must be sore.\"\n\nShe said it was okay to smile at your muscles.

One can say that a human being is nothing else but a conglomerate of thousands of twirling vortexes, some of them so very small that they are, let's say, like pinholes, but very important pinholes. Most of the vortexes are vortexes of energy. Energy flows freely through them, or is stuck in them. There are, however, six which are so enormous that they deserve special treatment. They are centers of life and vitality. Energy there is never stuck, but sometimes the supply of energy is so scarce that the center barely rotates.\"\n\nDon Juan explained that those enormous centers of vitality were located on six areas of the body. He enumerated them in terms of the importance that shamans accorded them. The first was on the area of the liver and gallbladder; the second on the area of the pancreas and spleen; the third on the area of the kidneys and adrenals; and the fourth on the hollow spot at the base of the neck on the frontal part of the body.

How to break that perceptive arc that ties us to that ordinary vision of reality?

He also said that the liquid appearance of this special energy is the mark of a filter-like quality that screens any energy coming to it, and draws from it only the part that is liquid-like. This quality of liquidness is a uniform and consistent feature of this center. A fifth center which was pertinent only to women, was the area of the womb. He said that in some women, there seems to exist a similar liquid energy in the womb, a natural filter that screens out superfluous energy, but that this feature was not present in every womb.

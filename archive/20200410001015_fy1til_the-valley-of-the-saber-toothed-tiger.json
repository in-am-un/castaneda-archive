You can find the account of that in his books.  It taught him to breathe, which might seem odd, until you learn to get into heightened awareness.\n\nI was told, the tiger lived not too far from here:\n\n[https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0626759,-118.3549213,3a,75y,288.63h,87.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjAweyQ7v6Gh7Yc7lel8HLQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0626759,-118.3549213,3a,75y,288.63h,87.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjAweyQ7v6Gh7Yc7lel8HLQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192)\n\nBut since I can't remember who told me that (I was wrong thinking it was Cholita; she denied it), I can't say it's all that reliable.\n\nAnd also, Carlos may have used recap to do it, instead of my lazy method, silence.\n\nBut it doesn't matter. The principle is the same.\n\nAnd it would be a piece of cake to find one of your own, at this spot.\n\n*Intent* remains, even after thousands of years.\n\nIt's like a smell.\n\nIf you had a stuffy nose all your life, and someone finally gave you some medicine for it, you'd be amazed at the scents you could pick up.\n\nIn fact, go outside right now, with this COVID19 thing going on, and with nearly all of the cars off the road, and factories shut down.\n\nYou'll be asking yourself, \"Are those Orange Blossoms I smell???\"\n\nThat's what *intent* is like.  It's just a whiff in the air.\n\nBut when you're silent, you're on the edge of manifesting anything you can think about.\n\nAll it takes is a single word.\n\nI once learned to manifest objects sitting in a chair. I'd think, \"Spatula\", and there one would be. Rotating in space in front of me, my eyes closed. The detail was amazing!\n\nI made the mistake of thinking, \"I wonder if you could see women's panties?\"\n\nYep.\n\nDon't do that.  You'll be sitting there for hours.  I got so good at it I could say, \"What about women from Portugal?\"\n\nIt makes me wonder.  Since Carlos warned against looking at porn, what would he say about looking at second attention porn?\n\nI'm sure he'd laugh. It's inevitable that male sorcerers end up exploiting the system.\n\nThe principle for summing women's crotches in panties is the same as for tracking down any other sort of intent trail.\n\nOr thread.\n\nAs one of the witches reported, Carlos was so good at finding a specific thread, he could answer questions on topics about which he knew nothing, by just closing his eyes or staring off into space, to find the right thread  and follow it.\n\nHe did that for us in class a few times, leaving the possibility for someone to go back and discover more about how he specifically did it.  Via re-run techniques.\n\nI got curious just now, and knowing the direction I saw him look when doing it, a direction that wasn't related to the people in class or the walls, I checked it out on the map.\n\nTurns out, he was looking dead south.\n\nI don't know if that matters, but Dance Home is skewed on the map, and doesn't align to east west.  And Carlos made a point of staring that direction, and around 15 degrees up from just looking straight ahead.\n\nIt might actually matter.  You find that out as you get better at gazing.\n\nI guess this ability to follow threads using the Akashic records is why Yogis have reputations for knowing stuff about their students, even without having met them before.\n\nOr how don Juan discovered the button nosed kid.\n\nTo find the tiger, you just go find a place to sit around there, maybe around 4AM so everyone is asleep, and just sit in silence and wait to find it.  Carlos' 2 known LA living spaces weren't all the far from there, so he could have done it at home.\n\nOr if you have a key to SAG, you could go sit in there.\n\nBut keep an eye on your wallet.\n\nI wouldn't expect the tiger to walk up to you, like a scene from Lion King.\n\nAlthough that's possible.\n\nMore likely is that you'll be silent, force even deeper silence (remove images from the mind), intend to see the tiger, and then remove Mr. DoubleTake, the guy who blocks impossible sights.\n\nYou'll realize a while later that you were staring ahead, without realizing it. And you were looking at something.\n\nYou'll be a bit confused, having passed through a dreaming barrier.  That's what makes this technique so insidious.\n\nYou might not even remember!\n\nBut if you do, and as you remember what you were looking at, the Tiger will become obvious.\n\nCan any of you make that work?  I mean, should you even put in the effort?\n\nIf you try, SOMETHING will happen.\n\nI can't guarantee that result.\n\nBut it's on the list.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't fake it.  You have to be silent. So silent, that even walking around in daylight produces wonderful sights. Not a lot of them. But at least a few, so you know you have achieved that level of walking around silence.\n\n*Intent* is everything to sorcerers.\n\nIt's like having a wealthy uncle who helps you out once in a while, if he thinks you deserve it, and it would be good for you.\n\n*Intent* makes the same estimates.  Do you deserve it, and would it help your progress?\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't judge what you want.\n\nThus witches can use it for revenge if that's their preference.\n\nI prefer to use it for exploration.\n\nIf you never met Carlos, and are wondering how on earth you can attach yourself to his *intent*, the answer is in here.

This is a bizarre stuff which needs to be killed all the way with recap and silence.\n\n&gt;He turned from talking to one or two, and announced, \"We're all sacks of viruses!\"\n\n&gt;I took that to have some special importance.\n\n&gt;But later I noticed, it was right around that year, a study came out on how viruses transfer DNA between unrelated species, and are likely responsible for the existence of Humans.\n\nWell, I've got an email from Cleargreen with this. With all this Covid hysteria, they are trying to speak on this topic. Some pearls are below.\n\n--------------\n\n\"Dear Tensegrity\u00ae Community:\n\nNavigating Coronavirus (COVID-19) is in your hands.\n\nThe Practical:\n\nSpecific to Corona:\u00a0As a virus, Corona is an ever-evolving life form, capable of mutating quickly from carrier to carrier. Because of this, the virus in your area may be different from the virus in other areas. Since the behavior of viruses is outside our control, what follows is a guide to what you can control \u2013 you! Viruses need a hospitable host in order to thrive. Feeding them or starving them is up to you!\n\nThe information below is intended as an addition, not substitute, for the specific, practical guidelines your \u2018local\u2019 health officials and medical advisories provide.\n\nImmunity is king!\u00a0As it starts to wane, so do your defenses against invaders. That\u2019s why Corona first hits the elderly because their immune system has been diminishing in power and efficacy since their thirties. Help keep yours strong by following commonsense things:\n\nStop the Sugar\u00a0\u2013 or at least lower it. Since the 1970\u2019s it\u2019s been proven by Oxford academicians that sugar puts the immune system in a temporary coma, limiting its ability to respond to challenges. If you are taking in sugar several times a day, imagine that you\u2019re walking around with little to no immunity at all. Additionally, viruses love sugar, they feed on it; and when you feed on it, you\u2019re feeding them. Carlos Castaneda would have no one around him who ate sugar \u2013 stating that it sent their lowest, basest habits into warp speed by stimulating their auto-pilot, rather than their conscious, decision-making brain.\n\nEat a balanced diet\u00a0\u2013 You know what we mean -- greens, proteins, fruits and whole grains, if you eat grains. Yes, you are what you eat! Yes, your entire immune system resides in your gut! Yes, you filling your gut with only the best food will help make and keep your immune system strong!\n\nDrink lots of water\u00a0\u2013 Keep your system and especially your liver, which processes everything in your body from food and air to medications, clean. Keeping your liver clean maximizes every organ you have \u2013 including your immunity, including your brain to help you make your very best decisions in these confusing times. It also flushes out the normal by-products of your body, leaving your immunity free and clear to focus on a disease.

With all this Covid hysteria, they are trying to speak on this topic. Some pearls are below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dear Tensegrity\u00ae Community:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Navigating Coronavirus (COVID-19) is in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Practical:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Specific to Corona:\u00a0As a virus, Corona is an ever-evolving life form, capable of mutating quickly from carrier to carrier. Because of this, the virus in your area may be different from the virus in other areas. Since the behavior of viruses is outside our control, what follows is a guide to what you can control \u2013 you! Viruses need a hospitable host in order to thrive. Feeding them or starving them is up to you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The information below is intended as an addition, not substitute, for the specific, practical guidelines your \u2018local\u2019 health officials and medical advisories provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immunity is king!\u00a0As it starts to wane, so do your defenses against invaders. That\u2019s why Corona first hits the elderly because their immune system has been diminishing in power and efficacy since their thirties. Help keep yours strong by following commonsense things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop the Sugar\u00a0\u2013 or at least lower it. Since the 1970\u2019s it\u2019s been proven by Oxford academicians that sugar puts the immune system in a temporary coma, limiting its ability to respond to challenges. If you are taking in sugar several times a day, imagine that you\u2019re walking around with little to no immunity at all. Additionally, viruses love sugar, they feed on it; and when you feed on it, you\u2019re feeding them. Carlos Castaneda would have no one around him who ate sugar \u2013 stating that it sent their lowest, basest habits into warp speed by stimulating their auto-pilot, rather than their conscious, decision-making brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eat a balanced diet\u00a0\u2013 You know what we mean -- greens, proteins, fruits and whole grains, if you eat grains. Yes, you are what you eat! Yes, your entire immune system resides in your gut! Yes, you filling your gut with only the best food will help make and keep your immune system strong!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drink lots of water\u00a0\u2013 Keep your system and especially your liver, which processes everything in your body from food and air to medications, clean. Keeping your liver clean maximizes every organ you have \u2013 including your immunity, including your brain to help you make your very best decisions in these confusing times. It also flushes out the normal by-products of your body, leaving your immunity free and clear to focus on a disease.

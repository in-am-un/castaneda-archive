There's a grumpy old man bullying everyone.\n\nBut in my defense, if you had a nasty evil witch holding you prisoner in your own home, you'd be a little grumpy too!\n\nNo offense to Cholita meant. She's a real gem...\n\nNo matter what she does, when she materializes in front of me in my darkroom while I'm practicing, in a very nice mood, it's hard to hold her Tonal Body's behavior against her.\n\nBut if it's too grumpy for you in here, Cleargreen now has a discussion group where you can masturbate to your heart's content.\n\nBe a total attention seeking shithead, and everyone is too afraid to stop you.\n\nBetter yet, the posts scroll off into the void after a month!\n\nAutomatically erasing all mistakes.

So at least they kind of know, sorcery really works if you give it a chance.\n\nThus it's slightly better than \"The Nagual Zone\".  Or , \"My amazing Toltec discussion chat room\".\n\nSlightly...\n\nWe're hoping to send some devious witches in there to tinker around.\n\nMeanwhile, here's \"bad player fodder\" from Facebook.\n\nOr as Soledad put it, \"Bantha fodder\".\n\nIt does work however, if you can get serious.  And it's repeatable!\n\nIt's not a \"gift\" from intent, which can't be repeated.\n\nIt's a movement of the assemblage point, to make the double visible.\n\nThose are repeatable!\n\n\\*\\*\\* from facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nDo you really have to scoop up the energy crusted on the outside of the luminous shell using Tensegrity, and move it back to the middle?\n\nHonestly, you really stink. So the stench of your worry, grief, anger, greed, has pushed that purple energy of your double, to the outside of the shell.\n\nIt wants to get as far away from \"you\" as it can.\n\nThe problem is, the total blob of awareness is all we are. Given to us by the Eagle, encased in an egg so it doesn't spread out into the dark sea, and become too thin to be sentient.\n\nSorcerers are trying to \"keep it\" past death, and have various tricks to find a new \"egg\" to confine it.\n\nBut if it could escape, it would spread infinitely thin and be useless.\n\nSo it can't. And your \"energy body\" is pressed against the shell of the egg, looking out into infinity, wishing it could escape you.\n\nHonestly, you stink. Ask anyone in the castaneda subreddit, who has to deal with new people.\n\nCarlos had that problem too, BIG TIME. But unless you were privy to all the trouble of attacking angry men at workshops, and spying on him anywhere they could, even going through his garbage at Pandora, you have no idea.\n\nNot something to dwell on much, because sorcery \"hoses you off\".\n\nSlowly, the shit all over you, from your daily living, is washed away and you become less \"stinky\" to the energy body.\n\nHe comes off the walls to play, when you do tensegrity in silence.\n\nWithout the silence? Not so much. Thus, so far NO ONE has learned any real magic. In 25 years since Carlos died, it's all pretending.\n\nNot so much anymore. There are some who now realize, you must follow the instructions Carlos gave us.\n\nAnd become \"Readers of Infinity\", who possess \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nTwo \"how to\" manuals he made at the end. Never got into book form, but I believe he bound copies of both at the photocopy store, back in the 90s.\n\nREAD THEM, so I don't have to deal with as many crazy angry men in the subreddit.\n\nMeanwhile, here's a curiosity.\n\nYou can use crusted energy!\n\nIt doesn't have to \"uncrust\"!\n\nI guess that's not quite right.\n\nMaybe, once you make friends with it by building an energy body, you can allow it to press against the outside of the shell from time to time, and use it out there!\n\nHere's one way.\n\nAt the end of the Affection for the Energy Body pass, after you hug \"yourself\" in the form of the double (that can become visible, so don't doubt it), lean back with arched back, let your arms fall to your sides, and \"lean into\" what's in front of you.\n\nBorrow the doubles sight!\n\nBe prepared to pass out if you get this right. You will change over to his view of the world.\n\nSometimes, it's a moonlit shopping mall for me. My double loves that place.\n\nBut most of the time, it's just brilliant blue sparkles of light, so overpowering you have to quickly sit down.\n\nAnd you can \"keep\" it for at least 5 minutes if you practice.

I mentioned it in posts.\n\nIt looked like a Japanese Rokurokubi disembodied female head spirit, with it's spinal attachments and perhaps some entrails following it like a cape.  Those are also present in other asian cultures and thought to be a woman who died under horrible circumstances, searching for justice.  Her head and neck are still beautiful enough to lure men, until they realize what the rest of her looks like.  She consumes them. And is often associated with ponds of water and frogs.\n\nI saw an eye like that with the eyeball looking perfectly real, but some veins and muscle material following it as it floated towards me.\n\nI said, \"No way.  That's too creepy even for me!  Go away.\"\n\nI thought to myself, why do I need that thing anyway?  La Gorda isn't exactly the most reliable apprentice in the books as far as passing on information we ought to be looking out for.\n\nAnd I got lucky, because Carlos had told us to stop reading his books.\n\nSo I forgot that the giant eye is part of the elusive \"losing the human form\".\n\nOtherwise I might have engaged in self-flattery and used my \"book deal mind\" to decide to keep that awful thing around.  Add it to my \"sorcery boy scout badge\" collection.\n\nOver time however it returned once in a while, for a few seconds.\n\nAs if to ask, \"Is this ok now?\"\n\nEach time slightly different.  Showing more cool stuff in the middle, such as a kitten's eye with orange and white facial fur visible.\n\nOr a portal to beautiful outdoor scenes in the middle of a more simple and less gruesome \"eye\".\n\nStill I refused it.\n\nEventually it just got brighter and brighter until it was so dazzling it could not be ignored.\n\nI have a theory regarding how the puffs will follow your gaze, and perhaps the shiny layer Carlos wants us to rise up from our toes, also will.\n\nBut it's not good for this subreddit.  I'll mention it over in the advanced one.\n\nWe do in fact see a negative impact in here, if there's advanced things in posts.  Beginners try to skip to those, as if it were all just a game you can play to get fame and fortune through pretending.  So why not skip all the hard work, and try to claim to have achieved it all?\n\nIgnore the posts except to find something to pretend, and then post your way to fame?\n\nIt's sick.  Shame on fakers!  I hope you get a little Guru throne of your own one day and slowly rot on it, while your followers wake up to the truth of how you deceived them.\n\nLast time I saw Chopra, he was looking quite a big rotted away.\n\nNew people who lie: Everyone knows it.  And they debate what to do about you, outside your ability to read what's being said.  No one wants to take on the nasty bully and have to live through the tantrums.\n\nThat's the only reason you aren't called out after the first sentence you post in this subreddit!\n\nIt's that obvious.\n\nWe have another bad guy floating right now, making up stuff that's painful to even have to read.\n\nWith discussions in chat on how to handle him.\n\nWe're always trying to figure out what to do with the endless men who come here to shoplift.\n\nNo one in human history has faced up to the forces of magic pretending.  Everyone else was pretending their own make believe magic. So they couldn't examine others doing the same. It would expose their own bad behavior.\n\nBut we get the \"unique chance\" to actually understand why there's no longer real magic in the world.\n\nMoney.  That was the start of the problem.\n\nThat knowledge is just as valuable as actual sorcery experience.  Because as someone said in another post, \"Debunk yourself.\"\n\nBy seeing how horrible others behave, you can see the same in yourself but at a less obvious level.\n\nSo don't make up stuff.  You don't have to!  If you put in hard work what happens will be far beyond anything you could imagine.\n\nLike this \"eye\".\n\nSupposedly you can reach inside the middle, and pull it open like a door.  There's a tensegrity pass for that. I tried it, but my eye wasn't solid enough to grab.\n\nSupposedly if you manage to open it you can walk right through the solid walls of your darkroom,   using the \"opened eye\" as a sliding glass door.\n\nPerhaps to escape the allies.\n\nDon't doubt it!\n\nI've done that.\n\nBut in my case, not to ESCAPE the allies!!!\n\nWho wants to ditch our magical friends?  That's like kicking Tinkerbell out of bed because she hogs a tiny piece of the corner of the blanket.\n\nOnly someone who hasn't had any sustained inorganic being visits yet, I suspect.  The ones who aren't going to ever see any IOBs for real, are the ones who \"reject\" them. Out of nobility?\n\nWell, for my own sake I renounce being a billionaire.  Who wants to be like Trump or Musk?\n\nSo I'll ignore billions of dollars if they should flow my direction.  \n\n\nOut of \"principle\"!\n\nBut the truth is, I leave the room through the walls in order to FOLLOW the allies most of the time. Or with their invitation to do so, and my trust in them.  \n\nSometimes they hold a door open for you, but remain on this side.  Pity.\n\nHere's La Gorda's version of this eye from one of the books.  Probably second ring. Our \"all in one\" pdf doesn't have indications for which book you are in. So it's easy to find stuff, but hard to know where you found it.  Not necessarily a bad thing because it discourages the worst fakers of all in here.\n\nInventory warriors. Using tedious quotations from the books, to prove some bizarre dubious detail they think will gain them fame.  \n\n\"Making a point\" which is so far from actual sorcery practice, it's confusing to even try to follow their meandering reasoning.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"What else did you feel, Gorda, when you lost your form, besides not having enough energy?\"\n\n\"The Nagual told me that a warrior without form begins to see an eye. I saw an eye in front of me every time I closed my eyes. It got so bad that I couldn't rest anymore. The eye followed me wherever I went. I nearly went mad. Finally, I suppose, I became used to it. Now I don't even notice it because it has become part of me.\n\n\"The formless warrior uses that eye to start dreaming. If you don't have a form, you don't have to go to sleep to do dreaming. The eye in front of you pulls you every time you want to go.\"\n\n{Dan comment: See how  useless La Gorda's observations are, to darkroomers who do nothing but waking dreaming?}\n\n\"Where exactly is that eye, Gorda?\"\n\nShe closed her eyes and moved her hand from side to side, right in front of her eyes, covering the span of her face.\n\n\"Sometimes the eye is very small and other times it is enormous,\" she went on. \"When it's small your dreaming is precise. If it's big your dreaming is like flying over the mountains and not really seeing much. I haven't done enough dreaming yet, but the Nagual told me that that eye is my trump card. One day when I become truly formless I won't see the eye anymore; the eye will become just like me, nothing, and yet it'll be there like the allies.\n\n\"The Nagual said that everything has to be sifted through our human form. When we have no form, then nothing has form and yet everything is present. I couldn't understand what he meant by that, but now I see that he was absolutely right.\n\n\"The allies are only a presence and so will be the eye. But at this time that eye is everything to me. In fact, in having that eye I should need nothing else in order to call up my dreaming, even when I'm awake. I haven't been able to do that yet. Perhaps I'm like you, a bit stubborn and lazy.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Eye of La Gorda", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6s4zxw2dg6ia1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6s4zxw2dg6ia1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cc3e25c964de47cc5c2fe96472bc944d135cbe3"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6s4zxw2dg6ia1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20dbce40583bd3ac10ff650c0e704c25985e82bc"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6s4zxw2dg6ia1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f954fb7401a590f3c29747f6a57d28ac16725c60"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6s4zxw2dg6ia1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=678bd79daa603b8b24a31c80ec98b11c9bda5982"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6s4zxw2dg6ia1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4228882fa318512e117cf69f0eb79103342d5bd6"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6s4zxw2dg6ia1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6276b833b1971e3b56ada104548bbdb61cddfc4"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6s4zxw2dg6ia1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9dc2ed9873e3efa6b56ba62eb3fd172bf96ab8e"}, "id": "6s4zxw2dg6ia1"}}, "name": "t3_1128y6d", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/J5Xed36Z7bAJBSHsvYn411FEV9DtqRyUQ1rQ5uo-GCY.jpg", "edited": 1676393754.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1676390601.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6s4zxw2dg6ia1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a9dc2ed9873e3efa6b56ba62eb3fd172bf96ab8e\"&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty much what darkroom is like for me lately.

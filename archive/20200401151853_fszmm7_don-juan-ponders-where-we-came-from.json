It could have been the 3 bottles of wine earlier, but I got absolutely no colors in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean zippo!!!   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking, is this how it is for a beginner?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How depressing, especially since as far as they know, they&amp;#39;ve been tricked and no colors are ever going to show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That might be a good reason to start people out on recap and dreaming.  Otherwise, starting by looking for colors could be downright depressing until you get some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing nothing but darkness, I pretty much had no choice but to go for the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But first, I tried Zuleica\u2019s movement. Scoop with your hands and fingers, into that second attention spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that doesn\u2019t bring colors quickly, then stand up and do some kind of swirling hands or feet movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, tensegrity makes colors visible faster than just looking around the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leaning back or stretching is perhaps a tiny bit faster than that, but last night, for me, it wasn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the advantage of the tensegrity is that once you can see any colors at all, using it, you can just keep that up to move the assemblage point further.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_fszmm7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fszmm7/don_juan_ponders_where_we_came_from/fm5drvm/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1585771037.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1585771037.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fm58e6e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1585768220.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fm4n692", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;\"Get that damn   \n&gt;  \n&gt;THING  \n&gt;  \n&gt; out of here!\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;:)))))))))))) you could have your own stand up show with a high rate of success!) do you usually perform any tensegrity movements in the heightened awareness state or when dreaming awake or before starting gazing darkness technique?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fm58e6e", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get that damn   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THING  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;out of here!&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;:)))))))))))) you could have your own stand up show with a high rate of success!) do you usually perform any tensegrity movements in the heightened awareness state or when dreaming awake or before starting gazing darkness technique?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_fszmm7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fszmm7/don_juan_ponders_where_we_came_from/fm58e6e/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1585768220.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fm4n692", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1585757218.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_fszmm7", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's good to hear the physical body goes along too.

They were a little too obsessed with making alternate real worlds to play in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do what they do,  as practice, but we don&amp;#39;t get trapped doing it too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that purpose, of learning what they did, Little Smoke gave us darkroom gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity was created by Carlos to use in the darkroom (and anywhere else)  in conjunction with removing the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing that, we accomplish what the new seers did.  We learn to move our assemblage points fast enough to reach the 3rd attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But none of sorcery is of any use, unless you learn to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can only learn it, by doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest you read the rest of the books, because they&amp;#39;re filled with amazing advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, most of that advice will float through this subreddit, along with practical examples, so you could get away with reading in here if you didn&amp;#39;t want to read the rest of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a good sign you fixated on the first 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people who do that, have never learned in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often they try to rely on drugs, which doesn&amp;#39;t work out at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they don&amp;#39;t do that, they obsess over the Men of Knowledge &amp;quot;code of the warrior&amp;quot;, and believe that&amp;#39;s all there is to magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just pretending to be cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have a fit when they find out about this place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t get excited and come to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They try to stop us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect the old Men of Knowledge did the same to the old seers. Fought against them on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s inevitable if you don&amp;#39;t learn to see, which requires getting rid of the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t get rid of that, you&amp;#39;re pretty much insane and angry all the time, overwhelmed by your own self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, you can&amp;#39;t be like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nin276/guidance/gz2v67s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1621707436.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_nin276", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gz2x01x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "dunemi", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gz2wela", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_6upmf", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I think you should keep reading forward from where you left off, and go til the end of the series.

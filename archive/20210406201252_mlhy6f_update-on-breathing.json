But each breath ends with the pleasant sensation at the end of a  yawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it changes over, there&amp;#39;s magic floating in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep it up a half  hour, you&amp;#39;re literally surrounded by fairies, orbs, glimmering crystals, and tiny dream worlds offering themselves to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always tell people, don&amp;#39;t practice breathing techniques!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are a con to get your money.  It&amp;#39;s fake, &amp;quot;progress&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they harm you by teaching you to interfere with breathing, which may make it harder to notice the change over when you move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or worse, when it changes over, you&amp;#39;ll give credit to the phony &amp;quot;breath work&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breath work seems to be a common &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; out there, among people who might be interested in Castaneda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first got here, there was some crazy guy wearing a mask and no shirt, who had made a video of himself surrounded by floating pixel dots, added by a computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He claimed they were &amp;quot;inorganic beings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he was selling phony breathing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect he taught people to hyperventilate until they saw those dots, because that is in fact the sort of thing you can see, if you hyperventilate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what the was doing was so awful, I didn&amp;#39;t even want to learn what he was selling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were several con artists in this subreddit, when I first got here.  Feeling on naive people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an extreme case of phony breathing, where you cause tiny dots to spin around you like a cartoon,  but all breathing techniques have an element of that in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Placebos, to get your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this has anything to do with breathing while doing physical movements, like Tai Chi, Tensegrity, or recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or mild recommendations for meditation breathing.  &amp;quot;In general&amp;quot; sort of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In those cases, proper breathing is mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Zen &amp;quot;snort&amp;quot; where you flare the nostrils, is in the bad (phony) category.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some crystals between the fingers would be infinitely more useful than flaring the nostrils, and give you much less of a fat head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, something not obvious in this story, but entirely consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, Carlos ALWAYS used women to introduce an important new topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, topics that lead to magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He used the two women to introduce the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this woman he used to explain the breathing, came after introduction of the J curve, by only a few classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was part of his parting plans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess: He borrowed the energy of the women and added it to his, to summon &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was very obvious in neither case, did he expect us to understand what he was showing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t even bother to try to get us to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He showed it, and dropped it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One good way to summon &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t tinker, that dilutes the effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be what goes wrong in the dark room too, when you try to do something specific, that you did before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re assuming YOU did it before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You intended something, that&amp;#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; did it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mlhy6f", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mlhy6f/update_on_breathing/gtmfbht/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1617747860.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gtlxmnx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "burlyhombre", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1617739720.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gtlnkmg", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4s15mn48", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Breath normally.

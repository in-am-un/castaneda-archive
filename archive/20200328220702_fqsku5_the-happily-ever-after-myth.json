Could be!*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nImagine you\u2019re standing in the dark, trying to summon an image of your living room.\n\nIt\u2019s on the other side of the wall behind you.\n\nThere are 2 paintings in there, on opposite ends of the room.\n\nGifts from a witch. Power objects.\n\nIf you can see those clearly in the darkness, it means your second attention is active, and your assemblage point has moved very far.\n\nAnd you can now intend your dreaming double to travel there.\n\nThat might sound difficult, but if you\u2019re awake with eyes open, in absolute darkness, walking around so that you aren\u2019t sleepy, manipulation of dreaming awareness only needs silence.\n\nThe 2 paintings hanging in the darkness, summoned by your *intent*, will remain in place as you then *intend* your dreaming body over there.\n\nThe room will seem to spin, you\u2019ll move forward a few feet, and find yourself standing in the other room.\n\nOn the opposite side of the wall.\n\nI\u2019m afraid to say, there\u2019s no Hollywood \u201cswoosh\u201d sound to accompany it. \n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a little disorienting for a few seconds. Takes a while to even remember you were trying to do that.\n\nBut it\u2019s still really, really cool.\n\nYea, you can do that!\n\nI\u2019m going to say something to you which Carlos said to me.\n\nJust weeks before he died.  And when he knew his time was up.\n\nIt actually sustained me for a few years. I\u2019ll pass it on.\n\n\u201cYou **will** experience this. I promise!\u201d\n\nBut it only applies to people who work very hard. \n\nTraveling in the double is the inevitable result of Zuleica\u2019s techniques.\n\nMerging of the second attention with the first, to make it more easily available.\n\nI suspect that\u2019s also the way to learn teleportation.\n\nCholita\u2019s dreaming double could even fix one of the paintings using her finger, if it was tilted a tiny bit on its hanger.\n\nUnfortunately, on this night in question, as you continue to try to master this technique for passing through the wall, an annoying syntactical command keeps going through your mind.\n\nIt\u2019s preventing the perfect silence needed to summon the image of the paintings.\n\n\u201cLife is too short!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the slogan from hell.\n\nIt\u2019s designed to order you to obey the social order.\n\nIt\u2019s used after an unreasonable demand is made, usually by family, to remind you that this familial duty is a cherished part of the social order.\n\nIf you disobey, you\u2019ll never have the chance to make up for it! You\u2019ll suffer.\n\nActually, it\u2019s the guy giving you the slogan who\u2019s suffering. But he doesn\u2019t want to suffer alone, so he tries to force you to join him.\n\nYou must obey the, \u201cHappily Ever After\u201d myth.\n\nThe happily ever after myth is built on a mountain of syntactic commands.\n\nThose are embedded in your mind one at a time, during your childhood. Eventually they mostly form the world around you.\n\nA world built on suffering.\n\nWe have the image for that. A gift to help us understand.\n\nThe savior, suffering on a cross for his fellow man, rewarded by rising to the highest levels of heaven.\n\nAfter his short life was over.\n\nCatholics love to hang him over their bed to remind themselves, this horrible existence is only temporary.\n\nYou just have to tolerate the suffering, and wait for the prize.\n\nI\u2019m all for the prize.\n\nFine by me.\n\nAnd we should be good to other people. Otherwise our energy gets tangled up in them.\n\nBut in the meantime, is it ok to walk through the wall?\n\nAnd even do magic?\n\nThe savior did.\n\nAnd in fact, that\u2019s the justification for that entire religion.\n\nSee! He did magic.\n\nSo listen to him!\n\nThen, yes of course it\u2019s ok to walk through the wall.\n\nBut to do that, you have to understand those syntactic commands, and the lie we were fed as children.\n\nFirst, no one lives happily ever after, unless they\u2019re demented.\n\nOr unless their biographer is trying to make them seem cool.\n\nLet me tell you a secret.\n\nGandhi was a bastard.\n\nAlmost killed his wife, because he insisted she had to be vegetarian, as he was.\n\nAll she needed was an egg or two, but he wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\nHis friends had to talk him down.\n\nLater, he murdered her by denying that a foreign substance (penicillin) could be injected into her infected body. She badly needed the medicine, but he denied it to her.\n\nMost of our heroes are like that.\n\nAnd so is the myth.\n\nFind your true love and live happily ever after?\n\nSex will be good for 2 months if the husband is a bastard or the wife nags,  6 months if both of them are somewhat normal, and 2 years at most, if you work at it.\n\nYou\u2019re supposed to trap the husband by producing children. That\u2019s the best way to keep it together.\n\nAnd yet, we still have a 50% divorce rate. There\u2019s also no way the other 50% are happy.\n\nJust observe them. If they have a party, stand outside the door 15 minutes early, and listen.\n\nEverything else promised by the Happily Ever After myth is similarly false.\n\nIf someone points out an example of a successful life, it\u2019s typically based on fame.\n\nHe\u2019s famous! Winner!!!!\n\nHe has the approval of the social order.\n\nReally?\n\nObsession with other people, and what they think about you, is the #1 enemy of learning sorcery.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201cbook deal mind\u201d. You\u2019re pimping for someone else\u2019s pleasure. An imaginary person in your mind, that you need to prove yourself to.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll reward you by being pleased with what you\u2019ve done.\n\nBorn into the oppressive social order, you can\u2019t escape by finding another one.\n\nNot even a mini-social order, where you get the respect you deserve.\n\nI believe more people would escape the social order, if they were only warned early on.\n\nBut it takes an entire lifetime to realize you\u2019ve been had.\n\nYou can see it in the eyes of people as they grow.\n\nIn high school, they\u2019re still optimistic. Eventually they\u2019ll find their place.\n\nThe girl, the car, the house. All the goodies life has to offer, will make it tolerable.\n\nEach fades away as you realize, that wasn\u2019t worth it.\n\nAnd then what are you going to do?\n\nTell the grandchildren the truth?\n\nNope. You\u2019ll help them to believe the myth, along with everyone else, on the theory that there\u2019s no alternative.\n\nBut there is!\n\nWe were born to explore. As infants, we *saw* everything.\n\nWe just didn\u2019t know what it was.\n\nOur mom, needing us not to stare into space like a damaged child, and wanting us to show off for her, forced our attention onto herself.\n\nShe gradually punished and coerced us, until we mostly only saw what she saw.\n\nWhen magic crept back into our minds at night, perhaps with a monster under the bed, she soothed us, and assured us it was not there.\n\nMagic was removed from us, and replaced with a cheesy myth.\n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative?\n\nShe could have pointed out that the Monster under the bed was Uncle Juan\u2019s, and he\u2019d left it for you, for a playmate.\n\nCarlos left me and Cholita two!\n\nAnd you can choose any shape you\u2019d like for your new friend.\n\nUncle Juan, the shaman, could also come and teach you fun activities.\n\nInstead of drinking beer and shouting angrily at the football teams on tv, to work out some of the endless suffering the happily ever after myth produces, he could teach his favorite nephew to travel to \u201cglory\u201d, and see the sights available to human beings.\n\nHe could teach you to teleport to Japan, so you can also enjoy the ordinary sights.\n\nIn other words, we could teach our children to continue what they were born to do.\n\nExplore.\n\nInstead, we have the ugly myth of compact family units which suffer together.\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nIt won\u2019t matter right now. Until you can \u201cmeasure\u201d your silence, by the effects it produces, it\u2019s pointless to worry about stuff.\n\nLike, can you have sex? How about porn?\n\nCan you have sugar?\n\nHow much can I self-medicate?\n\nDo I have to deny myself anything?\n\nThat\u2019s also part of the happily ever after myth.\n\nSelf-medication, and denial.\n\nTo \u201cimprove yourself\u201d.\n\nForget it. It\u2019s a placebo.\n\nBut once you have a tool, such as silence, which gives you unbiased measurements of your progress, you can discover all that on your own.\n\nJust remember, your friends and family will try to stop you. And they\u2019ll try to stop you with syntactic commands, like \u201clife is too short\u201d.\n\nOr, \u201cFamily has to stick together.\u201d\n\nOr, \u201cWe\u2019ll all be rewarded in heaven.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t do anything about them. Just remember, it\u2019s not true. It\u2019ll tug on your heart strings, but that\u2019s only because you have Stockholm syndrome.\n\nDo you have to leave them, if you\u2019re already sucked in?\n\nNo.\n\nI left my family for a couple of decades. Carlos sent me back.\n\nBut if they try to stop you from your sorcery activities, when you\u2019re just beginning to break free, then it\u2019s time to avoid them.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Happily Ever After Myth", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"4a0xp4zvihp41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 140, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4a0xp4zvihp41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43e6881ad422a807abace2da52ad5e3182a84d73"}, {"y": 280, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4a0xp4zvihp41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04349690eb2c501454d4a4986198f86afbb31917"}], "s": {"y": 400, "x": 308, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4a0xp4zvihp41.jpg?width=308&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6a810a44717b5cdedb7220fc6399dc69d94870f"}, "id": "4a0xp4zvihp41"}}, "name": "t3_fqsku5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WTORvW9aU5waCVM9oLWa8JqJmiZhrn6trx6xpvudPX8.jpg", "edited": 1585434363.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1585429622.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4a0xp4zvihp41.jpg?width=308&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d6a810a44717b5cdedb7220fc6399dc69d94870f\"&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know who painted this, but he sort of got Carlos right.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carlos&amp;#39; eyes, towards the end, looked like the ones you see on don Juan in the picture above, when he was &amp;quot;reading off the wall&amp;quot;.

Until you can \u201cmeasure\u201d your silence, by the effects it produces, it\u2019s pointless to worry about stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, can you have sex? How about porn?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you have sugar?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much can I self-medicate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I have to deny myself anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s also part of the happily ever after myth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self-medication, and denial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To \u201cimprove yourself\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget it. It\u2019s a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you have a tool, such as silence, which gives you unbiased measurements of your progress, you can discover all that on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember, your friends and family will try to stop you. And they\u2019ll try to stop you with syntactic commands, like \u201clife is too short\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, \u201cFamily has to stick together.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, \u201cWe\u2019ll all be rewarded in heaven.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t do anything about them. Just remember, it\u2019s not true. It\u2019ll tug on your heart strings, but that\u2019s only because you have Stockholm syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have to leave them, if you\u2019re already sucked in?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left my family for a couple of decades. Carlos sent me back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they try to stop you from your sorcery activities, when you\u2019re just beginning to break free, then it\u2019s time to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "8167efcc-7b48-11ea-afe1-0ea6e9cf624b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "fqsku5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 20, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fqsku5/the_happily_ever_after_myth/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/fqsku5/the_happily_ever_after_myth/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1585429622.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fls145x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1585432130.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_flrzhzs", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I suspect the whole thing about death was just to get lazy people off their butt.\n\nAnd implant alternate internal dialogue in their minds.\n\nI've never seen death over my left shoulder.\n\nAnd I see all kinds of odd things.\n\nI have to wonder about the alternative internal dialogue part.\n\nCarlos' early books produced a dramatic result in TV and movies.\n\nAll of a sudden, nearly ever TV series had to eventually have a wise indian shaman show up and do something magical.\n\nDozens of rocks songs had drugged out people riding on horses in the desert.\n\nAt least 1/4th of the entire hippy movement was based on Carlos' writings.

They\u2019re little dreaming worlds you can handle, about the size of business cards.\n\nYou can shuffle them, look inside, and ultimately select one and enter that dream world.\n\nAs you shuffle the deck, they do the most amazing thing. They don\u2019t change! Each one remains what it is.\n\nA hotel paradise.\n\nDowntown LA.\n\nAnd who knows what else.\n\nCholita never lets me see all of her cards.\n\nYesterday she had a new spell going, in the front yard. It was there to greet me, painted on the dirt by the driveway, with smooth river pebbles.\n\nIt had the same swirling pattern she\u2019d used in the back yard near the fountain.\n\nI have to suppose that Cholita\u2019s playing cards are no different than the little village the death defier made, and which don Juan\u2019s party could visit together.\n\nIt\u2019s just a really strange way to enter.\n\nOn the other hand, we don\u2019t seem to have a good account of how the members of don Juan\u2019s party entered their village.\n\nI realized, Cholita\u2019s playing cards must in fact be small bundles of emanations. Emanations which have an association because of her *intent*.\n\nThe bundles at large, which look to me like thick flames frozen in space, contain many more emanations, and the worlds you can enter there seem to be as vast as our own world.\n\nIf I can find Cholita in dreaming and she has the cards again, I might try testing the boundaries. It can\u2019t be as vast as the bundles, which could be said to be roughly the size of a big bag of compost from Home Depot.\n\nCompared to a thin business card, you can see why they\u2019d have a lot more places to visit.\n\nThe world I visited a night or two ago, gave me the impression of being \u201cfake\u201d. I didn\u2019t consciously believe that, but when faced with a water faucet I ended up testing it, expecting that maybe Cholita had forgotten the plumbing.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t.\n\nBut it is ok to talk like this?\n\nI don\u2019t know. \n\nCarlos seemed to avoid it. If you read his later works, and some of the lecture notes, things get pretty loose and illogical at times.\n\nIt becomes non-linear.\n\nI\u2019m still stuck with linear, but viewing non-linear things. And trying to describe them, specifically to lure as many of you as possible, into putting in the effort to do it yourself.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s not as risky as it sounds, to describe your own experiences to others.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a student or two be motivated by such talk, ask for precise techniques, I give those to them, and they  *see* something entirely different.\n\nBut it\u2019s just as exciting to them.\n\nAnd me too! The more the better.\n\nSo if I teach you to go rabbit hunting, but you catch a butterfly, it\u2019s all good in my opinion.\n\nLet\u2019s not obsess over, \u201cWas that right??? How do you know that\u2019s the real thing?!\u201d\n\nWe aren\u2019t trying to do anything.\n\nOr go anywhere.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to learn what causes things to happen.\n\nAll things. Real or not.\n\nAnd also, how to \u201cassemble\u201d another world. \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter which one. If your assemblage point shifts a little one way or the other, and the entire world contains only Bozo the clowns, so much the better.\n\nI loved that guy!  Back then, there were really only 2 or 3 channels at a time. \n\nHe was the kids entertainment.\n\nEven though as I later found out,  to my great disappointment, it wasn\u2019t a \u201cguy\u201d.\n\nIt was \u201cguys\u201d.  One even had  a jail record.\n\nNo one could stand that job.\n\nJust do me a favor,  and if you assemble a clown world avoid that scary one from the Stephen King movie.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to increase the *intent* behind him!\n\nIf you think about it, what exactly does \u201cassemble\u201d another world mean? And why is it associated with the word, \u201calign\u201d.\n\nSo far, every time I\u2019ve gained enough experience to understand one of the seemingly mysterious sorcerer\u2019s terms, I\u2019ve realized it wasn\u2019t mysterious or complicated at all.\n\nIt was literal!\n\n*Seeing* is just perceiving (with sight, but could be otherwise) something that \u201cshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d.\n\nThere it is!  Right there.\n\nI was staring right at the most frightening of Carlos\u2019 allies last night.\n\nI was searching for my living room, and it turns out, he had one too.\n\nI ended up there instead of where I wanted to go.\n\nBut there\u2019s no way anyone else would see that.\n\nI suppose\u2026\n\nSo we put the  word \u201csee\u201d in italics to warn readers.\n\nHey readers. This is nuts. But it\u2019s still what I *saw*.\n\nYes, probably no one would see that. But they could *see* it.\n\nThat is, if they weren\u2019t drowning in their internal dialogue, which holds their assemblage point in our societies' current safe-space, the \u201cmagic free\u201d zone.\n\nSimilarly, *dreaming* is just a dream which is being manipulated on purpose, for the purposes of learning sorcery.\n\nAnd \u201cassemble another world\u201d is just that. You literally assemble it from the emanations at large. Pick this one, not that one.  No more than this.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you can skip over some, or they have to be contiguous. \n\nCertainly from what I\u2019ve seen of Cholita\u2019s cards, those places do exist.\n\nMaybe she just sealed off a tiny piece of the emanations at large, because she liked it so much.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to trust me on all this.\n\nYou too can learn to view how a world gets assembled.\n\nLook for the fine lines, while searching for colors in darkness. They fall on flat surfaces.\n\nThose can create, \u201cthe wall\u201d, a very useful divination tool.\n\nBut when extended to all of the walls of a room, they begin to \u201cassemble\u201d other worlds for you.\n\nIt starts when you notice the lines are particularly bright, perhaps more so towards the floor. But they line up on the wall just above that, so that they seem to actually be more \u201caligned\u201d than normal.\n\nNormally it\u2019s difficult to even tell which way they go, and lines can cross over each other. But the maddening thing about them is, if you had to take a magic marker, and trace one of the lines on the floor, you wouldn\u2019t even try to touch the marker down.\n\nYou can\u2019t say \u201cwhere they are\u201d. \n\nOnly **that** they are.\n\nWhen they start to \u201cassemble\u201d another world, they line up. It becomes easier to try to figure out where they are located.\n\nAnd while gazing at the new alignment, it starts to \u201clook like something\u201d.\n\nIf you keep puzzling over what it looks like, you\u2019re daring your second attention to come help.\n\nIs it a bush?\n\nYes, it looks a little more like that now.\n\nOnce it looks a little more like \u201cthat\u201d, you\u2019ve just added intent to it. It\u2019ll look even more like that, until finally you\u2019re surrounded by a strange but oddly beautiful world.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful, because you have to be in heightened awareness to perceive it. If you weren\u2019t quite there, the act of gazing at it finishes the deal.\n\nYou feel really good, so it\u2019s \u201cbeautiful\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re kind of prejudiced in that way. If we feel horrible, everything is ugly.\n\nCholita\u2019s playing cards save time.\n\nHere\u2019s the new alignment, in compact form. Deal the card, enter the world.\n\nBut last night I was still trying to figure out how to get into the living room, in my dreaming double.\n\nWhat the situation was,  when Cholita showed me her playing cards, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nI\u2019d say that was closer to *dreaming*.\n\nMy technique for walking through the wall was definitely not.\n\nIt was dreaming awake, but in 2 places at once.\n\nThat\u2019s the \u201csecond attention\u201d.

They\u2019re little dreaming worlds you can handle, about the size of business cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can shuffle them, look inside, and ultimately select one and enter that dream world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you shuffle the deck, they do the most amazing thing. They don\u2019t change! Each one remains what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A hotel paradise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Downtown LA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And who knows what else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita never lets me see all of her cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday she had a new spell going, in the front yard. It was there to greet me, painted on the dirt by the driveway, with smooth river pebbles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had the same swirling pattern she\u2019d used in the back yard near the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to suppose that Cholita\u2019s playing cards are no different than the little village the death defier made, and which don Juan\u2019s party could visit together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s just a really strange way to enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we don\u2019t seem to have a good account of how the members of don Juan\u2019s party entered their village.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, Cholita\u2019s playing cards must in fact be small bundles of emanations. Emanations which have an association because of her &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bundles at large, which look to me like thick flames frozen in space, contain many more emanations, and the worlds you can enter there seem to be as vast as our own world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I can find Cholita in dreaming and she has the cards again, I might try testing the boundaries. It can\u2019t be as vast as the bundles, which could be said to be roughly the size of a big bag of compost from Home Depot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compared to a thin business card, you can see why they\u2019d have a lot more places to visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world I visited a night or two ago, gave me the impression of being \u201cfake\u201d. I didn\u2019t consciously believe that, but when faced with a water faucet I ended up testing it, expecting that maybe Cholita had forgotten the plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She hadn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is ok to talk like this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos seemed to avoid it. If you read his later works, and some of the lecture notes, things get pretty loose and illogical at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It becomes non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m still stuck with linear, but viewing non-linear things. And trying to describe them, specifically to lure as many of you as possible, into putting in the effort to do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think it\u2019s not as risky as it sounds, to describe your own experiences to others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve seen a student or two be motivated by such talk, ask for precise techniques, I give those to them, and they  &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; something entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s just as exciting to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And me too! The more the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if I teach you to go rabbit hunting, but you catch a butterfly, it\u2019s all good in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s not obsess over, \u201cWas that right??? How do you know that\u2019s the real thing?!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren\u2019t trying to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re trying to learn what causes things to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All things. Real or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, how to \u201cassemble\u201d another world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn\u2019t matter which one. If your assemblage point shifts a little one way or the other, and the entire world contains only Bozo the clowns, so much the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I loved that guy!  Back then, there were really only 2 or 3 channels at a time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was the kids entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though as I later found out,  to my great disappointment, it wasn\u2019t a \u201cguy\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was \u201cguys\u201d.  One even had  a jail record.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one could stand that job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just do me a favor,  and if you assemble a clown world avoid that scary one from the Stephen King movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don\u2019t want to increase the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; behind him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, what exactly does \u201cassemble\u201d another world mean? And why is it associated with the word, \u201calign\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far, every time I\u2019ve gained enough experience to understand one of the seemingly mysterious sorcerer\u2019s terms, I\u2019ve realized it wasn\u2019t mysterious or complicated at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was literal!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing&lt;/em&gt; is just perceiving (with sight, but could be otherwise) something that \u201cshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There it is!  Right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was staring right at the most frightening of Carlos\u2019 allies last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was searching for my living room, and it turns out, he had one too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up there instead of where I wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there\u2019s no way anyone else would see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we put the  word \u201csee\u201d in italics to warn readers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey readers. This is nuts. But it\u2019s still what I &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, probably no one would see that. But they could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is, if they weren\u2019t drowning in their internal dialogue, which holds their assemblage point in our societies&amp;#39; current safe-space, the \u201cmagic free\u201d zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; is just a dream which is being manipulated on purpose, for the purposes of learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And \u201cassemble another world\u201d is just that. You literally assemble it from the emanations at large. Pick this one, not that one.  No more than this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not sure if you can skip over some, or they have to be contiguous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly from what I\u2019ve seen of Cholita\u2019s cards, those places do exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe she just sealed off a tiny piece of the emanations at large, because she liked it so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don\u2019t have to trust me on all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You too can learn to view how a world gets assembled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for the fine lines, while searching for colors in darkness. They fall on flat surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those can create, \u201cthe wall\u201d, a very useful divination tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when extended to all of the walls of a room, they begin to \u201cassemble\u201d other worlds for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It starts when you notice the lines are particularly bright, perhaps more so towards the floor. But they line up on the wall just above that, so that they seem to actually be more \u201caligned\u201d than normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally it\u2019s difficult to even tell which way they go, and lines can cross over each other. But the maddening thing about them is, if you had to take a magic marker, and trace one of the lines on the floor, you wouldn\u2019t even try to touch the marker down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t say \u201cwhere they are\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they start to \u201cassemble\u201d another world, they line up. It becomes easier to try to figure out where they are located.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while gazing at the new alignment, it starts to \u201clook like something\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep puzzling over what it looks like, you\u2019re daring your second attention to come help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it a bush?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it looks a little more like that now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it looks a little more like \u201cthat\u201d, you\u2019ve just added intent to it. It\u2019ll look even more like that, until finally you\u2019re surrounded by a strange but oddly beautiful world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s beautiful, because you have to be in heightened awareness to perceive it. If you weren\u2019t quite there, the act of gazing at it finishes the deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You feel really good, so it\u2019s \u201cbeautiful\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re kind of prejudiced in that way. If we feel horrible, everything is ugly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita\u2019s playing cards save time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s the new alignment, in compact form.

It was pitch black, and by then I was extremely silent.\n\nMy breathing was automatic, low, and nearly still. That's the sure sign of heightened awareness.\n\nI was trying to *intend* to see Cholita\u2019s paintings, hanging on opposite sides of the living room.\n\nBut that\u2019s a tricky thing to do. \n\nOnce you know something you can do, and try to do it again, the *intent* has changed.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to \u201cforce\u201d something you did the night before, by accident.\n\nIt\u2019s like gently pushing a cute little insect around on the ground, to see if it\u2019s dead, versus smashing your finger down on it, to see if it reacts.\n\nYour *intent* can dissolve dream phantoms. All you need to do is stare at them, instead of taking them for granted.\n\nLikewise, if you try to do something again, you\u2019re likely to smash or dissolve it with your intentional *intent*.\n\nI suspect the only solution for that is to be completely \u201cempty\u201d, as don Juan was.\n\nUntil then, you can\u2019t always get what you want.\n\nThe first result of my *intending* to see the living room, was an oversized copy of Cholita\u2019s head.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t floating. It seemed more like she was walking through the bed, as if it weren\u2019t there.\n\nAnd she wasn\u2019t clear on how far down the floor ought to be.\n\nShe missed it by a few feet, leaving mostly her head visible over the bedspread.\n\nI saw her go by, and everything seemed the right shape, but her now floppy hair blocked any possibility of a direct identification.\n\nI turned my head to listen in the direction of Cholita\u2019s room. Maybe I could hear that she still had Alex going, and rule out that copy as being the real Cholita.\n\nBut it was silent.\n\nI glanced back, and the head was gone.\n\nI reinforced my silence.\n\nA room started to materialize (10 minutes later).\n\nIt was a bathroom.\n\nI was looking at all the bottles lined up on the top shelf of a vanity cabinet.\n\nIt was very bright in that bathroom.  Someone had a lot of light bulbs, maybe for putting on makeup.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t our bathroom.  It was someone else\u2019s.\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought of that.\n\nI really don\u2019t have any control over which room I\u2019m going to find.\n\nI tried to concentrate on my own living room.\n\nA big mistake.\n\nI next saw 2 lovers kissing.\n\nI presume they were sitting on a couch, in a cozy living room.

It was pitch black, and by then I was extremely silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My breathing was automatic, low, and nearly still. That&amp;#39;s the sure sign of heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trying to &lt;em&gt;intend&lt;/em&gt; to see Cholita\u2019s paintings, hanging on opposite sides of the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that\u2019s a tricky thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you know something you can do, and try to do it again, the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; has changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re trying to \u201cforce\u201d something you did the night before, by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s like gently pushing a cute little insect around on the ground, to see if it\u2019s dead, versus smashing your finger down on it, to see if it reacts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; can dissolve dream phantoms. All you need to do is stare at them, instead of taking them for granted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you try to do something again, you\u2019re likely to smash or dissolve it with your intentional &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect the only solution for that is to be completely \u201cempty\u201d, as don Juan was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, you can\u2019t always get what you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first result of my &lt;em&gt;intending&lt;/em&gt; to see the living room, was an oversized copy of Cholita\u2019s head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t floating. It seemed more like she was walking through the bed, as if it weren\u2019t there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she wasn\u2019t clear on how far down the floor ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She missed it by a few feet, leaving mostly her head visible over the bedspread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw her go by, and everything seemed the right shape, but her now floppy hair blocked any possibility of a direct identification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my head to listen in the direction of Cholita\u2019s room. Maybe I could hear that she still had Alex going, and rule out that copy as being the real Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced back, and the head was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reinforced my silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A room started to materialize (10 minutes later).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was looking at all the bottles lined up on the top shelf of a vanity cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was very bright in that bathroom.  Someone had a lot of light bulbs, maybe for putting on makeup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t our bathroom.  It was someone else\u2019s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn\u2019t thought of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don\u2019t have any control over which room I\u2019m going to find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to concentrate on my own living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I next saw 2 lovers kissing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I presume they were sitting on a couch, in a cozy living room. It was a lot darker in there, than in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They started to bend down onto the couch, and I realized what was coming next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her head went towards his pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oops.

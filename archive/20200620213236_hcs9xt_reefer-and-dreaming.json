I generally experienced a bounce-back effect whenever I'd stop for a bit (more dreams, and more vivid dreams), and it felt like when I went to sleep while high, the quality of sleep was always way lower and I'd be more tired and drained the next day. That said, I still had dreams I recalled, even when I was getting mega high every day, so it's definitely not a total killer of dreams.\n\nEither way, long before I ran into this subreddit, as I was first getting mega high, I got inspiration for the idea of waking dreaming during that time, but it's way harder than I thought it'd be.\n\nBasically, If I tranced myself deep enough, I could see hypnagogia, and if I was careful about how I moved, I could see it moving about. And in that state, being high aided me because the random colors and lines and stuff was pretty nice fuel for the hypnagogia fire. I was able to do things like look at my wall and see a forest and the such. I could also slowly walk around my room with a sleep mask on, and the increased blood flow combined with whatever weed was doing to my brain would actually make the hypnagogia MORE vivid.\n\nBut to actually get into the dreaming state, I don't know. My experience with dreaming has always been that if I physically moved at all, it all went away immediately, even if I was already sensing the real world around me normally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way, the suggestion I generally hear for things like sorcery and anything supernatural that you mess with is to go drug free except at most as a catalyst to get things started. It's a crutch at best, and quite possibly a hindrance at a certain point.\n\nFor me personally, weed made me feel like I was making insane progress very quickly, but the problem is that the memory killing effect as well as lack of focus made it so I lost most of the progress I made, eventually all of it. Writing down my experiences as they happened helped a bit, but upon reflection, skill building was definitely very much slowed down, and after I quit, picked up again by quite a bit.\n\nAs an example though, one of the biggest things I was working on was my ability to visualize. Being high felt like a huge boost to my ability, but I've made far more progress in the last month being completely sober than I did in the previous 2 years when I was getting mega high on cannabis sativa every day. To make matters worse, I'm not even sure how much it was boosting anything because weed also warps your perception of significance, meaning I'd do things, go 'omg!', then upon reflection days later realize it honestly wasn't anything special.\n\nWhat weed was good for, however, was teaching me to really drill down to the core of myself and really examine how my brain works at a very low level, as well as getting me to think about things in a different light, which generally led to various insights.\n\ntl;dr: Weed is good for inspiration and getting the ball going, but I don't recommend it long term. But that's also just my opinion and I've never had a waking dream, so I'm far from an authority.", "edited": 1592699703.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fvhpzk4", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it so much kills your recall (although it does fuck your memory too) as it directly fucks with your REM sleep cycle. I generally experienced a bounce-back effect whenever I&amp;#39;d stop for a bit (more dreams, and more vivid dreams), and it felt like when I went to sleep while high, the quality of sleep was always way lower and I&amp;#39;d be more tired and drained the next day. That said, I still had dreams I recalled, even when I was getting mega high every day, so it&amp;#39;s definitely not a total killer of dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, long before I ran into this subreddit, as I was first getting mega high, I got inspiration for the idea of waking dreaming during that time, but it&amp;#39;s way harder than I thought it&amp;#39;d be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, If I tranced myself deep enough, I could see hypnagogia, and if I was careful about how I moved, I could see it moving about. And in that state, being high aided me because the random colors and lines and stuff was pretty nice fuel for the hypnagogia fire. I was able to do things like look at my wall and see a forest and the such. I could also slowly walk around my room with a sleep mask on, and the increased blood flow combined with whatever weed was doing to my brain would actually make the hypnagogia MORE vivid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to actually get into the dreaming state, I don&amp;#39;t know. My experience with dreaming has always been that if I physically moved at all, it all went away immediately, even if I was already sensing the real world around me normally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, the suggestion I generally hear for things like sorcery and anything supernatural that you mess with is to go drug free except at most as a catalyst to get things started. It&amp;#39;s a crutch at best, and quite possibly a hindrance at a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me personally, weed made me feel like I was making insane progress very quickly, but the problem is that the memory killing effect as well as lack of focus made it so I lost most of the progress I made, eventually all of it. Writing down my experiences as they happened helped a bit, but upon reflection, skill building was definitely very much slowed down, and after I quit, picked up again by quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example though, one of the biggest things I was working on was my ability to visualize. Being high felt like a huge boost to my ability, but I&amp;#39;ve made far more progress in the last month being completely sober than I did in the previous 2 years when I was getting mega high on cannabis sativa every day. To make matters worse, I&amp;#39;m not even sure how much it was boosting anything because weed also warps your perception of significance, meaning I&amp;#39;d do things, go &amp;#39;omg!&amp;#39;, then upon reflection days later realize it honestly wasn&amp;#39;t anything special.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What weed was good for, however, was teaching me to really drill down to the core of myself and really examine how my brain works at a very low level, as well as getting me to think about things in a different light, which generally led to various insights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Weed is good for inspiration and getting the ball going, but I don&amp;#39;t recommend it long term.

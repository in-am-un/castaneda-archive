Likewise, if the\u00a0mind\u00a0is not tamed it harms others. All\u00a0suffering\u00a0is\u00a0caused\u00a0by the untamed mind.An\u00a0elephant\u00a0once tamed obeys its\u00a0master\u00a0better than any other\u00a0animal; even if the\u00a0master\u00a0were to say pick up a very large\u00a0hot ball with it's trunk, the\u00a0elephant\u00a0will do so. Therefore, the\u00a0mind\u00a0when tamed, can perform any\u00a0action, no\u00a0matter\u00a0how difficult.\n\nThe footprint of the\u00a0elephant\u00a0is larger than any other animal\u2019s. Likewise, if our\u00a0mind\u00a0is tamed and comes into the\u00a0realm\u00a0of the\u00a0Dharma, it serves its\u00a0master\u00a0better than any other and its capacity and scope is\u00a0unlimited. If our\u00a0mind\u00a0is very\u00a0peaceful and well tamed, there will no longer be any enemies of that\u00a0person\u00a0anywhere. If our\u00a0mind\u00a0is\u00a0peaceful, we make all others around us\u00a0peaceful. All the results of our mind-whether good or bad-increase, for\u00a0body\u00a0and\u00a0speech\u00a0of a\u00a0person\u00a0are only servants of the\u00a0mind.\n\nThe monkey\u2019s dark\u00a0color\u00a0symbolizes\u00a0scattering of\u00a0attention; its presence\u00a0symbolizes distraction and scattering of focus from both inner turbulence and outer\u00a0attraction. Thus the monkey leads the\u00a0elephant\u00a0everywhere, always to different\u00a0objects. (Just as scattering distracts the\u00a0mind\u00a0to\u00a0sense objects).\n\nThe rope held by the\u00a0monk\u00a0symbolizes recollectedness; and the hook\u00a0symbolizes watchfulness or\u00a0alertness\u00a0not only to the instruction about the practice of Calm-Abiding but also to the enlarging of the undistracted field of\u00a0Awareness: what is occurring and what one is doing.\n\nThe\u00a0fire\u00a0is the\u00a0energy\u00a0and zest for\u00a0meditation.

This arises with\u00a0time. If one can get to a level where\u00a0concentration\u00a0continues with\u00a0relative\u00a0ease, then this will combat our tendency to\u00a0laziness.\n\nWhen one forgets to keep the\u00a0attention\u00a0on the \u201cobject\u201d (i.e., the rise and fall of the\u00a0breath), then it is important to apply the antidote of\u00a0remembrance. Just as one \u201cremembers\u201d in one\u2019s head the list of items in a shopping list, so one has to keep remembering the\u00a0object.There is a part of the\u00a0mind\u00a0which is always recording, always taking everything down in\u00a0memory. Resort to that part of the\u00a0mind, and keep focused on the\u00a0object. Remember to\u00a0concentrate\u00a0upon the\u00a0object. Remain \u201cmindful\u201d or \u201cwell-recollected\u201d of the practice that one is trying to do.\n\nVery quickly, the\u00a0meditator\u00a0begins to find that, while\u00a0concentrating\u00a0upon the rise and fall of the\u00a0breath, one enters into one of two\u00a0mental states. Either the\u00a0meditator\u00a0gets very dreamy and \u201cspaced-out\u201d, in a daze, or the opposite, she or he gets lots of\u00a0thoughts\u00a0and images. If one is getting dreamy and spaced-out, even though not losing count of the\u00a0breath, we say that there is a\u00a0state\u00a0of passivity. If, on the other hand, all sorts of\u00a0thoughts\u00a0and images start\u00a0arising, we call this a\u00a0state\u00a0of\u00a0excitation. Every\u00a0meditator\u00a0swings back from one\u00a0state\u00a0to the other....\n\n...the\u00a0meditator, chases after the\u00a0elephant, the wildly untamed\u00a0mind. In the first stage our\u00a0mind\u00a0is completely under the sway and allure of the five\u00a0sense objects\u00a0and mental-emotional events. The rope and the hook carried by the\u00a0monk\u00a0are hardly any help at this point. When the\u00a0object\u00a0is not steady,\u00a0disturbances\u00a0are plentiful. The \u201celephant\u201d is not even looking toward the rope and hook and the\u00a0monkey\u00a0runs wildly, leading the\u00a0elephant. At this first stage, the flame of the\u00a0fire\u00a0of\u00a0effort\u00a0must be very strong....\n\n[several tedious \"stages\" and tons of effort later]\n\n...Through immersion in power of watchfulness,\u00a0distraction\u00a0and fogginess are almost completely gone and the\u00a0monkey is now behind the\u00a0elephant; now the\u00a0mind\u00a0is not under the\u00a0leadership\u00a0of scattering\u00a0distractions....\n\n...Gone also are the other\u00a0distractions\u00a0of the inner\u00a0emotional\u00a0and\u00a0mental events. An energetic\u00a0concentration\u00a0arises, shown as no hook and rope needed, though ever at the ready. The\u00a0monk\u00a0is not even looking at the\u00a0elephant.\nConcentration\u00a0without any\u00a0disturbance\u00a0is possible for at least one hour. The\u00a0monk\u00a0hooks the\u00a0elephant\u00a0with his goad; the\u00a0mind\u00a0is stopped from wandering by clear\u00a0understanding....\n\n...After long persevering practice, the\u00a0meditator\u00a0reaches complete pacification of the\u00a0mind. The\u00a0monk\u00a0is behind the\u00a0elephant\u00a0and allows the\u00a0mind\u00a0to \u2018rest\u2019 naturally. It\u00a0concentrates\u00a0on its\u00a0own. The\u00a0hare, which represents the subtle aspects of the mental factor of sinking (lethargy), disappears and, because no\u00a0energy\u00a0is (dispersed or) needed;\u00a0concentration\u00a0comes immediately. But still, the\u00a0monk\u00a0observes! There still remains\u00a0subtle\u00a0weakness and\u00a0distraction, but there is no\u00a0disturbance\u00a0at all.\u00a0Concentration\u00a0is possible for about four hours....\n\n...We see that the\u00a0monkey\u00a0leaves the\u00a0elephant and now squats behind the\u00a0monk\u00a0in complete obeisance. However there are still slight traces of black; this shows that even the subtlest sinking and scattering may continue to arise. Should they begin to arise they can be eliminated with slight\u00a0effort.\n\nSpontaneous\u00a0concentration\u00a0is now\u00a0present\u00a0until the\u00a0meditator\u00a0wishes to stop it. As the\u00a0concentration progresses, so does the clarity of the\u00a0object\u00a0concentrated\u00a0upon. \n\nThe\u00a0monk\u00a0doesn\u2019t even need to look at the\u00a0elephant; the\u00a0elephant\u00a0just comes and obeys.\u00a0Concentration\u00a0for one or two days without a break is possible. In the drawing the\u00a0monkey disappears (losing the human form?) and the elephant becomes completely white. The\u00a0mind\u00a0can now remain continually in\u00a0absorption\u00a0on the\u00a0object of concentration.\n\nAfter the 9th Stage of\u00a0Calm-Abiding\u00a0is\u00a0attained, many new and\u00a0extraordinary\u00a0experiences\u00a0come, which have never been\u00a0experienced\u00a0before. When these\u00a0experiences\u00a0come, this is the sign that\u00a0Calm-Abiding\u00a0has been\u00a0attained. From the\u00a0heart\u00a0of the meditating monk emanates a rainbow. The\u00a0monk\u00a0is shown flying alone; this is\u00a0bodily\u00a0bliss....\n\nHaving achieved this goal, the\u00a0meditator\u00a0gains all other\u00a0supernatural powers\u00a0such as reading\u00a0minds, disappearing, and transferring his\u00a0consciousness\u00a0into other\u00a0beings. Like someone who has \u201csharpened the axe to cut all things,\u201d he is capable of doing (virtually) any other\u00a0meditative\u00a0(or non-meditative) practice.\n\nAfter sharpening an axe, so a\u00a0person\u00a0must use it. We must ourselves become\u00a0Buddha! ...One has to free one\u2019s\u00a0mind\u00a0from the trap of\u00a0delusion (that there is anything outside of, or not conditioned by, the mind).\"\n\n[Archive.org Backup Link to Source Page](https://web.archive.org/web/20190914134059/http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Nine_Stages_of_the_Mind_Staying_-The_Elephant_Path)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Footprint of the Elephant - Nine Stages", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Buddhism"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_gcevix", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3l9c5e07", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Buddhism", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1588690656.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1588456921.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Condensation of page on &lt;a href=\"http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Nine_Stages_of_the_Mind_Staying_-The_Elephant_Path\"&gt;The Nine Stages of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The\u00a0elephant\u00a0is the example of the\u00a0mind\u00a0for: If an\u00a0elephant\u00a0is wild, it is very\u00a0dangerous\u00a0to all other\u00a0animals.

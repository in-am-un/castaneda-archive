A world filled with odd rectangles such as you might have in a drawing of an impossible scene. Where you can follow the stairs in the picture, but they go around and end up upside down, or some other impossible thing.\n\nIt was made of blue fabric like material, filling the room with a complete structure.\n\nThen, my memory is gone of what happened next.\n\nAll I remember is walking out of a passage on the south east corner.\n\nBut I did get one concrete thing from it.\n\nIf you focus on silence, instead of the special effects, you get even better special effects.\n\nAnd a lot more inorganic being \"guest appearances\" than you do, when you look for those.\n\nI had all 3of my inorganic beings competing to see who could be the most vivid or exciting in appearance.\n\nSeveral of their attempts made me gasp, or clap.\n\nThey liked that.", "edited": 1637599381.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hlnlmg7", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took my own advice and tried this again last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE MAIN POINT IS...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find some way to emphasize silence, instead of becoming &amp;quot;puff obsessed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Puff obsession is the book deal mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, go ahead and play with them! And YOU MUST build that energy body on the 3 pouches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you focus on silence at all times, even cooler stuff happens  than purple puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually saw black puffs again, and built myself a &amp;quot;black energy body&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was quite striking! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that horrible &amp;quot;La Gorda&amp;#39;s Eye&amp;quot; thing came to offer his services again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made it go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the black puff energy body, I translocated at least 20 worlds last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over a much longer time than any of you want to hear about.  It&amp;#39;d been at it so long, I figured it much be early morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at the clock.  11PM.  So I kept going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, in the middle I greatly emphasized silence, by forcing it until it turned into &amp;quot;something&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along the way I noticed we can design &amp;quot;dark room games&amp;quot; that focus on silence, instead of puffs or inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they were so abstract, there&amp;#39;s no way I can describe them now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One, if I translate it, was an electric heater from the 1950s with good grill work, floating in the air, and you had to put coins into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me.  But each coin made silence deeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until finally, I got what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little pieces of paper, like that business card. But brown and made of softer and thicker material.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they weren&amp;#39;t floating in the air like that, they were sitting on the bedspread between my crossed legs, while I sat up on pillows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By forcing silence on those, until there was absolutely no remaining internal dialogue, I could generate a weird &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I got the weird feeling, I saw endless new magic floating in the air around me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool stuff I wish I could describe now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I realized, you&amp;#39;re supposed to be silent for 2 minutes, not for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, I&amp;#39;d never reached that level of perfect silence (which likely still is not perfect) before, and certainly never held it 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I held it trying to reach 2 minutes, world after world materialized on my bedroom walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so curious about a brown one, with wood grain on the features, that i stood up and walked away from my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there was a 3D matrix of some kind.

I think sometimes we brush off weird experiences as the product of our minds, but we also feel there\u2019s more to it.\n\nThis is just opening my own experiences, as I feel looking at them under this lense is quite helpful, and value how carlos\u2019 work could help our view of the supernatural.\n\nLook for the + if you wanna skip around. \n\n-&amp;gt;+ = key/important\n______\n\nI was gonna write about this on the other post, but figured it\u2019d make more sense on it\u2019s own.\n\nTo start this of, even tho it\u2019s the last thing that\u2019s come to mind, but might be relatable: \n\naround a week after being born I had meningitis, and it seemed like I would not make it.\nInterestingly enough, a \u201cwitch\u201d told my grandma what I had before my family, and maybe even the doctors, knew. \n\nI\u2019ve always wondered where this kind of thing comes from. Is it by connecting with the other\u2019s energy, some other being that\u2019s with us, an underlying system in our bran/body that usually gets overwritten/buried? \u2014will come back to this later.\n\nI also wonder how being close to dying might have affected me. I think the infection might have helped develop other parts of my brain, and now kinda have access to more space, but that\u2019s another thing.\n\n-I\u2019ve always been quite sensitive, and sensed things in people, aswell as where there was nothing/no one.\n\nAs you all well know, our perception of the world tends to be overwritten by our family and culture, but hopefully we\u2019ll manage to help future generations stay more in tune\n\nI remember some weird ass dreams, things falling on their own.. and thankfully others saw those at times too, but mostly those freaky creepy feelings(which I kinda attribute to our fear of the unknown, the dark...\n\nAlthough now I\u2019m also open to our brain perceiving something, and \u201ccreating\u201d some representation of it.. but based on something that was perceived (cannot be apply to everything, but some situations yeah)\n\nAnyway.. the strongest experience I\u2019ve had, at least visually, was at my aunt\u2019s funeral. I was 15/16then. \nMy dad and her had fallen off for some time. The last time we had been together was probably 4 years before, bc we when to visit the to the Canary Islands. \n\nInterestingly enough I had a weird experience there. We were staying in some bungalows, and my cousins and I stayed on the same. \n\nThey had locked the door from the outside, but somehow I managed to sleepwalk out(there was a way of opening from the inside, which maybe I picked up on), and go to the swimming pool. I still remember it lol. Then some woman called me, and I went there, but don\u2019t remember anything after getting to the door. \n\nThe next day I was telling my family about the weird experience, but don\u2019t remember if I thought it was a dream, or they thought so. We get to the entrance, and the workers said: \u201chey, it\u2019s the kid from last night!\u201d Lmao \n\nI was like \u201cI told you!!\u201d Ahhahah \n\nMight not be related, but it\u2019s kind of a funny story; sorry for backtracking tho.\n\n1) We were at the church, and my father went to talk. I had been feeling alright, but a bit after he started, I started feeling kinda sick, which evolved to sick, which turned to being unable to hold myself together lol.\n\nNow it reminds me of what you say when doing the black room practice, that the head goes forward when blacking our, or about to, but I\u2019m the motion was more than my head, kinda like my whole body \u2014although mostly the top\u2014. \n\n++Oops, I forgot it. So I was feeling a bit sick, but the transition to feeling full sick came after I saw an irregular black ring\u2014not small, medium/big size. I was a bit far in the church, but it would encompass the stomach to above the head, and the sides were a bit more after the arms, of my father\n\n[holy fuck, as I was putting the ++ to make things more clear, I realized the ring was kind of the one in arrival. I\u2019ll look for it, but will still try to draw it]\n\nI noticed it, definitely caught my attention, and next thing I perceive is it flying towards me so damn fast. It got to me, and that when I couldn\u2019t hold myself together/my top body was falling forward. \n\n(As I was writing this, it came to find how Carlos felt after being attacked trying to liberate the blue scout and, more aligned with this, the black energy when (I think) he got out of his room on his energetic body\n\nAs I considered that, my left side \u201cturned on\u201d, kinda like goosebumps, and I got emotional. Probably because of seeing some correlation to what happened to me in his experience, after having questioned it so much)\n\nAnyway: my mom noticed, and worried quite fast. I was like \u201cit\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll piece myself together\u201d, but couldn\u2019t. \n\nShe took me outside, and after feeling a bit better, she and my grandma decided to take me to another witch.\n\n+She told me I have an open body, and that it\u2019s easy for other being to pass though, or interact with me.\n\nI wanted to learn more about it, and focus on that ability, but I let it go. Last time I went to see her, after some other weird ass experiences I had, she told me she felt I wasn\u2019t as open body, but that I could get it back.\n\nInterestingly enough I\u2019ve been thinking about how getting into philosophy, politic, and psychology has made it so my logic/reason has created some wall in my mind... \n\nthankfully Im in touch with my intuition and I\u2019ve been tearing it down hahaha\n\n(Damn, I hope going like this isn\u2019t annoying hahaha)\n\n{about (1): I used to rationalize it by thinking that I kinda knew they weren\u2019t getting along, and maybe it was a representation of how my unconscious perceived my aunt would react as energy(??????). I do think it was real tho, but still wonder if my mind played me. \n\n+also, and more importantly: my grandma told me she wanted to talk with my dad on her deathbed, that it was all she wanted... so she probably died with some intent tying them together(?)}\n\nI remembered this experience writing this, and I think it\u2019s worth sharing\n\n2) so I was on an abandoned house, on the outside of the town I lived in, with a friend. We were chilling on the top side, as you can see the trees and the sea from there.\n\nI noticed some weird shadows with my periferal vision, which was kinda freaky, but cool at the same time.\n\nWeirdest thing is that at one point I felt someone touching my hair, a mixture of caressing it and moving it up.\n\nI was sure it happened, and that had to be her, but she was like nope. I insisted, and ended up saying that it was a great joke if she had, because she had fooled me completely, but nope, she didn\u2019t do it.\n\n2b That witch told me some weird things happened by those abandoned houses, maybe rituals, but don\u2019t remember.\n\n2c on another house near that one, with two friends of mine, after smoking weed.. we heard some noises on the basement, and went to check it. We didn\u2019t see anything, quite probably an animal, but we felt like the presence of a girl.\n\nWe got quite freaked out, goosebumps and all, and when we heard some more noises we ended up bailing. The energy was quite weird, and my friend ended up scratching his car on the tiny streets lol, which kinda allowed for a blank slate as we were kinda laughing our asses off\n\n\n**okay, so this last one, and parts of the other, could be understood more rationally. Particularly the last one, as we kinda induced ourselves those sensations. 2a) i\u2019m sure about what I felt, and she seemed to be dead serious, but can\u2019t know for sure.\n\nBut here it is, this takes the cake.. divided with (1) tho hahaha \n\n[kinda went on a tangent, 3c is the cake hahaha)\n\n+3) a. I kinda feel energies, but moreover after smoking. Those hightened states usually involve \u201canswers\u201d with objects falling, be in they neighbors place, my own, or a different current of energy, trying to close me in. \n\nI was at a point where I was reconnecting with this, moreover after discovering the r/remoteviewing sub. I remember the night before, playing with an old toy I had and my cat, I wanted to test something.\n\nI felt like that might have been a charged object, as I was so involved with it, and the house was so charged. My brother sleepwalked more than usually, and so did I, but just a bit.\n\nAnyway, after playing slowly, I kinda did a motion towards the door, quite focused, now I\u2019d probably say with intent. \n\n+The cat stopped playing,and started staring at the door For 20+secs. His eyes moved a bit, and he went running to the kitchen. I felt there was something, and felt stupid for not having recorded it \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI don\u2019t remember if it was that same night, but I felt some other \u201cconscience\u201d, for lack of a better word, and thought it was my cat. Later on I played calling his name in my mind, and he indeed reacted (75%~ percent of the time\n\n\n{I think recreating this is kinda hard, moreover on the usual awareness/state our conscience is. Probably with silence it could be done, aswell as the location of our assemblage point. \n\nI\u2019ll explore this once I get back to Spain.}\n\nI feel like cats can\u2019t perceive more than we popularly know. Egiptians come to mind.\n\nParticularly, not having as many overlapping systems might make it easier to perceive some fantastic things, together with their inner workings.\n\n\nB) i had decided to stop smoking, and clean myself. I got my last 5/10\u20ac, but just smoked one at night as I ended up kinda tired, and drifting in my mind.\n\nInterestingly, although I don\u2019t remember for sure if it was that night, but I was quite active in my mind. After some strong ass recapitulation seems, and feeling weird energies, I realized i could have been sending strong energies.\n\nOh, I remember now. I remember trying to communicate mentally with my brother, or some energy.\n\nThere were some reactions, but no clear answer. The reactions came both from his room, and noises he did, aswell as the house upstairs, and my cat.\n\n+I started feeling bad, as my mind was kinda racing, and being aware of our \u201cantennas\u201d + the heightened state I was in + the noises and weird energy.. I thought/felt I could be bombarding someone\n\n++I think saying the electromagnetic field might explain it better, as I definitely was charged, and I feel it would have impacted.. moreover mixed with trying to send my energy outside lmao\n\n At one point there was this outburst against my energy, kinda like someone was done and wanted me the shut the fuck off hahaha\n\nI had felt really bad, but the mixture of my mind still running, and being curious to the point of wanting a reaction, so I could know if it was just in my mind, kept me going.\n\n+I remember that my mood quite changed, kind of like when someone tells you off and you know they are kinda right. It got to the point of a bit of angst. \n\nBut I decided to hold my ground, and got back my place.\n\n(It weird sharing all of this, but if this might help in some way, I guess it\u2019s worth it lol)\n\n+++After a bit of peace, some back and forth, accompanied by some noises, and then peace again... I started feeling some energy creeping in, slowly getting bigger and bigger\n\nA few seconds later, my brother gets in the house LOL\n\nI must have looked like the emoji meme: \n\n\ud83d\udc41 \ud83d\udc44 \ud83d\udc41  lmao\n\nI must have been so focused I didn\u2019t notice he left. And he definitely had smoked, so I feel it made this easier.\n\nHe\u2019s also had weird experiences, to the point where the cat got in a protective stance, looking so intensely to the dark, and kinda moving.\n\nMy brother said he instantly started praying, even tho he hadn\u2019t done it in such a long time.\n\n{my take is that sometimes it\u2019s just coming from within, others it\u2019s kind of a mixture of our biases to something we actually perceive, and then a more pure form where our imagination makes some sense but it\u2019s a more pure perception\u2014although I guess we can also just \u201csee\u201d}\n\n+Oh, I almost forgot. Before sleeping I actually had the feeling of my consciousness expanding, but I got afraid of it being cancer or something, and kinda cut it short.\n\nDunno if it was that night, but I also got to hear a different part of me, but it kinda stayed there. Probably fear got in the way too.\n\nAlthough it might look like I\u2019m set on what I believe of this experiences, I\u2019ve always questioned what might be behind.\n\n++The most common is doubting whether the energy comes from inside, but a part outside the  fram of mind/consciousness from the moment, a different set of neurological connections that haven\u2019t been \u201cvoiced\u201d/acted upon much..;\nOr outside. The ones about feeling energy in the house might have been internal, and the electromagnetic field, aswell as sincronicities, might explain it; but it also felt like there was more to it.\n\n\nQuite a shame fear got in the way; thankfully now I\u2019m more determined.\n\nBut the cake wasn\u2019t there lmao, it\u2019s here:\n\n+3c) the morning after I decided to smoke the rest as I woke up. I think this influenced a lot, as the frequency my brain was at was different, and mixed with the weed and those heightened made an interesting recipe.\n\n(When I\u2019m in that house I usually smoke on a garage that wasn\u2019t finished, as they stopped building the rest of the building from the block where I live.\n\nThe place feels charged. So damn charged. Dunno if something happened there, or it\u2019s influenced by the people also going there to smoke and do their thingy.\n\nIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve considered. The mark we leave on the place we are, depending on the states we are in, our energy, and so on. \n\nI ended up \u201cchallenging\u201d myself to go there, just because I felt repelled, kinda scared. If you were there I feel you\u2019d get it, although you might experienced those kinds of places too.\n\nIt feels like a mixture of our suggestion, and something else being at play.\n\n+I remember the first time I confronted it, and stood my ground. The feeling of being watched was so strong, and as I was looking around the dark, at one point it felt like when you lock eye contact. \n\n+Holy fuck, I was feeling my body vibrating, but at that point it got so damn strong. Funnily and interestingly enough, I got an advertisement from Gaia talking about that same thing lfmao.\n\nThose damn vibrations.\n\nI was like holy fuck. Gotta love those sincronicities.\n\nAnother time I suddenly got the image in my mind of me hanged with the long ass cable of my headphones, as I had the intention of exploring staying some more challenging the sensations... \n\nMy body instantly turned to the door, like going in rails lol.\n\nOne of the next nights I thought about going again, but I wasn\u2019t feeling. I overthought it, considering if it was just being afraid, but it\u2019s just an artificial place, and I felt like smoking in nature... I walked past it, and 20 secs later I turned, so challenge whatever might be underlaying that decision.\n\nAs I was about to go in, I felt quite strongly not doing it, and turned around again.\n\n+Around 30 secs later a song said something like \u201cget the fuck out of there\u201d, and I instantly connected with how it would\u2019ve said it as i would be getting set in the environment, and how creepy it would be.\n\nThere was also a sincronicity with the time, which I looked and it was a satanic number or something like that, but I don\u2019t remember what it was...\nAnd finding the voice message out of the 300+ will be kinda hard hahaha)\n\nHoly fuck, sorry for the wall of text. I hope you find it interesting, or it\u2019s made you connect with something in your life.\n\n+++the start of the cake:\n\nI go the place I started sitting at the last times, where you can see a bit of the sky. It was really dark, and I couldn\u2019t see well, but I noticed something on the place.\n\nI touched it with my feet, to then see that it was a sandwich someone had just eaten a bite off.\n\nAs I did that, my mind started racing seeing the perspective of someone in the place, hadn\u2019t gone to the lower floor, and seeing me touching his food with my foot lol.\n\nI got kinda paranoid, dunno tho if I had already lit it up.\n\nI was with the headphones, but I could hear/feel something on that lower floor; although it seemed like no one was there. I thought about two friends of mine who also go there, but not at that time.. and they don\u2019t like that kind of sandwich.\n\nA bit after that, I heard them laughing. Probably on my mind. But as I had gotten into remote viewing, I also considered how, maybe, I set a connection to them, reinforced by all the times together, moreover there, and if they could feel it, even unconsciously.\n\nIt probably wasn\u2019t the case, although this has made me consider whether IOBs could use this kind of thing to get some reaction, thus energy.\n\nBut it probably was just me.\n\nAnyway, the interesting thing is that what got me out of the spiral was a bird chirping. It made me snap out of it, and realize the spiral.\n\nIt happened two more times, as I was getting in the spiral. Even tho I felt I was okay, I noticed how the underlaying systems might have been agitated... \n\nWhich would definitely affect my electromagnetic field. And I feel bird, and other animals, can sense that.\n\nThe last time I got in the spiral, it even came inside the garage lol. It was an interesting connection I felt.\n\nI was also watching unity, on Gaia, and had learned his take on Angels and demons (beings from the 4th dimension, that actually work together; the forme with light, latter with matter. If we can\u2019t learn with the help of angels, the ally with demons to set traps to us.. something like that)\n\nI considered if the bird could have had/been a deeper being; now I\u2019d say inorganic being...\n\nBut I think it might have just been that it felt the change in the electromagnetic field\n\n(bear in mind, this is just the foundation of the cake hahaha. Again, sorry for the wall of text)\n\n++++ now to the coolest part. The top of the cake:\n\nI think my grandma and I communicated telepathically. \n\nI go to my room, and heard again the bird, which was cool. I was thinking about my projects, and then I hear my grandma saying something along the lines of \u201cyou know it\u2019s really hard to live off your projects, filli\u00f1o\u201d(which is like a sweet mixture of son and darling in Galician)\n\nBut she was theoretically talking on the phone with some nephew; but something she\u2019s told to me repeatedly in the last 4 years.\n\nIt was weird, but I kept on my thing... but she replied to it again. I started awknowledging more. Happened again with the next thing I thought...\n\nso I started kinda drifting mid sentence.. and she\u2019d also do that!! I would make her hesitate!!!\n\nIt was so weird, but also cool! \n\nIt caused a change in her. She want from talking kinda in her high horse, but kinda sweetly, to doubting more, feeing less confident; which seemed like a consequence of our line of conversation.\n\nThis went on for 5 min or more. My confirmation was when she messed up, acted like she was talking to my mom... on the same \u201ccall\u201d as the nephew one.\n\nThat was like a click. Sadly I don\u2019t remember much now of the conversation, but maybe I made an audio about it, will check.\n\nAt one point I felt something pulling from my leg in the direction of her room, which freaked the fuck out of me.\n\n{personally, I think it\u2019s quite a possibility, and she is quite intuitive}\n\nAfter this, I started questioning how it could have happened:\n\nUnderlaying system in our brains/bodies that can interpret that way of communicating, at least when being in an appropriate frame of mind, or part of the assemblage point.. \n\nInorganic beings that are with us, and can access that information, and lay it onto us...\n\nI just imagined it all(?). This I never truly felt. I know it happened\n\nWhat I said in the beginning about the witch, that I said would get back to, is that this knowledge has fit and expanded my view of the world... \n\nAll of this experiences where before I knew any of this, but this helps bring parts of them more into the light, which in itself, I think, validates carlos\u2019 work.\n\nI feel like we can definitely help bring it more into light, and refine more the system.\n\nOh, the point about the witch:\n\nAs I was writing it i considered whether some she\u2019d have some ally, guest or, more horrifying.. \u201csquatter\u201d.\n\n(Now I feel this deserves a post on it\u2019s own, and will probably do so tomorrow)\n\nAnd that entity could\u2019ve know what was going on more clearly, and passing the info down.\n\nThe same would fit with my grandma, moreover with some other things in our lives and make the possibility of have some Inorganic squatter with us.\n\nAgain, the key is to have an open mind and entertain all of this from the middle. It makes sense, but who knows what could have been.\n\n\nAnyway, I feel like exploring this kinds of things under this lense can be quite helpful, expanding evermore the range it has.. \n\nthis reminds me of Don Juan telling Carlos, after his encounter with the blue scout, that he believed the IOBs interacted in our world constantly... \n\nwhich made me remember this moments, and kinda freeze \u2014which I used, alongside its movement of my AP to meditate and then sleep under its frame.\n\nThis is so messy, sorry lmao. Hopefully it makes sense. \n\nI actually have another big one to share, but will try to post first, as it feels like it might be over the limit, although it hasn\u2019t stopped me\n\nMeh, I\u2019ll try here anyway:\n\nThis one is the most recent of these, probably 3 month ago. After smoking, I was feeling strange energies have felt those also without smoking, but not as strongly), feeling a connection with the friend who also smokes in that garage.. probably because of smoking at the same time(?) I\u2019ve met someone who thought it linked, and also that weed allows to see through entropy.\n\nAnyway, at one point it felt like we had stablished a connection, and managed to talk a bit. Seemed like he was surprised, but once I started doubting it, and thinking it must have been a representation from my brain, it started fading.\n\nAlso had a moment after seing a weird light where I was feeling how that strange energy would feel about me, and the reaction to my not reacting\n\n{I felt it might have been some internal current, but now I consider more something external... probably what attacked me later}\n\nAfter some other weird things, like some pain in my ear and losing a bit of hearing,\n\n(My neighbor on that other house lost the hearing of the same ear I felt, which was kinda creepy. \n\nBack then I was considering more the flow of energy between people than IOBs)\n\nI went back inside, and meditated on my bed.\n\nIt was quite intense. I love those weed trips. Around a week ago after an amazing ride (check my comments, there was a reset of my consciousness, and flashing of a spider...) I started considering more like a perceive psychedelics. Using it too often kinda took it for granted\n\nBut already a few months ago I was doing it more for the explorations of those hypothetical depths of the natural world(energy, other beings, etc)\n\n++Anyway. The big things was that at some point at felt myself going up, towards a bright white light; accompanied by such a feeling of bliss, happiness...\n\nAnd then... PUM. Something knocked me the fuck down. I felt at the depths of darkness. Some energy started cornering me. \nLike, for real, it surrounded all of me, and started pressing down... till I snapped out of it, and pushed my energy out, regaining my space, and pushing the foreign energy out.\n\nInterestingly, I then apologized to the energy, saying that, fuck, if you approach me in such a way, how could I not react like that. And that if it wanted to communicate in some way, it was cool, but never trying to get inside me, manipulate me.. respecting my boundaries in general.\n\nI didn\u2019t know if it was from within (don\u2019t think so), or outside; but I have the attitude of understandiing, or trying to, others... and with this kind of energies, being from other people, or IOBs, it\u2019s harder to do.\n\nWhat makes it more interesting is that my approach to IOBs seems to have been in this way before getting into this. It feels like tiptoeing around the dark, being mindful of how what I think could be taken by them, but it\u2019s quite cool.\n\nI maybe haven\u2019t portrayed it aswell as I could, but I\u2019ll never forget that moment.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to going deeper into this, and communicate with them through lucid dreams and the black room.\n\n_____\n\n\nHoly fuck, I hadn\u2019t written for so long, and so focused, in a long time.

Is it by connecting with the other\u2019s energy, some other being that\u2019s with us, an underlying system in our bran/body that usually gets overwritten/buried? \u2014will come back to this later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also wonder how being close to dying might have affected me. I think the infection might have helped develop other parts of my brain, and now kinda have access to more space, but that\u2019s another thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I\u2019ve always been quite sensitive, and sensed things in people, aswell as where there was nothing/no one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you all well know, our perception of the world tends to be overwritten by our family and culture, but hopefully we\u2019ll manage to help future generations stay more in tune&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember some weird ass dreams, things falling on their own.. and thankfully others saw those at times too, but mostly those freaky creepy feelings(which I kinda attribute to our fear of the unknown, the dark...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although now I\u2019m also open to our brain perceiving something, and \u201ccreating\u201d some representation of it.. but based on something that was perceived (cannot be apply to everything, but some situations yeah)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway.. the strongest experience I\u2019ve had, at least visually, was at my aunt\u2019s funeral. I was 15/16then. \nMy dad and her had fallen off for some time. The last time we had been together was probably 4 years before, bc we when to visit the to the Canary Islands. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough I had a weird experience there. We were staying in some bungalows, and my cousins and I stayed on the same. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had locked the door from the outside, but somehow I managed to sleepwalk out(there was a way of opening from the inside, which maybe I picked up on), and go to the swimming pool. I still remember it lol. Then some woman called me, and I went there, but don\u2019t remember anything after getting to the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I was telling my family about the weird experience, but don\u2019t remember if I thought it was a dream, or they thought so. We get to the entrance, and the workers said: \u201chey, it\u2019s the kid from last night!\u201d Lmao &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was like \u201cI told you!!\u201d Ahhahah &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might not be related, but it\u2019s kind of a funny story; sorry for backtracking tho.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) We were at the church, and my father went to talk. I had been feeling alright, but a bit after he started, I started feeling kinda sick, which evolved to sick, which turned to being unable to hold myself together lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it reminds me of what you say when doing the black room practice, that the head goes forward when blacking our, or about to, but I\u2019m the motion was more than my head, kinda like my whole body \u2014although mostly the top\u2014. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;++Oops, I forgot it. So I was feeling a bit sick, but the transition to feeling full sick came after I saw an irregular black ring\u2014not small, medium/big size. I was a bit far in the church, but it would encompass the stomach to above the head, and the sides were a bit more after the arms, of my father&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[holy fuck, as I was putting the ++ to make things more clear, I realized the ring was kind of the one in arrival. I\u2019ll look for it, but will still try to draw it]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed it, definitely caught my attention, and next thing I perceive is it flying towards me so damn fast. It got to me, and that when I couldn\u2019t hold myself together/my top body was falling forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(As I was writing this, it came to find how Carlos felt after being attacked trying to liberate the blue scout and, more aligned with this, the black energy when (I think) he got out of his room on his energetic body&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I considered that, my left side \u201cturned on\u201d, kinda like goosebumps, and I got emotional. Probably because of seeing some correlation to what happened to me in his experience, after having questioned it so much)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway: my mom noticed, and worried quite fast. I was like \u201cit\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll piece myself together\u201d, but couldn\u2019t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She took me outside, and after feeling a bit better, she and my grandma decided to take me to another witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+She told me I have an open body, and that it\u2019s easy for other being to pass though, or interact with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to learn more about it, and focus on that ability, but I let it go. Last time I went to see her, after some other weird ass experiences I had, she told me she felt I wasn\u2019t as open body, but that I could get it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough I\u2019ve been thinking about how getting into philosophy, politic, and psychology has made it so my logic/reason has created some wall in my mind... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thankfully Im in touch with my intuition and I\u2019ve been tearing it down hahaha&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Damn, I hope going like this isn\u2019t annoying hahaha)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;{about (1): I used to rationalize it by thinking that I kinda knew they weren\u2019t getting along, and maybe it was a representation of how my unconscious perceived my aunt would react as energy(??????). I do think it was real tho, but still wonder if my mind played me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+also, and more importantly: my grandma told me she wanted to talk with my dad on her deathbed, that it was all she wanted... so she probably died with some intent tying them together(?)}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered this experience writing this, and I think it\u2019s worth sharing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) so I was on an abandoned house, on the outside of the town I lived in, with a friend. We were chilling on the top side, as you can see the trees and the sea from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed some weird shadows with my periferal vision, which was kinda freaky, but cool at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weirdest thing is that at one point I felt someone touching my hair, a mixture of caressing it and moving it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sure it happened, and that had to be her, but she was like nope. I insisted, and ended up saying that it was a great joke if she had, because she had fooled me completely, but nope, she didn\u2019t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2b That witch told me some weird things happened by those abandoned houses, maybe rituals, but don\u2019t remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2c on another house near that one, with two friends of mine, after smoking weed.. we heard some noises on the basement, and went to check it. We didn\u2019t see anything, quite probably an animal, but we felt like the presence of a girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got quite freaked out, goosebumps and all, and when we heard some more noises we ended up bailing. The energy was quite weird, and my friend ended up scratching his car on the tiny streets lol, which kinda allowed for a blank slate as we were kinda laughing our asses off&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**okay, so this last one, and parts of the other, could be understood more rationally. Particularly the last one, as we kinda induced ourselves those sensations. 2a) i\u2019m sure about what I felt, and she seemed to be dead serious, but can\u2019t know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here it is, this takes the cake.. divided with (1) tho hahaha &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[kinda went on a tangent, 3c is the cake hahaha)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+3) a. I kinda feel energies, but moreover after smoking. Those hightened states usually involve \u201canswers\u201d with objects falling, be in they neighbors place, my own, or a different current of energy, trying to close me in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was at a point where I was reconnecting with this, moreover after discovering the &lt;a href=\"/r/remoteviewing\"&gt;r/remoteviewing&lt;/a&gt; sub. I remember the night before, playing with an old toy I had and my cat, I wanted to test something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt like that might have been a charged object, as I was so involved with it, and the house was so charged. My brother sleepwalked more than usually, and so did I, but just a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after playing slowly, I kinda did a motion towards the door, quite focused, now I\u2019d probably say with intent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+The cat stopped playing,and started staring at the door For 20+secs. His eyes moved a bit, and he went running to the kitchen. I felt there was something, and felt stupid for not having recorded it \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t remember if it was that same night, but I felt some other \u201cconscience\u201d, for lack of a better word, and thought it was my cat. Later on I played calling his name in my mind, and he indeed reacted (75%~ percent of the time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;{I think recreating this is kinda hard, moreover on the usual awareness/state our conscience is. Probably with silence it could be done, aswell as the location of our assemblage point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll explore this once I get back to Spain.}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like cats can\u2019t perceive more than we popularly know. Egiptians come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Particularly, not having as many overlapping systems might make it easier to perceive some fantastic things, together with their inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) i had decided to stop smoking, and clean myself. I got my last 5/10\u20ac, but just smoked one at night as I ended up kinda tired, and drifting in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, although I don\u2019t remember for sure if it was that night, but I was quite active in my mind. After some strong ass recapitulation seems, and feeling weird energies, I realized i could have been sending strong energies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, I remember now. I remember trying to communicate mentally with my brother, or some energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were some reactions, but no clear answer. The reactions came both from his room, and noises he did, aswell as the house upstairs, and my cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+I started feeling bad, as my mind was kinda racing, and being aware of our \u201cantennas\u201d + the heightened state I was in + the noises and weird energy.. I thought/felt I could be bombarding someone&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;++I think saying the electromagnetic field might explain it better, as I definitely was charged, and I feel it would have impacted.. moreover mixed with trying to send my energy outside lmao&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point there was this outburst against my energy, kinda like someone was done and wanted me the shut the fuck off hahaha&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had felt really bad, but the mixture of my mind still running, and being curious to the point of wanting a reaction, so I could know if it was just in my mind, kept me going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+I remember that my mood quite changed, kind of like when someone tells you off and you know they are kinda right. It got to the point of a bit of angst. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I decided to hold my ground, and got back my place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(It weird sharing all of this, but if this might help in some way, I guess it\u2019s worth it lol)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+++After a bit of peace, some back and forth, accompanied by some noises, and then peace again... I started feeling some energy creeping in, slowly getting bigger and bigger&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few seconds later, my brother gets in the house LOL&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must have looked like the emoji meme: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\ud83d\udc41 \ud83d\udc44 \ud83d\udc41  lmao&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must have been so focused I didn\u2019t notice he left. And he definitely had smoked, so I feel it made this easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s also had weird experiences, to the point where the cat got in a protective stance, looking so intensely to the dark, and kinda moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother said he instantly started praying, even tho he hadn\u2019t done it in such a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;{my take is that sometimes it\u2019s just coming from within, others it\u2019s kind of a mixture of our biases to something we actually perceive, and then a more pure form where our imagination makes some sense but it\u2019s a more pure perception\u2014although I guess we can also just \u201csee\u201d}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+Oh, I almost forgot. Before sleeping I actually had the feeling of my consciousness expanding, but I got afraid of it being cancer or something, and kinda cut it short.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dunno if it was that night, but I also got to hear a different part of me, but it kinda stayed there. Probably fear got in the way too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it might look like I\u2019m set on what I believe of this experiences, I\u2019ve always questioned what might be behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;++The most common is doubting whether the energy comes from inside, but a part outside the  fram of mind/consciousness from the moment, a different set of neurological connections that haven\u2019t been \u201cvoiced\u201d/acted upon much..;\nOr outside. The ones about feeling energy in the house might have been internal, and the electromagnetic field, aswell as sincronicities, might explain it; but it also felt like there was more to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite a shame fear got in the way; thankfully now I\u2019m more determined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the cake wasn\u2019t there lmao, it\u2019s here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+3c) the morning after I decided to smoke the rest as I woke up. I think this influenced a lot, as the frequency my brain was at was different, and mixed with the weed and those heightened made an interesting recipe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(When I\u2019m in that house I usually smoke on a garage that wasn\u2019t finished, as they stopped building the rest of the building from the block where I live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The place feels charged. So damn charged. Dunno if something happened there, or it\u2019s influenced by the people also going there to smoke and do their thingy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s something I\u2019ve considered. The mark we leave on the place we are, depending on the states we are in, our energy, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up \u201cchallenging\u201d myself to go there, just because I felt repelled, kinda scared. If you were there I feel you\u2019d get it, although you might experienced those kinds of places too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels like a mixture of our suggestion, and something else being at play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+I remember the first time I confronted it, and stood my ground. The feeling of being watched was so strong, and as I was looking around the dark, at one point it felt like when you lock eye contact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+Holy fuck, I was feeling my body vibrating, but at that point it got so damn strong. Funnily and interestingly enough, I got an advertisement from Gaia talking about that same thing lfmao.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those damn vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was like holy fuck. Gotta love those sincronicities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another time I suddenly got the image in my mind of me hanged with the long ass cable of my headphones, as I had the intention of exploring staying some more challenging the sensations... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My body instantly turned to the door, like going in rails lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the next nights I thought about going again, but I wasn\u2019t feeling. I overthought it, considering if it was just being afraid, but it\u2019s just an artificial place, and I felt like smoking in nature... I walked past it, and 20 secs later I turned, so challenge whatever might be underlaying that decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was about to go in, I felt quite strongly not doing it, and turned around again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+Around 30 secs later a song said something like \u201cget the fuck out of there\u201d, and I instantly connected with how it would\u2019ve said it as i would be getting set in the environment, and how creepy it would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also a sincronicity with the time, which I looked and it was a satanic number or something like that, but I don\u2019t remember what it was...\nAnd finding the voice message out of the 300+ will be kinda hard hahaha)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holy fuck, sorry for the wall of text. I hope you find it interesting, or it\u2019s made you connect with something in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+++the start of the cake:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go the place I started sitting at the last times, where you can see a bit of the sky. It was really dark, and I couldn\u2019t see well, but I noticed something on the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I touched it with my feet, to then see that it was a sandwich someone had just eaten a bite off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I did that, my mind started racing seeing the perspective of someone in the place, hadn\u2019t gone to the lower floor, and seeing me touching his food with my foot lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got kinda paranoid, dunno tho if I had already lit it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was with the headphones, but I could hear/feel something on that lower floor; although it seemed like no one was there. I thought about two friends of mine who also go there, but not at that time.. and they don\u2019t like that kind of sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit after that, I heard them laughing. Probably on my mind. But as I had gotten into remote viewing, I also considered how, maybe, I set a connection to them, reinforced by all the times together, moreover there, and if they could feel it, even unconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It probably wasn\u2019t the case, although this has made me consider whether IOBs could use this kind of thing to get some reaction, thus energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it probably was just me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the interesting thing is that what got me out of the spiral was a bird chirping. It made me snap out of it, and realize the spiral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It happened two more times, as I was getting in the spiral. Even tho I felt I was okay, I noticed how the underlaying systems might have been agitated... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which would definitely affect my electromagnetic field. And I feel bird, and other animals, can sense that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time I got in the spiral, it even came inside the garage lol. It was an interesting connection I felt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was also watching unity, on Gaia, and had learned his take on Angels and demons (beings from the 4th dimension, that actually work together; the forme with light, latter with matter. If we can\u2019t learn with the help of angels, the ally with demons to set traps to us.. something like that)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I considered if the bird could have had/been a deeper being; now I\u2019d say inorganic being...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think it might have just been that it felt the change in the electromagnetic field&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(bear in mind, this is just the foundation of the cake hahaha. Again, sorry for the wall of text)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;++++ now to the coolest part. The top of the cake:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think my grandma and I communicated telepathically. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go to my room, and heard again the bird, which was cool. I was thinking about my projects, and then I hear my grandma saying something along the lines of \u201cyou know it\u2019s really hard to live off your projects, filli\u00f1o\u201d(which is like a sweet mixture of son and darling in Galician)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she was theoretically talking on the phone with some nephew; but something she\u2019s told to me repeatedly in the last 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was weird, but I kept on my thing... but she replied to it again. I started awknowledging more. Happened again with the next thing I thought...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so I started kinda drifting mid sentence.. and she\u2019d also do that!! I would make her hesitate!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so weird, but also cool! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It caused a change in her. She want from talking kinda in her high horse, but kinda sweetly, to doubting more, feeing less confident; which seemed like a consequence of our line of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This went on for 5 min or more. My confirmation was when she messed up, acted like she was talking to my mom... on the same \u201ccall\u201d as the nephew one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was like a click. Sadly I don\u2019t remember much now of the conversation, but maybe I made an audio about it, will check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point I felt something pulling from my leg in the direction of her room, which freaked the fuck out of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;{personally, I think it\u2019s quite a possibility, and she is quite intuitive}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this, I started questioning how it could have happened:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Underlaying system in our brains/bodies that can interpret that way of communicating, at least when being in an appropriate frame of mind, or part of the assemblage point.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings that are with us, and can access that information, and lay it onto us...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just imagined it all(?). This I never truly felt. I know it happened&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I said in the beginning about the witch, that I said would get back to, is that this knowledge has fit and expanded my view of the world... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this experiences where before I knew any of this, but this helps bring parts of them more into the light, which in itself, I think, validates carlos\u2019 work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like we can definitely help bring it more into light, and refine more the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, the point about the witch:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was writing it i considered whether some she\u2019d have some ally, guest or, more horrifying.. \u201csquatter\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Now I feel this deserves a post on it\u2019s own, and will probably do so tomorrow)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that entity could\u2019ve know what was going on more clearly, and passing the info down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same would fit with my grandma, moreover with some other things in our lives and make the possibility of have some Inorganic squatter with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, the key is to have an open mind and entertain all of this from the middle. It makes sense, but who knows what could have been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I feel like exploring this kinds of things under this lense can be quite helpful, expanding evermore the range it has.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this reminds me of Don Juan telling Carlos, after his encounter with the blue scout, that he believed the IOBs interacted in our world constantly... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;which made me remember this moments, and kinda freeze \u2014which I used, alongside its movement of my AP to meditate and then sleep under its frame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is so messy, sorry lmao. Hopefully it makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually have another big one to share, but will try to post first, as it feels like it might be over the limit, although it hasn\u2019t stopped me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meh, I\u2019ll try here anyway:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one is the most recent of these, probably 3 month ago. After smoking, I was feeling strange energies have felt those also without smoking, but not as strongly), feeling a connection with the friend who also smokes in that garage.. probably because of smoking at the same time(?) I\u2019ve met someone who thought it linked, and also that weed allows to see through entropy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, at one point it felt like we had stablished a connection, and managed to talk a bit. Seemed like he was surprised, but once I started doubting it, and thinking it must have been a representation from my brain, it started fading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also had a moment after seing a weird light where I was feeling how that strange energy would feel about me, and the reaction to my not reacting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;{I felt it might have been some internal current, but now I consider more something external... probably what attacked me later}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some other weird things, like some pain in my ear and losing a bit of hearing,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(My neighbor on that other house lost the hearing of the same ear I felt, which was kinda creepy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then I was considering more the flow of energy between people than IOBs)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back inside, and meditated on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was quite intense. I love those weed trips. Around a week ago after an amazing ride (check my comments, there was a reset of my consciousness, and flashing of a spider...) I started considering more like a perceive psychedelics. Using it too often kinda took it for granted&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But already a few months ago I was doing it more for the explorations of those hypothetical depths of the natural world(energy, other beings, etc)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;++Anyway. The big things was that at some point at felt myself going up, towards a bright white light; accompanied by such a feeling of bliss, happiness...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then... PUM. Something knocked me the fuck down. I felt at the depths of darkness. Some energy started cornering me. \nLike, for real, it surrounded all of me, and started pressing down... till I snapped out of it, and pushed my energy out, regaining my space, and pushing the foreign energy out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I then apologized to the energy, saying that, fuck, if you approach me in such a way, how could I not react like that. And that if it wanted to communicate in some way, it was cool, but never trying to get inside me, manipulate me.. respecting my boundaries in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t know if it was from within (don\u2019t think so), or outside; but I have the attitude of understandiing, or trying to, others... and with this kind of energies, being from other people, or IOBs, it\u2019s harder to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes it more interesting is that my approach to IOBs seems to have been in this way before getting into this. It feels like tiptoeing around the dark, being mindful of how what I think could be taken by them, but it\u2019s quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I maybe haven\u2019t portrayed it aswell as I could, but I\u2019ll never forget that moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m looking forward to going deeper into this, and communicate with them through lucid dreams and the black room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holy fuck, I hadn\u2019t written for so long, and so focused, in a long time. I\u2019ll link this with the BrP, and then trying to lucid dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dunno if I\u2019ll check the comments before sleeping, as I don\u2019t want to mess up my frame/assemblage point; but if I finish the session out of it I might.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually am so thankful to be a part of this community lol, looking forward to exploring this together.. and getting to know you!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "0638d4a4-6006-11ea-9172-0ed30c810347", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "icwce8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lyammalik", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/icwce8/experiences_with_iobs_in_the_physical_world/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/icwce8/experiences_with_iobs_in_the_physical_world/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1597870892.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g25de2x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "lyammalik", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1597874003.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g25b62i", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_dtddf", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I think so.

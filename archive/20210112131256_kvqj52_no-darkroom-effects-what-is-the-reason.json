Carlos was a lot harsher than I am, when dealing with troubled people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman once said, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t wear those!&amp;quot; to a gift of shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was tossed out so fast, her head spun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still legendary to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other men didn&amp;#39;t get the respect they felt they deserved, so they did the same as you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They attacked Castaneda.  Two followed him around with video cameras, so they could shame and embarass him.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several cursed him as a bad man, and pretty much destroyed his reputation because when interviewed after his death, they could only find clueless people, and angry people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go away!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go darken someone else&amp;#39;s discussion group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they don&amp;#39;t have anything going on, they&amp;#39;ll give you the respect you feel you deserve.

I've seen the 'islands' metaphor before in various depictions, the way you describe here that they receive information from data tubes that feed in from above makes sense to me given what I know about circuit function combined with an intuitive carry-the-metaphor..\n\nI am curious: I see you say that for the male/masculine mind, internal silence is prerequisite for making any progress in sorcery. The 'talk machine' has to remain silent or it overcrowds the entire perception &amp; everything goes poof.\n\nOn the other hand, I have heard you imply this is not the case for the feminine/female mind. In that situation, the 'inner voice' is more able to function as a collaborator &amp; co-creator.. or at the very least, can chatter some without shattering the image.\n\nTo my understanding, the difference between these two approaches sum down to differences in 'brain dominance'. The masculine/male waking-mind is 'dominated' by what's typically called 'left brain'-- the expressing/logical brain. While on the other hand, the feminine/female waking mind is 'dominated' by what is typically called the 'right brain'-- the imaging/imagining/'emotional' brain. This 'natural preference' by the body-organism means that in the feminine mind, the wakingly-submissive 'expressing' brain is already accustomed to accompanying/serving the 'imaging/imagining' brain. Whereas for the masculine mind, the same chattering-dominating 'expressing' brain must finally learn discipline+servitude in relation to the wakingly-submissive imaging/imagining (which is the brain in which the activities of sorcery take place).\n\nAll of this is to tie into the experience in Cholita's brain that you share here:\n\nBeing plagued by delusions means her imaging/imagining brain is 'stuck asleep/in dreaming state' while her expressive brain is reacting to that state as a sleeptalker would (though a sleeptalker would be A. paralyzed by the mitor brain while sleeping B. would be reacting to their own energy-sphere &amp; not to the sphere of a moving, living, unpredictable Other human being).\n\nMeaning: Cholita's expressing brain is stuck running all the time in waking-state, compensating for her permanently sleeping-state imaging/imagining brain-- yet paradoxically, even though her expressing brain is stuck while in 'waking state', it's responding to 'sleeping state' input from the imaging/imagining brain whether not she's physically awake or physically asleep.\n\nThis innate &amp; perpetual submissive-state connection from her expressing brain to her imaging/imagining brain via her misfiring network as you describe has three implications that make her a 'natural' at exercising the sorcery ability she has:\n\n1. She's a woman, so the natural 'hierarchy' of both her brains is conducive to the 'expressing' brain being able to operate without drowning out the imaging/imaginary brain.\n2. Her being a woman, though, hardly 'matters' though, because the specific way her brain is miswired guarantees the expressing brain will adapt to become permanently-submissive to the dominant, permanently-dreaming imaging/imagining brain.\n3. Returning the 'paranoid' expressing brain and the 'schizophrenic' imaging/imagining brain to a baseline sleep state while freezing the motor brain + her technical 'inventory' knowledge of sorcery that was passed to her double-- makes to the point that when both brains are in a sleeping state, the 'double' can 'take over' Cholita's neurological hardware in order to act in subtle energy realms why the body is frozen.\n\nFollow to the 1st implication:\nThis 'neurological possession' by the double is the same thing that happens to the male sorcerer-- yet in his case, due to the hierarchy structure between his expressing brain. imaging brain, the 'flyer narration program' is able to hijack the expressing brain, then hijack the imaging/imagining brain, all to the end-result of booting the double out from the neurological hardware.\n\nFollow to the 2nd implication:\nThe paranoid-schizophrenic miswire (which causes the expressing brain to become paranoid &amp; the imaging/imagining brain to become schizophrenic), when expressed in men (and with a lower gradient of paranoia) as a neurological configuration, can also be a boon to male sorcerers-- and this explains the historical connection between apparent-schizophrenia and the shamanistic/witch-doctor/sorcerer traditions of other cultures (yet as the same with your Cholita {who overcame this conceptual hurdle &amp; shared the knowlege of sorcery with her double while in your studying before her schizophrenia disabled her waking-rationality [if I understand her history right, her brain wasn't always this destructive to her waking-rationality, was it?]}), these men too require a logical/rational/expressing basis within the surrounding culture for them to be able to integrate their experiences in the spirit realm within their personal-mental life &amp; within life in the greater community).\n\nNo follow to the 3rd implication.\n\n----\n\nBoy well, that was a lot more than I intended to write, but it takes a lot of words to convey these concepts in.. primitive linguistic speech.\n\nAm I on the dime in terms of building off the base of your prior explanation? I'm rather curious about this subject as I've been speaking lately to a few others in conversation about the connection between schizophrenia and altered/magical states of consciousness.\n\nHow's my understanding of the behaviour of the baseline masculine and feminine brains compared against each other? I'm not sure if you've answered this question-- I actually found this thread while searching this subreddit to see if anyone had answered it.\n\nBest of luck to you &amp; I am curious to hear what you may have to say.", "edited": 1621573266.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gywsag9", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating explanation.. I&amp;#39;ve seen the &amp;#39;islands&amp;#39; metaphor before in various depictions, the way you describe here that they receive information from data tubes that feed in from above makes sense to me given what I know about circuit function combined with an intuitive carry-the-metaphor..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am curious: I see you say that for the male/masculine mind, internal silence is prerequisite for making any progress in sorcery. The &amp;#39;talk machine&amp;#39; has to remain silent or it overcrowds the entire perception &amp;amp; everything goes poof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I have heard you imply this is not the case for the feminine/female mind. In that situation, the &amp;#39;inner voice&amp;#39; is more able to function as a collaborator &amp;amp; co-creator.. or at the very least, can chatter some without shattering the image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my understanding, the difference between these two approaches sum down to differences in &amp;#39;brain dominance&amp;#39;. The masculine/male waking-mind is &amp;#39;dominated&amp;#39; by what&amp;#39;s typically called &amp;#39;left brain&amp;#39;-- the expressing/logical brain. While on the other hand, the feminine/female waking mind is &amp;#39;dominated&amp;#39; by what is typically called the &amp;#39;right brain&amp;#39;-- the imaging/imagining/&amp;#39;emotional&amp;#39; brain. This &amp;#39;natural preference&amp;#39; by the body-organism means that in the feminine mind, the wakingly-submissive &amp;#39;expressing&amp;#39; brain is already accustomed to accompanying/serving the &amp;#39;imaging/imagining&amp;#39; brain. Whereas for the masculine mind, the same chattering-dominating &amp;#39;expressing&amp;#39; brain must finally learn discipline+servitude in relation to the wakingly-submissive imaging/imagining (which is the brain in which the activities of sorcery take place).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this is to tie into the experience in Cholita&amp;#39;s brain that you share here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being plagued by delusions means her imaging/imagining brain is &amp;#39;stuck asleep/in dreaming state&amp;#39; while her expressive brain is reacting to that state as a sleeptalker would (though a sleeptalker would be A. paralyzed by the mitor brain while sleeping B. would be reacting to their own energy-sphere &amp;amp; not to the sphere of a moving, living, unpredictable Other human being).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning: Cholita&amp;#39;s expressing brain is stuck running all the time in waking-state, compensating for her permanently sleeping-state imaging/imagining brain-- yet paradoxically, even though her expressing brain is stuck while in &amp;#39;waking state&amp;#39;, it&amp;#39;s responding to &amp;#39;sleeping state&amp;#39; input from the imaging/imagining brain whether not she&amp;#39;s physically awake or physically asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This innate &amp;amp; perpetual submissive-state connection from her expressing brain to her imaging/imagining brain via her misfiring network as you describe has three implications that make her a &amp;#39;natural&amp;#39; at exercising the sorcery ability she has:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She&amp;#39;s a woman, so the natural &amp;#39;hierarchy&amp;#39; of both her brains is conducive to the &amp;#39;expressing&amp;#39; brain being able to operate without drowning out the imaging/imaginary brain.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Her being a woman, though, hardly &amp;#39;matters&amp;#39; though, because the specific way her brain is miswired guarantees the expressing brain will adapt to become permanently-submissive to the dominant, permanently-dreaming imaging/imagining brain.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Returning the &amp;#39;paranoid&amp;#39; expressing brain and the &amp;#39;schizophrenic&amp;#39; imaging/imagining brain to a baseline sleep state while freezing the motor brain + her technical &amp;#39;inventory&amp;#39; knowledge of sorcery that was passed to her double-- makes to the point that when both brains are in a sleeping state, the &amp;#39;double&amp;#39; can &amp;#39;take over&amp;#39; Cholita&amp;#39;s neurological hardware in order to act in subtle energy realms why the body is frozen.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Follow to the 1st implication:\nThis &amp;#39;neurological possession&amp;#39; by the double is the same thing that happens to the male sorcerer-- yet in his case, due to the hierarchy structure between his expressing brain. imaging brain, the &amp;#39;flyer narration program&amp;#39; is able to hijack the expressing brain, then hijack the imaging/imagining brain, all to the end-result of booting the double out from the neurological hardware.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Follow to the 2nd implication:\nThe paranoid-schizophrenic miswire (which causes the expressing brain to become paranoid &amp;amp; the imaging/imagining brain to become schizophrenic), when expressed in men (and with a lower gradient of paranoia) as a neurological configuration, can also be a boon to male sorcerers-- and this explains the historical connection between apparent-schizophrenia and the shamanistic/witch-doctor/sorcerer traditions of other cultures (yet as the same with your Cholita {who overcame this conceptual hurdle &amp;amp; shared the knowlege of sorcery with her double while in your studying before her schizophrenia disabled her waking-rationality [if I understand her history right, her brain wasn&amp;#39;t always this destructive to her waking-rationality, was it?]}), these men too require a logical/rational/expressing basis within the surrounding culture for them to be able to integrate their experiences in the spirit realm within their personal-mental life &amp;amp; within life in the greater community).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No follow to the 3rd implication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boy well, that was a lot more than I intended to write, but it takes a lot of words to convey these concepts in.. primitive linguistic speech.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I on the dime in terms of building off the base of your prior explanation?

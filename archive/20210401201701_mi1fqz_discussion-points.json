When it's short term, such as puffery of whatever you run into, not insisting on the same kind, it's not \"trying\".\n\nFancy showed me. To do some of the most fantastic things you hear about in the books, you just look that direction.\n\nSo if you worry who will show you how to do something from the books, just remember how Carlos turned into a crow.  Go back and read it.\n\nIt's pretty lame.  \n\nBut even more lame is a video of Nyei showing how to turn into a bat.  And yet, it looks like that might actually be the way to do it.\n\nAfter seeing that, I think I'll avoid becoming batman.\n\nI suspect your positions are as accurate as we can get for now. I doubt Juan would disagree with any, for more than 6 inches.  And the curve itself, has to be at least 5 feet.  If anyone has some string and a little time, figure it out for us!\n\nBut no one should assume we know where everything is, just because we make suggestions or guesses.\n\nWe just go up and down the curve daily, and you sort of learn \"how long\" to get a certain thing to happen, and so you estimate where that is on the curve.\n\nBut for all we know, there's a time sink hole in the middle which throws everything off.\n\nMaybe it's 20 minutes to pass the red line, but only 1 to pass the green line.\n\nHere's a thought.  Is the bottom of the curve the lowest we can get the assemblage point to go?\n\nDon't trees have very low assemblage points, and  the old seers could turn into a tree?\n\nMaybe it's possible to go \"off curve\"?\n\nCertainly, I don't recall becoming a tree while moving along the entire J curve length.\n\nAnd the new seers stretch themselves into an infinite line.  So you'd expect, their assemblage point goes even above the head.\n\nI never noticed if unusual sitting positions make it easier to get silent. I'll have to check that out.\n\nZuleica had them sitting on rocks in bags.\n\nAbout all these positions on the J curve, and what should happen.\n\nWe have only the very little of what Carlos lectured to us, on this topic.\n\nAnd, of that very little, only what I remembered from when I wasn't obsessed with the girl's butt.\n\nIn general, here's all we have for sure:\n\nYou can move left and right on the blue line. It's normal for people to do that all day long.\n\nStuff happens at the green line, but what exactly I don't recall.\n\nRed line is for shapeshifting.\n\nBetween the red line and green line, is something to do with insects. But Carlos stopped with a grin, and dropped the topic.  \n\nThe assemblage point only moves 1 inch left or right at any vertical point. However, there are hundreds of worlds in that small movement.\n\nTo the right is more physical, to the left more spiritual feeling.\n\nThe bands on either side of that slice of cheese  alter which emanations are assembled within man's cheese slice (band of emanations), as you get closer to them.\n\nYou can't go over into those cheese slices, except for one of them.  I'm not sure we know if that band touches man's band, but it's the black world.  I have a strange feeling it's to the right, but can't remember why I believe that.\n\nAnd it's not good to hang out in that one. It ages you.\n\nStill, as you get closer to them, they exert an influence.\n\nFor example, if you shift as far right as you can, you smell limburger cheese in the next slice.\n\nIf you shift far left, you smell sharp cheddar.\n\nIt's just an analogy.  What it means is, the outside bands can influence what you assemble, even if you can't assemblage emanations which are entirely a part of those bands.\n\nInorganic beings come from all 8 bands.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gt2jtuh", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;If further on the curve I see a bright puff and decide to scoop it, I return back to the blue orb position &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you &amp;quot;tried&amp;quot;?

And yet, it looks like that might actually be the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After seeing that, I think I&amp;#39;ll avoid becoming batman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect your positions are as accurate as we can get for now. I doubt Juan would disagree with any, for more than 6 inches.  And the curve itself, has to be at least 5 feet.  If anyone has some string and a little time, figure it out for us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one should assume we know where everything is, just because we make suggestions or guesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just go up and down the curve daily, and you sort of learn &amp;quot;how long&amp;quot; to get a certain thing to happen, and so you estimate where that is on the curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for all we know, there&amp;#39;s a time sink hole in the middle which throws everything off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s 20 minutes to pass the red line, but only 1 to pass the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a thought.  Is the bottom of the curve the lowest we can get the assemblage point to go?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t trees have very low assemblage points, and  the old seers could turn into a tree?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s possible to go &amp;quot;off curve&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I don&amp;#39;t recall becoming a tree while moving along the entire J curve length.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the new seers stretch themselves into an infinite line.  So you&amp;#39;d expect, their assemblage point goes even above the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never noticed if unusual sitting positions make it easier to get silent. I&amp;#39;ll have to check that out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica had them sitting on rocks in bags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About all these positions on the J curve, and what should happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have only the very little of what Carlos lectured to us, on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, of that very little, only what I remembered from when I wasn&amp;#39;t obsessed with the girl&amp;#39;s butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, here&amp;#39;s all we have for sure:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can move left and right on the blue line. It&amp;#39;s normal for people to do that all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuff happens at the green line, but what exactly I don&amp;#39;t recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Red line is for shapeshifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between the red line and green line, is something to do with insects. But Carlos stopped with a grin, and dropped the topic.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assemblage point only moves 1 inch left or right at any vertical point. However, there are hundreds of worlds in that small movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the right is more physical, to the left more spiritual feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bands on either side of that slice of cheese  alter which emanations are assembled within man&amp;#39;s cheese slice (band of emanations), as you get closer to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t go over into those cheese slices, except for one of them.  I&amp;#39;m not sure we know if that band touches man&amp;#39;s band, but it&amp;#39;s the black world.  I have a strange feeling it&amp;#39;s to the right, but can&amp;#39;t remember why I believe that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not good to hang out in that one. It ages you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, as you get closer to them, they exert an influence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if you shift as far right as you can, you smell limburger cheese in the next slice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you shift far left, you smell sharp cheddar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just an analogy.  What it means is, the outside bands can influence what you assemble, even if you can&amp;#39;t assemblage emanations which are entirely a part of those bands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings come from all 8 bands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mi1fqz/discussion_points/gt2jtuh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1617308787.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_mi1fqz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gt8tzri", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gt36jqf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It should be mentioned, for new users, that silence is actually the only thing that matters. \n\nThe only thing that is going to make your assamblage points shift. \n\nExtras, like position, are just aids.\n\n&gt; could feel the path that the A.P. \n\nYes!

It was hard for me not to be brainwashed. In high school, I was surrounded by angry women's libbers (in the 70s), in micro miniskirts, \"hot pants\", and blouses with an open back, a big bow you could obviously tug on, making the whole enchilada fall off.\n\nIt was very subtle back then...\n\nIt was hard not to take what they said to heart, even if it didn't make much sense. Mostly they got angry over \"Fly me to San Francisco\", or other sexy advertisements that made them seem to be \"sex objects\".\n\nIn hot pants...\n\nIt wasn't until I reached 50 that I realized,  nearly every woman over 40 would kill to be a \"sex object\" again.  Especially the women's libbers from the 70s.\n\nI got an excellent definition of the differences between men and women from a witch, and it lines up with both Cholita, and Cleargreen.  And frankly, reality.\n\nIt's just a placebo for the mind, possibly from \"the fliers\", to make the argument about men and women be over what job you can have, or who does the housework.\n\nIt's all nonsense.  It's beside the point.  A distraction. More crumbs on the path of \"happiness\", which actually leads the opposite direction.\n\nIt's more nitpicking inside the Tonal.\n\nThe witch explained to me that men need to be slaves.  They'll join a big organization and do it's bidding, they'll marry a beautiful woman and follow her orders about how their lives should be, they'll become religious fanatics and walk around in robes, because someone else said they should do that.\n\nOr they'll join a \"quest for freedom\". Become stuffy, obsessed, \"impeccable warriors\".\n\nIt's all about what they do, and doing stuff.  And maybe a little about what other people think about them. They still want the approval from boss mommy.\n\nWith women, it's all about how you live. Not what you do.  That gives them an advantage over men, because they can see the bigger picture.\n\nMen have been enslaved by women on this planet, and from what I've seen of the inorganic beings (who are almost always female according to don Juan), female energy just does that. It dazzles male energy, in order to keep it around and utilize it.\n\nCarlos was plagued with the inorganics trying to kidnap him and bring him to their world.\n\nI've even been brought, although I consider it a lot of fun, and not threatening.\n\nMen are slaves. But they're still brutes. Being a slave to females doesn't mean they won't act badly.  Punch stuff, break stuff, shout loudly.\n\nThey put on the gorilla display.  But the female gorilla is actually the ruler of the tribe.  The men aren't their worry.  Competition from more desirable females is what they have to look out for.\n\nWomen aren't like men according to this witch.\n\nThey're kingdom builders.\n\nIf their kingdom is destroyed, they rebuild it from whatever is available.\n\n(Isn't this obvious from biology?)\n\nCholita has rebuilt my entire house, except for my room.  She threw away all of my belongings, and bought around $50K of stuff, to make her kingdom the way she wants. Daily she expands it, until now it even fills the garage and back yard. She's working on the front yard, but there's conflict with neighbors.\n\nYesterday, the old woman next door left Cholita a big bag of persimmons, and 2 gift plants.\n\nCholita's been eyeing her fruit in her background, and complaining about how much is going to waste. I suspect it came to \"words\", and thus the peace offerings politely set next to the entrance to the backyard.\n\nApparently Cholita's kingdom doesn't include a party sized couch in the living room.  I had to haul it away yesterday, so Cholita could sit in meditation in an empty room.\n\nThe Chinese bosses' son helped, and kept warning me not to touch the Klenix tissues stuck between the cushions.\n\nGood advice.  There were a lot of hot women on that couch.\n\nI can't interest Cholita in shared dreaming.

It was hard for me not to be brainwashed. In high school, I was surrounded by angry women&amp;#39;s libbers (in the 70s), in micro miniskirts, &amp;quot;hot pants&amp;quot;, and blouses with an open back, a big bow you could obviously tug on, making the whole enchilada fall off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was very subtle back then...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was hard not to take what they said to heart, even if it didn&amp;#39;t make much sense. Mostly they got angry over &amp;quot;Fly me to San Francisco&amp;quot;, or other sexy advertisements that made them seem to be &amp;quot;sex objects&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In hot pants...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until I reached 50 that I realized,  nearly every woman over 40 would kill to be a &amp;quot;sex object&amp;quot; again.  Especially the women&amp;#39;s libbers from the 70s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got an excellent definition of the differences between men and women from a witch, and it lines up with both Cholita, and Cleargreen.  And frankly, reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a placebo for the mind, possibly from &amp;quot;the fliers&amp;quot;, to make the argument about men and women be over what job you can have, or who does the housework.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all nonsense.  It&amp;#39;s beside the point.  A distraction. More crumbs on the path of &amp;quot;happiness&amp;quot;, which actually leads the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more nitpicking inside the Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witch explained to me that men need to be slaves.  They&amp;#39;ll join a big organization and do it&amp;#39;s bidding, they&amp;#39;ll marry a beautiful woman and follow her orders about how their lives should be, they&amp;#39;ll become religious fanatics and walk around in robes, because someone else said they should do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or they&amp;#39;ll join a &amp;quot;quest for freedom&amp;quot;. Become stuffy, obsessed, &amp;quot;impeccable warriors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about what they do, and doing stuff.  And maybe a little about what other people think about them. They still want the approval from boss mommy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With women, it&amp;#39;s all about how you live. Not what you do.  That gives them an advantage over men, because they can see the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men have been enslaved by women on this planet, and from what I&amp;#39;ve seen of the inorganic beings (who are almost always female according to don Juan), female energy just does that. It dazzles male energy, in order to keep it around and utilize it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was plagued with the inorganics trying to kidnap him and bring him to their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve even been brought, although I consider it a lot of fun, and not threatening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men are slaves. But they&amp;#39;re still brutes. Being a slave to females doesn&amp;#39;t mean they won&amp;#39;t act badly.  Punch stuff, break stuff, shout loudly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They put on the gorilla display.  But the female gorilla is actually the ruler of the tribe.  The men aren&amp;#39;t their worry.  Competition from more desirable females is what they have to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women aren&amp;#39;t like men according to this witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re kingdom builders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If their kingdom is destroyed, they rebuild it from whatever is available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Isn&amp;#39;t this obvious from biology?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has rebuilt my entire house, except for my room.  She threw away all of my belongings, and bought around $50K of stuff, to make her kingdom the way she wants. Daily she expands it, until now it even fills the garage and back yard. She&amp;#39;s working on the front yard, but there&amp;#39;s conflict with neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the old woman next door left Cholita a big bag of persimmons, and 2 gift plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s been eyeing her fruit in her background, and complaining about how much is going to waste. I suspect it came to &amp;quot;words&amp;quot;, and thus the peace offerings politely set next to the entrance to the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently Cholita&amp;#39;s kingdom doesn&amp;#39;t include a party sized couch in the living room.  I had to haul it away yesterday, so Cholita could sit in meditation in an empty room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chinese bosses&amp;#39; son helped, and kept warning me not to touch the Klenix tissues stuck between the cushions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good advice.  There were a lot of hot women on that couch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t interest Cholita in shared dreaming.  But, if the kingdom is the way she likes, she&amp;#39;ll ask about shared dreaming from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I can use her energy as long as it&amp;#39;s just energy she disperses naturally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women radiate energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women: forget about &amp;quot;energy vampires&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ran into someone that advanced, you should consider an apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men &amp;quot;vampire&amp;quot; women&amp;#39;s energy mostly because they cause their internal dialogue to go nuts, trying to figure out how to dazzle and capture that man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos set Cleargreen up to be dominated by women.

Ok, some of you you might not believe this, but whatever.\n\nI live in California, and found a military base, during AP that I've never seen before in real life. I don't know if it's just an unlisted base, or I just can't find it. I tried to search for a few hours after my experience for all bases in California, but could not find this particular one. Not sure what to make of that.\n\nMiddle of a desert area. From what I could see, at least like an hour or 2 away from anything else. here's the weird thing, this base was not a typical building, or series of buildings like you'd expect. You approach this place, and the ground starts to slope downward, like a ramp, but its still just desert in front of you. Eventually, you are inside what appears to be an entrance, as if you passed right through the desert ground. Sorry if that doesn't make any sense, I'm not sure how else to describe it. It was like a dirt ramp, that appeared to lead to nothing, but if you kept going anyways, you pass through the ground, and end up in a \"check-in\" type area.\n\nThere were lots of guards, all wearing what appeared to be US military uniforms, and they all appeared to be of American nationality. I could turn around and look behind me, and see the desert, even though I was \"inside\" whatever this was. It was very brightly lit, in fact, I've never seen these types of lights before in real life, they were like a new technology or something. They were like a light blue color, and the light from them covered everything equally, like there was not just a glow around the light source, they saturated every surface with equal amount of \"light\". Maybe it wasn't light, but some kind of energy.\n\nI could see what I assumed was a large metal door in front of me, with a small circular pattern/grating on the ground in front of the door. I saw a soldier walk up ,step onto the grating, and then it started to move forward with him standing on it, and he went right through the metal door! It was like the door was made of water or something, but it was not visually disturbed, he just melted right through it, I assume to the other side. I decided to try to go through the wall myself, but not to step on the circular thing.\n\nI stepped through the wall, and had one leg on either side of it, when I felt a HUGE jolt through my entire astral body! It was like I was hit with a stun gun or something, everywhere all at once. I pulled myself through to the other side, and there was an alarm going off! I was now in a corridor with lots of boxes, equipment, some monitors and I could see communication stuff like radios and phones. All of a sudden someone appeared at the end of the hallway, and shouted \"HE'S DOWN HERE!\", while looking directly at me and pointing excitedly. I was pretty much just standing there the whole time, not sure what was happening, kind of in shock. I didn't know if this guy could really see me, or was he another Astral being? I decided not to move or say anything, and then someone grabbed me from behind very roughly, while the guy at the end of the hall was still standing there (this guy looked like a normal dude, plain clothes, no ID badge or anything like that. The guy that grabbed me was bigger than me, and was angry as hell.\n\nHe yelled at me, asking \"what the fuck are yo doing in here?\", \"how did you find this place?\". I asked him how he was able to see/touch me, and was he a real person, and he put his knee in my back and forced me down on the ground. My mind thought to fight back, but I didn't know what this was, or what he could do to me. I told him that I was Astral Projecting, and that I found this place by accident. I was pleading with him not to do anything to me, and that I would just leave and not say anything. He told me they are not only aware of AP'ing, but they employ people that can do it for their own purposes. He said that technology to disrupt/intercept AP'ing was developed after the phenomena was proven to be real. He said most civilized nations have programs involving it, and also have defenses/weapons against it. I told him about being shocked, and he said the facility had countermeasures against AP'ers entering it, and that it has happened multiple times.\n\nHe spoke to someone via radio, and then showed me a device that he was wearing on his wrist. He said the device allows a person in the physical plane, to see, and interact with someone in the astral plane. He said they also have astral \"jails\" for people that they capture that are trying to spy for foreign nations, or blackmail people of power. He said that if you are caught in your astral form, and placed into one of these containment chambers, you will NOT be able to get out, nor will you be able to return to your body, until/if they release you. He did not discuss the technology in detail, he just said he knows that it works, but not how it works. he mentioned that The President has even been trained to AP, and so are other world leaders, and they sometimes hold meetings in the astral plane.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes, he told me he was cleared to release me, I guess after checking to see who I was in real life. He told me that he would take me outside the building, and I'd be free to go, but that if I tried to return, on purpose or by accident, \"the consequences would be more severe next time.\" He told someone behind a glass window he would be right back, then led me out a door to the East of where I entered the building. Once we got outside, he let go of my arm, did something on his wrist device, and told me to leave, and that they had my \"energy signature\", so they'd know if I ever got withing a mile of the place again. I didn't ask anymore questions, and I jumped from a standstill, and was flying. It usually takes me a few jumps to fly, so this was also a surprise. Maybe he gave me some kind of boost or something, idk. I got back to my body, and where he held my arm behind me, and put his knee into my back were both sore.\n\nHow is this possible? To not only be apprehended, but PHYSICALLY hurt while AP'ing? Everyone says it's not possible, yet this happened to me. Can you die while outside your body? Is the pain not real, but just in my mind? I definitely felt the shock when I stepped through the wall. It was like what I'd imagine being in an electric chair feels like, but only lasted for a second or 2. Has anyone else gone into a base or encountered someone that could see and touch them? Should I be concerned about this spilling over into the real world? What if I'm not marked, or on some list or something..I've been stressed ever since, and paranoid as well. I even called off work the next day because I had to process what happened. I honestly am afraid to AP now, like ever again. I feel like they will be watching me now, and what if I accidentally get close to that place again, or find another place that's even worse. Imagine a foreign country's version of this...my God. What if I'd been in like Afghanistan or something, I'd probably be held captive in my Astral Form until my body died or something horrible. It never even occurred to me that if normal civilians can do this, so can anyone else, including people that work for the government. It seems they have an entire program/division dedicated to this.\"", "edited": 1580318914.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ffx622r", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a preserved version of the OP post:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.removeddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/dvxfad/i_was_physically_injured_after_being_hurt_in_the/\"&gt;https://www.removeddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/dvxfad/i_was_physically_injured_after_being_hurt_in_the/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; I typically project to places I&amp;#39;m familiar with, but on occasion, I have gone to new places, or even outside of the Earth.

At first it seems like there\u2019s a heavy load, and there\u2019s turmoil as the cart seems to be fighting captivity. But eventually the load magically becomes so light, that the participants begin to believe maybe there really is a god in there.\n\nSuch events are common at Buddhist temples in Taiwan, where underage cheerleaders in miniskirts are often part of the celebration, and \u201cInvulnerable\u201d monks allow children to toss firecrackers at them.  The firecracker vendor has a deal with the Daoist sorcerer.\n\nSorcerers go into a trance and let a demon enter their body.  But the demon can take control, and so they carry a pole covered in sharp pieces of metal, in case they have to bash themselves on the head to stop the demon from fully taking over.  They also have a little highly decorated chest they carry around in a trance.  I suspect after it travels around the room, bouncing up and down and fighting the sorcerers, another is put out to accept donations.\n\nWhile the sorcerers engaging in these actions are sometimes just looking for gainful employment, it\u2019s not always the case.  Many do indeed enter into the second attention while performing their rituals.\n\nSome of their duties include exorcisms.  In larger cities in Asia, you can often find a mini-temple on the corner, where people go to place incense to honor their ancestors, or burn cartoon money so that they have riches in the afterlife.  Objects drawn on paper, such as scissors, are often included.  You never know when you might have to take that angel\u2019s robe up an inch or two.  Fashions in heaven clearly vary.\n\nOften on the opposite corner of the block, a \"negative\" version of the temple is present. It'll be a lot smaller.  Demons exorcised from people are placed in there.\n\nIn offices, it's common to have a shrine to the ancestors.  A picture of a God, part of the Daoist \"Heiarchy of Heaven\", sits at the center.  Moon shaped wooden pieces are clanked together, while incense burns, and people ask their ancestors for good business.  If I had to guess, I'd say the wooden moon shapes are a reference to Isis, the goddess who fell from the moon.  The Chinese are said to be ancestors of the Akadians (think Conan the Barbarian), which is the likely origin of that Isis story.\n\nIf something goes wrong with the prayers at the altar, an extra ceremony to the ancestors can be used.  Food substances, alcohol, incense, and maybe even objects, are offered while everyone involved stands quietly, and a leader does the invocation to the ancestors.  Later you get to (have to) eat the food.\n\nOddly, it's worked everytime I've seen it performed.  Last time, a horribly bogus but expensive lawsuit was settled a week after the ceremony, with the suing party simply withdrawing and promising never to sue us again.\n\nZen practitioners are about as close to Carlos\u2019 style sorcerery as I\u2019ve found.  Other forms of Buddhism are difficult to categorize, because they're all so different.  Zen is a unified Japanese system, and so you can analyze what it does.\n\nI found a wonderful web page on \u201cmindfulness\u201d.  It was perhaps just wonderful to me, because it boiled everything down to the internal dialogue. Shutting it off was defined as \u201cmindfulness\u201d.\n\nI was pleased to see that one of the authors had a book entitled, \"Ending the Pursuit of Happiness: A Zen Guide.\"  If I made a similiar book, it would be entitled \"Ending the Search for Cookies\".  But it's pretty much the same idea.\n\nThere's no doubt that author can shut off his internal dialogue. You can't fake that kind of understanding.\n\nBut if they manage to shut off the internal dialogue, how come the LA Zen master for more than 50 years, told new students not to \u201cexpect to fly to the sun\u201d?  I could probably manage to fly to the sun in a few days, if I practiced that on purpose for 4 or 5 hours each time.  It just hasn\u2019t seemed like a pleasant thing to try so far.\n\nA westernized form of Zen explains how shutting off the internal dialogue can affect you.  It\u2019s an excellent explanation (wish I could find it again), because it is very clear that whoever wrote it can in fact shut off their internal dialogue.  They explain how you no longer feel impatient with the old lady in front of you in the grocery store line.\n\nThat\u2019s true.  You\u2019ll see.  But it doesn\u2019t mean your nasty personality is fixed.  Ask the monks who remember Joshu Sasaki about nasty personalities. Myself, I always liked the guy, but he\u2019d invite \u201cpointed questions\u201d, then if he actually got one he'd gasp, and still couldn\u2019t answer it.  I'm sure what was going through his mind was, \"In Japan, the monks would beat this guy after my lecture, for the nerve of asking such a question.\"\n\nAs a western Zen practitioner wrote,  about no longer being impatient with the slow old lady, \u201cBeing angry with the old woman is the same as starting a war.\u201d\n\nStarting a war??? And there\u2019s possibly why Zen doesn\u2019t assemble other worlds. They have a different intent, and it's a little bizarre and Japanesey.\n\nThe issue in all of these cases is likely \u201cintent\u201d.  If you have the intent to be a master, and you\u2019re told that makes you \u201cpure of heart\u201d, you might not notice other worlds that are available to you, from silence.  None of those, as far as I know, are \"pure of heart\".\n\nIf you want to earn your \u201cCertificate of Enlightenment\u201d, why would you play around with crazy stuff in the second attention, which might get you kicked out of the temple?  If a floating head Fairy showed up, maybe you'd get up and flush your face with cold water, and vow to stay away from saffron in curry too late in the evening.\n\nIf you earn a living having children toss firecrackers at you,  \u2026   Well, it\u2019s just not the same intent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: five times", "edited": 1560902680.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_erhhawj", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the top picture, you have a crowd of people \u201cmoving a god\u201d statue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The experience activates the second attention in the participants.

Other forms of Buddhism are difficult to categorize, because they&amp;#39;re all so different.  Zen is a unified Japanese system, and so you can analyze what it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a wonderful web page on \u201cmindfulness\u201d.  It was perhaps just wonderful to me, because it boiled everything down to the internal dialogue. Shutting it off was defined as \u201cmindfulness\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to see that one of the authors had a book entitled, &amp;quot;Ending the Pursuit of Happiness: A Zen Guide.&amp;quot;  If I made a similiar book, it would be entitled &amp;quot;Ending the Search for Cookies&amp;quot;.  But it&amp;#39;s pretty much the same idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no doubt that author can shut off his internal dialogue. You can&amp;#39;t fake that kind of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they manage to shut off the internal dialogue, how come the LA Zen master for more than 50 years, told new students not to \u201cexpect to fly to the sun\u201d?  I could probably manage to fly to the sun in a few days, if I practiced that on purpose for 4 or 5 hours each time.  It just hasn\u2019t seemed like a pleasant thing to try so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A westernized form of Zen explains how shutting off the internal dialogue can affect you.  It\u2019s an excellent explanation (wish I could find it again), because it is very clear that whoever wrote it can in fact shut off their internal dialogue.  They explain how you no longer feel impatient with the old lady in front of you in the grocery store line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s true.  You\u2019ll see.  But it doesn\u2019t mean your nasty personality is fixed.  Ask the monks who remember Joshu Sasaki about nasty personalities. Myself, I always liked the guy, but he\u2019d invite \u201cpointed questions\u201d, then if he actually got one he&amp;#39;d gasp, and still couldn\u2019t answer it.  I&amp;#39;m sure what was going through his mind was, &amp;quot;In Japan, the monks would beat this guy after my lecture, for the nerve of asking such a question.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a western Zen practitioner wrote,  about no longer being impatient with the slow old lady, \u201cBeing angry with the old woman is the same as starting a war.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting a war??? And there\u2019s possibly why Zen doesn\u2019t assemble other worlds. They have a different intent, and it&amp;#39;s a little bizarre and Japanesey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue in all of these cases is likely \u201cintent\u201d.  If you have the intent to be a master, and you\u2019re told that makes you \u201cpure of heart\u201d, you might not notice other worlds that are available to you, from silence.  None of those, as far as I know, are &amp;quot;pure of heart&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to earn your \u201cCertificate of Enlightenment\u201d, why would you play around with crazy stuff in the second attention, which might get you kicked out of the temple?  If a floating head Fairy showed up, maybe you&amp;#39;d get up and flush your face with cold water, and vow to stay away from saffron in curry too late in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you earn a living having children toss firecrackers at you,  \u2026   Well, it\u2019s just not the same intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: five times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c242rw/intent_gone_astray/erhhawj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1560875344.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_c242rw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}]

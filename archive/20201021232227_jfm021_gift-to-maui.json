The\n\nfollowing were added, but perhaps not all from LA were included).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm roll:  Roll right arm through entire swing back to front, going\n\nforward over the top.  Use the shoulder to move it.  Swing 10 times or\n\nmore, then reverse direction.  Then do left arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShoulder breath: Palms up at waist, crossed, like holding baby.  Out and\n\nup.  Use shoulder ligaments only to push air out.  Stomach relaxed if\n\npossible.  As arms move up and inhale, all the way out and in to palms\n\nout, thumbs down 2\" apart.  Push forward with palms almost extended but\n\nelbow stays bent a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpynx breath:  Arms at side, palms back.  Swing in to stomach with\n\narms crossed, but then lift up over head and then down to sides with\n\npalms down but retracted like a karate move. Inhale the whole time, fully.\n\nThen exhale while pushing hands out, palms down, like the spynx.  Stomach\n\nout, get real fat.  Look between hands while it happens.\n\nFluidity foot: Modified from LA.  Witches explained in Colorado that all\n\nworkshops were different as a sign to IT.  In Maui, the foot never\n\nleaves the ground.  Instead, after the pass you pick it up at the Knee,\n\nreturn it to the other foot, lift the leg up high and drop gently back\n\nto the position about 1.5 feet in front.  Then angle foot in as before\n\nand count to 10.  Do perhaps 5 on each foot.  Point the toes at particular\n\nstars, like Orion to connect with their energy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOpening a window for abstract energy:\n\nGift to Maui pass.  Stand erect, look down between feet, count to\n\n6 while ball of energy forms.  Look way down.  Eyes attach to ball.\n\nLift head to attach the ball to your chest, lowering it again to look\n\nat your chest.  Then raise head and look way up so that the ball can\n\nrise.  Count to 6.  Do right karate inside palm edge strike with left\n\narm retracting, then do left.  This opens a hatch.  Raise right hand too\n\nto grab the hatch.  rotate left, right, left, right, left, right.\n\nGo back to center.  This opens the hatch.  Pull it down but keep looking\n\nup, hands go to side and then let go. Send ball into infinity with gaze,\n\ncount to 6.  Then lower head and look down, opening the hole in the back\n\nof the neck.  Count to 6 as ball falls and splashes onto neck.  Lift and\n\ninhale shoulders 3 times.  Raise arms and head to close hatch by\n\nrotating in the reverse direction from last time.  Start right and do\n\nthe 6 rotations.  Bring arms and head down, then raise and lower head to\n\nunhook the energy to chest.  Stare down for count of 6 to send the ball\n\ndown into infinity.  Hands at side.  Fan fingers then do 3 gill breaths by\n\nlifting the wrists to parallel to the ground with fingers extended while\n\nbreathing.  But arms stay straight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe shake was done and it was said that Emilito disappeared before Taisha's\n\neyes while doing the shake which gives control over to the energy body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this workshop, it was said that all passes from the video 1 should\n\nbe practiced every day.  And emphasis was made on pulling the energy\n\nhole down and back when doing the \"reaching the energy hole above\n\nthe head\" pass.  It was also stated that when the palms open to touch\n\nthe thighs you are exchanging the energy you pulled down with personal\n\nhistory which is usually stored in the legs.  You then thrust it away\n\ninto infinity with both the arms, eyes gazing up, and stomach.  Hold\n\nwhile it flies away, but break gaze quickly at end to avoid bringing\n\nit back.  On ball of energy,  the initial movement where right hand is on\n\ntop in the video and switches to left hand on top for preparation of\n\nholding ball was done on each of the three sets instead of just the\n\nfirst.  Extra breaths were added both during the pass to gather energy\n\nfrom stars (do 5 at top instead of just 3 in video) and on the one\n\nto move the terminal from the ground.  Do 5 at bottom (is video 3?).\n\nOn the part where hand is to mouth exhaling at top, do an extra inhale\n\nand exhale before thrusting it up.  And break the gaze quickly there\n\ntoo to avoid pulling terminal downwards.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Gift to Maui", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_jfm021", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1603315613.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1603315347.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is already in the wiki somewhere, but it&amp;#39;s always intrigued me no end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s teleportation!

I still try to remote view Cholita at least a while each night, because of how wonderfully that worked before I told Cholita and she &amp;quot;reversed the charges&amp;quot; on me.  She blocked it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gazing at her, her eyes lifted up and obviously noticed me off in the distance, her eyes got angry, and the &amp;quot;tunnel&amp;quot; zipped shut.  From her side.  Rudely I might add, like she slammed a door on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is a door slammer for sure.  She probably even invokes intent that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t tell people about magical stuff they become involved in,  unless you have a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes straight to their dreaming double, which can block you if it wants to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, if I get Fancy in the middle, between me and Cholita, she can&amp;#39;t block it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy opens up a tunnel from where I am, to where Cholita is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pink, oddly.

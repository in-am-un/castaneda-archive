It's a very easy way to enter dreams as long as you can see them clearly in the darkness. \n\nWhen the assemblage point moves at least to the red zone, dreams can float in the air like bubbles or windows.\n\nYou find some element of the dream bubble that's \"cozy\" or feels \"familiar\".\n\nConcentrate on that, and you zip right into the dream!  Could be you need an inorganic watching, to supply \"dark energy\".\n\nBut I think not, once you understand how it works.    Something you can easily learn at the 1st gate in \"Art of Dreaming\".\n\nForget about past that gate.  You can't get there.  You're deluding yourself if you want to learn sorcery with 4 gates dreaming.  You  didn't study enough.  You can't reach the second gate, without learning deep internal silence.  It's just not possible. And since in 57 years no one has done it, you might want to try waking dreaming first.  Darkroom gazing.\n\nWhere you only get waking dreams through silence.\n\nWhen awake, you can enter the dreams offered to you in the darkness just by gazing into them.\n\nAnd you can return by simply turning your head \"back towards your darkroom\".\n\nOn a good night, you can zip in and out of as many as 5 dreams, over the course of a few minutes, before you \"get noticed\".  Then the course is interrupted by outside entities.\n\nBut it still takes me hours to get to Silent Knowledge and it's only there that I can remote view at will.\n\nAnd by the time I get there my dreaming energy is nearly used up.\n\nSo I looked up \"desperate\" in the books, seeming to remember that the old seers had the same problem.\n\nI wanted to see if they had any ideas, other than cannibalism.\n\nDidn't find it.  That's the problem with searches of the collected books.  Any mistake in the choice of words and you don't get what you wanted.  Worse, the formatting in our copy is still not perfect.  Not all words are searchable.\n\nBut here's some interesting passages which came up.\n\nUseful to the advanced.\n\nBut also useful to beginners, so that they realize we aren't pretending here!\n\nIt's real.\n\nElsewhere, people are mostly just trying to figure out how to keep those clown pants from falling down.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhat about the other two girls? Where do they fit?\"\n\n\"A year later Elena came. She is la Gorda. She was by far in the worst condition you could imagine. She weighed two hundred and twenty pounds. She was a desperate woman. Pablito had given her shelter in his shop. She did laundry and ironing to support herself.\n\n\"The Nagual came one night to get Pablito, and found the fat girl working while a circle of moths flew over her head. He said that the moths had made a perfect circle for him to watch. He saw that the woman was near the end of her life, yet the moths must have had all the confidence in the world in order for them to give him such an omen. The Nagual acted fast and took her with him.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next day we arranged a time for another session of dreaming together. She started from her bedroom and I from my study, but nothing happened. We became exhausted merely trying to enter into dreaming. For weeks after that we tried to achieve again the effectiveness of our first performance, but without any success. With every failure we became more desperate and greedy.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nZuleica said that first of all I had to perfect my command of moving at will. She began her instruction by directing me time and time again to open my eyes while I was in a state of restful vigil. It took a great deal of effort for me to do it.\n\nOne time my eyes opened suddenly and I saw Zuleica looming over me. I was lying down but I could not determine where. The light was extremely bright as if I were just underneath a powerful electric bulb, but the light was not shining directly on my eyes. I could see Zuleica without any effort.\n\nShe ordered me to stand up by willing my movement. She said that I had to push myself up with my midsection, that I had three thick tentacles there which I could use as crutches to lift up my whole body.\n\nI tried every conceivable way to get up. I failed. I had a sensation of despair and physical anguish reminiscent of nightmares I used to have as a child in which I was unable to wake up and yet I was fully awake desperately trying to scream.\n\nZuleica finally spoke to me. She said that I had to follow a certain sequence, and that it was wasteful and downright dumb of me to fret and get agitated as if I were dealing with the world of everyday life.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHe affirmed that one of the most important breakthroughs for the new seers was to find that the spot where that point is located on the cocoon of all living creatures is not a permanent feature. It is established on that specific spot by habit. Hence the tremendous stress the new seers put on new actions, on new practicalities. They want desperately to arrive at new usages, new habits.\n\n\"The nagual's blow is of great importance,\" he went on, \"because it makes that point move. It alters its location. Sometimes it even creates a permanent crevice there and the assemblage point is totally dislodged; and awareness changes dramatically.\n\n\"However, a matter of even greater importance is to properly understand the truths about awareness in order to realize that the assemblage point can be moved from within.\n\n\"The unfortunate truth is that human beings always lose by default. They simply don't know about their possibilities.\"\n\n\"How can one accomplish that change from within?\" I asked.\n\n\"The new seers say that realization is the technique,\" he said. \"They say that, first of all, one must become aware that the world we perceive is the result of our assemblage points' being located on a specific spot on the cocoon. Once that is understood, the assemblage point can move almost at will as a consequence of new habits.\"\n\nI did not quite understand what he meant by habits. I asked him to clarify his point.\n\n\"The assemblage point of man,\" he said, \"appears around a definite area of the cocoon because the Eagle commands it. But the precise spot is determined by habit; by repetitious acts.\n\n\"First we learn that it can be placed there and then we ourselves command it to be there. Our command becomes the Eagle's command and the assemblage point becomes fixated at that spot.\n\n\"Consider this very carefully; our command becomes the Eagle's command. The old seers paid dearly for that finding. We'll come back to that later on.\"\n\nHe stated once again that the old seers had concentrated exclusively on developing thousands of the most complex techniques of sorcery. He added that what they never realized was that their intricate devices, as bizarre as they were, had no other value than being the means to break the fixation of their assemblage points and make them move.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"What does it mean to be mesmerized by detail?\"\n\n\"The energy body is like a child who's been imprisoned all its life. The moment it is free, it soaks up everything it can find, and I mean everything. Every irrelevant, minute detail totally absorbs the energy body.\"\n\nAn awkward silence followed. I had no idea what to say. I had understood him perfectly, I just didn't have anything in my experience to give me an idea of exactly what it all meant.\n\n\"The most asinine detail becomes a world for the energy body,\" don Juan explained. \"The effort that dreamers have to make to direct the energy body is staggering. I know that it sounds awkward to tell you to view things with care and curiosity, but that is the best way to describe what you should do. At the third gate, dreamers have to avoid a nearly irresistible impulse to plunge into everything, and they avoid it by being so curious, so desperate to get into everything that they don't let any particular thing imprison them.\"\n\nDon Juan added that his recommendations, which he knew sounded absurd to the mind, were directly aimed at my energy body. He stressed over and over that my energy body had to unite all its resources in order to act.\n\n\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\"Desperate\"", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 114, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"8awp1arto5a91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 88, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8awp1arto5a91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4838a5f0312be3f2acfe220f5376c4d1c23fb73f"}, {"y": 176, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8awp1arto5a91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d09d9c199b1353410caad738ee02fb3e85bf0aa7"}, {"y": 261, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8awp1arto5a91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0d1aa2c390684341aff86ae3801c6e7a2af944c"}, {"y": 523, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8awp1arto5a91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=713ab31665270685236fa3bbff591967442b11d5"}], "s": {"y": 745, "x": 910, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8awp1arto5a91.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=189d2b1859b42a82567131e27dfae29d85c261dc"}, "id": "8awp1arto5a91"}}, "name": "t3_vtjwgd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/InKPcz55iicUurP7Hys1Es54K7uJuCtdXq13QGCZ2QU.jpg", "edited": 1657204371.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657203914.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8awp1arto5a91.png?width=910&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=189d2b1859b42a82567131e27dfae29d85c261dc\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8awp1arto5a91.png?width=910&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=189d2b1859b42a82567131e27dfae29d85c261dc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit &amp;quot;desperate&amp;quot; for more waking dreaming energy lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to remote view through my 6000 mile energy tunnel, so I can clearly see the other side and &amp;quot;zip&amp;quot; into there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy, my Ally,  taught it to me.

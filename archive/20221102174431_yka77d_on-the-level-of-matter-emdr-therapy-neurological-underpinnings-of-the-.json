A neuroscience explanation (follows).\n\nWhen we experience something overwhelming and relive the traumatic event there is reduced control of the pre-frontal cortex over the activated amygdala and hippocampus (the amygdala and hippocampus become overstimulated). In other words, when you are triggered, the rational thinking part of your brain can\u2019t control the emotional part of your brain. This is why when you get triggered, you can\u2019t think and you feel overwhelmed.\n\n**Traumatic memories are \u201cstuck\u201d in the amygdala-hippocampal complex and when triggered, they seem to occur in the present.** **\u201cStuck\u201d memories are thought to be unprocessed memories.**\n\nDuring sleep, we process and consolidate memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex. Normal, less traumatic memories, don\u2019t become \u201cstuck\u201d, because at night when we dream (Rapid Eye Movement or REM phase), these are moved out of the amygdala-hippocampal complex and processed by the rest of the brain. This is one of the reasons we feel so much better after a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\n**Neuroscientists propose that what happens during REM (dream) sleep happens during EMDR.**\n\nDuring EMDR, therapists move your eyes from side to side whilst getting you to focus on a fragmented traumatic memory or emotion. Much like when your eyes move side to side when you dream (alternately tapping on your legs or shoulders is used when outside the therapists office).\n\nEEG tracings show that the eye movements (much like in REM sleep) elicit a synchronization of all cortical activity at a frequency in the delta range like slow-wave sleep. EMDR temporarily slows your over-stimulated amygdala down and synchronizes your brain waves helping you process the traumatic memory.\n\nThis suggests that during EMDR therapy the traumatic memories are continuously \u201creactivated, replayed and encoded into existing memory networks\u201d. In other words,\u00a0 EMDR helps traumatic memories become \u201cunstuck\u201d and processed like normal, less traumatic memories.\n\nTo [quote the article](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/295202/fpsyg-08-01935-HTML/image_m/fpsyg-08-01935-g001.jpg):\n\n\u201cIn fact, we posit that bilateral stimulation mimics the low-frequency stimulation typical of SWS (slow-wave sleep), inducing a depotentiation of the AMPA receptors of amygdalar synapses, which in turn lead to a weakening of the traumatic memory. This reduction of the over-potentiation of amygdalar synapses makes traumatic memory more accessible, and facilitates the connection between emotional memory and episodic memory, thus promoting a shift of memory to associative and neocortical areas.\u201d\n\nEMDR bilateral stimulation (moving your eyes **(or head!)** side to side) **rapidly mimics slow-wave sleep**, **calming the amygdala and allowing it to synchronise with the rest of the brain.

Can't post most to the beginner's subreddit.\n\nFor instance, I found a way to make my phantom room very very real, using the purple zone on the J curve.\n\nAnd my entity \"Mystery\" decided I needed an armchair in the corner.  So she materialized floating on Cholita's favorite armchair, from the living room.\n\nGuided it to fall from the air as I watched, clear as anything, and set it into the south west corner of the room where Cholita likes to make appearances.\n\nMystery was a gift from Cholita, so she's still indebted to her in some weird way.\n\nIt's like Cholita gave Mystery her favorite pet lapdog (me).  So even though Cholita and her don't interact at all, she still remembers where she got her fun human pet.  Mystery seems to be far too old to go around hunting out humans. But she's happy to have one around while she rests.

In fact, I even forgot that armchair existed.  \n\nShe has it just for decoration in one part of the living room I don't pay attention to. Three decorative pillows sit on it, so that it's barely noticeable.\n\nYet, Cholita decided to move it to a temporary location.\n\nIt was as if she were reciprocating the offer she hadn't actually seen, which only took place in my own phantom copy of the  house.\n\nI just can't post stuff like that in here.  \n\nIt's like telling little kids there's a huge bowl of candy waiting for when they finish their real dinner.\n\nThey'll sneak off to eat that instead.\n\nWe're still arguing in here about whether \"Astral travel\" and \"Magick\" are valid \"paths\".\n\nWith tantrums and exploding heads resulting.\n\nWe REALLY need a \"road trip\" into the heart of magic land, but this subreddit is only for a car wash before the journey.\n\nFortunately, Techno raises an intriguing point here.\n\nOnce you can visibly see the emanations you start to realize, if you could spread which ones are active over just 1 inch in space, you could reshape reality in a subtle way.\n\nReality really is just which emanations are glowing.\n\nAnd those can be altered.\n\nNow, there's the crappy issue of \"physical matter\".\n\nSo we don't have infinite power.\n\nBut that's not outside the emanations!\n\nIt's just a different \"band\" of them.\n\nAnd it also vanishes, when you move your assemblage point.\n\nIt's just that we have our tonal awareness stuck in our \"energy pouches\".\n\nIn the internal organs.\n\nDoesn't have to be!  In fact we didn't start that way.\n\nAnd we don't understand why, but newly formed \"beings\" who are just bubbles of awareness, tend to pick a physical world, and \"take a birth\".\n\nOnce you live in there  while, you have endless attachments to the history and memories of it.\n\nYou have millions of tiny strings tying you to that.\n\nA few, and maybe you could escape.\n\nBut we have MILLIONS.\n\nWe try to recapitulate what we can, but the physical attachments just aren't broken that easily.\n\nThat doesn't mean solid matter is \"outside the emanations\".\n\nJust that we can't escape it yet.\n\nIn the books it says that a Nagual who can look in the mirror of the second attention, can \"almost\" vanish as if he had no physical matter.\n\nOr something to that extent.\n\nBut not completely.\n\nWhich is why the old seers \"buried\" their physical matter. And then extracted as much of their awareness from it as possible, to go live as phantoms with no body.\n\nSome turned themselves into trees, hoping to keep their physical matter safe that way, for a few thousands years.\n\nThe oldest \"beings\" in the world are only a short 100 miles from where Carlos lived.\n\nA few 5000 year old trees up in the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nI have to wonder \"who\" those really are.\n\nAt don Juan's compound, they transplanted some old seer trees to take with them when they left.\n\nBut in the end, we can't escape that physical matter without figuring out how to find a \"new container\" for our awareness.\n\nYou can go to the IOB realm for 5 million years. They can stave off \"the rolling force\" so that your shell doesn't break open, and you die.\n\nThe old seer who now inhabits Carol Tiggs, found a way to \"seal\" his gap with energy given to him by new Naguals.  But clearly he's lost his physical matter, or he wouldn't need to use Carol to contain his awareness.\n\nI'm off topic now, but want to finish this line of thought.\n\nALL of you get to see this. There are NO SACRED SCROLLS in sorcery.\n\nNothing to learn.  Noting to \"pass down from on high\". Nothing you can ponder, and become so \"wise\" you understand it.\n\nThere are no \"wise monk\" jobs in sorcery.\n\nIt's all automatic if you move your assemblage point.  In fact, all the knowledge that ever was or ever could be for humans,  is there for us in Silent Knowledge.\n\nI use it nightly for amazingly fun activities.\n\nBut you DO have to learn to move that assemblage point.  You just can't get out of that by trying to memorize facts in here, and \"learn\" sorcery.\n\nIt'll just turn you into a \"bad player\".\n\nSo what I was getting to.\n\nWe want to SUCCEED.\n\nBut Soledad, the old witch from Julian's lineage,  didn't see much hope to do that.\n\nInstead, she seems to have decided to manipulate the emanations.\n\nTo \"add\" to some range of the bundle glowing with awareness, and subtract from the other part.\n\nJust \"move it over\" a bit into a less awful place.\n\nShe did it through movies.\n\nLike Star Wars.\n\nWe may not think that could do anything, but that's because we believe physical matter is the truth of it all.\n\nWhen really, that stuff is not real.\n\nWhat's real is, when you look out at the world which feelings echo back from the emanations.\n\nOr reality is like the echo of a radar signal, bouncing back to us to make those dots on the screen. So you see what airplanes are out there.\n\nCholita once showed this to me visually. Showed me her own awareness radiating into the environment, illuminating objects.\n\nQuite a sight that was!\n\nAnd you'll get to learn to see that too.  Visibly.\n\nNow, how is it that Cholita mocks me so?\n\nWith that Chair.\n\nI wish I knew.\n\nCholita may have gotten exposed to Soledad's generation, through Carlos.\n\nI'm not sure she's even aware of it though.\n\nThere's literally no way to ask her.

In fact, all the knowledge that ever was or ever could be for humans,  is there for us in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use it nightly for amazingly fun activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you DO have to learn to move that assemblage point.  You just can&amp;#39;t get out of that by trying to memorize facts in here, and &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll just turn you into a &amp;quot;bad player&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what I was getting to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to SUCCEED.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Soledad, the old witch from Julian&amp;#39;s lineage,  didn&amp;#39;t see much hope to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, she seems to have decided to manipulate the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To &amp;quot;add&amp;quot; to some range of the bundle glowing with awareness, and subtract from the other part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just &amp;quot;move it over&amp;quot; a bit into a less awful place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did it through movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We may not think that could do anything, but that&amp;#39;s because we believe physical matter is the truth of it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When really, that stuff is not real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s real is, when you look out at the world which feelings echo back from the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or reality is like the echo of a radar signal, bouncing back to us to make those dots on the screen. So you see what airplanes are out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita once showed this to me visually. Showed me her own awareness radiating into the environment, illuminating objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite a sight that was!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll get to learn to see that too.  Visibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, how is it that Cholita mocks me so?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that Chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita may have gotten exposed to Soledad&amp;#39;s generation, through Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure she&amp;#39;s even aware of it though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s literally no way to ask her.

No wonder Genaro liked to fart!](https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abe55e3429bfd43d56ba34dff2738af8c96f6259)\n\nSilent knowledge (orange zone) is very annoying.\n\nJust when you get to the fun stuff, you start *knowing* things.\n\nAmazing things!  So amazing, you just HAVE to tell them to others.\n\nAnd that's the first problem:  Silent Knowledge causes the book deal mind.\n\nAnd the book deal mind is very bad for learning.\n\nBefore you start thinking, \"But Carlos loved silent knowledge, so it **must** be a great thing!\"\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nWe're lost.  Trying to find our way down the Olmec path.  With no guide.\n\nCarlos was up to his ears in guides!\n\nSo for him, silent knowledge was an opportunity to have a deeper discussion with don Juan.\n\nFor us, it's a potential to lose something that feels valuable.\n\nYou know you're not going to remember some of these \"insights\".  They're applicable to a specific position of the assemblage point.  When that's gone, they don't make sense anymore.  I don't mean they aren't true and useful anymore.  It's just that you can't find a context to explain them.\n\nBest analogy: You're at Disneyland looking at the lame sleeping beauty castle in the middle. Its only purpose is to sell kids cheap hats with Disney figures on them, for high prices.  The family just arrived and hasn't blown all their spending money yet. So the castle's real purpose is to sell the least expensive merchandise, for the highest prices.\n\nI suspect every parent secretly dreads that castle.  To make matters worse, they put a bunch of bathrooms there, to get you to return as much as possible.\n\nYou comment to a friend:  But the duck pond is amazing!  The architect was a genius!\n\nIf you're standing next to the churro cart at the front of that castle, it makes sense.\n\nIf you've never been to Disneyland, it's jibberish.\n\nSilent Knowledge is like that.\n\nMakes sense when you can perceive the thing it's about, but none if you are back at the blue line on the J curve.\n\nHere's some amazing silent knowledge,  for a specific example!  But it won't mean much to people.  You have to be seeing energy before it makes you excited.\n\nWomen are completely different than men for learning sorcery.\n\nIn the deep orange zone, anything  you think causes a video to play around you.  But since you have no more concept of \"self\", you're just sort of integrated with that ability.  You ponder something, and up comes an educational video on the topic. It's somewhere between a daydream, and an actual video on a giant screen, hanging on the wall.\n\nYou could make it go either way. Inside, or outside you and so real it looks like electronics.\n\nExcept you don't care at all.\n\nMakes perfect sense as you watch it.  Makes very little sense later.\n\nYour head is spinning with the revelations!  Later when you think about it, you can't figure out what you were going on about.\n\n\"Rosebud??!!?    What the heck does that mean?\"\n\nIn the case of women being different, it's because when in a location they *feel* what that place is like. They check out the potential for self-soothing.  A side effect of their assemblage points sliding sideways and making them moody.\n\nAnd possibly there's a biological motive for that.  Make sure the environment is safe for the female population of the tribe.\n\nAs the witches have explained, men are like a funnel with the larger end on their face, and them looking through that tiny tube at the bottom.\n\nLooking for something to use as a weapon?\n\nWomen are like looking through the small bottom of the funnel, out the larger side.\n\nSucking up the entire view of the environment.\n\nThey see more than men, but not as much about how to use individual pieces.\n\nBut inside,  my theory is that they're rating \"smelly bath with candles\", relaxing potential.\n\nCholita likes those.  With a glass of rose.\n\nThey tend to see how they can integrate their feeling into that environment, and rearrange or sort their daily life to fit best in there.  A lifestyle.\n\nMen are looking for something to exploit.  They're focused on the things available there, more than the place itself.\n\nI'll go a step further.  Men are red zone creatures.  Looking do to \"practical magic\" they can use on their enemies.\n\nWomen love practical magic!  But they're orange zone creatures.  Knowledge is what they're after, so that they can manipulate things.\n\nThe insights you get in the orange zone may not seem so \"knowledgeable\" when you leave it, but when there you get a little show, floating in the air. Last night I saw \"proof\" over and over that women have a huge advantage in the orange zone. The proof  used examples of male and female behavior.\n\nNow in particular, the advantage women have is that the orange zone itself is a \"feeling\", more than an accomplishment.\n\nIf you can still \"feel it\", you will retain it.  If you have to resort to the technique you used to get there, you'll slip back to the red zone.\n\nAnd women are the masters of the type of feeling that holds you in the orange zone.  You just \"be\" it.  Soothe and relax in it.\n\nThe men not so much.  The orange zone is in fact,  sort of vague.\n\nTo break the \"vague\" issue you have to switch to the double.  I suppose, once you get to the double, the male/female differences are mostly gone.  So as you approach the purple zone at the end of the J curve, maybe men and women are on equal ground.\n\nLet's take another example.  Tensegrity.\n\nOne thing becomes absolutely obvious when silent knowledge is available, if you know as many passes as Carlos taught us.  If you only know a few, it won't be obvious.\n\nSome passes are blue zone, some green zone, some red zone, and some orange zone.\n\nIf someone would study that and make a list to use as you go along in darkroom, we could greatly speed up and also \"refine\" that movement of the assemblage point.\n\nBut you'd have to be able to see energy to do that.  Guessing wouldn't go well.\n\nExample: mashing energy is blue zone.  Because it's stirs up nothingness from off the floor.  You start out with no colors, nothing to see here, and you try to stomp them to appear.  A yellow dust cloud slowly forms from the mashing.\n\nIt's ideal blue zone tensegrity.\n\nBut unbending intent long form, around 5:22, shows how you gaze up to find a puff of color and then jump up and pull it down.\n\nYou'll have to copy and paste this and remove the spaces, if you want to see the video. If I don't break it up that picture is substituted for my sneeze pic.\n\n[www](http://www).   youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s\n\nThat's a green zone activity.  Could be used in red too, but you're trying to build up your energy body while in the green zone. So you need to see puffs up there, even if barely visible.  And green zone is when they are first viewable.\n\nIf you were in deep red zone, it would be a little silly.  Deep red zone is swimming in brilliant colors.  You couldn't isolate a single puff if you had to. It would be like trying to pull a piece of taffy out of a pot filled with molten taffy waiting to be poured and stretched.\n\nRed zone passes are the most convoluted. Those are easy to spot.  Look for the long forms that do bizarre things, like focus balls of light on the floor, and try to make them float up to eye level, then up to infinity.\n\nThere are plenty of passes like that, which seem to be \"doing something\", but it's too weird to understand.\n\nThose are pure red zone.  They'd be impossible at the blue zone, because there's nothing to see there.\n\nIn the green zone they could also be done, but the result would be to push you to the red, due to all the \"treating something as real\" effects, which cause fine horizontal shifting.\n\nThe red zone passes that seem to be \"doing something\" could also be used in the deep orange zone, where dreams materialize as needed. You might get to see **precisely** what the creators had in mind!\n\nBut you'd get sucked back to the \"pink\" zone.  That's where you're in the orange zone, but summoning red zone magic. It can quickly decay to pure red zone, putting you at risk of getting stuck in the future.\n\nOrange zone passes should be very simple.  They purpose of those is to shock or alter how the body feels.  The results play around you, like changing the channel on a TV.\n\n\"Running Man series\", where you do foot movements on the bed, while sitting up or laying down, are perfect examples of orange zone passes.  You'd do those when you were getting sleepy, while remote viewing (\"reading infinity\").  They \"stir\" you a bit, so you don't zone out.\n\nPressing on the top of the head is another good example. It produces tingles up your body, starting at the ground.\n\nAnything like that, in the deep orange zone, alters all of reality around you, in visible waves.\n\nTry sneezing in deep orange zone and you'll see something that looks like a scene out of a war.\n\nBlasts and clouds of burning gasses, filled with orbs, and mostly in pink.\n\nWhen the explosion clears you'll possibly be in another place. Fully translocated by the blast.\n\nBut orange zone passes are blue zone compatible.  Because they manipulate subtle energies. That might help get you calmer,  less ME obsessed, so that you can escape the blue zone.  Perhaps they \"center\" you horizontally.\n\nThe orange zone can also be a mental trap that prevents moving further towards the purple.\n\nLet's say you had a huge silent knowledge realization there, and thought  you could remember this and tell people the next day.\n\nNow you're REALLY in trouble.\n\nBecause you'll check to make sure you remember what it is you believe you can remember.\n\nAnd every tiny aspect of that thing suddenly brings up further details to \"prove\" that point, floating in the air around you.\n\nNone of which you'll have any chance of remembering.\n\nJust wondering what to remember makes it so complicated, it's impossible you will.\n\nWe read about that in one of the books when Don Juan and Silvio pushed Carlos into the orange zone, and took him out to eat.\n\nJust to see if he could eat.\n\nAt one point they asked him if he understood what intent is, and he was sure at that moment that he did. But as he thought about how to explain it, he could not. He just kept, \"knowing\" more and more things, none of which allowed him to communicate what he knew.\n\nI believe he said, he ended up going around in circles in his mind.\n\nPart of silent knowledge is to realize its hopeless to try to pass it on.\n\nBecause even considering what to say to convey it, brings up \"examples\" around you.\n\nYou'll see how angry book deal visitors to this sub would react. Perhaps bad player #28.  How he'd twist the idea around to make himself seem more knowledgeable, so that all value from the knowledge was lost.\n\nIf you thought to  yourself, \"But he's a bad guy.  Who cares?\"\n\nThen you'll get a video about a good guy, who obeys and copies everything he hears, trying to please. He's so eager to understand and pick up an advantage, that you realize he'll simply distract himself again, expecting rewards, and his practice will be hurt.\n\nBut there must be a guy who can receive what feels like amazing Orange zone revelations!\n\nSo up comes a video of that guy.  The guy who's doing well in the darkroom.\n\nTurns out, he doesn't need it.  If he did understand you'd only \"break\" his flow of intent.  For example, if he was just about to learn to open real portals on the walls and enter them, you'd be tossing a firecracker into there, causing that process to end.\n\nIt's like asking the Devil's Weed ceremony lizard a different question, when it's sitting on  your shoulder giving you the original answer you were seeking.\n\nIt stops talking.\n\nSo are we the only ones doomed not to be able to profit fully from silent knowledge, due to not having a real lineage surrounding us?\n\nNo.\n\nIn fact, don Juan didn't seem to get much from it either.  Certainly his training of Carlos and the apprentices was a disaster.  Even Silvio Manuel's silent knowledge didn't uncover their seeing mistakes.\n\nThey had to reclassify the basic \"'type\" of both Carlos and La Gorda. A huge blunder.\n\nAt one point, which I'll never find again from the books, I believe don Juan even justifies this by saying, what you see is always true. It's absolute.\n\nBut then he explains how it fails in practice anyway.\n\nIt's true, but not always useful.\n\nHere's my prediction.\n\nThe lineages got a bit stuffy.  Too big for their own britches.\n\nThey had a \"mood\".  A very serious mood.\n\nThat got passed on to Carlos and the witches.\n\nThey're very serious!\n\nFrankly, it's not ideal for our situation.\n\nIt just feeds  the book deal mind of people who can't move their assemblage points.\n\nHaving \"the mood of a warrior\" might be good when you get to the red zone and beyond.\n\nBut in the blue zone, it's a real stumbling block.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Annoyance of Silent Knowledge", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"wsn5mrym9gt71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e6700b0ee03ea952d715548e16bffcbff2fa68a"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de701effea254deafe4fc02839ceca61f39e9d95"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7484f1122d351503fcbb66bc530cc64302dd5412"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99ccb6dd4c6be52477a2c62f5af19d98f3179f64"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0b5d5822397b0c1c4b1b6f9b89d4ac6181a90d7"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ec6724fe433554a5d4e9fde9d2f47a347a619e8"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abe55e3429bfd43d56ba34dff2738af8c96f6259"}, "id": "wsn5mrym9gt71"}}, "name": "t3_q7x1sk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/u8Ae_DxUMGyHqGt2k6FXouvFv61z9ACbMDVnZKHJkb8.jpg", "edited": 1634249350.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1634207939.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wsn5mrym9gt71.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=abe55e3429bfd43d56ba34dff2738af8c96f6259\"&gt;Silent Knowledge sneezes are rough.

Look for the long forms that do bizarre things, like focus balls of light on the floor, and try to make them float up to eye level, then up to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of passes like that, which seem to be &amp;quot;doing something&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s too weird to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are pure red zone.  They&amp;#39;d be impossible at the blue zone, because there&amp;#39;s nothing to see there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the green zone they could also be done, but the result would be to push you to the red, due to all the &amp;quot;treating something as real&amp;quot; effects, which cause fine horizontal shifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The red zone passes that seem to be &amp;quot;doing something&amp;quot; could also be used in the deep orange zone, where dreams materialize as needed. You might get to see &lt;strong&gt;precisely&lt;/strong&gt; what the creators had in mind!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;d get sucked back to the &amp;quot;pink&amp;quot; zone.  That&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;re in the orange zone, but summoning red zone magic. It can quickly decay to pure red zone, putting you at risk of getting stuck in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Orange zone passes should be very simple.  They purpose of those is to shock or alter how the body feels.  The results play around you, like changing the channel on a TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Running Man series&amp;quot;, where you do foot movements on the bed, while sitting up or laying down, are perfect examples of orange zone passes.  You&amp;#39;d do those when you were getting sleepy, while remote viewing (&amp;quot;reading infinity&amp;quot;).  They &amp;quot;stir&amp;quot; you a bit, so you don&amp;#39;t zone out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pressing on the top of the head is another good example. It produces tingles up your body, starting at the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything like that, in the deep orange zone, alters all of reality around you, in visible waves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try sneezing in deep orange zone and you&amp;#39;ll see something that looks like a scene out of a war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blasts and clouds of burning gasses, filled with orbs, and mostly in pink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the explosion clears you&amp;#39;ll possibly be in another place. Fully translocated by the blast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But orange zone passes are blue zone compatible.  Because they manipulate subtle energies. That might help get you calmer,  less ME obsessed, so that you can escape the blue zone.  Perhaps they &amp;quot;center&amp;quot; you horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The orange zone can also be a mental trap that prevents moving further towards the purple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you had a huge silent knowledge realization there, and thought  you could remember this and tell people the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;#39;re REALLY in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you&amp;#39;ll check to make sure you remember what it is you believe you can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And every tiny aspect of that thing suddenly brings up further details to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; that point, floating in the air around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of which you&amp;#39;ll have any chance of remembering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just wondering what to remember makes it so complicated, it&amp;#39;s impossible you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We read about that in one of the books when Don Juan and Silvio pushed Carlos into the orange zone, and took him out to eat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to see if he could eat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point they asked him if he understood what intent is, and he was sure at that moment that he did. But as he thought about how to explain it, he could not. He just kept, &amp;quot;knowing&amp;quot; more and more things, none of which allowed him to communicate what he knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe he said, he ended up going around in circles in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of silent knowledge is to realize its hopeless to try to pass it on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because even considering what to say to convey it, brings up &amp;quot;examples&amp;quot; around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see how angry book deal visitors to this sub would react. Perhaps bad player #28.  How he&amp;#39;d twist the idea around to make himself seem more knowledgeable, so that all value from the knowledge was lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you thought to  yourself, &amp;quot;But he&amp;#39;s a bad guy.  Who cares?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you&amp;#39;ll get a video about a good guy, who obeys and copies everything he hears, trying to please. He&amp;#39;s so eager to understand and pick up an advantage, that you realize he&amp;#39;ll simply distract himself again, expecting rewards, and his practice will be hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there must be a guy who can receive what feels like amazing Orange zone revelations!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So up comes a video of that guy.  The guy who&amp;#39;s doing well in the darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, he doesn&amp;#39;t need it.  If he did understand you&amp;#39;d only &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; his flow of intent.  For example, if he was just about to learn to open real portals on the walls and enter them, you&amp;#39;d be tossing a firecracker into there, causing that process to end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like asking the Devil&amp;#39;s Weed ceremony lizard a different question, when it&amp;#39;s sitting on  your shoulder giving you the original answer you were seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It stops talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So are we the only ones doomed not to be able to profit fully from silent knowledge, due to not having a real lineage surrounding us?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, don Juan didn&amp;#39;t seem to get much from it either.  Certainly his training of Carlos and the apprentices was a disaster.  Even Silvio Manuel&amp;#39;s silent knowledge didn&amp;#39;t uncover their seeing mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had to reclassify the basic &amp;quot;&amp;#39;type&amp;quot; of both Carlos and La Gorda. A huge blunder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point, which I&amp;#39;ll never find again from the books, I believe don Juan even justifies this by saying, what you see is always true. It&amp;#39;s absolute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then he explains how it fails in practice anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true, but not always useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my prediction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lineages got a bit stuffy.  Too big for their own britches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had a &amp;quot;mood&amp;quot;.  A very serious mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That got passed on to Carlos and the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re very serious!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, it&amp;#39;s not ideal for our situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just feeds  the book deal mind of people who can&amp;#39;t move their assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having &amp;quot;the mood of a warrior&amp;quot; might be good when you get to the red zone and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the blue zone, it&amp;#39;s a real stumbling block.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c812fe20-6005-11ea-a726-0e9c39b3b989", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "q7x1sk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/q7x1sk/the_annoyance_of_silent_knowledge/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/q7x1sk/the_annoyance_of_silent_knowledge/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1634207939.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_q7x1sk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_q7x1sk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_q7x1sk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hgnnjf1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hgnh2lr", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "&gt;But it's so obvious!!!!!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyone?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You ALL know the answer to what made Carlos like some music, and hate others.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you can say it, you're doing well.\n\ncomes down to SILENCE! which gives us the ability to express our awareness and move the AP out of the blue zone and away from self reflection.\n\nYes that totally makes sense to me, the criteria carlos has.

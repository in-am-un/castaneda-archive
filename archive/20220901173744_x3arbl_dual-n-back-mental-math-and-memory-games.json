I  wish I could be owned by the Yakuza.\"", "edited": 1662135686.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_imt9ct9", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Probes&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;The Eagle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not an uncommon theory of why existence does as it does.  Even among other &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The universe is trying to become aware of all of itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s quite consistent with the Eagle devouring our memories at our death, and then tossing our awareness aside like a nut shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The theory goes, he doesn&amp;#39;t care one way or the other about the awareness he gave us.  He has plenty more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just wanted the memories of what happened to it, in the range of emanations where it lived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;s designed the original probe (us) to &amp;quot;get stuck&amp;quot; in a reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily this one!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just &amp;quot;collided&amp;quot; with the &amp;quot;intent of it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in theory, we could have wandered around without becoming attached to any particular place, until our cocoon couldn&amp;#39;t hold together anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And our awareness was released.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our awareness doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be able to &amp;quot;hold itself together&amp;quot; without a container stopping it from spreading out too thin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t have to theorize about this!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the cool thing about sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see it with your own eyes, playing with the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also can &amp;quot;spread out too thin&amp;quot;, and lose sentience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a whole range of magical techniques based on spreading the smallest puff you can find, &amp;quot;too thin&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It becomes more like a little LCD display you can manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you also get to see that the tonal awareness can ride along with the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leave the organic body (how much of it we don&amp;#39;t know), and add &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; to a puff, that then goes off into dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the energy body as a whole, taking along a fraction of the tonal&amp;#39;s awareness so it can be &amp;quot;lucid&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to make sure new people don&amp;#39;t read this and think we have &amp;quot;sacred scrolls&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We only discuss, that which you can do and see yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no Buddha guy so far above you, no students can ever exceed the master.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, &amp;quot;What the Eagle Wants&amp;quot;, becomes more and more obvious, by observing what happens as you learn about awareness directly from using it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The opposite of that is when you learn by reading &amp;quot;sacred scrolls&amp;quot; and believe that&amp;#39;s even remotely the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like believing you visited Europe because you have a cheesy, biased travel brochure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crap magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of the biggest mistake you can make in a foreign city, if you want to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get in the Taxi, and ask the guy to take you where it&amp;#39;s fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He takes you where his pockets get lined with cash the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dali Lama Taxi Service&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best thing to do is find some older bar girls getting off work, and pay them to show you how to have fun in this city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they get greedy, it will be amusing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once had a bar girl take me into the den of the Yakuza,  under a huge building, because she liked the food down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She ordered nearly everything on the menu as &amp;quot;takeout&amp;quot;, but I got to hear why the Japanese guy in the corner with the teenage girl, was banished to live there 6 months while the police &amp;quot;cooled off&amp;quot; back in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how the Japanese mafia owned the girl and kept her only for Japanese gangsters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I commented, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s horrible!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said,  &amp;quot;No, it&amp;#39;s an honor.

I never saw one that was actually \"helping\" anyone, despite what their customers believe.\n\nNo need to go into why.\n\nThat can be seen by just studying in here until you start to see progress yourself.\n\nBut, I'm not against anyone making money, if they actually help others learn real sorcery.\n\nI was joking with a witch that she should open an office in Dance Home, where the stereo equipment is stored in the front, but in her dreaming double.\n\nI guess I'm becoming too familiar with the layout of that place, since I'm making a virtual copy.\n\nClear out the stereo place, leaving Dance Home for us to  use for cartoons,  and set up a couch for \"counseling sessions\" in her double in that second floor office.\n\nThen charge shitloads of money to wealthy hollywood types.  Like, $100K for a single session.\n\nWon't do them much good, but as long as they actually get to see the supernatural for their money, I have no problem with it myself.  She'd be busy forever if she could pull it off.  And no harm done to anyone, since it's so nutty the KGB or CIA wouldn't be inclined to notice it.\n\nCholita's levitation tricks?

To charging for them.\n\nWe have examples of that in the women's books. The bowl of mercury and cigar rituals.\n\nI have a nice bowl of mercury waiting behind me right now, on a dusty old shelf. Not in the open of course. Mercury evaporates and poisons everyone.\n\nAnd I have some cigars too!\n\nJust couldn't get Cholita interested no matter how much money she could charge.\n\nI am in fact hoping for small magical businesses to come out of this.\n\nBut REAL magic. Not pretend magic.\n\nThis is all just like it went during the period of the Olmecs.\n\nIt's ok to \"cash in\" as a way to make a living in what interests you most, as long as you actually provide the real thing.\n\nMy disdain for the modern \"Men of Knowledge\" types is that they are clueless, and have absolutely no idea what they are talking about.\n\nMost even believe the ally is in the plant!\n\nSo that all they need is some good shrooms or bell shaped flower plants, and they're in business.\n\nThat's NOT what the Men of Knowledge were selling.\n\nAnyone could go out and pick the free power plants back then.

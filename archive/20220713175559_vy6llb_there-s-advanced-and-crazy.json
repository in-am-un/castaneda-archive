That's no fun,  trust me on that one!](https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=775d30e30e1cd5fba21f2c8a2eba0b450c4c4e5d)\n\nI posted this on facebook, created from comments and replies in the advanced subreddit.\n\nSuffice it to say, beginners need to find puffs of purple, using tensegrity and silence.\n\nThey don't need to be driving away in clown cars, passing through the walls of their home.\n\nSave that for later!\n\n\\*\\*\\* from facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nHow to Drive in a Phantom Clown Car\n\nSomeone asked a question in the \"advanced\" subreddit. I was explaining how to make yourself a \"clown car\" from a puff of purple light, using the \"Pandora's Box\" pass Carlos gave us.\n\nYou can manufacture anything with those puffs of the double's awareness. Tensegrity calls it, \"the energy body\", and we reach out into the air, jump up, or even reach down low to scoop it up and place it on our torso. To \"build the energy body\".\n\nI suppose if you can't \"see\", that all sounds kind of silly.\n\nBut later, it's FULLY visible. And there's no exaggeration about what Tensegrity can do.\n\nI just like to \"go off the deep end\".\n\nCarlos taught us to make a phantom creature, with the Pandora's box pass. Just like don Juan did in the books, with his weird rabbit that had WWII style japanese teeth. Like their leader   Shigenori Togo from back then.  Carlos would have had that guy burned into his subconscious.\n\nI only made a few \"evil dead risen\" type beings, because Cholita showed me how.\n\nShe likes visiting along the road to hell in the second attention. \n\nShe finds it, \"soothing\" to be dead and doomed to eternity in purgatory.  Carlos emphasized \"dead dreaming\" in classes. \n\nCholita took it to heart\n\nAnd besides, Cholita's catholic...\n\nBut then I realized, you can make ANYTHING.\n\nOur double does that in dreaming! If you've actually tried 4 gates dreaming (not just pretended), you quickly realize that dreaming double guy is CRAZY!\n\nHe can be looking at a peaceful lake, turn around to see the mountains behind him, and when he turns back he's at Disneyland.\n\nHe just can't keep his dreams straight!  And doesn't want to.\n\nWe do \"4 gates dreaming\" to try to merge his power, with our rationality.\n\nJust for fun, I used Pandora's box to make a tiny car in my darkroom (so it could fit), then used the \"Affection for the Energy Body\" pass to switch over into my double so I could drive away in the car.\n\nDid I do precisely that?\n\nNo.  I did other things, even better!  But can't talk about it.  \"Minx Secrets\" are involved.\n\nBut a clown car makes a good \"story\" to tell people who want to learn. And it's completely possible to do that.\n\nI even used to stage fatal car accidents in my dark room!\n\nI thought it would excite people, but one sort of asked me, \"what's the point???\"\n\nWhat???\n\nWhat's the point in amazing magic no other system even dreams of? What's the point of kicking Dzogchen ass all over Asia, for hours and hours each night?\n\nMaybe \"revenge\"? \n\nFor all their years of horribleness, claiming Castaneda can be done with pathetic Buddhism. When in fact, they never do anything at all!\n\nBut revenge aside, I guess magic is pointless if you put it like that.\n\nI did finally manage to come up with some \"reasons\" over in the advanced subreddit, so here they are for the Facebook crowd.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from reddit \\*\\*\\*\n\nQuestion:\n\nAll this Sounds great but what practical value we can draw up using this? We live both in second and first attention, so how practical it can be for the first attention?\n\nReply:\n\nIt's a wonderful question, as long as it's in the right spirit.\n\nThe problem is, \"the right spirit\".\n\nIf you're asking how can you incorporate it into the \"cozy\" in the normal world we live in, you'd have to \"dumb it down\" so much it would lose any actual magic.\n\nPerhaps that's what happened to all the other magic in the world. It got \"dumbed down\" to fit into the cozy until there's only tiny hints of any actual magic.\n\nYou could possibly make the real thing, namely advanced sorcery, fit inside \"cozy\" (your friends, family, daily world, practical activities), but it would lose so much just to bring over a tiny piece.\n\nThe best stuff is even outside the realm of thinking. NONE of that could be \"translated\".\n\nAnd it would take a lifetime of mistakes trying to extract even tiny useful pieces. So whoever tried to \"integrate\" the two, wouldn't live long enough to get very far. They'd have to give up on the journey, in order to try to help those left behind. With dubious results.\n\nUnfortunately, the advanced stuff is off in a \"non-cozy\" realm.\n\nI guess \"the wheel of time\" best explains this.\n\nIn waking dreaming it's possible to look for the start of \"phantom rooms\" on the whitish light around you.\n\nBut then you come to realize, they're all around once the assemblage point moves far enough.\n\nIt's the full \"double's vision\".\n\n4 gates dreaming practitioners are well aware of what the double's vision is really like, when he's off doing whatever he likes.\n\nBecause they try to \"hold dreams\" while attempting to pass all 4 gates.\n\nAnd find out, that guy is crazy!\n\nHe has no steady dream. That's just our Tonal's rationality coming in and trying to make sense out of it.\n\nA \"dirty little secret\" of that 4 gates technique is, it's not actually rational procedures that leads to a goal. To bring the double into the real world.\n\nMostly it's just a chance for you to see the conflict between your rationality, and how the double likes to experience reality.\n\nThe double is sort of gazing around inside his \"dark room\" looking for translocations. His \"darkroom\" is that blue ball of energy the new seers prefer. The affection pass can create one.\n\nHe's inside a bubble which has dreams projected on the walls.\n\nExcept he's also the walls.\n\nBut he's so good at it, he isn't seeing vague scenes on walls as we do in darkroom. Where it's difficult to even pick up a tiny piece of a dream scene.\n\nHe's seeing possible \"full on\" vivid dream choices.\n\nHe can get absorbed in the \"asinine details\" in all of them, as don Juan put it.\n\nWe want him to be out on some cool adventure we can take over. When we do 4 gates.\n\nAnd to some extent we can direct him with some \"purpose\" to make the situation seem like he's just a wizard who can travel to many realms, but once he gets to a nice one he can \"behave\" so that it's consistent and has a \"plot\".\n\nBut really, he's just tripping out. Looking at endless shroom visions.\n\nYou can learn to do this in darkroom, but it's VERY advanced.\n\nI use it to call Minx. I create a dream scene I know Minx is familiar with, and then if I'm lucky he shows up to play in it.\n\nLike some large boulders a lizard might crawl out onto, to sun himself.\n\nMinx has done that before! For Carlos. In the devil's weed ceremony ritual part where you have to grab your wild lizard, and put it into a bag.\n\nI \"lure\" him like he's really a little animal, with a materialized portion of a dream near the door to Cholita's realm and hope he notices, and comes to \"be in it\". I haven't got the \"warm sun shining on the rocks\" part down. It looks more like bounders on a sunless cloudy day.\n\nIt's a very good activity to learn in darkroom, because of how much power it leads to. The activity of phantom room creation and usage.\n\nOn the surface it looks like you're simply trying to learn to become as powerful as your double, for viewing perfectly real looking phantom realms.\n\nBut as you gaze around the room looking for the start of one of those, such as vague trees on the south wall, with no more details, you realize that the way you can turn those vague trees into a real forest you can walk into is to get absorbed in the \"asinine details\" exactly as don Juan complained was the double's behavior.\n\nAnd out near Silent Knowledge (SK), the entire dark room is filled to the brink with potential mini-dream scenes, or dream fragments, into which you can gaze and enter.\n\nThat's what the double does.\n\nHe's like a very small child in the most wonderful toy store in the world.\n\nHe waddles from toy to toy, getting lost in the details of that particular one until his awareness gets bored with it, and he runs to the next.  He explores the unknown.\n\nThat's our \"natural\" behavior as humans.\n\nAnd adults (us) would like him to play with a specific toy longer, so we could interact with the child in a \"cozy\" way.  \"Teach\" him.\n\n\"Cozy\" is mostly about \"brainwashing\"?\n\nBut the kid just wants to flow from sight to sight. He doesn't care about long term meaningfulness. Doesn't care if interaction with his parent using the toy, will be good for the family and their relationships in the long run.\n\nThat's \"cozy\". The kid doesn't really understand cozy yet. He understands wet diapers, hungry, cold, bored.\n\nHe's mostly free of concerns over cozy.\n\nYou're asking what good it is to be more like the toddler lost in the toy store. How will it pay the bills? Can it be used to get along with grumpy grandma better? Will it bring us all closer?\n\nAs a result of being concerned over that, you will end up missing out on the pointless baby wanderings in the toy store.\n\nMight be fun for the baby, but what use are they?\n\nTrouble is, that's the \"real\" us.\n\nThe baby exploring the unknown.\n\nIf you grow up into that, instead of in the \"cozy\", you begin to see a pattern.\n\nTo how the dream visions come along for a double inside dreaming.\n\nWhat's the order, how long do they stay, are there categories of random weird little dream places you can get lost in?\n\nAnd you notice a pattern to how they come and go.\n\nI believe Carlos called that, \"the wheel of time\".\n\nYou can TURN it!\n\nBut he also described a tunnel in which you could, \"jump grooves\".\n\nTo save yourself from an illness. Assuming you have enough energy to do it.\n\nI'm not sure it's the same thing.\n\nBut it is a view of reality that a baby in a toy store might grow up to know, if it didn't get dragged into the \"cozy\" world.\n\nIt's a little like, the baby wants to wander around the shopping mall. \n\nRandomly, with no purpose.\n\nGod only knows what amazing stores are out there, beyond eyesight!\n\nHis family is sitting in the McDonald's at the end of the mall, and wants to limit the baby to wandering around only in the plastic playground provided there, completely fenced in so the baby is safe.\n\nThey can't control the baby when its so young, but eventually the baby will become obsessed with his status in the family, and find sitting at the table eating french fries to be more interesting than exploring the unknown.\n\nAnd never learn the layout of the mall, or what complicated activities go on there at all levels. \n\nHe won't even find the Victoria's Secret store!  What a loss...\n\nThe mall isn't a good example because it's in the world of the cozy too.\n\nBut out there in the land the dreamer occupies, the possibilities are endless.\n\nUnfortunately it's not cozy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "There's \"Advanced\", And \"Crazy\"", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 87, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"900qjinoxcb91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 67, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c11d51815f1d97261496cf6c4188c0cb1580e4d"}, {"y": 135, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a8354d46967f5f9ff1674336b5fe975df61fa77"}, {"y": 200, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ad284252a08e5b8f0700ab89721ef59b7fa50e5"}, {"y": 400, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecd7fee7ef73db188bfce8366ce3600a9d08b5bb"}, {"y": 600, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb403fd42e77a74b4ace45f49d03beb5b065e7af"}, {"y": 675, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ded363a0074753dff21430fa22e83b4ca37d85b"}], "s": {"y": 1280, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=775d30e30e1cd5fba21f2c8a2eba0b450c4c4e5d"}, "id": "900qjinoxcb91"}}, "name": "t3_vy6llb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Q8GCYFS8eWjrEtyBOp7VNNohQSgXAE-zucw1WB9ebsw.jpg", "edited": 1657730731.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657727759.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/900qjinoxcb91.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=775d30e30e1cd5fba21f2c8a2eba0b450c4c4e5d\"&gt;I hope it doesn&amp;#39;t turn out my double is Japanese...

Where it&amp;#39;s difficult to even pick up a tiny piece of a dream scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s seeing possible &amp;quot;full on&amp;quot; vivid dream choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He can get absorbed in the &amp;quot;asinine details&amp;quot; in all of them, as don Juan put it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want him to be out on some cool adventure we can take over. When we do 4 gates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to some extent we can direct him with some &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; to make the situation seem like he&amp;#39;s just a wizard who can travel to many realms, but once he gets to a nice one he can &amp;quot;behave&amp;quot; so that it&amp;#39;s consistent and has a &amp;quot;plot&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, he&amp;#39;s just tripping out. Looking at endless shroom visions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can learn to do this in darkroom, but it&amp;#39;s VERY advanced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use it to call Minx. I create a dream scene I know Minx is familiar with, and then if I&amp;#39;m lucky he shows up to play in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like some large boulders a lizard might crawl out onto, to sun himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx has done that before! For Carlos. In the devil&amp;#39;s weed ceremony ritual part where you have to grab your wild lizard, and put it into a bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &amp;quot;lure&amp;quot; him like he&amp;#39;s really a little animal, with a materialized portion of a dream near the door to Cholita&amp;#39;s realm and hope he notices, and comes to &amp;quot;be in it&amp;quot;. I haven&amp;#39;t got the &amp;quot;warm sun shining on the rocks&amp;quot; part down. It looks more like bounders on a sunless cloudy day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very good activity to learn in darkroom, because of how much power it leads to. The activity of phantom room creation and usage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the surface it looks like you&amp;#39;re simply trying to learn to become as powerful as your double, for viewing perfectly real looking phantom realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as you gaze around the room looking for the start of one of those, such as vague trees on the south wall, with no more details, you realize that the way you can turn those vague trees into a real forest you can walk into is to get absorbed in the &amp;quot;asinine details&amp;quot; exactly as don Juan complained was the double&amp;#39;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And out near Silent Knowledge (SK), the entire dark room is filled to the brink with potential mini-dream scenes, or dream fragments, into which you can gaze and enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what the double does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s like a very small child in the most wonderful toy store in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He waddles from toy to toy, getting lost in the details of that particular one until his awareness gets bored with it, and he runs to the next.  He explores the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s our &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; behavior as humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And adults (us) would like him to play with a specific toy longer, so we could interact with the child in a &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; way.  &amp;quot;Teach&amp;quot; him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cozy&amp;quot; is mostly about &amp;quot;brainwashing&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the kid just wants to flow from sight to sight. He doesn&amp;#39;t care about long term meaningfulness. Doesn&amp;#39;t care if interaction with his parent using the toy, will be good for the family and their relationships in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot;. The kid doesn&amp;#39;t really understand cozy yet. He understands wet diapers, hungry, cold, bored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s mostly free of concerns over cozy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re asking what good it is to be more like the toddler lost in the toy store. How will it pay the bills? Can it be used to get along with grumpy grandma better? Will it bring us all closer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of being concerned over that, you will end up missing out on the pointless baby wanderings in the toy store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might be fun for the baby, but what use are they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, that&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The baby exploring the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you grow up into that, instead of in the &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot;, you begin to see a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To how the dream visions come along for a double inside dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the order, how long do they stay, are there categories of random weird little dream places you can get lost in?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you notice a pattern to how they come and go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Carlos called that, &amp;quot;the wheel of time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can TURN it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he also described a tunnel in which you could, &amp;quot;jump grooves&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To save yourself from an illness. Assuming you have enough energy to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;s the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is a view of reality that a baby in a toy store might grow up to know, if it didn&amp;#39;t get dragged into the &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a little like, the baby wants to wander around the shopping mall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Randomly, with no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God only knows what amazing stores are out there, beyond eyesight!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His family is sitting in the McDonald&amp;#39;s at the end of the mall, and wants to limit the baby to wandering around only in the plastic playground provided there, completely fenced in so the baby is safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t control the baby when its so young, but eventually the baby will become obsessed with his status in the family, and find sitting at the table eating french fries to be more interesting than exploring the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And never learn the layout of the mall, or what complicated activities go on there at all levels. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He won&amp;#39;t even find the Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret store!  What a loss...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mall isn&amp;#39;t a good example because it&amp;#39;s in the world of the cozy too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But out there in the land the dreamer occupies, the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s not cozy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort":

Without anyone even knowing, we have 600 other worlds we could choose to live in. Just swap \"who we are\".\n\nAnd 1 billion more out there to explore!\n\nYou can even leap anywhere in the universe, and make a visit.\n\nSo once you have 1 billion 600 choices out there, this one doesn't seem very attractive.\n\nBecause you gain the ability to travel to other worlds.\n\nEven into the past for short little \"vacations\"!\n\nBut it's always a struggle to do that.\n\nEven when you get good and it's no longer a big deal, it's still \"not real enough\", or not as far as you were trying to go.\n\nFor sleeping dreaming, the old seers devised \"the twin positions\", where you duplicate your sleeping position, and go to sleep in a new dream in that same position.\n\nA dream within a dream, that's very stable.  I've stayed in those as long as 2 weeks.\n\nBut to get a \"total perception\" takes some skill and effort.\n\nSo EVEN THE OLD SEERS who did nothing but sorcery all their lives (from childhood) had trouble coming up with enough free energy to travel all the places humans can go.\n\nAnd that activity is beyond anything you could do in this world we live in.\n\nIt's why some of us work so hard, for free, trying to get others to learn.\n\nSo that this knowledge won't be lost forever. It's almost lost from the world even now!\n\nIt's also why I'm nearly heartless about confronting bad men who come into the subreddit, with greedy motives.

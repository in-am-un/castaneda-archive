His studies overlapped with Carlos\u2019 travels.  I was exposed early on to power plants.\n\nAs a result, I thought I knew all the power plants growing in my area.  And when I heard rumors of one I didn\u2019t know about up in the Santa Monica mountains, just north of Carlos\u2019 compound, I was very interested.\n\nI went up there with a woman from his private classes, but neither of us knew the area. She\u2019d only heard it was \u201csomewhere over there\u201d.  \u201cOver there\u201d turned out to be at the end of Malibu road, quite a way from the Sorcerer\u2019s Cave, but along the same path.\n\nNeither of us had planned to do any hiking.  We didn\u2019t have appropriate shoes.  We thought we\u2019d just park near the right spot, and walk a short distance to the plant.\n\nWe never found it.  And it was horribly frustrating because we hadn\u2019t planned to spend that much time up there.  We wandered around from plant to plant, even studying soil types because we\u2019d been told it likes to grow in sandy soil near water.\n\nI saw some half-spent roaches.  Apparently, it\u2019s a good spot for getting high in general. I also found a bank of promising shale-like stone, in which I suspected you could find some fern fossils.\n\nBut no power plant.  We left frustrated and hungry, and drove to \u201cReal Food Daily\u201d, the little vegetarian restaurant next to Dance Home, where Carlos gave most of his classes.  A witchcraft bookstore was located right next to it.\n\nDuring the course of the meal, we kept discussing things we\u2019d seen.  Eventually we realized, if we had found the power plant we wouldn\u2019t have learned nearly as much about those mountains.  Plus, if we wanted some marijuana we knew exactly where to go to get it in pre-smoked form.\n\nThat\u2019s the exact situation all of us are in.  Wandering in the mountains, trying to track down a rumor.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a guide to move us along quickly, in \u201cresult oriented\u201d ways, as Carlos was taught.  Our results won\u2019t be as dramatic, because they won\u2019t be caused by someone else.\n\nThis is also sort of why Carlos told his class to stop reading his books. They were a hook.  You\u2019re hooked. Stop reading them.  My interpretation: They\u2019ll only keep you from doing what you really need to do, which will be a lot more tedious than the stories in his books.\n\nThe books are a map, so we need them now.  Carlos is gone.  But it\u2019s easy to confuse the way Carlos learned sorcery, with how we\u2019re stuck learning it:  Under our own power, stumbling around in the wilderness without knowing where to go next.\n\nAlthough we might not reach the goals, or it might take a lot longer than it seemed to take in Carlos\u2019 books, we have the potential to learn more than he did, along the way.  Just not what we wanted to learn first.\n\nWe have to be process oriented, and not as much goal oriented.  We have to help each other.  Compare notes so to speak.  If someone discovers something new, not covered in Carlos\u2019 books, we already know one thing about it.  You can do that on your own power.\n\nLast night I got an early start on exploring.  It wasn\u2019t dark enough outside to prevent my room from being lighter than I like, when I\u2019m practicing waking dreaming.  There are cracks along the taped-up windows.  I could easily see my hands, and all the details in the room. But they were a little vague.\n\nI was wondering if I\u2019d still be able to see colors, and whether I could get my \u201cfairy\u201d to appear in the middle of the bright spots of purple.  Almost as soon as I wondered about it, I saw a patch of purple.  I was surprised. The thought occurred to me that maybe it\u2019s easier to see the colors in twilight.\n\nThe colors had some squiggly bright lines.  A lot more than I see in darkness.  If I squinted my eyes to reduce the light, I could manipulate them.\n\nA patch of purple formed, and it was so bright that I couldn\u2019t help myself but try to grab it with my hands.\n\nWhen you try that, you might or might not feel it. Don\u2019t expect to grab it the way you usually grab an object.  You just put your hands where you would grab it if it were \u201creal\u201d, and simulate the process of pulling on it.  I don\u2019t want to say you can\u2019t feel it.  You certainly can.  But it\u2019s not necessary at first.\n\nIt was so bright, it looked like violet taffy.  Or more like a blob of taffy that was still warm, and so it could hold a blob shape, but was also easy to pull apart and push back together. I was shocked at how bright it was, then realized my grabbing technique was very similar to what Carlos had shown us one day, in an effort to get our second attention to wake up in class.   Most of the class probably thought he was losing it when he did that, because we saw nothing.  But as it turns out, he likely had a lot more things going on in class than we could perceive.\n\nIn the center of the blob of purple mass, a fairy\u2019s head appeared. She was laughing at me.  Then she vanished.  I asked her, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just stick around for a while?\u201d\n\nI started watching the purple blob more closely, to see if I could coax her back.  I noticed, there was a reddish orange color on the edges.  I thought, maybe the extra light in the room adds colors?\n\nIn the center of the purple I noticed some greenish blue color.  In fact, the purple color had always had that, and yellow brown to boot.  I just hadn\u2019t thought about it much.  I\u2019d been focused on the brilliant purple, but the other colors were available too, and each seemed to be of a different intensity.\n\nI reached behind the blob, thinking I could \u201cstretch\u201d the orangish red a bit, to make it predominate.  I want to understand why Zuleica said it was more restful.  I realized, the path was like a balloon or a membrane, and I could in fact push on part of it, stretch that out with my hand, and it would tend to remain stretched.\n\nSoon I had a blob of mostly orangish red light, with some purple still on the edges.  I also had blobs of blackness forming in the area. I\u2019d only seen those in the middle of the purple color.    Those blobs of blackness were everywhere, and the sight was quite unusual, because there was still enough light to see the room.\n\nI have to admit, having more light is a lot more \u201cconvincing\u201d if you manage to see colors. In the darkness, it\u2019s still almost like a dream.  Even with your eyes open, you could say all you\u2019d accomplished was falling asleep with your eyes open, and seeing a dream vision.\n\nThese colors and blobs of black were \u201cright there\u201d, on top of the room's details.  In particular, the bed sheets and lumped up comforter were full of them.\n\nContinued because of word count limits...", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to Change Colors", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_btcod3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1558902643.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1558901960.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father was an anthropologist from the same UC system \u201ccrop\u201d as Carlos.

At the time I thought, I must have written the story badly because I had no idea how to do that.  The assumption that if you could pull on the colors, then that also means you can stretch them to a blanket shape, and wrap your body with them, seemed very misguided.\n\nBut out of curiosity, I tried it.  I concentrated on the orange patch, pulled only that part out to stretch it sideways.  But instead of stopping when my hands were a foot or two apart, I kept pulling until I had produced a stretch of orangish red about 6 inches tall, and several feet wide.   And it was willing to follow the contours of my body, so I was able to bring it around the back also. Not exactly a blanket, but at least a fat winter scarf.\n\nWhile my hands were still holding it, the area lit up. It was covered in all colors of lines and jagged features.  And they were more stable, and more willing to remain in place than what I had seen before.  I\u2019ve long had the idea that those colors and lines might be the inside of the luminous cocoon, so I looked for the next part of Zuleica\u2019s technique;  the fibers of light that connect the torso to the rest of the world.\n\nI wanted to see if it was actually possible to distinguish a stalker from a dreamer, on the basis of the features around the stomach area.  I noticed that to keep that view, I had to keep my hands where they were, when they finished pulling the orange color.  It was as if they were generating the color, by my intention to hold that \u201cthing\u201d in place.\n\nAs soon as I started to let my hands drop a bit, the lines and jagged features started to fade away into a mild orange mist. I pulled them back up, so I could look closer.\n\nI saw a bright orangish red filament going from my right stomach area, straight out further than I could see.  I expected it to blink away as such things always do the instant I notice them. But it was absolutely stable. It was located in space, and didn\u2019t move.  It was fully directional, not moving when my head moved.  And even more interesting was that I could see its relationship to my leg on the bed, because there was enough light in the room to see everything.  It gave all the appearance of being a real object, stretched out about 8 inches above my leg, and moving off too far to see.\n\nIt remained for as long as I wanted to look at it.  It wasn\u2019t vague at all. Someone could have coated a real cotton thread with orange luminous paint and tied it to my shirt, stretching it out across the room. That\u2019s how real it looked.  The glowing line was vibrating, like it was made up of tiny pieces all aligned together, but they couldn\u2019t hold the same alignment for long, so they constantly vibrated to switch it.  You had to look closely into it, to see that it was doing that.  The vibrations seemed to produce awareness of something, when observed.  I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.\n\nI have no idea how long I spent looking at that sight.  Sometimes when you practice this technique, you might think you only spent 1 hour, then look at the clock and find out it\u2019s been 5 hours.    But I strongly advise others, not to get impatient. If you are looking at something \u201cimpossible\u201d, don\u2019t get bored too quickly and move on to the next thing.  Just the act of holding your assemblage point where you can keep that view, is an important training method.  Maybe that\u2019s even off into the realm of stalking.\n\nBut I got tired of doing that anyway. I find it hard to take my own advice.  I let my arms rest on the bed, and just looked at the orangish red color that was everywhere.  No wonder I hadn\u2019t noticed it before! It\u2019s too vague to be satisfying.  The purple is so harsh, and it tends to spin off details like writing and hypnogogic images. And Carlos had advised us to look for that color.\n\nThe orange is more like a pleasing smell in the room.   Maybe even vague enough that you won\u2019t realize it was there at first.  I understood why Zuleica had said it was restful.    In order to make it brighter, you had to be calmer.\n\nI looked around for my hypnogogic fairy, but she was nowhere to be seen.  The orange red color just wasn\u2019t vibrant enough to generate a hypnogogic image.\n\nIt was still early in the day, and I\u2019d planned to practice all night.  I lay on my right side to rest a bit, and closed my eyes.\n\nAfter a minute or two of drifting due to silence, I opened my eyes to see if the room was still filled with that orangish red color. I didn\u2019t want to lose that.\n\nI was shocked by the sight. There, laying in bed next to me, was the fairy.  She had a beaming smile, and it looked like she\u2019d pulled the covers up to cover herself, exposing only her head and neck.  It was the exact same pose I'd seen just once before, when I couldn't get her to stand on the bed again. Except she was no longer 4 inches tall.\n\nI commented, \u201cThere you are!\u201d. She giggled and turned her head more to face me.   At that point, I was not sure she wouldn't transform into some horrible monster, or at least her face would lose its cuteness. Maybe a Frankenstein's monster style bolt on her neck, or some jagged stiches on her cheek.  And her face was only 1 foot away from mine since she was laying next to me.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t change.  She even gave me a smirk with her eyes.  A rather Julia Roberts sort of smirk, the kind that crinkles the skin around the nose.\n\nI can\u2019t judge how tall she was, but she was pretty close to normal human size. And she was laying next to me, on the bed, exactly as if she were real.   It was as if a new girlfriend had snuck into my bed, to surprise me.\n\nExcept, she was made out of transparent bluish light.\n\nI closed my eyes, not wanting to see her fade away.  Or worse, change into something horrible.  I thought, there was no way she could remain much longer.   Fairies are usually very fleeting when you have to manufacture them, using an inorganic being.\n\nAfter a minute or two, I opened my eyes cautiously take a peek.  She was still there, giggling!\n\nI sat up on the bed to see if I could get her to walk around. So far, it's the only way I get to see her whole body. But she\u2019d vanished.  I remembered her words the last time I tried to get her to prance on the bed again.  She said (without sound), \u201cWe already did that!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: three times", "edited": 1558912468.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eovx780", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to change part 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered someone\u2019s suggestion to try to wrap the orange around myself like a blanket.    At the time I thought, I must have written the story badly because I had no idea how to do that.  The assumption that if you could pull on the colors, then that also means you can stretch them to a blanket shape, and wrap your body with them, seemed very misguided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But out of curiosity, I tried it.  I concentrated on the orange patch, pulled only that part out to stretch it sideways.  But instead of stopping when my hands were a foot or two apart, I kept pulling until I had produced a stretch of orangish red about 6 inches tall, and several feet wide.   And it was willing to follow the contours of my body, so I was able to bring it around the back also. Not exactly a blanket, but at least a fat winter scarf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While my hands were still holding it, the area lit up. It was covered in all colors of lines and jagged features.

It's not that kind of \"in and out\" game.\n\nFancy would though.  Fairy too.\n\nThey're like the infamous \"Star Trek\" female Alien raised on a world where there's no sex.  And someone from the crew decides to educate them.\n\nBut that's another story.\n\nWhat happened last night was, I returned to playing ping pong with Fancy.  Then I tried to remember the 3D version, \"Pong\".  Like the first video game.\n\nFancy's thing is this:  Looking at puffs of color moves the assemblage point down, along the J curve.\n\nBut if you want to learn to move it horizontally, to gain \"practical magic\", you have to look around.  Smell the flowers once in a while.\n\nThat's how the Little Sisters learned to run around the room, on the walls.\n\nIt's how Pablito created his \"third arm\".\n\nAnd it's how La Gorda learned to fly.\n\nAt some point, after Fancy became super bright and realistic from playing games, I returned to trying to learn to use her \"energy telescope\".\n\nI formed a particularly bright puff of pink color using both hands, and then tried to gaze through it towards Cholita's room and the garage. I just want to learn to determine where she's sleeping.\n\nI could see all sorts of things, but not what I wanted.\n\nI turned to try it on the cardinal directions.  Could I see a difference between north and south using it?\n\nThe idea is, it's dreaming eyes, that the tonal has in front of it.  It's non-directional, meaning, it follows your head as it turns.\n\nIt's like those \"3D\" glasses from the late 1950s, given out in theaters!  Once you have them on you can forget about keeping them in place, and yet they transform your vision of the movie.\n\nI discovered I didn't need my hands holding the glowing ball in place. I lowered them cautiously, and the big pink puff of brilliant color remained.  I could turn and scan the room with it.\n\nIt was perhaps double the diameter of my head, so all I could see looking straight ahead, was through that ball of energy.\n\nI got Fancy's attention. She saw that I was trying to use it for a different purpose than she'd originally promised.\n\nI suppose she didn't want me to fail, and think that she was unreliable.\n\nShe drifted by, extremely slowly, dressed very oddly.  Like the red princess of evil magic.\n\nThat picture doesn't do justice to how solid and real, and vivid she looked. Her read outfit was so intensely red, it even had whitish highlights.  \n\nAnd actually her mouth was wide open, as if she were swallowing energy as she went along. \n\nBut I couldn't find such a picture on google images.\n\nShe was headed towards the south east corner, so I gazed over there.\n\nA little intense flurry of lights told me there was energy over there, and gazing through my pink puff scope I could make out a woman in a convertible.  It's not unusual to see dreams play out in your dark room, so I wondered what good the energy scope was.  I scanned it around the room, and realized I was inside Fancy's ice cave again.  Except that the walls weren't slick as usual.\n\nSo either it was the summer thaw on Fancy's home world, or maybe it was just an energy formation on the walls of my own room.\n\nWhatever it was, the room no  longer had 4 walls. It was a curved structure.\n\nI turned around several times to verify, I was inside a domelike structure.\n\nAs I scanned, I found dreams at 4 different locations.  With more undiscovered in other locations.\n\nTurning back to the convertible, I gazed very intently trying to find a use for the scope.\n\nFancy told me, use your feelings.  Not your eyes.\n\nI gazed even harder, and found that I had feelings about everything in that scene. But one particular place in the dream reminded me of something from the past.  It felt \"real\".\n\nCozy even.\n\nI was sucked into the dream.\n\nPuzzled while standing in that scene, I slowly realized I had passed through a barrier, and forgotten my purpose.  I had been in the dark room.  Entering the dream had caused a memory lapse.\n\nI was tossed back out into the room, at the same spot.\n\nFancy nodded to me to indicate I understand this new game now.\n\nYou go in and out of dreams, by finding the right sensation.  Doing that will make it easier to enter dreams by other methods, since you won't blank out for an instant.  You'll have a continuous memory of entering.\n\nOne by one I entered each dream I found around the room, by looking for the \"key feeling\".\n\nThat was the strongest feeling I got from anything in the dream, which made it seem pleasant to go in there.  Even a discarded grocery receipt crumpled on the floor could constitute the key feeling in that dream.\n\nFeeling that makes you become a part of the dream, making it easy to enter.  In fact, I'd say you don't so much get sucked into it, as it envelops you once you can \"feel\" it.\n\nBut there is a sensation of moving associated with entering.\n\nAfter a while I believed I was learning to pass through the transition without forgetting what I was doing.\n\nRealizing that, I found myself in a white hallway.  It was like you can find in any modern shopping mall, where they keep the offices and bathrooms.  It was like a business-like white painted passage way to key rooms which support a large shopping mall.\n\nOr even a government office building hallway.\n\nStanding next to me was Carlos himself.  He seemed to be waiting for me to notice him.\n\nBut he was 30 years younger than I last saw him. He was clearly in his 40s.\n\nHe started walking slowly down the hallway and I followed him.  He gave off creepy dark energy, making me suspect he was really Fancy playing games with me.\n\nI stopped walking, he stopped, and I asked him a question.  I'm afraid to say, I was \"testing\" him.\n\n\"Do you have any advice for people who are gazing at the second attention in dark rooms?\n\nHe blinked his eyes, as if the sound were painful.\n\nI realized I should have let him continue walking, to see where we were going.\n\nHe moved his mouth around, as if it were too stiff to work.\n\nThen he said,  \"Tell them to look for the \\*\\*overall\\*\\* darkness.\"\n\nI visualized vertical lines, cracks in reality, between the magic buzzing around.\n\nBut that didn't make sense.  He continued to explain, but the single sentence he got out was garbled, like someone trying to talk while fully asleep.\n\nIt faded before I could understand the words.\n\nWe had become \"out of sync\".\n\nI was thrown out of the dream and back onto my bed.\n\nWhich was odd.\n\nI had started out standing up in the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fancy's New Game: In and Out", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"z0eckhd1kvy51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z0eckhd1kvy51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d6ab0d481ccda9d2ff19586086a3678f1b43a5b"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z0eckhd1kvy51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a4018182fcc4835f7969ea5d8776cab460872d9"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z0eckhd1kvy51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68d761028ceeee5574345bff1c95001951eb0d4b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z0eckhd1kvy51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cb87d0fe1e585e9656f39699127ca6c81add97e"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z0eckhd1kvy51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=badd06cfcc836c8547355df1a847d5a2eb999ffa"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z0eckhd1kvy51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57742a8df88edbbe62d0162ede681348385f6a44"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z0eckhd1kvy51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f729532ddbcc0b1f9b71a5ef381a4c9e3395b3c"}, "id": "z0eckhd1kvy51"}}, "name": "t3_jt41jy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wXjCsmbgMSs9xGyyA3SEb2ct8oJjzxg0e2DSePUl8s0.jpg", "edited": 1605222455.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1605217707.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z0eckhd1kvy51.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0f729532ddbcc0b1f9b71a5ef381a4c9e3395b3c\"&gt;Using an Energy Telescope to Rapidly Enter Dreams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, you pervert!

That darkness was more fundamental than light, because light proceeds from darkness. Darkness, as a potentiated state, is the default and it should be a focus of spiritual traditions, rather than the obsession with \"divine light\" which was more masculine; where darkness was inherently feminine.\n\nThe full page isn't showing up in Google, but this quote distills it's essence. It was just philosophical and not practically minded after-all:\n\n\"Much has been said about light, almost nothing about darkness. But darkness is a much deeper  phenomenon than light is. Light comes and goes - darkness remains; it never comes, it never goes.  Light is not eternal, because it needs fuel, some kind of fuel, and the fuel will be exhausted sooner or  later.

That darkness was more fundamental than light, because light proceeds from darkness. Darkness, as a potentiated state, is the default and it should be a focus of spiritual traditions, rather than the obsession with &amp;quot;divine light&amp;quot; which was more masculine; where darkness was inherently feminine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The full page isn&amp;#39;t showing up in Google, but this quote distills it&amp;#39;s essence. It was just philosophical and not practically minded after-all:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Much has been said about light, almost nothing about darkness. But darkness is a much deeper  phenomenon than light is. Light comes and goes - darkness remains; it never comes, it never goes.  Light is not eternal, because it needs fuel, some kind of fuel, and the fuel will be exhausted sooner or  later. Darkness needs no fuel, no cause; hence darkness is not an effect and can remain eternally  there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the morning, you see the sun arises and there is light; in the evening the sun sets, the light  disappears, and suddenly all over there is darkness. It does not mean that when the sun disappears,  darkness comes in. It has been there all the time; just because of the light you could not see it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/LightOnThePath/Light_on_the_Path%20OSHO_djvu.txt\"&gt;Osho (source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jt41jy/fancys_new_game_in_and_out/gc3gfp2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1605221194.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_jt41jy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gc67kv5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gc651p1", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I don't have to.

Not even 1.\n\nSo you must have a reason for believing it can work.\n\nOtherwise, it's almost surely like everything else out there.  A distraction to let people get out of doing hard work to actually learn magic. And to get money for the instructor.\n\nHOWEVER, I must admit. Carlos and the inner circle were doing some of that.\n\nOlmec style. They even tried to pull me into it with Florinda.\n\nI suspect once you become a sorcerer, sex can be used to move the assemblage point, and likely as an entry to shared dreaming awake.\n\nAnd I should mention, don Juan sort of explained the dilemma you and I both face, of whether or not you can \"save up sexual energy\". I got the impression you weren't sure about that point either.\n\nNote: The Chinese believe that, but when you study with a teacher of such a thing, it's always that he can have sex but students cannot.  Which makes one a bit suspicious.\n\nSo I'll trust don Juan on this one.  He said, if you were born of a \"bored fuck\", meaning the parents were just going through the motions,  you are born with very low energy.  The male adds the energy to the woman, who gathers more in her womb as the baby grows.  But the initial energy has to come from sexual excitement.\n\nThose type of people have so little energy, they should never have sex.  Don Juan said their pecker is just for peeing.\n\nJulian was the opposite, so don Juan said he was a \"libertine\", whatever that is.\n\nI'm reading between the lines, and he seems to have been bisexual also.  AND, used sexual humiliation to move assemblage points.\n\nDon Juan seemed to have been taught to cross dress by Julian, and Carlos was cross dressing inner circle men in Infinity Theater.  His compound had an excellent paver stone or brick area to walk around in for a \"show\", and plenty of fine wood picnic table seating.\n\nI suppose that has some hint at why sex magic could work (but is unlikely to outside sorcerers). It can move the assemblage point because of the complex assortment of emotions it summons.\n\nBut there's NOTHING vague about whether you have energy or not! I hope you understand, we aren't talking Tony Robbins style energy here, the famous motivational speaker.\n\nSorcery is not pretend. If you have energy, crazy things happen. If you don't, they don't.\n\nLast night I was revisiting the technique that lets you zip in and out of dreams rapidly, of this post, to get practice switching to the dreaming double.\n\nI'm hoping to lure some women into being able to do that, to turbo charge their witchcraft.\n\nIt's done fully awake, eyes open, no drugs.  But in a dark room, to make it easier on beginners.\n\nYou play with the colors until they clear the air and it looks, \"sparkly\", but there's no obvious puffs or streaks. HOWEVER, you must pass through the brilliant colors, or you have gone the wrong path.  So if you turn out the lights and there's nothing, don't think to yourself, \"I'm so gifted, I skipped all the way to the point that the room is cleared!\"\n\n\"Clearing the second attention fog\" makes sure you are going straight down the J curve, instead of sideways.  It insures you passed the bottom and are starting towards the orange zone, on the other side of the body.\n\nA person with very low energy, still having sex, won't even find a color in the air. And they'll be too fussy to put in more than 20 minutes before they feel sorry for themselves, and decide it's all made up.\n\nA person with very low energy who only has occasional sex, might find some colors.\n\nHe can continue on.  But without intense silence, he won't make it to the \"sparkles\" in the air.\n\nA person with moderate energy can make it there, even with imperfect silence.\n\nNext step requires whitish light to form repeating patterns on the walls, so that you can clearly see the room.\n\nThat's going to take someone with **good** levels of \"energy\".  Or someone who has endless patience and puts in 3 hours every day, emphasizing silence.\n\nThe person with **amazing** levels of energy, or a crazy hard worker, will next see the whitish light form a phantom copy of their room, though probably mostly blackness.\n\nDoing this last night, my walls started to look like an antique mall.  Objects were clearly visible, and did not change locations. I looked on my western wall towards Cholita's area, and saw a wall of light made from perfectly straight fibers. They were spaced no more than 1/4th inch apart, and stretched from floor to ceiling.\n\nI don't know what's up with that, but Cholita's side was sealed off with energy.   She's been angry with me for days, destroying various small things she finds around the  house that she knows will bother me.  So it wasn't a surprise to see that my phantom room couldn't pass into her virtual house.\n\nOnce you are in a phantom room, you are surrounded by dreaming. The whole room is a dream.  So it's no big deal if it gets fractured into multiple dreams.  That happens all the time in lucid dreaming. People just don't notice it.\n\nYou gaze off at places at least 6 feet back from the walls, and at least 8 feet away from you, a reasonable distance for leaping into an area in the room without bouncing off the walls,  until you find a large imperfection in the \"sparkles\".\n\nIf you didn't waste your energy that day by arguing or other indulgences, that blooms into a visible, transparent blue dream.  Others might see different colors, but it's rather dull. Unsaturated is the technical term.  Barely has any color.\n\nBut the person with average energy probably still doesn't have enough energy to \"zip\" into it. He's only allowed to watch, which will pull his assemblage point further. A good thing, but not as fun as zipping in.\n\nAnd by the time that person can zip in, because he's ignored his disappointment and continued to move his assemblage point  using the sight, he won't care to.\n\nBummer.  Once everything is possible, you often don't care anymore.\n\nThe first floating dream I found last night was Cholita, taunting me.  She was changing her blouse inside her bedroom,  or maybe in the garage, while giving me an angry stare.\n\nI had started practicing early enough that it actually might have been the real Cholita.  But no way to verify it, unless I wanted to run from the room, find her, and scare the hell out of her with a crazy story about watching her undress from my bedroom...\n\nThat messed with my \"not caring\" feeling, and she vanished.\n\nFancy got interested at that point, floated over, and I flattered her for a good 30 seconds, insisting I need her to \"anchor\" for me, so I could test out rapid dream in and out again. I explained to her, there were witches I wanted to teach it to.\n\nShe floated a couple of feet closer every 5 seconds, until her face was pressed against mine.\n\nI summoned several dreams in the air, but didn't have enough \"energy\" to get them to be full color and vivid.\n\nIf they are not full color and vivid, which takes a person who's saved up energy, or was born with a lot, you can't enter by that method.\n\nIf they are vivid, you gaze into the dream and find something you can, \"feel\".\n\nSomething not alien.  For instance, you gaze in and see a red convertible.  But that's not enough.  You gaze deeper and notice it has a leather cover on the steering wheel.  With little dangling strands of the leather, so it can \"tie\" on there.\n\nAnd your father had one of those.  You can remember how that feels in your hands, so you gaze at it.\n\nAnd you zip right into that dream based on the familiarity of that \"feeling\" inside the dream.\n\nYou literally find yourself standing in the same dream you were watching in the air, although you may be facing a different direction than you saw it from, and need to turn around 360 to orient yourself.\n\nTo exit (better do it in less than 15 seconds or you might not be able to), you \"feel\" the direction from which you came, and turn your head to glance back there.\n\nThat's what having energy does.\n\nI'm not sure what you do with sex magic, but I doubt they do anything that isn't common in the fake magic discussion groups.  Touchy feely sort of stuff.\n\nPretend stuff.\n\nOn top of that, they have a \"partner\".\n\nNo way can you find enough time to learn magic, under those ominous circumstances.\n\nPossibly in the distant past it was a valid technique, but magic is always buried by greed over time, until it's lost and only the \"inventory\" items are left.", "edited": 1614970264.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gpsbcqv", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you show me somewhere that there&amp;#39;s a community of sex magic practitioners doing actual magic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never heard of anyone succeeding that way.

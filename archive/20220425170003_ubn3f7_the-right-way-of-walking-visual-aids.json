Please check out this page: [Compliation of Quotes on the Right Way of Walking](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/oth28g/the_right_way_of_walking_for_reference/).\n\nFrom Tales of Power - \"Don Juan explained that the position of the fingers did not matter at all, that the only consideration was to draw attention to the arms by clasping the fingers in various unaccustomed ways, and that the important thing was the manner in which the eyes, by being kept unfocused, detected an enormous number of features of the world without being clear about them. He added that the eyes in that state were capable of picking out details which were too fleeting for normal vision.\"\n\nMy experience is that when you hold your attention on those two things while you are walking, you simply don't have any attention left for self-talk. It's exactly as don Juan describes \"flood(ing) ... tonal with information.\" I prefer this practice over sitting or laying meditation for quieting self-talk. We also know that the \"details\" don Juan is mentioning includes visual elements of the second attention, so be on the lookout for colorful sparkle bursts, and puffs, and IOB faces as Dan suggested the other day.\n\nFrom the first occasion I tried the right way of walking I enjoyed it and the fact that it was so good at shutting off internal dialog was simply incredible. Unlike Carlos, I am in rather poor shape, so I personally have noticed don Juan's claims about increased stamina and speed. I also have a very toxic inner-dialog, so I definitely notice when something makes it shut up. For me, it was the easiest thing to put into practice early on in reading Castaneda's books, having no ritual aspects to it at all, and also seeming to be a very low-risk activity in a world of activities seeming to all be of very high risk without a real sorcerer there. I just enjoy the relief I derive from the inner-silence it produces. However, I'm pretty indulgent in the way I practice it, in that I don't really walk all that much and I'm not even remotely looking to stop the world with it, so I don't push continuous silence very hard with it myself, though I'm very sure you could stop the world with it.\n\nSome hand postures and gazes I've used -\n\n[This was the first posture I adopted](https://preview.redd.it/u7fnsdfypov81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40081794b793410769f65a439ae34a64af91b4a7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Another view of the first posture I did](https://preview.redd.it/x68wtxz0qov81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f64e97b19fbf1bf818ad75454149c012f5a189c9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[When I'm feeling confident I go for this one](https://preview.redd.it/0clxlmf6qov81.jpg?width=901&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef7b4c2c2c4d9029c97dcf2231a4a8f3c3213a55)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Another view of the second posture I've tried. It's slightly easier for me to pay attention to, possibly because it's new and unfamiliar](https://preview.redd.it/lrhk232aqov81.jpg?width=1166&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=114dea504e3466cf9a7ea24707a9fd5c9982f0e7)\n\nWith either of those hand postures I'm gently pressing my fingertips into the the palm. The first one is more stealthy and keeps your whole hand much warmer when you are walking in the cold, so I like it for those times. I like the other position a lot too, with the \"antennae\" gathering energy and the circling fingers trapping it. With both hand positions I've noticed that the circled fingers pressed into the palm get nice and warm and thereby seem to gather energy. Also, the finger tips have bunches of minute energy centers, so a posture that stimulates them is probably not a bad idea.\n\nFor the eye position, I've done both \"crossed\" and \"staring into infinity\" (uncrossed) eye positions. I find that crossed eyes are perhaps a touch better for flooding the tonal with visual information. More important than exactly how you point them is keeping a steady gaze that doesn't require much attention to maintain, and switching away from scanning your surroundings as usual by moving the eyes and head, to directing your attention into your peripheral vision without moving the head or eyes. Any eye position that enables you to do that is a good one.\n\nWhat makes this an effective exercise for gaining inner-silence is feeling your arms and flooding your attention with your visual field simultaneously. I generally find this to be a light contact with inner-silence myself, because I only sustain seconds of silence at a time, but over, and over throughout walking.\n\nI even use short walks in stores, or work environments and I'm always using a backpack or tying my dog's leash to my waist or whatever I need to do to turn every walk into an energy generating experience. Although, one should not expect any wild results from this kind of walking, I have noticed that dark room is more vivid and it's way easier to go from blue zone to green zone on days when I practice it. It's no substitute for dark room, but even a little of the right way of walking gives you a boost in dark room in my experience. By all means, please share your own variations and experiences with this practice.\n\nEdit: I have noticed I like to have eyes pointed slightly above eye level, as suggested in the above quotes. For some time, perhaps due to a misreading or quote I just can't find again, I kept my eyes fixed between my eye level and a point 6 ft away in this practice. Although it is nearly the same when you keep your eye position fixed and attend your peripheral vision, I find looking above the horizon a touch easier for getting silent. In trying that, I found that the peripheral vision is so good one can still watch one's feet when one has trained oneself to pay attention to one's peripheral vision while having the eyes pointed slightly above one's eye level.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Right Way of Walking - Visual Aids", "link_flair_richtext":

In trying that, I found that the peripheral vision is so good one can still watch one&amp;#39;s feet when one has trained oneself to pay attention to one&amp;#39;s peripheral vision while having the eyes pointed slightly above one&amp;#39;s eye level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZQbZKxtL0Fi-fTuo9kox9-v1TmwMqGsyIDIfcvmOoIA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=da61e9e8c58d68d914f8977e7e74b2f18ebac177", "width": 1200, "height": 1200}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZQbZKxtL0Fi-fTuo9kox9-v1TmwMqGsyIDIfcvmOoIA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02600484bee78e74a34572997a9b954bbe628a2f", "width": 108, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZQbZKxtL0Fi-fTuo9kox9-v1TmwMqGsyIDIfcvmOoIA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de73c1950e56103288dd9f9555187691995d54b5", "width": 216, "height": 216}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZQbZKxtL0Fi-fTuo9kox9-v1TmwMqGsyIDIfcvmOoIA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d57a46006a90929047e5600fc1f315420435830", "width": 320, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZQbZKxtL0Fi-fTuo9kox9-v1TmwMqGsyIDIfcvmOoIA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e2eb5236c2318cf30ff66d74f777713c69f5486", "width": 640, "height": 640}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZQbZKxtL0Fi-fTuo9kox9-v1TmwMqGsyIDIfcvmOoIA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8445866d746963e0c9ae76ab7585abab6f6fb121", "width": 960, "height": 960}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZQbZKxtL0Fi-fTuo9kox9-v1TmwMqGsyIDIfcvmOoIA.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82bca9df9eca07531c1b6fcf55bc84c698894afa", "width": 1080, "height": 1080}], "variants": {}, "id": "b7Hkj5v_sy9CXFJoAkwJ3h_pi4OIpzlUJGn2B3fbg4Q"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1a0d5e9c-6005-11ea-8472-0e86798f0183", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ubn3f7", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ubn3f7/the_right_way_of_walking_visual_aids/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ubn3f7/the_right_way_of_walking_visual_aids/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1650898803.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ubn3f7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i65xwju", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i65xfxh", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "I love the \"right way of driving!\" I've had to drive so much for work and I did that a lot!\n\nNothing like silence to make a drive go fast!\n\nThat said, yes, neither did anything like darkroom for me. \n\nVery nice ways to get silent outside of dark room though.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the &amp;quot;right way of driving!&amp;quot;

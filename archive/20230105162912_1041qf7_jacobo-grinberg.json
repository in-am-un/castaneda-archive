He studied Mexican shamanism, Eastern disciplines, meditation, astrology and telepathy through the scientific method. He wrote more than 50 books about these subjects. Grinberg disappeared in December 1994.\n\nJacobo might have been the IDEAL man to take over for Carlos.\n\nHoward was a \"chinese man\", and as Carlos stated, thus he was really screwed up.\n\nI can attest to that, having an office in a Chinese country.\n\nAmerican engineers who have worked with the chinese will readily agree, they are \"really screwed up\".\n\nIt's like this math formula:   Asia =  (River of Shit) \\^ 2 + (entertainment compensation package)\n\nThat's asia in the worst parts like Japan, Formosa,  and China.\n\nNaturally I go there for the entertainment compensation package, but when I discuss that sort of thing I get mega bad players like O'Neil writing blogs saying I'm not saintly enough to be in this subreddit helping people.\n\nThe \"compensation package\" in Asia is that they don't think like that at all.\n\n\"It can't be helped\" is their motto when it comes to topics like that.\n\nBut the rest of the time they're really screwed up.\n\nThe united nations classifies Japan as a \"Shame Based Culture\".\n\nLetting your family down is at the top of that list.\n\nNext is your public image.  People kill themselves over the loss of their imagined \"good image\".\n\nShaming your ancestors follows that. Asians don't worry \"what would Jesus say?\"\n\nThey worry what their dead grandfather would think.\n\nThey even purchase $1M paper currency and draw pictures of scissors and other grooming stuff you might find handy in the afterlife, and burn them at the temple. To keep their ancestor well furnished.\n\nIt's called, \"Ghost Money\". You can find it at any large Chinese market, near the knives and incense burners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/in44ynadv8aa1.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb32aee5d84476074acc9338ca9c92019262f506\n\nSo Howard would not be a good sorcery leader.  But Carlos tried to interest him anyway.\n\nTony Karim was ideal, being a young double male.  Perfect for the job!\n\nBut Tony wanted endorsement.  Not magic.\n\nSo he's off licking the feet of that horrible fraud, \"The Dali Lama\".\n\nI'm not sure Tony will ever realize what he gave up.\n\nBuddhists seem to just get angry if anyone tries to point out the obvious.\n\nBuddhism doesn't work!\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if that attack last week with the guy trying to \"prove Castaneda was a fraud\" to us, wasn't just a Buddhist protecting his own feelings by trying to \"disprove us\".\n\nWe're a threat to any asian system.\n\nSo we didn't get Tony as our new leader,  due to his own greed.\n\nSame for Howard.  Carlos gifted him with a \"blank check\". That mention in \"Fire From Within\".\n\nHoward decided to use it as a retirement plan, since kungfu is notoriously hard to earn a living with.\n\nHe created \"weird kung fu\", following in the footsteps of Carlos.\n\nWho by the way, was accused of stealing from Howard.\n\nActually it's the other way around.\n\nWith no Tony and no Howard, Carlos tried something bizarre.\n\nSell his house to three of his male students.\n\nI have no idea what that would have looked like, but when it wasn't going to happen without more effort, he pretended it was a stalking maneuver and dropped the idea.\n\nAnd we ended up with what we have now.  Female top heavy organizations that haven't kept up with the task.\n\nThey stopped where Carlos left off, and as a result the reputation of Carlos went into the toilet.\n\nNo magic.   Just talk.\n\nPeople needed to see real magic!  Especially with the rise of the internet, and \"google\".\n\nAnd then along came the vultures like Sergio, who is buying expensive top search results from google to push his crappy \"Dream yourself and manifest your desires using Toltec Dreaming\" workshops.\n\nShameful crap!  I sure hope no one in here can't see right through this childish attempt to trick people.\n\nBut it's so bad out there, I get into trouble for pointing out a wicked con artist like Sergio.\n\nBy the way, if you hear someone say, \"But Sergio helped me\".\n\nThat means, the person who finds Sergio helpful, is also thinking about stealing in the same manner, and likes that Sergio seems to be \"getting away with it\".\n\nWe've been visited here by \"Sergio supporters\". In various forms.  Not all supporting just that fraud.  Some supporting others.\n\nAlways bad men they turn out to be.  Men bent on theft.\n\nBut Sergio won't get away with it any longer.\n\nHere's his banner.  Remember, those google top clicks are very expensive.  I've paid as much as $5 for a well qualified top search result click through.  I can't imagine Sergio doesn't pay at least $0.10\n\nSo he's aggressively trying to fool people with this total crap banner:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0i7c215ks8aa1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=013b9573321eb6537db74b4aaa147fbf16b0ec58\n\nI suppose I need you to see that, to explain why Miles wasn't a viable choice.\n\nMiles has sort of done the same himself.  Except that he's fully qualified to teach what he teaches.\n\nStill, it's unseemly if you ask me.  He doesn't put magic first above all else!  He even has a boring interview on Youtube calling Carlos, \"Doctor Castaneda\".\n\nAs if that defined who he was!\n\nI'd like to hear, \"OH MY GOD!  IT'S ALL TRUE!!!\"\n\nBut Miles doesn't seem to know that.\n\nOr possibly, Miles and Aerin was a \"unit\" and Carlos didn't want to reduce his chances of success by breaking up that \"faction\".\n\nAnd perhaps Miles would have made a better choice in the long run, seeing as how we got no male leader at all.\n\nHard to say.  I don't know Miles.\n\nCholita loves him.\n\nBut he didn't provide any strong male leadership over on his side, and so the reputation of Carlos was destroyed.\n\nBut what about Jacobo?\n\nHe would have been ideal.\n\nIn fact, Carlos tried to promote what Grinberg was exploring.\n\nChildren who can read newspapers with their feet.\n\nPsychic surgery.\n\nBruce Wager, the \"inner circle\" man who might even have known Soledad the witch, who tinkered with Star Wars, also promoted what Jacobo wrote about.\n\nHe made a mini-series about psychic surgeons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zz6zpzaet8aa1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e565456e496b099cf981758a513e3edee929d79d\n\nI'm not a big fan of Maria Sabina, a woman Jacobo also wrote about.\n\nBut who didn't?\n\nMaria was a publicity whore.\n\nShe even had Disney lined up, maybe to put into one of those Pixar cartoons?\n\nI'd watch that one!\n\nImagine the woke Disney latina child heroine cartoons, with Maria as the kindly grandmother?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zpi0rcpt8aa1.png?width=1160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=229829a344218e1a0126e9311052b8d0fe83cd95\n\nThat was Jacob's view of sorcery.\n\nHe wasn't a \"purist\".  Shamanism, sorcery.\n\nIt was all the same to Jacobo.\n\nBut he would have worked.\n\nExcept he just disappeared...\n\nMysteriously.\n\nAnother possible \"fliers\" topic?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI purchased some new animation moves. Wish I could find some tango.\n\nAnd yes, Cholita still needs adjusted lighting on the face. She was at the academy awards going up an incline when that picture was snapped.  Upper face was too brightly lit.\n\nBut I need to edit that curl on her hair also.\n\nAnd it's \"skippy\" because that's not \"rendered\".  It's just a screen capture in real time.\n\nIn fact, \"Little Smoke\" in moth form takes 3 seconds just to render a single picture of her now.\n\nToo much fuzz.\n\nI need to rename her \"bones\", so that she can dance along with Cholita.\n\nI saw the two of them playing quite a few times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMakes me wonder all women don't buddy up to their inorganic beings.  Taisha cuddles with Pheobus all night long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1041qf7/video/pcy1fd882baa1/player\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title":

Not magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he&amp;#39;s off licking the feet of that horrible fraud, &amp;quot;The Dali Lama&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure Tony will ever realize what he gave up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhists seem to just get angry if anyone tries to point out the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhism doesn&amp;#39;t work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if that attack last week with the guy trying to &amp;quot;prove Castaneda was a fraud&amp;quot; to us, wasn&amp;#39;t just a Buddhist protecting his own feelings by trying to &amp;quot;disprove us&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re a threat to any asian system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we didn&amp;#39;t get Tony as our new leader,  due to his own greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for Howard.  Carlos gifted him with a &amp;quot;blank check&amp;quot;. That mention in &amp;quot;Fire From Within&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howard decided to use it as a retirement plan, since kungfu is notoriously hard to earn a living with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He created &amp;quot;weird kung fu&amp;quot;, following in the footsteps of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who by the way, was accused of stealing from Howard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually it&amp;#39;s the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With no Tony and no Howard, Carlos tried something bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sell his house to three of his male students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what that would have looked like, but when it wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen without more effort, he pretended it was a stalking maneuver and dropped the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we ended up with what we have now.  Female top heavy organizations that haven&amp;#39;t kept up with the task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They stopped where Carlos left off, and as a result the reputation of Carlos went into the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No magic.   Just talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People needed to see real magic!  Especially with the rise of the internet, and &amp;quot;google&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then along came the vultures like Sergio, who is buying expensive top search results from google to push his crappy &amp;quot;Dream yourself and manifest your desires using Toltec Dreaming&amp;quot; workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shameful crap!  I sure hope no one in here can&amp;#39;t see right through this childish attempt to trick people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s so bad out there, I get into trouble for pointing out a wicked con artist like Sergio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you hear someone say, &amp;quot;But Sergio helped me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, the person who finds Sergio helpful, is also thinking about stealing in the same manner, and likes that Sergio seems to be &amp;quot;getting away with it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been visited here by &amp;quot;Sergio supporters&amp;quot;. In various forms.  Not all supporting just that fraud.  Some supporting others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always bad men they turn out to be.  Men bent on theft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Sergio won&amp;#39;t get away with it any longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s his banner.  Remember, those google top clicks are very expensive.  I&amp;#39;ve paid as much as $5 for a well qualified top search result click through.  I can&amp;#39;t imagine Sergio doesn&amp;#39;t pay at least $0.10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he&amp;#39;s aggressively trying to fool people with this total crap banner:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0i7c215ks8aa1.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=013b9573321eb6537db74b4aaa147fbf16b0ec58\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0i7c215ks8aa1.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=013b9573321eb6537db74b4aaa147fbf16b0ec58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I need you to see that, to explain why Miles wasn&amp;#39;t a viable choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miles has sort of done the same himself.  Except that he&amp;#39;s fully qualified to teach what he teaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, it&amp;#39;s unseemly if you ask me.  He doesn&amp;#39;t put magic first above all else!  He even has a boring interview on Youtube calling Carlos, &amp;quot;Doctor Castaneda&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if that defined who he was!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to hear, &amp;quot;OH MY GOD!  IT&amp;#39;S ALL TRUE!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Miles doesn&amp;#39;t seem to know that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or possibly, Miles and Aerin was a &amp;quot;unit&amp;quot; and Carlos didn&amp;#39;t want to reduce his chances of success by breaking up that &amp;quot;faction&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And perhaps Miles would have made a better choice in the long run, seeing as how we got no male leader at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard to say.  I don&amp;#39;t know Miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita loves him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he didn&amp;#39;t provide any strong male leadership over on his side, and so the reputation of Carlos was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about Jacobo?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would have been ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, Carlos tried to promote what Grinberg was exploring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Children who can read newspapers with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Psychic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bruce Wager, the &amp;quot;inner circle&amp;quot; man who might even have known Soledad the witch, who tinkered with Star Wars, also promoted what Jacobo wrote about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He made a mini-series about psychic surgeons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zz6zpzaet8aa1.png?width=220&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e565456e496b099cf981758a513e3edee929d79d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zz6zpzaet8aa1.png?width=220&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e565456e496b099cf981758a513e3edee929d79d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of Maria Sabina, a woman Jacobo also wrote about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But who didn&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maria was a publicity whore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even had Disney lined up, maybe to put into one of those Pixar cartoons?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d watch that one!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine the woke Disney latina child heroine cartoons, with Maria as the kindly grandmother?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4zpi0rcpt8aa1.png?width=1160&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=229829a344218e1a0126e9311052b8d0fe83cd95\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4zpi0rcpt8aa1.png?width=1160&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=229829a344218e1a0126e9311052b8d0fe83cd95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was Jacob&amp;#39;s view of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;purist&amp;quot;.

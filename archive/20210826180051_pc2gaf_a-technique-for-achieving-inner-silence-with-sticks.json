I wanted to upload a pic of my paperweight from the Tensegrity days which has &amp;quot;Tensegrity&amp;quot; written on one side and &amp;quot;Silence&amp;quot; on the other but couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how to do it on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I could add one more I&amp;#39;d add this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting outside and gazing at the intricacies of  a rock or a leaf. Diving into the world of a natural object has a profound silencing effect -- a bona fide pathway to silence.  I think you or Juann mentioned this one earlier. This can also be done indoors.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great list.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pc2gaf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pc2gaf/a_technique_for_achieving_inner_silence_with/hbcjvlg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1630607824.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "haku8ky", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1630083924.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_pc2gaf", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "New people:\n\nCarlos had lots of \"props\" trying to get his \"lazy dog\" private class people to practice silence.\n\nThey all would work, but no one did them. They kept waiting for someone else to try it first, and prove it was worth their valuable time.\n\n\\#1: Sit next to a coffee table, cross legged, and lean forward until your forehead is pressing against the table, right near the edge. I don't think you have to worry too much about the position.  As long as you're leaning onto it, with something pressing on your forehead above the nose, that's enough to give you a distraction so you can force silence.\n\n\\#2: go for a walk, and curl the fingers of both hands to keep your attention on those. Gaze slightly up at the horizon, and use your peripheral vision to \"see everything\", without focusing on anything in particular. Force silence.\n\n\\#3: Get a wooden pole, maybe 3 feet long, and 1.5 inches in diameter.  Put a little \"cushion\" on top.  Cholita uses a piece of nice black vinyl cloth, with cotton or sponge padding under, held onto the pole by a big rubber band. She insists it's not for forcing silence, and instead is a tool she uses in her profession.  But, that's what they're like.  Sit cross-legged, then stretch your legs out just enough so that the soles of the feet press together, stick the stick in the space between them, and lean into the padded side, letting it press against your forehead.  Force silence. The stick keeps your head from falling forward and jarring against your chest (when you doze off), but also keeps the focus (pain) on inner silence.\n\nYou can literally \"travel\" like a witch through reality, using this technique. IF you get silent.\n\n\\#4: Find smooth river rocks that fit nicely between all fingers, curl the fingers slightly to keep them in place, then sit in a big comfortable arm chair (arms to you don't fall to the side), close your eyes, and force silence.  Squeeze hard on the rocks, if you keep failing to get all words from your mind.  Drawing blood is optional, but getting slight bruises between your fingers is not.\n\n\\#5: Do Tensegrity long forms, while letting all words fade from your mind, using the \"smoothness\" of the moves to help keep you from thinking.  Gaze at the hand when the arm sweeps, so you see it scrolling along by itself.  But it's also ok to \"force\" thoughts out. We aren't Yoga people. Force is fine!\n\n\\#6: Put one thumb under the side of each jaw, with the index finger under the eye, slightly to the side.  Below the outside of the eye itself. These are acupuncture points.  Squeeze slightly, pressing the thumb \"up\", and the finger \"down\".  Don't overdo it or in 2 days you'll think you're coming down with a virus, and your glands under the sides of the chin are swollen.  They bruise easily!\n\n\\#7. Press down on the bone on the very top of the head with one finger or your thumb and hold for a few seconds.\n\n\\#8. Cross the arms and \"pinch an inch\" as the famous gay exercise guru likes to say.  On the thin part on the rib cage, just below the armpits.  Squeeze the hell out of it!  Should hurt like the dickens the first time.\n\nNaturally those \"pressure point\" ones are only to generate helpful \"energy\", and you sill have to suffer by forcing out thoughts.\n\n\\#9: Shout, \"Intent!    Intent!!   Intent!!!\" out doors, as loud as you can. It's ok to hide, or do it as your care goes into a noisy overpass on the freeway, and no one can hear much of anything.  Keep it in your mind, you want to learn to be silent.\n\n\\#10: Place a leather paper weight, or a palm sized flat and rounded river rock onto your stomach while you lay on your back.  Don't ask me exactly where.  It's embarassing...\n\nBut women store dark energy there.

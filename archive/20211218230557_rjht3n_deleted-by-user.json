A false narrative, and will not help you learn sorcery.\n\nIt's just the Japanese doing what the Japanese do.  They have the very same driver's test course for everyone in Japan.  Anywhere you go, same test course. They still use word processor machines.  They're fixated on the idea there's only one way to do things correctly, and Zen wreaks of it.\n\nZen is not wise, does not get you very far, and it turns men into angry bullies on giant ego trips.\n\nTheir idea of enlightenment is nothing. It's a side effect in our darkroom practices.  You have to pass that far by, to learn sorcery.\n\nWhy not practice dark room in here until you learn to move the assemblage point, and then rethink your book deal Zen obsession?  You only got into that, because you couldn't find a real shaman to teach you.\n\nSome of the worst to come in here and blow up in anger, are interested in Zen. They cooked up the idea to \"be the first to  understand Castaneda\", by adding Zen to it.\n\nIt's a common \"plan to take over the world of sorcery.\"\n\nBut they always freak out when faced with the real thing in here.\n\nBuddhism in general is a very bad false narrative.  Easterners don't fall for it, the way westerners do.  I suppose anything Asian seems wise to us. But not to Asians.  They know all about how to twist words to tickle the \"wise\" funny bone.\n\nFor instance, the Buddhist temple in Tokyo sells little girls to important businessmen, and has corrupted Japanese politics for years.  And the Japanese know, Zen archers are so bad they don't even qualify for the high school archery team.  And their thing about getting the body to shoot, is not magic.  It's just the cerebellum doing what the cerebellum does.\n\nPatanjali's flying sutra does the same thing, but when you catch a glass falling off the table before you notice it, you are doing that also.\n\nIt's nothing special.\n\nBut it tricks the monks into thinking something profound is happening.  \"It shot!\" from the American book on the topic.\n\nNo, it didn't.  That's delusional.\n\nAnyway, you can learn in a dark room to manipulate \"intent\".  That's what you want.\n\nIt will appear as a wall of whitish light, right in front of you, and you can do just about anything you can think of, using your fingers to tickle it.\n\nOur reality is created from \"the emanations\", which of course, Zen masters are oblivious to.\n\nBy removing the internal dialogue (something Zen masters never really achieve or they wouldn't be so boring),  you can get your assemblage point to move.\n\nThey also have no knowledge of the assemblage point, even though it's the most important thing to a human that there is.\n\nIt makes us human!  Or we can select another form.\n\nWe use darkness mostly, in here, because once the assemblage point starts to move weird stuff becomes visible in the air.\n\nYou gaze it it, and it pulls your assemblage point along the path we call, \"The J Curve\", shown to us by Carlos as an emergency measure, when he realized he was dying.\n\nYou can read in here what happens next, but I warn you, it would make a Zen master's head explode to hear about it.  He can't do it, and has been lying to his students about magic for his entire career.\n\nNo magic, no enlightenment. That's the truth.

You can form power objects from it, including remote viewing orbs (my favorite), or you can simply pull cute toys from the air, and place them on your bed.\n\nThere's pictures of that in here.\n\nWe do everything with our eyes open, walking around.

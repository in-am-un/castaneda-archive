Just lay on their side, fully awake, went into a vague phantom dream, then copied the position they were laying in and went to sleep for the first time, in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&amp;#39;s why Carlos wrote that god awful book, &amp;quot;The Art of Dreaming&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one that unleashed a hoard of angry men on our community, all pretending endlessly and never doing any real work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_z3rznn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/z3rznn/black_friday_animation_sale/ixqykdd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1669395843.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ixqs52o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "oimerde", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1669392955.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_z3rznn", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6kyce", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I may be lost, but what does this has to do with Castaneda?

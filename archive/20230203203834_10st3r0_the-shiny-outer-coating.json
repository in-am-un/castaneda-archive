But I'll leave you to discover that.\n\nIn our own community of Castaneda fans, you even find magic deniers.\n\nThese are typically people who are pretending to learn sorcery, but you make them feel bad when you point out it's supposed to be real. Just like in the books.\n\nSome have even been cheated by bad men like Kachora, who teach them that some things from the books of Carlos are true, and some are made up.\n\nI never got to see such a thing in person but I suspect they teach something totally false, and years later when what Calos says contradicts it, they use the \"Carlos went bad\" excuse.\n\nAnd claim that's been made up.  Sometimes it's as simple as, \"It wasn't in the first 4 books!\"\n\nAnd those first 4 books are all they needed to read, in order to create their con game.  So anything past that has to be a fake.\n\nExcept of course, no one they teach ever actually learns any real magic.\n\nSo this topic of a \"shiny outer coating\" became quite controversial when Carlos began to talk about it, around 1995.\n\nIt goes like this.\n\n\"The Fliers\" are a special form of inorganic being, likely from the Pleiades cluster.\n\nFrom \"The sisters\".  Or \"The cousins\" in some cultures.\n\nEvery native culture has stories about the Pleiades cluster. You can't miss it, even at sunset or sunrise when the sky isn't quite dark enough to see the other stars.  \n\nBut supposedly some inorganic beings who live there discovered earth, and found they could lick energy off our shiny egg shell until there was only a glow left at our toes.\n\nCarlos said it was like licking the powdered sugar off the outside of a donut, leaving it bare down to the plate on which it sits.\n\nAt that point the \"tastiest\" energy they can find is all that's left.\n\nThat \"bottom shiny coating.\n\n\"Self Pity\" energy.\n\nBut if you can fight self-pity,  shut off the internal dialogue, do tensegrity with Kylie Fierceness, and generally try to avoid \"indulging\", that coating might raise up a little bit.\n\nWhen it got to our ankles in private classes Carlos got excited.\n\nHe could look out at  the class and see we'd made progress.\n\nThen the next day it was back down below our toes.\n\nCarlos got quite upset on seeing that.   In one day we burned off all of his hard earned gains?\n\nWhich of course just made him seem like a crazy moody guru.\n\nBut he was in fact simply reacting to what was actually going on.\n\nWe were self-indulgent,  and most likely hopeless lost causes.\n\nBUT, if he could just get us to have a \"good spell\" for a month or two,  and rise our energy all the way to our knees, the force of the shiny outer coating might take over.\n\nAnd prevent the fliers from focusing on us anymore.\n\nWith so many self-pity filled humans on earth, why would they want to lick someone who's energy didn't taste good anymore?\n\nAnd it stops tasting the way they like if you can only get it to rise up above your knees.  \n\nSo that it's not just the  \"poor baby me...\" type energy you find between your toes.\n\nYou'll learn about self-pity when you can move your assemblage point to the orange zone on the J curve. \n\nIt's not a pretend topic. It's very real!\n\nAt that point, when the fliers give up on you,  it'll keep rising until you start to see incredible sights while doing darkroom.\n\nLike these examples of the \"shiny outer coating\" being directed by the gaze.\n\nI've uncovered at least 5 different ways to view this.\n\nThere's the golden sparkles with the \"eye\" of la Gorda in the middle.\n\nThere's yellowish white sparkles without the eye, which can be used for general purpose magic.\n\nThere's the blue sparkles of the energy body,  when he's formed into your double and you can \"step into him\" a little.  Just overlap with it, and you can borrow the eyes.\n\nLean back a bit and push the chest forward, to stretch the back and project dreaming energy that's crusted back there. So that crusted energy from the back will merge with the view of the double.  \n\nThat blue will cause you to pass out if you get it right!\n\nSame for the golden light.\n\nThere's also orange, which can be \"stirred down\" from your upper right.  Raise your right arm up there towards the ceiling, immediately above your right shoulder.  And move it in a slow clockwise circle around 1 foot in diameter.   \n\n\nIf you are totally silent and have seen it before, the \"orange streaks\" will collect on your arm, and you can turn around and cast them into the room.\n\nTo form amazingly perfect highlights on a specific phantom room you have been working on.\n\nI'll have to animate that one.\n\nAnother shiny outer coating view is the \"red chaos\" above you.\n\nI don't know why I believe this, but it's a window into the pure nagual.\n\nWhen you look into it no thoughts about it are possible, and it begins to dissolve your very being.\n\nBut I haven't time to draw that, and we still don't have more views of such things from other practitioners.\n\nThose are out there in uncharted territory.\n\nUnlike the puffs, the whitish light,  and inorganic being manifestations.\n\nWhich Carlos taught us about.  The puffs themselves are integral to Tensegrity!\n\nThose fall into the realm of \"Castaneda verified darkroom sights\".\n\nPast Silent Knowledge?\n\nWe don't yet have \"verified accounts\".", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Shiny Outer Coating", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/b061bb3a-9e7f-4aa9-aa7a-e852027799a8", "link_ids": ["t3_ufe5n7", "t3_uqjb1b", "t3_v0blwa", "t3_vet0rc", "t3_vj02xm", "t3_vl5y3u", "t3_vljtnc", "t3_vofz7z", "t3_vskr8w", "t3_vw90yz", "t3_w06vvt", "t3_w0ef1w", "t3_w4ku1c", "t3_w69oc4", "t3_wtav5p", "t3_wzr75t", "t3_x08z4q", "t3_x394xi", "t3_x5hqin", "t3_xiqr6m", "t3_xqg5yk", "t3_yb5su0", "t3_yntpxe", "t3_yzvbf2", "t3_z29k0l", "t3_yzfldm", "t3_z6na2c", "t3_zbtriz", "t3_zuotse", "t3_zuck9m", "t3_zxxeke", "t3_zycipg", "t3_10cnn2l", "t3_10lm2xt", "t3_10og6ip", "t3_10st3r0", "t3_10t7r08", "t3_10tlqmo", "t3_112wgv2", "t3_11a9k43", "t3_11b31re", "t3_11mk18w", "t3_11mrueg", "t3_11ukc7r", "t3_11x2mm6", "t3_137rsam", "t3_13ink97", "t3_13sgu3u", "t3_13vt16r", "t3_146ari6", "t3_14hgshp", "t3_14n3guj", "t3_14nzehw", "t3_14rbo3d", "t3_159f5xc", "t3_15epoo9", "t3_15ivrij", "t3_15mmpi9", "t3_161dw6x", "t3_16tme3p", "t3_16vhq77", "t3_17hp09f", "t3_1892kzi", "t3_18d01eh", "t3_1aevm5d", "t3_1aflfh4", "t3_1aj65ur", "t3_1awevc6", "t3_1ayafsg", "t3_1b51fqk", "t3_1b88jgx", "t3_1bhyfsq"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 3", "created_at_utc": 1651408248.875, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "b061bb3a-9e7f-4aa9-aa7a-e852027799a8", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1714464584.911, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2nldn0dvx0ga1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59f5e837bcc3e2af79ba41dbc0f5feddd8b76898"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8c17357b776e5e447e9322591aca870b65e06b7"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a09a4b3751ec41c6fed73c5ea324892fb45fd7fe"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a91e8851fc3b01f3766d3afed28a343ed12e5f3"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aeff0009d185bc7b37702d736f5ff6cd70084c9"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9728c2fa43b3f91edd2e81bbea5279e8daeab3c6"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359ab1da8188bc56109c37e9a65741b785e3271b"}, "id": "2nldn0dvx0ga1"}}, "name": "t3_10st3r0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7P-C8JTw6ReN5pN64ZFh5qIPFwl3NVo2fbT9gTE5Tyw.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1675453114.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=359ab1da8188bc56109c37e9a65741b785e3271b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/2nldn0dvx0ga1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=359ab1da8188bc56109c37e9a65741b785e3271b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only do we have &amp;quot;magic deniers&amp;quot;

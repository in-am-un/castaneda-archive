So it&amp;#39;s portrayed by a lame smiling meditation guy, just sitting there enjoying his greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to escape that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity is the escape route.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The red zone is WONDERFUL.  Too wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could spend all night every night, building magical machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way Merlin the Magician is portrayed as doing inside the church, in bibles from the 1600s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Not the king james).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the red zone is the land of &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Endless meaningful, meanings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why psychonauts are doomed to fail. They get lost in the &amp;quot;deep spiritual meanings&amp;quot;, and become  hopeless to ever learn real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to pass that into the void of the orange zone, and learn to see energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this only works, if you find some REAL MAGIC, and then use deeper silence to make it stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recap helps you get more of your energy back, so it increases the vividness of darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is good!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the last 27 years since Carlos left us, not a single person doing recapitulation and tensegrity as their &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; has gotten anywhere useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t really even believe there&amp;#39;s magic in our sorcery, even though that&amp;#39;s what lured them into it in the first place, through the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, we get attacked by delusional Cleargreen followers, wanting us to stop and make a &amp;quot;journal&amp;quot; instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join them in mental masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to understand the amazing nonsense trying to stop us, except to agree with Carlos there has to be some evil intelligence behind it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the advice to you is FIGHT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fight, fight, fight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women don&amp;#39;t have to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do have to be serious and regular in their practice, and explore methodically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11g5r00/efficient_use_of_practice_time/jamzih2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677774167.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_11g5r00", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jb73f4h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "curious__bug", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1678142965.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_janv3lt", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_752dpv4g", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thanks.\n\nI\u2019ve switched up my daily routine so that I can do 3 continuous hours before bed.

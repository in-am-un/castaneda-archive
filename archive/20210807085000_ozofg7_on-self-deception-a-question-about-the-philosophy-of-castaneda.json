It's clockless logic, running up to 400 beats per second, over 100 billion neurons.\n\nYour internal dialogue is a puny smart phone ap, to remind you of your schedule. \n\nIt's using just an extremely bit of that huge computer, in order to tell you the results of all that processing.\n\nBut you already \"know\" the results, or you wouldn't be able to speak them in your internal dialogue.\n\nSo removing the internal dialogue IMPROVES thinking.

Meditation does it by repeating a mantra or some other words, or by visualizing a golden buddha, or whatever they do.  To \"substitute\" something else for the internal dialogue. But self-reflection still remains.\n\nShamanic drumming moves it just as far as meditation, if you listen to the sound and let your internal dialogue reduce.\n\nBoth only get you to the green line, although meditation can occasionally reach the red line on the J curve.\n\nSo, anything \"cool\" or \"supernatural\", will only happen if your assemblage point moves.\n\nIf the tank helps reduce self-reflection, then just try to find something \"weird\" to look at, while you keep your internal dialogue off.\n\nColors floating, mini-dreams, dozing off and waking up, and seeing the remains of something that isn't there.\n\nIf you get lucky and see something continuously, keep watching to see if your assemblage point will move even further.\n\nThings get weird and more vivid if that happens.\n\nPuffs of color floating or swirling around you would be a good sign.\n\nJust watch them, with the best silence you can manage.\n\nIf you hit a \"plateau\", you need to shift horizontally instead of in depth, if you want more bizarre stuff to happen.\n\nThe instructions for that are, \"play with what you find, as if it were real\".\n\nYou could use various hand positions to see if you can make any colors you see, behave differently.

They can add the glow of awareness to any emanations in your view.\n\nBut remember this key point:\n\nYou can't learn sorcery!  It's impossible.\n\nAll you can do is hook yourself to the old seers by practicing their exact techniques.\n\nOnce you are \"hooked\" to their phantom reality, it will pull you along.\n\nAnd the techniques begin to work.\n\nIf you try to add in something else from outside you break your link, and nothing happens.\n\nThe reason meditation works a little bit is, you tied yourself to the intent of those who invented that meditation.\n\nBut they never got very far.

It&amp;#39;s clockless logic, running up to 400 beats per second, over 100 billion neurons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your internal dialogue is a puny smart phone ap, to remind you of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s using just an extremely bit of that huge computer, in order to tell you the results of all that processing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you already &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; the results, or you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to speak them in your internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So removing the internal dialogue IMPROVES thinking. It doesn&amp;#39;t eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what to do in a dark tank...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A double woman I was stalking was interested in those, but we never got her into one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever they do, I can do 1000 times more anywhere there&amp;#39;s some darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sloshing around just sounds like a barrier to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if you want your assemblage point to move, you need silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tanks move it by the very slight reduction in internal dialogue they can produce, the same as meditation does. Meditation does it by repeating a mantra or some other words, or by visualizing a golden buddha, or whatever they do.  To &amp;quot;substitute&amp;quot; something else for the internal dialogue. But self-reflection still remains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shamanic drumming moves it just as far as meditation, if you listen to the sound and let your internal dialogue reduce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both only get you to the green line, although meditation can occasionally reach the red line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, anything &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;supernatural&amp;quot;, will only happen if your assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the tank helps reduce self-reflection, then just try to find something &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; to look at, while you keep your internal dialogue off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Colors floating, mini-dreams, dozing off and waking up, and seeing the remains of something that isn&amp;#39;t there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get lucky and see something continuously, keep watching to see if your assemblage point will move even further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things get weird and more vivid if that happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Puffs of color floating or swirling around you would be a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just watch them, with the best silence you can manage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you hit a &amp;quot;plateau&amp;quot;, you need to shift horizontally instead of in depth, if you want more bizarre stuff to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The instructions for that are, &amp;quot;play with what you find, as if it were real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could use various hand positions to see if you can make any colors you see, behave differently.  Emphasize you palm because there are faint lines of energy coming from them. They can add the glow of awareness to any emanations in your view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But remember this key point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t learn sorcery!

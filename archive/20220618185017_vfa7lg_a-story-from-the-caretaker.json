Especially those obsessed with attention seeking, coming from subreddits where lying and pretending is a given.  Like the Magick subreddits.\n\nWhere make believe is the real thing.\n\nSo the story goes, a little girl had a father who was never home.  He couldn't get along with her mother.\n\nBut she craved his approval.\n\nHe liked cars, and when she pointed out a car on the road she liked, he gave her lots of attention over it.\n\nAnd more than anything else in the world, she wanted his admiration.\n\nNot specifically his love.  She knew he loved her, but it wasn't enough to keep him around.\n\nShe made up her mind to buy that car.  The pink convertible.\n\nHer mother humored her, telling her that anything was possible if she worked hard and had patience.\n\nThe evil neighbor boy noticed her obsession, and decided to take advantage of it.\n\nHe had her running a lemonade stand for him, and even got her to bake cookies and cup cakes to sell.\n\nShe used up her mothers ingredients for all of it, but her mother thought it was good for her to have to some clear goals and purpose.  \n\nThe evil neighbor boy took full advantage of her, including stuff I won't mention.\n\nHe also kept all the money.  And never paid the mother for all the lost resources.\n\nBut the little girl worked so hard, and advertised her lemonade stand all over the school, until the evil boy felt compelled to finally pay her some money.\n\nFortunately she was too young to understand money, so he only needed to give her $2 in change.\n\nIt went to her head.  She became angry and militant to all the kids who said she'd never be able to buy that pink convertible.\n\nShe'd hold out her little  hand, and shout, \"See!!!  I have the money now!\"\n\nAnd she truly believed that.\n\nThat's what the green zone does to people.

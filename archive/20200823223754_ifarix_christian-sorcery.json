Sometimes I hear a claim the Buddhists did that, but when you check out the dates for the texts, you find they are in dispute.\n\nThey're back-dated prophecies.\n\nAnd what the Jews wanted wasn't all that bad.\n\nBe nice!\n\nDon't murder people.\n\nLearn basic hygiene.  Back at a time, when no one else had a clue about that sort of thing.\n\nAnd of course don't mess with another person's mate.\n\nOr at least, don't get caught.\n\nSeems reasonable to me.\n\nHowever, if doing magic meant you got to say what God wants, other religions would have that claim to fame too.\n\nAnd they don't agree on the matter.\n\nI've seen magic with my own eyes, so I'm sure the Celts could do it, and of course actual shamans all over the world.\n\nThere is magic! Or we wouldn't have any religions. They're all based on someone doing magic at some point.\n\nAlso, the bible says, \"Behold, I foretold you all things!\"\n\nBut it didn't.\n\nSee my post today.  No one mentioned that.\n\nBottom line: Believe Christianity if you like, it's not incompatible.\n\nJust agree you believe in Christ.\n\nAnd believe Judaism if you like.\n\nBut try to learn what the prophets were smoking if you want more fun in life.\n\nAs I recall, the wild ancestor of poppies grew around there.  They were probably brewing dried opium pods with honey at some point.\n\nThat's how \"The Tao\" was discovered. Poppy wine.\n\nSo take your pick.  Join your cultural religion.

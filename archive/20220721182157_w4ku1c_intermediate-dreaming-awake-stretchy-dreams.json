He looked like a medallion of a south american \"sun god\".\n\nI waited for him to speak, but then I forgot what happened after that.\n\nSomehow I vanished from my darkroom.\n\nI came to laying on my side listening to him finish explaining how not to waste sleeping time.\n\nHe reminded me, \"Once you can get silent, all dreams are real.\"\n\nAs I watched that dream fade away the witch from the tunnel, who had stretched a dream all the way to my room so I could try to walk in, got into a car and drove off with the Silent Knowledge entity.\n\n\"Hey!!!

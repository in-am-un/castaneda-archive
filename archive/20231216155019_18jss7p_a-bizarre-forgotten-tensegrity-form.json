So they're congratulating themselves for a group effort.\n\nThat's what you do when you don't have any actual magic.  The attention seeking reward.\n\nI was curious if there was any possibility \"pre-Olmecs\", by anthropological standards putting the Olmecs only 4000 years old, might have run into living Saber Toothed Tigers, and decided to learn to shapeshift into one. So I asked ChatGPT:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nQuestion: Did any humans living 10,000 years ago have personal contact with Saber Toothed Tigers?\n\n**ChatGPT**\n\nNo, humans living 10,000 years ago did not have personal contact with saber-toothed tigers. Saber-toothed tigers, or more accurately saber-toothed cats, belonged to various species, the most famous being Smilodon. These creatures became extinct approximately 10,000 to 11,000 years ago, which coincides with the end of the last Ice Age.\n\nBy the time these animals were facing extinction, early humans certainly coexisted with them for thousands of years. However, direct \"personal contact\" as we might imagine it (such as domestication or close interaction) is highly unlikely. Early human contact with saber-toothed cats would have been largely adversarial or avoidant, as these cats were apex predators.\n\nThe nature of the interactions between early humans and saber-toothed cats is mostly speculative, based on archaeological findings like fossils and cave paintings, which show that early humans coexisted with a variety of large mammals, including saber-toothed cats. But the notion of personal, close contact in the sense of domestication or companionship is not supported by current evidence.\n\nQuestion: Where were cave paintings of saber toothed tigers found?\n\n**ChatGPT**\n\nCave paintings of saber-toothed tigers have not been definitively identified or confirmed. While ancient cave art often depicts a wide range of animals that early humans encountered or hunted, including various Ice Age mammals like mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, and bison, there is no clear evidence of saber-toothed tigers being represented in such art.\n\nThe lack of such depictions could be due to several reasons. First, saber-toothed tigers (Smilodon species) might not have been as common or as significant to the daily life and survival of early humans compared to other animals. Second, the specific regions where Smilodon lived may not overlap significantly with areas known for cave art. For instance, Smilodon was common in the Americas, especially in areas like the La Brea Tar Pits in modern-day Los Angeles, whereas most famous cave art sites are in Europe, such as Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain.\n\nTherefore, while early humans and saber-toothed tigers did coexist, the absence of their depictions in cave paintings might simply reflect the geographical and ecological contexts of prehistoric human life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kx0pu5nm5o6c1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8e9bd7f1155203cf9e00b5d25805866c9d837d8", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Bizarre Forgotten Tensegrity Form?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"kx0pu5nm5o6c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 79, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kx0pu5nm5o6c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a552c08c611b71267aaa237ce244fcda796b1ad"}, {"y": 158, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kx0pu5nm5o6c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3b8b74350e7f2518df99eb159c66283658f5bf1"}, {"y": 234, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kx0pu5nm5o6c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfab736b7767511d6786d01718584411f182c866"}, {"y": 469, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kx0pu5nm5o6c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46beedfd2ebf15475dec82575874106397f3c168"}, {"y": 704, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kx0pu5nm5o6c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aab3f8c0088325c90b3068737fcbbfb80d2727b"}, {"y": 792, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kx0pu5nm5o6c1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f687d2a68f6882f1d419bc58e1481fbcc3538909"}], "s": {"y": 939, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kx0pu5nm5o6c1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8e9bd7f1155203cf9e00b5d25805866c9d837d8"}, "id": "kx0pu5nm5o6c1"}}, "name": "t3_18jss7p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 19, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"267\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPZcpepUgdE?start=3&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Stuff you can pretend.\n\nIf I had time, I'd draw up what I've been seeing lately during darkroom.\n\nBut essentially, when Carlos explained that once the double comes out the abstract becomes visible between the \"here\" and the \"there\", we all kind of know that implies you'll get to perceive it all the time.\n\nCarlos and the witches would say something was \"non-linear\", when they couldn't figure out how to explain it to us.\n\nAnd it was obvious there, they saw that way all the time.\n\nSo in the end, not only do we perceive hundreds of thousands of slight shifts in reality, which are visible during darkroom, but also \"the abstract\", and the non-linear.\n\nI believe the non-linear is the fault of our double, but can't prove it.\n\nIn Silent Knowledge you might see a curious sight in front of you, like a small group of visitors, look a little closer thinking it looks inviting in there, and realize you were already there before, minutes ago.\n\nIn fact, you aren't spying on them. They're wondering why you left so suddenly.\n\nThat's my understanding of the non-linear thing popping up. When events are non-linear!\n\nI suppose it's not much of a stretch, but it's a lot simpler than I had imagined \"non-linear\" would be.\n\nAnd toss in SK there, if the double's version of non-linear is too tame for you. SK has access to any point in time, anywhere in the universe.\n\nSo while doing tensegrity your double comes out as puffs, forms your energy body, the abstract has to become visible as a result, and by switching back and forth between the memories of the double and your tonal body, you discover nonlinear things.\n\nAll that happens during the tensegrity, at intermediate levels.\n\nCleargreen could have been running workshops by now which were designed to enhance all three of those effects.\n\nAnd explain them!\n\nHere's a silly example. The best I can do on short time.\n\nYou gaze down expecting to see some sparkles or balls of purple light floating below where you usually see it, for a specific Tensegrity pass, but instead you turn into a plank of wood.\n\nYou are literally a beam of wood about the thickness (square) of your torso. Standing upright, and yet, you fell from above.  Or the board fell from above, and replaced you.\n\nIt's just an instantaneous vision, but one which can last as long as you don't question the validity of it.\n\nIt's stable as long as you don't notice that's \"impossible\", and block it from your view.\n\nNothing that you can perceive is \"Impossible\". That's a silly prejudice.\n\nAnd since you are silent you can go back and forth between that, and the normal glowing balls of light sights.\n\nThe vision is \"abstract\", so it's not really like this picture I added to this comment.  But it's as close as I can portray in a short time.\n\nNow, here's the strange part.\n\nIf that wasn't strange enough.\n\nIn going from the normal darkroom view to the abstract darkroom view, the double becomes more involved.\n\nSo the double \"splits off\" in the middle of a tensegrity move, stands 3 feet from you, and the result is absolute confusion.\n\nWhich deepens your levels of silence until the other senses begin to be just as active as sight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jks13jpk797c1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc8ed68e877144910e84cd71fda84ca054a5fb90", "edited": 1702993347.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ke17whm", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saddest part is how far Tensegrity really goes.

Only a few reflex actions, which still need to be applied through actual sparing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which kungfu masters avoid, because they&amp;#39;re rather out of shape and almost never actually practice anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for Howard&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;, he&amp;#39;s just teaching ordinary Daoist longevity techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daoists are so obsessed with longevity techniques (probably so they could steal money from old people), that they were known as alchemists looking for the elixir of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Howard was hanging out with some really crummy martial artists, back in the days when anything at all got you into black belt magazine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howard was mediocre at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But so what? Most martial arts instructors are big fakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the ones who practice hard, can&amp;#39;t fight any better than the ones who don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of what I&amp;#39;ve seen of Howards &amp;quot;light of life&amp;quot; techniques, curving your back releases some crusted energy, and can move your assemblage point a bit down the back, so that you feel bliss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a green zone effect, the same as meditation produces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to get on an ego trip and deceive yourself with green zone magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you haven&amp;#39;t even gotten close to moving your assemblage point past thoughts of gain, among humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result?  Someone obsessed with &amp;quot;me, me, me&amp;quot; who experiences a tiny bit of green zone magic, will declare themselves a &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot; and try to cash in by lording it over other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is the multi-level marketing scam of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_18jss7p", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/18jss7p/a_bizarre_forgotten_tensegrity_form/ks12ien/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1708839007.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1708839007.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ks0v23j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Chantrieri-0-", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1708835294.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kdn9om7", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3b8xyjl7", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "So you don't reckon Howard Lee's system is worth anything?

I watched myself asleep, and had the self-control to remember that I was  dreaming. I followed then the directions don Juan had given me, which were to avoid sudden  jolts or surprises, and to take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nThe dreamer has to get involved, don Juan had said, in dispassionate experimentations.  Rather than examining his sleeping body, the dreamer walks out of the room. I suddenly found myself, without knowing how, outside my room. I had the absolutely clear sensation that I had been placed there instantaneously. When I first stood outside my door, the hall and the  staircase were monumental. If anything really scared me that night, it was the size of those  structures which in real life were thoroughly commonplace. The hall was about fifty feet long  and the staircase had sixteen steps.\n\nI could not conceive how to cover the enormous distances I was perceiving. I vacillated, then something made me move.\n\nI did not walk, though. I did not feel my steps. Suddenly I was holding on the the railing. I  could see my hands and forearms but I did not feel them. I was holding on by the force of  something that had nothing to do with my musculature as I know it. The same thing happened when I tried to go down the stairs. I did not know how to walk. I just could not take a step. It  was as if my legs were welded together. I could see my legs by leaning over, but I could not  move them forward or laterally, nor could I lift them up toward my chest. I seemed to be stuck  to the top step. I felt I was like those inflated plastic dolls that can lean in any direction until  they are horizontal, only to be pulled upright again by the weight of their heavy rounded bases.\n\nI made a supreme effort to walk and bounced from step to step like a clumsy ball. It took an  incredible degree of attention to get to the ground floor. I could not describe it in any other  way. Some form of attentiveness was required to maintain the bounds of my vision; to prevent  it from disintegrating into the fleeting images of an ordinary dream.\n\nWhen I finally got to the street door I could not open it. I tried desperately, but to no avail.  Then I recalled that I had gotten out of my room by gliding out of it as if the door had been  open. All I needed was to recall that feeling of gliding and suddenly I was out in the street.\n\nIt looked dark- a peculiarly lead-gray darkness that did not permit me to perceive any colors.  My interest was drawn immediately to an enormous lagoon of brightness right in front of me  at my eye level. I deduced rather than perceived that it was the street light, since I knew there  was one right on the corner twenty feet above the ground.\n\nI knew then that I could not make the perceptual arrangements needed in order to judge up, or down, or here, or there. Everything seemed to be extraordinarily present. I had no mechanism, as in ordinary life, to arrange my perception. Everything was there in the foreground and I had no volition to construct an adequate screening procedure.\n\nI stayed in the street, bewildered, until I began to have the sensation that I was levitating. I  held on to the metal pole that supported the light and the street sign on the corner. A strong  breeze was lifting me up. I was sliding up the pole until I could plainly see the name of the  street; Ashton.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nNow, if anyone is drooling, keep in mind that at least 4 in this subreddit already did this.\n\nBut you'd have to have done it yourself, to notice when they mentioned it.\n\nAnd, they didn't realize what it was either.\n\nIn our cases, it's just lucking out.\n\nThey hadn't \"earned\" it yet, through continuous hard work.\n\nIt's just one of those \"intent gifts\" that can come along.\n\nThey woke up in their double, near their bed. Then wandered around a bit, confused about what was going on.\n\nIt likely explains how Cholita visits me in her double.\n\nDoesn't realize what's going on until I notice her, and get her attention, at which point she runs.\n\nAnd gets angry if I question her about it the next day.\n\nSo always remember:\n\nThis isn't a pretend magical system where a couple of super cool experiences means you're now a \"Master\".\n\nDo you honestly want to end up being yet another Yogananda?\n\nWhen instead you could be another don Juan?\n\nOr Muktananda. He was also a phony guru type who wrote a book about a few cool experiences he might or might not have actually had, as if those qualified him for anything at all.\n\nHis gimmick was bopping people with an ostrich feather, claiming he just transferred shakti particles into them.\n\nSame as Howard Lee is doing these days.  Beaming energy into his audience.\n\nFor some cash.\n\nIf any of that sounds good to anyone reading this, give up now.\n\nYou'll never learn sorcery.\n\nGo make yourself \"great\" some other way.\n\nIt'll be a lot easier.", "edited": 1702752058.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kdn9om7", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old apartment of Carlos is likely in this google maps satellite photo.

Like chi gung or other fake magical systems.\n\nSeriously. \n\nIf you want to see how low they sunk, go try it.  Search that huge pdf.  I believe there's 21 occurrences.\n\nThat entire year of 1998 they went around spreading absolute poison to the Castaneda community.\n\nPretending. As a substitute for actual magic.\n\nI suppose they thought that was \"leadership\"?\n\nAnd after they all joked, while Carlos was still alive, that Carol Tiggs should get a bullwhip and beat everyone so they'll actually do some work.\n\nThey forgot about that. They now had the bullwhip capability, and decided it was better for their own profit to turn sorcery into useless things which never work, such as breathing exercises and Saber Toothed Tiger hero worship.\n\nLet's face the facts! There's **no one** doing real magic using breathing exercises!\n\nI'd be happy as can be if there were. It means I could rest.\n\nNone of us really care who has real magic.\n\nJust that someone does.\n\nAnd since they don't, we're stuck preserving it.\n\nBreathing exercises may sooth you, and even make you feel happy.\n\nBut they won't cause your assemblage point to move so far that  you walk off into another world.\n\nWon't cause the puffs to become visible and ready for usage.\n\nWon't cause your energy body to form around you, so you can shrink the tonal and violate the laws of physics.\n\nAll \"Tiger Breath\" exercises will do is the make believe stuff people defend angrily, when they haven't ever seen any real magic.\n\nAnd yes, you can point to some obscure passages in the books implying you could switch to your double with a breathing technique.\n\nBut you have to look at the context.

I hope everyone knows what i mean.\n\nIt's like making you body vibrate. Or more like you are paralyzing you body. Idk it feels like you energybody is shaking or some shit. \n\nIn that state what's when I did something i couldn't imagine before. I summoned my double with my eyes.\n\nSo basically i intended a vision of me looking into a mirror. And i saw me but with one extra thing. \n\nThis kinda refers to that thinglucid dreamers say. Do not look in the mirror. This kida makes sense since the mirror is a portal and i probably a portal for the double. \n\nBut basically the guy in the mirror had glowing eyes. Or it was me with glowing eyes. I must add it was scary. Some weird presence. But i am used to it or whatever. \n\nSo that was when I snapped a little out of it, but then seconds later i found myself again tensing my body/ paralyzing my body. This time i used what i found i guess. And i did something scary. I actually shifter my AP with the eyes. Not just a minor change but this time it was different. I made my eyes glow \ud83c\udf1f. \n\nThat was when I started shaking violently (my energy body) and then i was just got charged at by a shadow beeing so i my mind was like: \"hell naw, im out of here\". \n\nSo my AP shifted back because i was scared i guess. \n\nI mean what do the IOB want from me. Why when i shift my AP i get attacked by shadow IOB. Is it even IOB?\n\nPeople in here talk about seeing fairy's and good looking girls IOB. I see formless dark energy shadow beeings. \n\nBut this was not about the IOB. The crazy lesson is. Make you eyes glow. YES. LIKE AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER. \n\nIts funny but the people that made avatar the last Airbender must have been influenced by CC or some shit. Just think about it. Avatars eyes always began to glow when he entered the spirit world. Also when his eyes began to glow he became inmortal and just destroyed the enemy's with his powers. That some references to the double in my opinion. \n\nAlso the uncle guy had some real stuff to teach his nephew ( the fire bender guy ). Like he said: walk life with total abandon. And stuff like: never let you thoughts decide you actions. \n\nOr that might be coinsedenceses because they said they was influenced mostly by Buddhism. \n\nBut anyway the double eyes actually glow. I am SO HAPPY TO FIND THAT YOU. I DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN MY DELIGHT. LIKE JUST BY SUMMONING THE DOUBLE ONCE I FEEL LIKE  NOT A HUMAN. YEEEY. NOW I ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO SHIFT THE AP WITH MY EYES. \n\nBut plz can someone go in depth on what s wrong with the shadow beeings that attack me.\n\nAnd also do people even know what i mean by paralyzing the body? \n\nBut Genaro was right 1000%.

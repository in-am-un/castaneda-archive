Google had to take them down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Japanese really do believe in spirits!  And that bad ones can follow you around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a Zatoichi fan, in the original Japanese, you&amp;#39;ll see Zatoichi say things like, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just a gangster&amp;quot;, in the subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like he&amp;#39;s being humble or modest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact what he says is, he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;unclean&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s from the death handlers.  A descendant of some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are still scorned in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see some, go to the college in Shinjuku.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find the adult area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stand near the McDonald&amp;#39;s, and look down the street.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see a man with curly hair just hanging out on the corner, that&amp;#39;s an &amp;quot;unclean&amp;quot; person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They become Yakuza.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, Japan has many female shamans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often they exorcise bad spirits, and stuff them into their children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, the large city blocks of tall apartments and multi story small businesses, are proud if they have a &amp;quot;shrine&amp;quot; on one of their corners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They look like a mail boxes etc, with a place to burn incense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been afraid to ask what&amp;#39;s in the little mail boxes all over the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People go there to burn incense to their dead ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you walk down a street that&amp;#39;s not as nice as the main street, which also goes by that corner, at the opposite end of the block you can sometimes find an &amp;quot;anti-shrine&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A miniature shrine, sitting on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shaman women put exorcised spirits in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, Asia tolerates magic much better than we do here, unless there are communists involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/p4dfoq/shamanism_is_thriving_in_modern_south_korea_and/h8xvwsb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1628966713.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_p4dfoq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h90was3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1629031191.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h8zrbt2", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's filed in the Tensegrity=&gt;Misc.

And has a tendency to appeal to bad players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we aren&amp;#39;t careful, Frank Diaz will end up with his own new book &amp;quot;explaining&amp;quot; it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That evil man plagues my Spanish speaking social media audience more than us in the English speaking world.  So I never realized how awful he is, until someone from South America reminded me he&amp;#39;s still out there actively stealing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for other languages there are also very bad men who go unchallenged. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the importance of Stellar Hatch, it REALLY does bring back a &amp;quot;blob&amp;quot; of awareness from a star.  You can visibly see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And FEEL it. That &amp;quot;plop&amp;quot; Carlos told us to watch for. He had a reason for telling us to look for that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, the energy lured back forms an amazing face on the floor.  This is NOT an exaggeration:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=2508&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0e36645e92b17b14b0b9aa0acda2d3eccfd40c05\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=2508&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0e36645e92b17b14b0b9aa0acda2d3eccfd40c05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What Carlos said about it in private classes was that the energy would mix with that between your toes, and make it easier to move your assemblage point OFF that &amp;quot;me, me, me&amp;quot; spot, where everyone is obsessed with focusing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jadey has a better memory of what he said.  I was surprised when she explained it from her recollections.  She was in the &amp;quot;inner circle&amp;quot;, so she got more information about using the stars and constellations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nyei seems to have specialized in this &amp;quot;star awareness&amp;quot; thing, and was teaching classes on how to communicate with stars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only problem I have with that is, it&amp;#39;s easy to pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting there with your eyes closed, doing some technique she discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Evil Clown Effect&amp;quot; will pollute that quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she wasn&amp;#39;t forthcoming with enough details to clarify precisely what she&amp;#39;d learned to do, and was teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in my opinion, darkroom is superior for learning what Stellar Hatch really does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you succeed at stretching a bit, you&amp;#39;ll feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s WAY out there in silent knowledge, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the tensegrity forms respond well to silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They become &amp;quot;something else&amp;quot; entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when you&amp;#39;ll realize what a CRIME it is, to make up new passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can make up &amp;quot;darkroom games&amp;quot;.  If you must.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, to create those you need to be able to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And clearly no one at Cleargreen is even close.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1abjrxe", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1abjrxe/the_red_rag_of_tensegrity/kjouv7f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1706292688.0, "media_metadata": {"iyh1705kqtec1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 63, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44d83f7a0424b01a6095bfcad1445001d4f8f5ae"}, {"y": 126, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f2f136cd2ce5703afb946e0704dc42973755fa7"}, {"y": 187, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd3449f6a8a6afc1d4ea76945d9b51c15db99911"}, {"y": 374, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b6aa9f598c28648c261db4319a75cf46263d081"}, {"y": 561, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f782ec73a4293b24bda4bf8f2801b9fb679c660"}, {"y": 631, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d41bbbf103cbf56544022233c737241337eb1f62"}], "s": {"y": 1466, "x": 2508, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/iyh1705kqtec1.png?width=2508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e36645e92b17b14b0b9aa0acda2d3eccfd40c05"}, "id": "iyh1705kqtec1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1706292688.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kjoqelf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "cuyler72", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kjopv3s", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_1fy7uagm", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Quote suggesting A \"movement of the assemblage point\" means shifting to a different total world and that it is inside the luminous sphere.\n\nArt of dreaming chapter 12\n\n\"Don Juan further explained that most of the shifts modern-day sorcerers experience are mild shifts within a thin bundle of energetic luminous filaments inside the luminous egg, a bundle called the band of man; or the purely human aspect of the universe's energy.

We do the same dreaming that the old sorcerers used to do, but at one moment we deviate into new ground. The old sorcerers preferred the shifts of the assemblage point, so they were always on more or less known, predictable ground. We prefer the movements of the assemblage point. The old sorcerers were after the human unknown. We are after the nonhuman unknown.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Dreaming is too easy for you. That is a damnation if we don&amp;#39;t watch it. It leads to the human unknown. As I said to you, modern-day sorcerers strive to get to the nonhuman unknown.&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;What can the nonhuman unknown be?&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Freedom from being human. Inconceivable worlds that are outside the band of man but that we still can perceive. This is where modern sorcerers take the side road. Their predilection is what&amp;#39;s outside the human domain. And what are outside that domain are all-inclusive worlds; not merely the realm of birds or the realm of animals or the realm of man- even if it be the unknown man. \n&amp;quot;What I am talking about are worlds, like the one where we live; total worlds with endless realms.&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Where are those worlds, don Juan? In different positions of the assemblage point?&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Right. In different positions of the assemblage point, but positions sorcerers arrive at with a movement of the assemblage point, not a shift. \nEntering into those worlds is the type of dreaming only sorcerers of today do. The old sorcerers stayed away from it because it requires a great deal of detachment and no self-importance whatsoever.

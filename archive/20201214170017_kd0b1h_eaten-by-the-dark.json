I've gotten very skilled at summoning little dreams floating around in the darkness.  I believe you can enter your dreaming double at that assemblage point position.\n\nThen I got the weird idea I could just select one of the dream puffs, deposit it on my stomach, and enter that dream.  Like a transparent robot made of light, inserting a program you can see running on itself. It soaks in, and causes a teleport.\n\nI haven't concluded if that works.\n\nBut the good news is, I can't say it doesn't or can't work.\n\nThere's a very long intent delay, and a memory loss associated with doing things like that.\n\nBut it makes the luminous shell quite active.\n\nDaytime gazing is amazing!  It's revolutionized my darkroom.  It does in fact increase your \"power\".\n\nUse Zuleica's advice: Watch all details, looking for \"power\".  Let the observation produce the silence, by making your internal dialogue something external.\n\nThe \"power\" you find will be more like bliss feelings, but with a touch of dark energy.\n\nAt some point, you can feel any dark energy that touches your skin.  It's also a bliss feeling, but it's more like it's on your cheeks, and is warm.\n\nLike blushing I suppose.\n\nZuleica didn't say so, but this sort of daytime power hunting retrains your entire relationship to the world. Instead of running around glossing, you're like a little kid running everywhere, to see everything, trying to find something cool.\n\nBut minus the running part. \n\nIf you keep it up, you'll find the \"emptiness\" of everything.\n\nThe Zen guys seem to have gotten themselves trapped there, maybe because it makes a good slogan.\n\nYou get some sad and angry monks, and tell them the goal is to see the emptiness of everything.\n\nBingo!  That's going to really appeal to them.\n\nThey'll be sitting, watching dead, diseased leaves fall, with a smile on their face.  Then you can get them to do some sweeping.\n\n\\&gt; The whole body shudders, letting go of everything and receiving a caress of happiness.\n\nI was thinking about this body movement thing.  Several darkroom gazers have extreme outbursts of this.\n\nI have no answer, but I will point out.  The TM folks practice a mantric meditation technique which is just an inch away from forcing silence. They never cross that inch, but using what they have, they make Patajali's sutras work. A very tiny bit. Not enough so that they aren't angry if you try to help them.  But enough to keep them hanging around 20 years, before they give up.\n\nAfter practicing their flying sutra (cross legged guy levitating images come from them), they lay on the mat.\n\nIt's not uncommon for someone to start to convulse.  And of course, muscle twitches are common.\n\nKeep in mind, the flying sutra simply activates the cerebellum, by giving it a silent idea that you want to fly off into the air.

I&amp;#39;ve gotten very skilled at summoning little dreams floating around in the darkness.  I believe you can enter your dreaming double at that assemblage point position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got the weird idea I could just select one of the dream puffs, deposit it on my stomach, and enter that dream.  Like a transparent robot made of light, inserting a program you can see running on itself. It soaks in, and causes a teleport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t concluded if that works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the good news is, I can&amp;#39;t say it doesn&amp;#39;t or can&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a very long intent delay, and a memory loss associated with doing things like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it makes the luminous shell quite active.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daytime gazing is amazing!  It&amp;#39;s revolutionized my darkroom.  It does in fact increase your &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use Zuleica&amp;#39;s advice: Watch all details, looking for &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;.  Let the observation produce the silence, by making your internal dialogue something external.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; you find will be more like bliss feelings, but with a touch of dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point, you can feel any dark energy that touches your skin.  It&amp;#39;s also a bliss feeling, but it&amp;#39;s more like it&amp;#39;s on your cheeks, and is warm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like blushing I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica didn&amp;#39;t say so, but this sort of daytime power hunting retrains your entire relationship to the world. Instead of running around glossing, you&amp;#39;re like a little kid running everywhere, to see everything, trying to find something cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But minus the running part. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep it up, you&amp;#39;ll find the &amp;quot;emptiness&amp;quot; of everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Zen guys seem to have gotten themselves trapped there, maybe because it makes a good slogan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get some sad and angry monks, and tell them the goal is to see the emptiness of everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bingo!  That&amp;#39;s going to really appeal to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll be sitting, watching dead, diseased leaves fall, with a smile on their face.  Then you can get them to do some sweeping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The whole body shudders, letting go of everything and receiving a caress of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this body movement thing.  Several darkroom gazers have extreme outbursts of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no answer, but I will point out.  The TM folks practice a mantric meditation technique which is just an inch away from forcing silence. They never cross that inch, but using what they have, they make Patajali&amp;#39;s sutras work. A very tiny bit. Not enough so that they aren&amp;#39;t angry if you try to help them.  But enough to keep them hanging around 20 years, before they give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After practicing their flying sutra (cross legged guy levitating images come from them), they lay on the mat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not uncommon for someone to start to convulse.

Yes, you can do it.  I do it primarily through 4th Gate Dreaming, this sub does it primarily through darkroom.  \n\nIf you want me to describe it, I can do that for you, but as Dan says, it's kind of silly and a bit of a spoiler.  I'll do it in the order you probably would prefer, which is the visual, although given my druthers, I would start with the 'feeling' of it. \n\nVISUALLY:   Visually, the landscape/scenery can be anything you are intending, but the quality of the imagery is mind-boggling.  I'm just going to use movie and video game terms: basically, the graphics are insane, the best you'll ever see, and the CGI is top notch lol.  It feels like being in the movie Avatar, or any other insanely vivid film.  The only other place you'll see these kind of graphics, is, ironically enough... real life.  A snow covered mountain.  A jungle.  A landscape.  If you've every been out in nature and gone silent, and your eyes clear, that kind of vividness is what it looks like, at least, for me.   As far as the content of the second attention, that is of course infinite and based on where along your luminous shell/ J Curve you have moved your AP.  \n\nFEELING: The feeling is complete and utter freedom.  It helps you understood what DJ meant when he said freedom was the point of sorcery.  If anyone asked me what it is we study here, I'd say, \"Practicing inner silence and dreaming, in order to move the AP to a new position, and then stalking the new position to hold it there.\"  But if someone dug deeper and asked me what it's all about?  Freedom.  In the second attention, with full awareness, you can fly, shape-shift, float, change worlds, lift cars, explore alien worlds, and learn, learn learn.  There is a giddy, awesome, joyful feeling that for lack of a better word, I have a deep, personal love and affection for.  In the same way I have a deep love and personal affection for Carlos even though I  never met the man, or Don Juan, or the books themselves.  I could literally just 'sit' in the 2nd attention, at the edge of a cliff, overlooking a great vista, and be happy just 'feeling' it, without shape-shifting or flying or anything fancy.  There is just a tone to it all, a vibe, a feeling like a warm bath of energy.\n\nAs to your question - why would anyone live in this world when we have the option to build our own? \n\nWell, that's a heavy topic.  \n\nThe ones we love would be my answer.  Parents.  Wife.  Kids.  Friends.  That's why I wouldn't stay there. \n\nBut there's an even more basic, scientific answer, at least for me:\n\nEnergy.\n\nYou need gobs of it to stay in the 2nd attention for even a few hours. Personally I don't have it.  Not nearly enough of it.  And I can't even fathom the amount of energy required to stay in the second attention forever - however I believe that is what the fire from within is all about.  \n\nBut if you had the energy, and you didn't give a shit about anyone or anything in this world, could it be done?  Yes, I think there are stories about that in the books. \n\nIt's ironic isn't it - you are talking about the thrill of living in the 2nd attention and meanwhile your energy body wants the thrill of living in the 1st attention.  I suppose the grass is always greener, huh?  \n\nIt would seem to be, and Kabbalah would also agree, that unification would be the true goal, the true mastery.  The ability to thrive in the first attention and second attention, to be able to shift your AP at will, to travel to distant worlds, then come out of dreaming, put on a suit, and go make a deposit in your bank account (reference to DJ doing that in one of the books).  I think that's the most worthy goal of all.\n\nHope this helps clarify moving beyond the 1st attention a little bit.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i9yxfrr", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is in fact, valid.

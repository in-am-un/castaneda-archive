I never thought about that...\n\nOr Ice mass.  Smithsonian says \"kelp\" mass...\n\nBut the bottom line is, our Olmec Sorcery is nearly certainly Siberian Shamanism, evolved over here in a more favorable environment.  And minus the funny hats. They swapped them for rubber football helmets.\n\nHere's what Smithsonian says:\n\nFor more than half a century, the prevailing story of how the first  humans came to the Americas went like this: Some 13,000 years ago, small  bands of Stone Age hunters walked across a land bridge between eastern  Siberia and western Alaska, eventually making their way down an ice-free  inland corridor into the heart of North America. Chasing steppe bison,  woolly mammoths and other large mammals, these ancestors of today\u2019s  Native Americans established a thriving culture that eventually spread  across two continents to the tip of South America.\n\nIn recent years, however, that version of events has taken a beating,  not least because of the discovery of archaeological sites in North and  South America showing that humans had been on the continent 1,000 or  even 2,000 years before the supposed first migration. A subsequent  theory, known as the \u201cKelp Highway,\u201d came closer to the mark: As the  massive ice sheets covering western North America retreated, the first  humans arrived on the continent not only by foot but by boat, traveling  down the Pacific shore and subsisting on abundant coastal resources.  Supporting that idea are archaeological sites along the West Coast of  North America that date back 14,000 to 15,000 years.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nNow, keep in mind. When the Russians get their hands on anything esoteric, the tend to ruin it for profit.\n\nThey've done that with Castaneda's knowledge. Selling phony versions of it all over the place, bragging things like, \"17 years an impeccable warrior!\"\n\nAs proof of their sorcery knowledge...\n\nThey have endless Buddhist cults, run by a single man who victimizes dozens.  Often Dzogchen as you'd expect.\n\nI went to look at Siberian Shamanism on the net, and saw Russian men in the background smiling next to some old Siberian guy in a clown costume.\n\nDidn't see any, \"Oh my god this stuff works, come read about it!\"\n\nJust weird costumes and rituals they'd teach you for cash.\n\nIn case you look at that map and wonder how the invading \"Beringians\" spread, here's the info:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zvybkhxkr381.png?width=1700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=929943fab8751c054d7e16526817e0f9b4d5916a\n\nI suppose to confuse attacking Native Americans, like the last batch who waited for Native American month to try to take us down,  we could claim we were practicing Beringian magic?\n\nThe funny thing is, the ones who attack are naturally the bad players among native American shamanism followers.\n\nLikely the worst of the worst with pretend shamanism.\n\nJust like the Castaneda followers who attack here.  The worst of the worst.\n\nBut, if native Americans take their shamanism seriously, they'll eventually incorporate materials from here, into what they do.\n\nOtherwise, they'll remain mostly impotent.  Except for the hidden ones (a handful of lineages according to don  Juan), who would like this place.\n\nNot attack it.\n\nNo one who has magic, attacks another place that has magic.\n\nThey just check it out to see if there's anything they can use to improve their own.\n\nOne thing interesting here, the Siberian stuff spread first to Mexico, then later to Peru and Brazil.\n\nHowever, there are some even older human habitation sites in Peru. I'm not sure about Brazil.\n\nHere's some \"Paleosiberians\", the modern version of the actual people from whom native americans are likely descendant, as backed up by DNA (see one of the comments).  Can't stick the pic there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvt4vzwdns381.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a4fd6c41d79892536af7f5f239fd09edbf2fe1\n\nThis next pic came up as Paleosiberian people too, but I'm a little suspicious of it...

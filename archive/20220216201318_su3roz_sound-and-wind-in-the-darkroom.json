Some said that they were within a violet coat others saw an amber light emanating from their hands). &amp;#39;Olinda makes a buzzing sound &amp;#39;..zzzzzzzz.....&amp;#39; and that sound is the herald of a moth like being, the guardian of the second attention. Olinda was sitting on her favourite bench in the plaza of Tula one sunny morning and she started to buzz. Next moment she looked up to the sky and she saw the stars. It was night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20020815184038/http://www.tensegrity.yucom.be/Notes/Olinda.html\"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20020815184038/http://www.tensegrity.yucom.be/Notes/Olinda.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here you begin the part of the pass with sound. You can choose between three ways to do the pass. One is with a vocalized &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;. The second is with an unvocalized &amp;quot;s&amp;quot;. The third is with a vocalized &amp;quot;z&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ll describe for the &amp;quot;z&amp;quot;. The other two will be clear from that. The use of musical terms is just because it&amp;#39;s easy.

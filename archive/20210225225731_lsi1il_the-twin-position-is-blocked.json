One closer to the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with chair silence is, you go inwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assemblage point drops, then goes sideways because you have nothing to hold you at &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normal = down the middle.  Not normal = sideways, and it gets too thick to move down more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not impressive. To have cool experiences in a chair with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s hundreds doing that in subreddits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you never convince yourself you did anything unusual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you don&amp;#39;t keep pushing, all the way along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just expand your definition of sleeping dreaming, to include that technique. And at best, learn to drop it to the red line in the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You never gain some cool experiences you can use, to motivate you to do the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyes open, dreaming awake.  That&amp;#39;s the only way you get people to say, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re lying!!!&amp;quot; when you tell them about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chair is just a stop over, because no one will go for the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I&amp;#39;ve taught several people to do what I wrote there, in the chair, and all quit in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One even had a tantrum when he saw some of the pictures I make for this place. I keep things isolated for the most part, so he didn&amp;#39;t know about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that was the last straw when he saw a timid picture from here,  and that I was &amp;quot;making it up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was a chair semi-expert, but the idea you could do that with your eyes open, was too much for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which proves my point about the need for motivational experiences that break what people think is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a secret all of you will discover, but which makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery vanishes if you don&amp;#39;t keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how far you went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because if the assemblage point returns to this normal position, and becomes inflexible again, it&amp;#39;s as if none of that ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, being &amp;quot;convinced&amp;quot; is actually more important than it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_lsi1il", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lsi1il/the_twin_position_is_blocked/gorzg4n/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1614301414.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1614301414.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gorwb5s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gorpzl7", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Batsavage - Here's the method I'm experimenting with, it was in the wiki.

I cut back on my job working hours to 4-6 a day, and had no private life at all so I could practice that long each day.\n\nI got so good at lucid dreaming that I was inside dreams as long as 12 hours a day, re-entering 6 times in a single night.\n\nNot once a week, or even once every other day, as the Chacmools currently brag.\n\n6 times a night...\n\nI could go to sleep inside dreams several levels, with no danger of wakeup or loss of lucidity.\n\nI found a scout, and taught it to follow me all the time, so I could retain lucidity.

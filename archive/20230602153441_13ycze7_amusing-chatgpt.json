While there may not be a specific term like \"video book,\" you can create videos that showcase the content of a book in a multimedia format.\n\nTo preserve the contents of a subreddit in a video on YouTube, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather the content: Collect the relevant posts, discussions, and images from the subreddit that you want to preserve. You can take screenshots or save text content for reference.\n2. Organize the material: Arrange the content in a logical order to create a coherent narrative or presentation. This could involve categorizing posts, arranging discussions, and selecting relevant images.\n3. Create a script or outline: Develop a script or outline that outlines the structure and flow of the video. This will help you ensure that the video effectively captures the essence of the subreddit.\n4. Create the video: Use video editing software to compile the content, images, and text into a video format. You can add voiceover narration, background music, and visual effects to enhance the video's quality.\n5. Upload to YouTube: Once you've finished creating the video, upload it to YouTube or any other video hosting platform. Set the video to public or private based on your preferences.\n\n Regarding the preservation of book contents in video format, yes, there have been instances where books, especially those with lots of pictures, have been converted into videos. This is particularly common in cases where books are transformed into audiobooks or adapted for educational or promotional purposes. For example, children's books often have videos with animated illustrations to engage young readers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that converting a book into a video format may not capture the exact experience of reading the physical book or viewing it on a digital platform designed for books. The video format can be a useful way to showcase the content and visuals but might not fully replicate the reading experience.\n\nIf you're looking to preserve the content of a subreddit for historical or archival purposes, consider also exploring options such as web archiving tools or creating offline backups of the subreddit's content. These methods can provide alternative ways to preserve the information in its original format.\n\n\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Amusing ChatGPT", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 103, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"7a4608fuxl3b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 79, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7a4608fuxl3b1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7306e77757e04be405310599dcb2dc26b3f1d77a"}, {"y": 159, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7a4608fuxl3b1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=851ab86cb9b4b590f0fcc329af2b443073663245"}], "s": {"y": 193, "x": 261, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7a4608fuxl3b1.png?width=261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=807668d989f6e10bb46f2987183d5b682e8a9072"}, "id": "7a4608fuxl3b1"}}, "name": "t3_13ycze7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/V_tSofc2uIMx4q7mi38CiOTJCX2PugkbSCAenEAwUT0.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1685712881.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7a4608fuxl3b1.png?width=261&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=807668d989f6e10bb46f2987183d5b682e8a9072\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7a4608fuxl3b1.png?width=261&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=807668d989f6e10bb46f2987183d5b682e8a9072&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really do like that Chat bot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He makes up stuff, if he can&amp;#39;t answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And repeats back to you, with authority, the pieces of your question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So clearly he&amp;#39;s got a lot of programmed in &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; to sound intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he also seems to know just about everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reddit is going IPO, and greedily trying to maximize their value, ridding reddit of what they consider harmful to their public persona.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could easily be one of those &amp;quot;bad subreddits&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People are discussing what to do about that, and I wondered if you couldn&amp;#39;t just make a video, and upload it to youtube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all of the content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll experiment and make a tiny one, and put it here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I thought I&amp;#39;d ask ChatGPT about it, and he gave his usual amusing answer with an introduction, &amp;quot;Steps&amp;quot;, and a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** From an AI ***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is possible to preserve book contents, including lots of pictures, in a video format.

We&amp;#39;re the sheep, Jesus is the Shepard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why it doesn&amp;#39;t occur to Christians that this means we&amp;#39;re food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They might say, &amp;quot;But God only wants to LOVE us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yea, I saw that movie too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t end well for the woman in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whoever created an entire reality, is likely to be blamed for all of it&amp;#39;s disappointments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they call the eagle the tyrant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And humans being pests, can only be &amp;quot;petty tyrants&amp;quot; by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sensing you&amp;#39;re a bit lost in the &amp;quot;spiritual&amp;quot; meanings of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fake magic systems load you up with that, to make you feel special and knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they don&amp;#39;t have any actual magic to offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they give you &amp;quot;rules to follow so you&amp;#39;ll be sacred to God&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No sugar, no meat, no sex in odd positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No swearing (don Juan swore like a drunken sailor but the publishers censored him).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos swore so badly in private classes, everyone went around outside saying, &amp;quot;fuck&amp;quot; all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breaking the laws of &amp;quot;good spirituality&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a balance I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So be &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;honest&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;reliable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not spiritual.  That&amp;#39;s a con game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers are the spiritual ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;literally&lt;/strong&gt; deal with fully visible, semi-solid, spirits each day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuff beyond anything done by the 1800s spirit movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was snooping around the Bardon subreddit, because one of theirs came over here to cause trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just wanted to learn how to shapeshift, as if this were just another chapter in a Bardon book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And someone had posted Bardon&amp;#39;s descriptions of types of spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total nonsense, based on assuming no one can actually see and interact with them daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was like a Nazi propaganda paper explaining what Jewish people are like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not angry or &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; like that, but just as absurd and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally the Bardon folks didn&amp;#39;t like hearing it was nonsense, and if you can&amp;#39;t perceive them with your own eyes daily, you ought not to be writing about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fake magic is self-enforcing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_13ycze7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13ycze7/amusing_chatgpt/jmqwsg9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1685803859.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jmpmlmj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Ok-Lengthiness-7613", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1685772439.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_13ycze7", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_9n89tsi8a", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "hi dan Unfortunately, I was kicked out of the public chat, and after I asked Techno to make me a member of the chat room again, he agreed, but said that due to reddit's problems, it is not possible to re-member you in the public chat.

I started to practice again.\n\nI have been dedicating more and more time (ofcourse its no where close to how it was back then yet) to practice silence and darkroom. also a bit of recap as suggested by danl.\n\nlast night I was visiting the same post and re-reading the comments again to better grasp all the things there are. and I hit something that resonated within me, the death defier..\n\nseeing he/she's name reminded me of the story. I immediately opened the books to read about them again. somehow I always loved that character whenever I reached it in the books ( i have read all the books for about 12 times now) somehow it resonated with me a lot in that they were experiencing something so far out-side the 'world we know everyday' that you couldn't really name him human anymore. it was always a sign for me to how big the range of our potential is.\n\nafter finishing that section of the book and starting my practice, i contemplated a bit on the death defier and it soothed me, a sense of calmness yet filled with a kind of 'sadness' that wasn't really sad but rather sober washed over me, and it truly sent away my fears, even of death by a large margin to the point that only now i am starting to feel a little of it again, I had no notion of that blockage and fears last night at all.\n\nand I decided that I truly wanted to follow the intent that you are following here. to actually do sorcery rather than chase it as I have all my life just to look at it through the window of 'information provided by others' after all, what good are they if I cannot be a part of it.\n\nso I decided to be a part of it even though I have made this decision before. but I thought maybe its better to not do it alone and as everyone is doing share that which I experience here so that MAYBE by calling up the intent that you guys are following it might give me the chance and include me as well.\n\nthroughout this week (about 2-3 days before posting the fear post) I restarted my practices, and as I  replied to danl on the same post. I have been having a same peculiar repeating experience. every day the same thing happens. halfway or somedays even immediately after starting my practice a sense of dread fills my body. not my everyday fear though. this is not that. its the terror you feel when you are a child. stuck in the darkness. like someone is chasing you when you run to turn on the lights. the chilling,shivering sensation of not being alone in the darkness. its there every night, however I never had that before when I practiced back then, even though I had reached the colors and all.\n\nlast night after the contemplation on the death defier and my fears being vanquished by that 'sobering calm/sadness' this same sensation returned however this time I was less reactive to it. I used to jump out of the fear when it came and start breathing fast. but this time I was only aware of it. my room cannot be absolute darkness because of how bad the design and the placement of windows and leds are so I was just practicing in a dark room filled with moonlight. I could hardly see the floor but was able to differentiate between objects. however objects dont get enough light to have color so I see shadows instead of the actual object colors.\n\nwhen I remained less reactive to that sensation in that state. I noticed that on the corners of my eyes. the shadows started moving. mainly becoming larger and creeping towards me. I couldn't stop myself not turning to check it. obviously everytime I did they returned to normal but immediately when going back to the silence and centering myself the same shadow repeated.\n\nonce I didnt turn and a shadow got larger and larger almost twice my sitting size and crept from the right side towards me. reached the border of a mat i put on the ground to sit on while practicing. and started creeping back and back to its size.\n\nwhen everything was back to normal I allowed myself to move and saw something I couldn't believe. to the right side of my mat was a folded paper which wasn't there before. taking it in my hands the thought came to my head that it was folded as if something was written inside and its a message. I opened it and it was empty. but I couldn't help but stare at it, at this point my body was doing all this automatically and I was just an spectator, observing what was going on.. I stared at the paper for what seemed like atleast an hour. every second i stared more at that empty paper lighten by the moonlight i was more 'mesmerized', more silent.  it was as if the paper was something unfathomable to my mind and just looking at it would overflow my mind with confusion and silence it.\n\nafter a point something happened that I still am checking my trash bin to check even at this very moment that I am typing this and yes. its true, how? I don't know. but in my hands the paper suddenly turned softer and softer and suddenly i was holding 2 large fragile pieces of feather. automatically my body had the intention to blow them. how you would blow those feather flowers ( dandelion puffballs ) into the wind. as I did the force of my blow was stronger than I anticipated and they started floating in my room and eventually hitting the ground.\n\nI immediately came back to my ordinary state, stood up ran to the lights. turned it on and looked. and to my wonder. to my utter surprise (and frankly I would say disappointment but I am thinking that its not even remotely something to be disappointed about) there was ripped paper towel on the ground. even though a part of me wants to laugh even now that im writing this and think of it as a figment of imagination and my mind playing a dirty joke on me.. I can't deny that at the time that WAS at first an actual text paper, and IT DID become feathers.\n\ngoing against my usual personality and hoping to progress with you guys and follow the intent that CC through danl offered us.

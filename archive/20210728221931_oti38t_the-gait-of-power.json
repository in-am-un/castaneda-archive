And then came the raspy prolonged cry of a small owl. I had no doubt it was don Juan. It came from a place behind me. I turned around and began to walk in that direction. I moved slowly because I felt inextricably encumbered by the darkness.\n\nI walked for perhaps ten minutes. Suddenly some dark mass jumped in front of me. I screamed and fell backward on my seat. My ears began buzzing. The fright was so great that it cut my wind. I had to open my mouth to breathe.\n\n\"Stand up,\" don Juan said softly. \"I didn't mean to scare you. I just came to meet you.\" He said that he had been watching my crappy way of walking and that when I moved in the darkness I looked like a crippled old lady trying to tiptoe between mud puddles. He found this image funny and laughed out loud.\n\nHe then proceeded to demonstrate a special way of walking in the darkness, a way which he called \"the gait of power\". He stooped over in front of me and made me run my hands over his back and knees, in order to get an idea of the position of his body. Don Juan's trunk was slightly bent forward, but his spine was straight. His knees were also slightly bent.\n\nHe walked slowly in front of me so I could take notice that he raised his knees almost to his chest every time he took a step. And then he actually ran out of sight and came back again. I could not conceive how he could run in total darkness.\n\n\"The gait of power is for running at night,\" he whispered in my ear.\n\nHe urged me to try it myself. I told him that I was sure I would break my legs falling into a crevice or against a rock. Don Juan very calmly said that the \"gait of power\" was completely safe. I pointed out that the only way I could understand his acts was by assuming he knew those hills to perfection and thus could avoid the pitfalls.\n\nDon Juan took my head in his hands and whispered forcefully, \"This is the night! And it is power!\"\n\nHe let go of my head and then added in a soft voice that at night the world was different, and that his ability to run in the darkness had nothing to do with his knowledge of those hills. He said that the key to it was to let one's personal power flow out freely, so it could merge with the power of the night, and that once that power took over there was no chance for a slip-up. He added, in a tone of utmost seriousness, that if I doubted it I should consider for a moment what was taking place. For a man of his age to run in those hills at that hour would be suicidal if the power of the night was not guiding him.\n\n\"Look!\" he said and ran swiftly out into the darkness and came back again. The way his body moved was so extraordinary that I could not believe what I was seeing. He sort of jogged on the same spot for a moment. The manner in which he lifted his legs reminded me of a sprinter doing preliminary warm-up exercises.\n\nHe then told me to follow him. I did it with utter constraint and uneasiness. With extreme care I tried to look where I was stepping but it was impossible to judge distance. Don Juan came back and jogged by my side. He whispered that I had to abandon myself to the power of the night and trust the little bit of personal power that I had, or I would never be able to move with freedom, and that the darkness was encumbering only because I relied on my sight for everything I did, not knowing that another way to move was to let power be the guide.\n\nI tried various times without success. I simply could not let go. The fear of injuring my legs was overpowering. Don Juan ordered me to keep on moving in the same spot and to try to feel as if I were actually using the \"gait of power\".\n\nHe then said that he was going to run ahead and that I should wait for his owl's cry. He disappeared in the darkness before I could say anything. I closed my eyes at times and jogged on the same spot with my knees and trunk bent for perhaps an hour. Little by little my tension began to ease up until I was fairly comfortable. Then I heard don Juan's cry.\n\nI ran five or six yards in the direction where the cry came from, trying to \"abandon myself\", as don Juan had suggested. But stumbling into a bush immediately brought back my feelings of insecurity.\n\nDon Juan was waiting for me and corrected my posture. He insisted I should first curl my fingers against my palms, stretching out the thumb and index of each hand. Then he said that in his opinion I was just indulging myself in my feelings of inadequacy, since I knew for a fact I could always see fairly well, no matter how dark the night was, if I did not focus on anything but kept scanning the ground right in front of me. The \"gait of power\" was similar to finding a place to rest. Both entailed a sense of abandon, and a sense of trust. The \"gait of power\" required that one keep the eyes on the ground directly in front, because even a glance to either side would produce an alteration in the flow of movement. He explained that bending the trunk forward was necessary in order to lower the eyes, and the reason for lifting the knees up to the chest was because the steps had to be very short and safe. He warned me that I was going to stumble a great deal at first but he assured me that with practice I could run as swiftly and as safely as I could in the daytime.\n\nFor hours I tried to imitate his movements and get into the mood he recommended. He would very patiently jog on the same spot in front of me, or he would take off in a short run and return to where I was, so I could see how he moved. He would even push me and make me run a few yards.\n\nThen he took off and called me with a series of owl cries. In some inexplicable way I moved with an unexpected degree of self-confidence. To my knowledge I had done nothing to warrant that feeling, but my body seemed to be cognizant of things without thinking about them. For example, I could not really see the jagged rocks in my way, but my body always managed to step on the edges and never in the crevices, except for a few mishaps when I lost my balance because I became distracted. The degree of concentration needed to keep scanning the area directly in front had to be total. As don Juan had warned me, any slight glance to the side or too far ahead altered the flow...\n\n...In a reassuring tone he said that I had a very good idea what the \"gait of power\" was like, and that in order to master it I needed only a slight push, which I could get on another occasion when we ventured again into the night. He patted me on the shoulder and announced that he was ready to leave.\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" he said and began running.\n\n\"Wait! Wait!\" I screamed frantically. \"Let's walk.\"\n\nDon Juan stopped and took off his hat.\n\n\"Golly!\" he said in a tone of perplexity. \"We're in a fix. You know that I cannot walk in the dark. I can only run. I'll break my legs if I walk.\"\n\nI had the feeling he was grinning when he said that, although I could not see his face. He added in a confidential tone that he was too old to walk and the little bit of the \"gait of power\" that I had learned that night had to be stretched to meet the occasion.\n\n\"If we don't use the \"gait of power \" we will be mowed down like grass,\" he whispered in my ear.\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"There are things in the night that act on people,\" he whispered in a tone that sent chills through my body.\n\n:::::::::::::::::\n\nPage 524:\n\nWe returned in the late afternoon. After eating, don Juan left don Genaro's house. He told me that I had to wait for Pablito, who was bringing some kerosene for the lantern, and that I should talk to him.\n\nI became utterly absorbed in working on my notes and did not hear Pablito come in until he was next to me. Pablito's comment was that he had been practicing the gait of power, and because of that I could not possibly have heard him unless I was capable of seeing.\n\n::::::::::::::::::\n\nPage 558:\n\nThe cliff was unnoticeable from the trail that led to it; don Juan, however, had shown it to me several times before. He had made me look over the edge and had told me that the whole cliff was a place of power, especially the base of it, which was a canyon several hundred feet down. Every time I had looked into it I had had a discomforting chill; the canyon was always dark and menacing.\n\nBefore we reached the place, don Juan said that I had to go on by myself and meet Pablito on the edge of the cliff. He recommended that I should relax and perform the gait of power in order to wash away my nervous tiredness.\n\nDon Juan stepped aside, to the left of the trail, and the darkness simply swallowed him. I wanted to stop and examine where he had gone, but my body did not obey. I began to jog although I was so tired that I could hardly keep on my feet.\n\nWhen I reached the cliff I could not see anyone there and I went on jogging in place, breathing deeply. After a while I relaxed a bit; I stood motionless with my back against a rock...\n\n:::::::::::::::::\n\nPage 951:\n\n\"\"Genaro has something to show you which is more exciting than all the self-pity you can muster up,\" don Juan continued, \"it has to do with the position of the assemblage point.\" Genaro immediately began to walk around the corridor, arching his back and lifting his thighs to his chest.\n\n\"The nagual Julian showed him how to walk that way,\" don Juan said in a whisper, \"it's called the gait of power. Genaro knows several gaits of power. Watch him fixedly.\" Genaro's movements were indeed mesmeric. I found myself following his gait, first with my eyes and then irresistibly with my feet. I imitated his gait. We walked once around the patio and stopped.\n\nWhile walking, I had noticed the extraordinary lucidity that each step brought to me. When we stopped, I was in a state of keen alertness. I could hear every sound; I could detect every change in the light or in the shadows around me. I became enthralled with a feeling of urgency, of impending action. I felt extraordinarily aggressive, muscular, daring. At that moment I saw an enormous span of flat land in front of me; right behind me I saw a forest. Huge trees were lined up as straight as a wall. The forest was dark and green; the plain was sunny and yellow.\n\nMy breathing was deep and strangely accelerated, but not in an abnormal way. Yet it was the rhythm of my breathing that was forcing me to trot on the spot. I wanted to take off running, or rather my body wanted to, but just as I was taking off something stopped me.\"\n\n:::::::::::::::::\n\nPage 954:\n\nI asked him to explain the act of walking the assemblage point. He said that once warriors have attained inner silence by stopping their internal dialogue, the sound of the gait of power, more than the sight of it, is what traps their assemblage points. The rhythm of muffled steps instantly catches the alignment force of the emanations inside the cocoon, which has been disconnected by inner silence.\n\n::::::::::::::::\n\nPage 986:\n\nGenaro stood up and started doing the same gait of power that he had done before, when he circled an enormous flat rock in a corn field by his house, while don Juan had watched in fascination. This time don Juan whispered in my ear that I should try to hear Genaro's movements, especially the movements of his thighs as they went up against his chest every time he stepped.\n\nI followed Genaro's movements with my eyes. In a few seconds I felt that some part of me had gotten trapped in Genaro's legs. The movement of his thighs would not let me go. I felt as if I were walking with him. I was even out of breath. Then I realized that I was actually following Genaro. I was in fact walking with him, away from the place where we had been sitting. I did not see don Juan, just Genaro walking ahead of me in the same strange manner. We walked for hours and hours.\n\n:::::::::::::::::\n\nPage 1008:\n\nDon Juan said that the nagual Sebastian nicknamed that nameless man \"the tenant,\" for they struck an arrangement by which the man was given energy, lodging so to speak, and he paid rent in the form of favors and knowledge.\n\n\"Did anybody ever get hurt in the exchange?\" I asked.\n\n\"None of the naguals who exchanged energy with him was injured,\" he replied. \"The man's commitment was that he'd only take a bit of superfluous energy from the nagual in exchange for gifts, for extraordinary abilities. For instance, the nagual Julian got the gait of power. With it, he could activate or make dormant the emanations inside his cocoon in order to look young or old at will.\"\n\nDon Juan explained that the death defiers in general went as far as rendering dormant all the emanations inside their cocoons, except those that matched the emanations of the allies. In this fashion they were able to imitate the allies in some form.\n\nEach of the death defiers we had encountered at the rock, don Juan said, had been able to move his assemblage point to a precise spot on his cocoon in order to emphasize the emanations shared with the allies and to interact with them. But they were all unable to move it back to its usual position and interact with people. The tenant, on the other hand, is capable of shifting his assemblage point to assemble the everyday world as if nothing had ever happened.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Gait of Power", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

With it, he could activate or make dormant the emanations inside his cocoon in order to look young or old at will.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan explained that the death defiers in general went as far as rendering dormant all the emanations inside their cocoons, except those that matched the emanations of the allies. In this fashion they were able to imitate the allies in some form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each of the death defiers we had encountered at the rock, don Juan said, had been able to move his assemblage point to a precise spot on his cocoon in order to emphasize the emanations shared with the allies and to interact with them. But they were all unable to move it back to its usual position and interact with people. The tenant, on the other hand, is capable of shifting his assemblage point to assemble the everyday world as if nothing had ever happened.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "fd91a8a8-6005-11ea-8439-0eaf9c4c470b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "oti38t", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oti38t/the_gait_of_power/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/oti38t/the_gait_of_power/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1627503571.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h6vl2ig", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1627505896.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_oti38t", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt;We walked for hours and hours.\n\nIt's good to remember this sort of thing.\n\nI'm not sure why, but the Castaneda community believes things should only take a half hour, or maybe worst case, 1 hour.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlos wiggled his fingers to get his dent in the second attention energy body, for what was likely 800 hours.\n\nYou can sort of figure it out from the account.\n\nOddly, if you go visit Disneyland there's no shortage of people waiting in line for the Haunted Mansion, or the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, even knowing it's a 2 hour wait.

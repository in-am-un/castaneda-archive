I'm good at those.\n\nYour dreaming double is always out there.  He never stops!\n\nWe were created as an egglike bubble around a clump of awareness on the vast sea of the emanations. On all possible realities.\n\nYou can learn to visibly see this, with darkroom. There's no theories in sorcery, it's all available to you if you try. And stay away from phonies like Lujan Matus, Miguel Ruiz, Ken Eagle Feather, Victor Sanchez, Armando Torres, Sergio Smergio, or anyone else with a book claiming to help you understand Castaneda sorcery.\n\nAll frauds. Except Taisha and Florinda, \"the witches\" associated with Carlos.\n\nNow, your dreaming double becomes fully visible along the way. If you work hard using the instructions in here.\n\nAnd will merge with you, so that you can \"borrow\" his eyes.\n\nThe \"affection for the energy body\" Tensegrity pass is a good example of my point.\n\nDone in ABSOLUTE internal silence, the pieces of your energy body become VERY visible, and you can see them forming into a second copy of yourself.\n\nIt even has eyes. And if your hair doesn't stand up at least once while you master this pass, you're a lot braver than me.\n\nAt the end of the pass, if you do it right, you locate your double in some kind of alien world,  stuck there behind some landscaping.  In my case, stalky plants sticking straight up.\n\nTurns out, it's landscaping for his favorite shopping mall!\n\nNo kidding here.  In fact, the witches from our private classes once went \"shopping\" too long, and had Carlos very worried.\n\nWhen I push back the stalks and reach in to pull him out and give him a hug, the goal of this magical pass, I gain his vision.\n\nI can see his mall perfectly!\n\nAnd if I turn very slowly in my darkroom to face south, I can keep the view of his world on my eastern wall. It helps out with holding the assemblage point at very distant positions.\n\nBut there's a witch who visits me, even in my darkroom on occasion.\n\nWe're still working on making it \"real\".\n\nRight now, it's endless \"coincidences\".\n\nWe have no \"consensus\".\n\nBut we get \"coincidences\" so good, only an idiot would doubt them.\n\nLike two days ago when she asked me, \"Were you stuck in a star wars movie last night when I found you in dreaming?\"\n\nShe's 6000 miles away using \"womb dreaming\", which is a female variety of lucid dreaming which they can get on demand directly from being awake (usually).\n\nI was thinking, \"No, I was in that shopping mall hoping you could see that too.  Wasn't in any Star Wars movie.\"  So I had to tell her, \"I don't believe so.\"\n\nWe had no consensus.  So we couldn't \"tune in each others view of the world\".\n\nThat \"reskims\" the infinite number of \"emanations\", and can make \"micro-adjustments\" in our view of reality.  Tune in the view of two people, to be nearly a perfect match.\n\nThat's easy in the reality we share with billions of people!  That is in fact, your real world!\n\nIt's just a \"consensus\" created realm.  With the \"power\" of billions, making it very real.\n\nBut in a new one, shared by only 2, some \"tuning\" is required.\n\nThis is something the old seers did, to make \"phantom rooms\".\n\nShared realms of dreaming they could repeat, like the city the death defier made at Tula, which everyone in the lineage has visited in the last few hundred years.\n\nThey started with a single object, like a table, which both of them learned to perceive in darkness. When they both could see the same table, they'd add a vase.\n\nUntil they had an entire room.\n\nMuch of what you read in the books, did not in fact take place in the normal copy of reality.\n\nBut you don't find out until you read the very last one, written by Taisha.\n\nBut later I realized, maybe my witch comrade wasn't talking about being stuck in Star Wars while I was awake.\n\nDoing waking dreaming.\n\nMaybe she was talking about afterwards, when I used my waking dreaming to go into lucid dreaming.\n\nIt's a shame to waste it.\n\nAnd in fact, although I was not stuck in \"Star Wars\", I was indeed stuck in \"The Orville\".\n\nA Disney space show of sorts.  On the same stream service as Star Wars!\n\nI told the witch and she said, \"I've never seen star wars.  How could I know which one I was looking at?  It was kind of blurry anyway.\"\n\nI felt stupid.\n\nThat's how shared dreaming builds up.  The double, your dreaming body, can tune in 10,000 worlds for each depth of the assemblage point your waking body can move to.\n\nAnd has no way to \"adjust\" to the \"right copy of reality\".\n\nIn fact, that's the goal of 4 gates dreaming.

I&amp;#39;m good at those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your dreaming double is always out there.  He never stops!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were created as an egglike bubble around a clump of awareness on the vast sea of the emanations. On all possible realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can learn to visibly see this, with darkroom. There&amp;#39;s no theories in sorcery, it&amp;#39;s all available to you if you try. And stay away from phonies like Lujan Matus, Miguel Ruiz, Ken Eagle Feather, Victor Sanchez, Armando Torres, Sergio Smergio, or anyone else with a book claiming to help you understand Castaneda sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All frauds. Except Taisha and Florinda, &amp;quot;the witches&amp;quot; associated with Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, your dreaming double becomes fully visible along the way. If you work hard using the instructions in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And will merge with you, so that you can &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;affection for the energy body&amp;quot; Tensegrity pass is a good example of my point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Done in ABSOLUTE internal silence, the pieces of your energy body become VERY visible, and you can see them forming into a second copy of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It even has eyes. And if your hair doesn&amp;#39;t stand up at least once while you master this pass, you&amp;#39;re a lot braver than me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the pass, if you do it right, you locate your double in some kind of alien world,  stuck there behind some landscaping.  In my case, stalky plants sticking straight up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it&amp;#39;s landscaping for his favorite shopping mall!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No kidding here.  In fact, the witches from our private classes once went &amp;quot;shopping&amp;quot; too long, and had Carlos very worried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I push back the stalks and reach in to pull him out and give him a hug, the goal of this magical pass, I gain his vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see his mall perfectly!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if I turn very slowly in my darkroom to face south, I can keep the view of his world on my eastern wall. It helps out with holding the assemblage point at very distant positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a witch who visits me, even in my darkroom on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re still working on making it &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, it&amp;#39;s endless &amp;quot;coincidences&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have no &amp;quot;consensus&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we get &amp;quot;coincidences&amp;quot; so good, only an idiot would doubt them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like two days ago when she asked me, &amp;quot;Were you stuck in a star wars movie last night when I found you in dreaming?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s 6000 miles away using &amp;quot;womb dreaming&amp;quot;, which is a female variety of lucid dreaming which they can get on demand directly from being awake (usually).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking, &amp;quot;No, I was in that shopping mall hoping you could see that too.  Wasn&amp;#39;t in any Star Wars movie.&amp;quot;  So I had to tell her, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t believe so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had no consensus.  So we couldn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;tune in each others view of the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That &amp;quot;reskims&amp;quot; the infinite number of &amp;quot;emanations&amp;quot;, and can make &amp;quot;micro-adjustments&amp;quot; in our view of reality.  Tune in the view of two people, to be nearly a perfect match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s easy in the reality we share with billions of people!  That is in fact, your real world!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;consensus&amp;quot; created realm.  With the &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; of billions, making it very real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in a new one, shared by only 2, some &amp;quot;tuning&amp;quot; is required.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is something the old seers did, to make &amp;quot;phantom rooms&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shared realms of dreaming they could repeat, like the city the death defier made at Tula, which everyone in the lineage has visited in the last few hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They started with a single object, like a table, which both of them learned to perceive in darkness. When they both could see the same table, they&amp;#39;d add a vase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until they had an entire room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much of what you read in the books, did not in fact take place in the normal copy of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t find out until you read the very last one, written by Taisha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But later I realized, maybe my witch comrade wasn&amp;#39;t talking about being stuck in Star Wars while I was awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe she was talking about afterwards, when I used my waking dreaming to go into lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a shame to waste it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, although I was not stuck in &amp;quot;Star Wars&amp;quot;, I was indeed stuck in &amp;quot;The Orville&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Disney space show of sorts.  On the same stream service as Star Wars!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told the witch and she said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never seen star wars.  How could I know which one I was looking at?  It was kind of blurry anyway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how shared dreaming builds up.  The double, your dreaming body, can tune in 10,000 worlds for each depth of the assemblage point your waking body can move to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And has no way to &amp;quot;adjust&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;right copy of reality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, that&amp;#39;s the goal of 4 gates dreaming. At the end, you have to get your double to come into the &amp;quot;consensus&amp;quot; version of the blue line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the topic is KEY to shared dreaming. And to teaching I suppose, when a sorcerer is trying to bring the apprentice into the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as someone else warned you, understanding sorcery is of no use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you do it, there&amp;#39;s nothing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all just &amp;quot;becomes obvious&amp;quot; when the assemblage point moves along that J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t see the map with little pictures, here it is.

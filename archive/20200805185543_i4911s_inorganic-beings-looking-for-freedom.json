They love the feel of the lure, but dread all the work the advice implies.\n\nThis section of text from one of his last publications, is designed to give us permission to play with the inorganic beings.\n\nIt seems to have been badly misunderstood in the Castaneda world, and we have people blow through this subreddit once in a while, giving their poor interpretation of it.\n\nNamely that Carlos failed, and decided to turn into an inorganic being.\n\nTheir hope is that you're so stupid you'll believe you should follow them instead, being the purists they claim to be, who take the advice of don Juan.\n\nOr maybe you should follow them because they have something new, and better, like rehashed Hinduism.  \n\nOr stale old Chinese \"wisdom\".\n\nThere\u2019s always a book deal mindset behind that kind of stupidity.\n\nWhat they fail to realize is, we're not without a teacher.\n\nCarlos left us *intent*, and the inorganic beings.\n\nThat's how this whole sorcery thing got started in the first place!\n\nWe just don't have the human help anymore, outside his books.\n\nIt's up to you to change yourself and evolve.", "edited": 1596649837.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g0gtc64", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of his life, when the news came that Carlos wasn&amp;#39;t going to be cured of his cancer, he began to &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; his private class lectures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d run out of time, and his students were not advanced enough to survive his death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The writing was on the wall.

We need to be rewarded along the way, or we&amp;#39;ll stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He began to push us in the direction of playing with inorganic beings, as a substitute teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were in private classes, there were rumors each class about what was coming next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thinking was, he&amp;#39;d give us a demonstration of &amp;quot;real magic&amp;quot;. The in-your-face kind that everyone was craving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he did. But what people didn&amp;#39;t realize was, sorcery is a very long process. It&amp;#39;s very fun once you actually give it a try, but a single event isn&amp;#39;t going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, he got Carol Tiggs to show me the entry way into the inorganic being\u2019s realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tunnel of dirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he also introduced us to Little Smoke, and Devil\u2019s weed, knowing that once they are aware of you, they keep trying to interact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently Inorganic beings can evolve also, and so the relationship can be beneficial to both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he taught us about \u201cthe wall\u201d, where we could get direct assistance from &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, how to manifest objects, so we could amuse ourselves and provide our own \u201cproof\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; energy on the horizon, so we could explore the endless worlds available to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He banned me from reading his books, which included his final publications. So this is the first time I have seen this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those final publications were the \u201chow to\u201d books. If you can\u2019t see that now, you will later on. It\u2019s hard at first to tell the difference between Carlos luring us, and Carlos advising us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most everyone out there is &amp;quot;lured&amp;quot;, but is not taking his advice.  They love the feel of the lure, but dread all the work the advice implies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This section of text from one of his last publications, is designed to give us permission to play with the inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to have been badly misunderstood in the Castaneda world, and we have people blow through this subreddit once in a while, giving their poor interpretation of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Namely that Carlos failed, and decided to turn into an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their hope is that you&amp;#39;re so stupid you&amp;#39;ll believe you should follow them instead, being the purists they claim to be, who take the advice of don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you should follow them because they have something new, and better, like rehashed Hinduism.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or stale old Chinese &amp;quot;wisdom&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s always a book deal mindset behind that kind of stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they fail to realize is, we&amp;#39;re not without a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos left us &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, and the inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how this whole sorcery thing got started in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just don&amp;#39;t have the human help anymore, outside his books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s up to you to change yourself and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null,

Sorcerers back then liked the idea, and after generations of people viewing it that way, we can't see it without interpretation anymore.\n\nYou can experience that yourself!  Juan has.  Not clearly yet, but there will be a time when he explains how he looked into a cloud of energy, thought he recognized a feature, and that cause the entire cloud to turn into the thing he recognized.\n\nWhatever \"it\" (The Eagle) is, it's sort of like that theory that the universe makes life, so it can become aware of itself.\n\nSupposedly humans are fixed containers loaded with a finite amount of energy.\n\nAt death, the energy leaks out.\n\nWithout a container, it's typically consumed by that Eagle.\n\nIt's consumed as a series of memories, sort of like watching a review of your life at death.\n\nMy suspicion is that you believe yourself to be inside the memory, during the review.  And that's why you're trapped.  As each memory goes by, you lose the energy you were given.\n\nA sorcerer recapitulates his life in as much detail as he can, which keeps him from being pulled into the memories.\n\nAn alternate explanation Cholita said Taisha taught her, is that you make a copy of yourself with the recap, and the Eagle is either too dense to realize that (Eagle's aren't that bright), or because you worked so hard, he lets you sneak by him.\n\nLike letting a rat escape because he caught squirrel.\n\nBut the Eagle keeps track.

He had a loose tooth, his tongue got burned at lunch.  He had endless excuses, none of which were very convincing.  But out of politeness no one wanted to call him a liar to his face, so he got away with it for a while. Or maybe they were afraid he'd throw a tantrum, and no one wanted to volunteer for his wrath. So no one spoke up.\n\nI must admit his family was a bit too hippy for me . They even lived in a geodesic dome.  It was one of those \"Tensegrity\" structures from the 70s, which could be purchased off one of the freeways leading towards the Indian reservations south of LA.  Near the nudists' colony below Corona.\n\nThat very same freeway leads all the way into Mexico, to the very spot where the Yaqui wars took place.  So Carlos would have traveled that road a lot.  He might even have noticed the lovely model dome home visible from the freeway on a little hill, with all the colorful flags waving from its weird roof, to welcome visitors inside.\n\nThey always had free coffee and cookies, if you wanted to visit the aging dome. It became something of a local tourist attraction, on the way to scoring a lid in the area where no roads were actually paved.  Especially if you had the munchies.\n\nThey sold \"do it yourself dome kits\" as being better for the environment, because they used less wood to enclose more space.   That also meant they could sell them for much less than a traditional house.\n\nJust $10K for your own home!\n\nOf course, the roofs leaked.  And the walls sloped up in a curve, so furniture near the walls wasn't practical.  But hippies back then were handy with buckets, and bean bag chairs will fit anywhere.\n\nThe little kid with all the excuses had a  mom who firmly believed the macro-biotic food she served was healthier.  And so for a while she gave him the \"better offer\" he was after at dinner time, or at the least he got a lot of attention for his poor sore tooth, even if he had to eventually eat what they had.\n\nBut things just kept escalating, so finally she figured out how to get him to eat his real dinner.\n\nShe thought up horrible alternatives for any mouth or stomach malady he could think up. If he said his stomach was upset and couldn't digest the wild plants she'd gathered from the side of the dirt roads, she'd offer to puree it like baby food, mixed with some Castor oil.\n\nI don't know what made me think of that story.\n\nPossibly it's because I'm here in the dark room trying to summon a \"finger wiggle demon\",  so I can use it in a puppet show, while Cholita is chirping loudly like a frantic bird, two rooms away from me.\n\nAt any rate, a very good idea came to me just beforehand.  Something one of our visitors who can't find their internal dialogue can do, to find it.  Or something a person who is already silent but can can't see colors, could also use to make up for it.\n\nNo one can keep their awareness focused on the same thing, perfectly.  Not for long.  Not even a Zen master has that sort of control over their awareness.\n\nI supposed you can \"get into the flow\" with a hobby, and seem to keep your concentration entirely on the same thing.  But in fact, I suspect you haven't really done that, and your internal dialogue simply finds the use of your hands pleasant, while it goes free style.\n\nIf you could interrupt that freedom, you could measure how long you can concentrate on the same thing.  In other words, find both a hobby,  and a way to prevent fantasizing because fantasizing interrupts the hobby itself.\n\nAnd, meditation folks like to replace the internal dialogue with something else. Maybe over time they learned that one in 20 can't find their internal dialogue, and that means less paying customers. And so they decided to simply replace it with something else.\n\nYou might be able to claim you can't find your internal dialogue, but it's pretty hard to claim you can't think at all.\n\nA mantra to replace the internal dialogue has the added benefit of delaying real magic for their paying students, who tend to leave once they have the real thing.\n\nIt also brings up an interesting question. If they replace it with a mantra, do the meditation teachers ever have someone claim they can't form a mantra in their mind, because they don't have an internal dialogue in which to say it?\n\nI kind of doubt it.  Like mac and cheese, repeating mantras is easy to enjoy.\n\nWhile forcing silence is like eating a plate of boiled grains and beans, with brown rice. \n\nI know.   We used to go to the restaurant below Dance Home often, where you did in fact end up with a giant plate of boiled stuff, with no sauce or spices.\n\nIt was next to the witchcraft book store, which had an entire shelf for the works of Carlos Castaneda.\n\nThey called the restaurant, \"Real Food\", and insisted you should eat it daily.  And stay away from \"Lucy's\", a favorite Mexican food, with fries and burgers style restaurant, among private class students.\n\nI suggest then, we have a perfect solution for those who can't find their internal dialogue.\n\nMake a good recapitulation list, good enough for a full month of 1 hour a day, and go through it in a closet or somewhere private, non-stop.\n\nNo breaks.  No fantasizing. Just down the list, with no interruptions.\n\nNow, find out what prevents that.  What makes you stop doing the technique for a few seconds.\n\nYou will.  Periodically the Eagle commands us to \"take an inventory\", perhaps so no one zones out with their awareness stuck on the abstract for too long.\n\nWe always stop for a mental break, even if we intend not to.\n\nThat's the internal dialogue. It takes the inventory.\n\nIf you find that nothing stops you, because you truly don't have an internal dialogue, then you hit the jackpot!\n\nYou don't need darkroom gazing.  You can recapitulate at 10 times the speed of a person burdened with an internal dialogue.\n\nYou can get all of your energy back quickly, and combined with your perfect silence you will automatically become a sorcerer.\n\nI have to go.  Cholita stopped chirping and is banging doors.  When I got home today, the house was filled with pleasant smelling smoke of several varieties, and Cholita was coincidentally bent over facing away from me in blue shorts,  in her little garden paradise easily visible as you walk in the house, beating on a rug that presumably needed to be dusted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Can't Find The Internal Dialogue?

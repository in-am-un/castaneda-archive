She blocked me from practicing.\n\nSo last night I \"ambushed\" her.  I simply started practicing before she could catch me, summoned her with 4 of her passes, and then continued what we had been doing 2 nights ago.\n\nExcept, she didn't want to play that game again.\n\nI couldn't get her bright enough, to make it worth playing.\n\nI blew into her, but the result was feeble.  So I stood her back up in the sock puppet prep mode, and scooped  bright puffs of color onto her.\n\nShe got brighter on the very first one, and I wondered, was she wearing that shirt before?\n\nThe next puff transformed her into a black lace outfit.\n\nI wish I could remember the rest of the costume changes, but I was more focused on how the puff of light was absorbed into her.  The main puff would hit her and sink, but behind her it seemed to ooze out, and fade away.   In a different, \"colder\" color.\n\nBut it was the oozing created the new outfit. It produced ripples in reality, which settled down over the details of the outfit.\n\nI was fascinated with each scoop, until Fancy turned to her right, and leapt at a downward angle.\n\n\"Hey, where are you going?\" I said.  \n\nShe'd jumped into a dreaming scene.  It was appropriate for the Victorian costume she was wearing when she leapt away.\n\nMy first thought was the TV she'd been watching 2 days ago, in the sock puppet show.\n\nBut this was all around Fancy, she wasn't looking into it.  And there was nothing rectangular about the scene at all.\n\nThe boundaries were determined by objects in the scene.

Maybe someone else will see it more clearly if they can repeat the experience.

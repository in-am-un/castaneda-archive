But that\u2019s how I felt about it.\n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t alone. There were mumblings in class about how there wasn\u2019t any tensegrity in his books (horribly untrue), and that he\u2019d merely copied Howard's movements.\n\nAlso horribly untrue.\n\nMy embarrassment at hearing about redeploying energy stemmed from not realizing that sorcery terms are literal.\n\nThey aren\u2019t poetic Buddhist phrases designed to puzzle the mind.\n\n*Seeing* just means, you see something that can\u2019t be there. So it\u2019s put in italics.\n\n*Dreaming* just means, you\u2019ve become lucid in the dream, and are behaving as if it were real. Thus the italics to make sure you know what\u2019s being discussed.\n\nAn \u201cInorganic Being\u201d is merely a being you can perceive in front of you, which has no organic body. Well\u2026 There are dream phantasms.  Those tend to belong to an entire dreaming scene.\n\nBut more on that later.\n\n\u201cThe Intent of the Sorcerer\u2019s of Ancient Mexico\", is literally that. Intent left over from their sorcery doings, which we can tap into as an aid to our sorcery practices.  Think of it like smells, lingering in the air.  Most people don't notice all the smells around them, but sorcerers are silent, so they can pick up even the faint ones.\n\nAnd as it turns out, there is in fact energy floating around you at arms length,  on the edge of a virtual sphere, and you can redeploy it to the middle.\n\nHow could it be any simpler?  Not cheesy at all.\n\nThe problem is, until you can be silent while doing the tensegrity, your assemblage point can\u2019t shift enough to perceive what the movements are doing.\n\nBut once you can *see* it, the wide selection of Tensegrity techniques become practical. They\u2019re no longer just exercises; they\u2019re techniques to invoke sorcery effects.\n\nAs such, they\u2019re valuable. If you have a video or workshop notes, try to put It out on the web so it has a better chance of surviving. We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface for discovering what Carlos hid in the tensegrity.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily according to a master plan he had. He created movements in an organic fashion, drawing from what was happening among his apprentices. But as he tinkered, he embedded knowledge.\n\nYesterday when I got home, Cholita seemed to be in a better mood. I was happy to see that, but also a little disappointed.\n\nWhen she hates me, I get to lock myself up in my room and practice gazing in darkness. When she\u2019s in a good mood, I get to go shopping until the stores close.\n\nNaturally I have a preference.\n\nShe announced that she\u2019d like to go get something to eat in 1 hour. That\u2019s code for Whole Foods Market.\n\nI waited, but when the hour was up I found her in the kitchen struggling to open a safety seal on a bottle of mixed spices. She looked at me, fumbling a little knife in her shaking hands and said, \u201cI know **you\u2019re** the one making this difficult!\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cSo, no dinner tonight?\u201d.\n\nShe said, \u201cJust go to your room and leave me alone.\u201d\n\nThat night I wanted to investigate the little \u201cgalaxy\u201d someone mentioned. I hadn\u2019t gotten into the habit of calling the lights I can see in darkness a little galaxy, but that\u2019s a pretty good description.\n\nMy problem is, those are associated with inorganic beings.  In a BIG way.  If you learn to play with them, you\u2019ll agree.\n\nBut Carlos\u2019 allies look like a bar of light. I\u2019ve seen it on 3 occasions and can verify it. I saw it even before I read that description in his last books, since he\u2019d banned me from reading them.\n\nAnd good thing.  I verified much of what Carlos added in his last books, on my own.\n\nThat's a lot more convincing than reading about something, and then seeing it.\n\nYes, Carlos\u2019 allies do in fact look like a bar of light, when *seen* in a certain way.\n\nThe low energy inorganic beings do not.  They appear as a collection of little dots and squares of light, weakly connected with thin fibers.  Occasionally an outer shell can be seen.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with the discrepancy,  and did Carlos ever mention the little galaxies?\n\nI don't know anything about why there's a discrepancy. We should all endeavor to just use what we get, and stop worrying about racking up sorcery merit badges by doing things according to the Sorcerer's Boy Scout manual.\n\nThe only way we'll figure out what's universal, and what isn't, is with more people who can *see*.\n\nThat's what were working on here.\n\nIn the meantime, Carlos did in fact mention the little galaxies.\n\nOne of the women had seen it.\n\nIt was a woman I never mixed with.  Carlos had created some kind of barrier between us. I was even afraid to look at her eyes in class.\n\nCarlos had a way of creating rifts.\n\nHe brought the galaxy up while she was standing closer to  him than usual, and he smiled like there was some kind of prank involved.  As far as I know, he never mentioned it again.\n\nBut he did mention the \u201csworl\u201d multiple times. It spins off text you can read, and apparently entire cities, going by the painting he showed us.\n\nIt once formed a portal to another world for me, and I was able to enter it.\n\nIs the sworl the same thing as the little galaxy?\n\nIt\u2019s not.\n\nI have several students who have seen the sworl. I\u2019ve read accounts of people who have no knowledge of sorcery, but saw the sworl as a child, floating on their ceiling at night.\n\nIt\u2019s a real thing, and not the same as the little galaxy.\n\nThe sworl seems to spin off pieces from the second attention.\n\nIt isn\u2019t consumed by spinning them off. It remains in place.\n\nThe little galaxies transform into hypnogogic images. You can\u2019t see both, except during a transition. More on that later.\n\nI keep saying more on that later, for a reason. When I turned off the lights last night, I instantly had all 3 kinds of colors you can see in darkness.

Patches, around the size of a basketball.\n\nBut the purple dreaming fog was also present. It's made of streaks of purple haze, with almost no empty spaces between them. It fills the entire room.\n\nAnd the fine whitish lines and folds were also present on all surfaces.\n\nRather than being in a perfectly dark room, I was instead in the middle of what looked like a Disneyland ride. There was colorful stuff to see from all angles. And it wasn't dim.\n\nI sat up on my bed to try to intercept the *intent* of local dreamers. As best I can figure, it remains in the air while someone is dreaming.\n\nIt\u2019s a faint signal, but you can pick it up.\n\nAnd you know that you\u2019ve picked it up because you\u2019ll find yourself watching a piece of a dream. It\u2019s not like the inorganic being manifestations, which tend to be mostly transparent.\n\nIt\u2019s a little chunk of someone\u2019s dream.\n\nI saw a woman dressed in old fashioned clothing, laying in bed with her reading glasses. It was like a cutout from a magazine.\n\nShe was fully animated, meaning, she didn\u2019t skip images only when I was watching.\n\nIt was a full on video of that chunk of the dream.\n\nShe turned to get a glass of water from her nightstand.\n\nI gazed around the room, focusing my attention on the thick purple fog. Each patch I gazed at began to create another piece of someone\u2019s dream.\n\nAfter a half hour, the room was filled with all sorts of odd activities.\n\nExcept that I could only perceive them one at a time. They seemed to be happening at fixed locations. I could look to the left to see the old woman with reading glasses, or look to the far right to see a man running from something.\n\nBut nowhere did I find Cholita.\n\nWithout Cholita, I have no way to verify those are in fact someone\u2019s dream.\n\nI got up from the bed, to look more closely at the fine lines and folds.\n\nAs I was gazing at them, I noticed I could now see the entire nightstand, and all the objects on it. And yet, the room was pitch black.\n\nThey were built out of a network of those fibers and folds, like a vague white outline on the objects, with moving wrinkles on the flat surface.\n\nI turned my head and torso to the extreme, to see what was up to the right.\n\nI saw one of those little galaxies made out of small lights and threads of light.\n\nI tried to scoop it, but I wasn\u2019t willing to turn my head to assist. It had to be directional to get my attention.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t follow just my hand, so I ignored it.\n\nI looked on the left, stretching so that it was an unusual position, and again there was the little galaxy.\n\nI contorted and turned to get the maximum unusual stretches, and looked all around the room, leaning way back.\n\nAnytime my posture was unusual, I saw energy where I gazed. It wasn't always a little galaxy, but there were very intense patches of purple and red.\n\nIt was all around me, stuck at the outskirts of some virtual circle, perhaps the size of my arms outstretched as Carlos once described. Except, really really outstretched. Someone else who can *see* energy claims the edge is actually 15 feet from you.\n\nI couldn't dispute that.\n\nI got the idea to \u201credeploy\u201d it, since it was so abundant. I got to see my own luminous shell the last time I scooped up that much energy.\n\nI started pulling on the fog strands as if they were thick ropes, I scooped as far out and around me as possible, stuffing the results back onto my stomach, and I even pushed things there. It started to bloat, so I wiggled my fingers in the middle of it, to activate my second attention's assemblage point.\n\nA little galaxy materialized where I was wiggling.\n\nI was in no way stretching, or in any kind of unusual position. And the galaxy seemed to be directional now. It was located whereever it was located, and had no connection to my head, or how my body was contorted.\n\nThe galaxy was behaving like an inorganic being, attracted to the energy I was scooping.\n\nIt\u2019s been weeks now, and I have no inorganic being to play with. Carlos\u2019 allies won\u2019t come when summoned, my little Fairy flew the coop, and Zoltar went home.\n\nHe didn't even phone first.\n\nI\u2019ve tried pushing and pulling on inorganics in their own world, hoping to entice one here. But I can\u2019t get one to follow me.\n\nNow, here in my hands, was a potential new inorganic being to play with. By scooping and \u201credeploying\u201d energy from the periphery of my luminous cocoon, I\u2019d attracted the attention of this entity.\n\nAn entity which seems to have started as some kind of body defect, perhaps with the contortion of stretching altering the blood flow to the eyes and brain, producing the little galaxy vision.\n\nBut this was now independent, and behaving like it was alive.\n\nI stared into it, knowing not to keep that up too long, or I\u2019d lose consciousness.\n\nThat\u2019s the value of having an inorganic being to play with. They\u2019re pure second attention. They aren\u2019t vague blobs.\n\nThey\u2019re simply mesmerizing. Like a beautiful woman.\n\nStaring at those will move your assemblage point very quickly, as long as you can hold silence.\n\nI mean, the galaxy. Not the woman. Staring at those has a different effect.\n\nLooking into the galaxy, which was pretty much sitting on my lap now, I could see that it was actually 2 pieces.\n\nIt might be described as 2 galaxies, colliding. There were discrete boundaries on both halves. The left half was a little sturdier than the right half.\n\nThe odd thing about the galaxy is that it had taken me months to learn to see my little fairy in her native form, as a collection of little lights, similar to that little galaxy.\n\nI had to stare down the hypnogogic images she produces, to get to that form.\n\nEventually it became easy, but at first it was difficult.\n\nSo how come my first encounter with this little galaxy was in it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d form? I had yet to see it produce any hypnogogic images.\n\nI began to wonder if it could even make them. Maybe this wasn\u2019t what I believed it to be.\n\nAs soon as I had that thought a loving couple, kissing, slowly rose up from the little galaxy. It was as if they were submerged in it, and came up so that I could see them.\n\nThere were 2 beings!  That's  unusual.\n\nThey weren\u2019t fully animated. Their rate of change in images corresponded to me looking at them.\n\nIf I saw it, it changed to the next image. \n\nDreaming phantasms don't do that. They're fully animated, perhaps because they're entirely in our mind.\n\nThe couple kept kissing, and it didn't look like there would be sex anytime soon.  So I refocused my attention to see the galaxy in it\u2019s native form.\n\nIt had clear boundaries. I felt as if I could pick it up, and my hands would actually feel something semi-solid. I fancied I could feel it's weight, while it was resting on my lap like that.\n\nWhen I had the thought to pick it up, a gigantic woman\u2019s head projected out from the galaxy, with a stern look on her face.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t transparent. She was solid.\n\nAnd yet, she had a ghastly bluish color, so I wasn\u2019t in any danger of wanting to flee. I knew it had come from the little galaxy.\n\nThe head was so large that I had to look up to see all of it. It filled my view of the room.\n\nI turned my head to see how far it extended, and another head materialized. This one was male.\n\nNeither of them gave me the feeling they were the same entity I\u2019d trained to be a fairy.\n\nThis one had a frantic feeling to it. More solid and real, and in a hurry.\n\nBy comparison, my little fairy is on tranquilizers. She's as mellow as can be.\n\nI thought about the argument I\u2019ve gotten into on a YouTube channel. Someone pointed me there, I commented, and since then I get periodic questions.\n\nOne guy insists Carlos has been disproved as a perverted fraud, a narcissist who made the whole thing up. Someone else there, or maybe him, actually made up a story about a suicide pact.\n\nI have to wonder why a man would go around spreading his own misery, as if it didn't matter at all what he made up.\n\nWatching inorganic being\u2019s heads materialize and fill the room, with the purple dream fog everywhere, and the walls and objects on tables visible even in darkness, I felt a little sad for the guy.\n\nI hope he\u2019s come over here to read how absurd his comments were.  But typically angry people never stop being angry.  They're actually angry with themselves.", "edited": 1572720908.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f67g99j", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued from earlier&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were strong blobs of purple floating around.

It fills the entire room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the fine whitish lines and folds were also present on all surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than being in a perfectly dark room, I was instead in the middle of what looked like a Disneyland ride. There was colorful stuff to see from all angles. And it wasn&amp;#39;t dim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up on my bed to try to intercept the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of local dreamers. As best I can figure, it remains in the air while someone is dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a faint signal, but you can pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you know that you\u2019ve picked it up because you\u2019ll find yourself watching a piece of a dream. It\u2019s not like the inorganic being manifestations, which tend to be mostly transparent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a little chunk of someone\u2019s dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a woman dressed in old fashioned clothing, laying in bed with her reading glasses. It was like a cutout from a magazine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was fully animated, meaning, she didn\u2019t skip images only when I was watching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a full on video of that chunk of the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned to get a glass of water from her nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed around the room, focusing my attention on the thick purple fog. Each patch I gazed at began to create another piece of someone\u2019s dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a half hour, the room was filled with all sorts of odd activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that I could only perceive them one at a time. They seemed to be happening at fixed locations. I could look to the left to see the old woman with reading glasses, or look to the far right to see a man running from something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But nowhere did I find Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without Cholita, I have no way to verify those are in fact someone\u2019s dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up from the bed, to look more closely at the fine lines and folds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was gazing at them, I noticed I could now see the entire nightstand, and all the objects on it.

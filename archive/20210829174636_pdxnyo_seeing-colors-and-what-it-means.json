You might even think you're at the bottom, in the middle, and then you start to move, and you assume it's forward and up the front again.\n\nBut it's sideways.\n\nBeginners:  You can **feel** that you are moving!  But in the red zone, it's very hard to feel which direction it is.  It's not so hard in the green zone, which is why we don't talk about drugs trapping you up there.\n\nJuan and I got stuck recently, just by playing around there in the red zone, drug free.\n\nBut with drugs it's worse because it's horizontally shifted quite a bit.\n\nHowever, the red zone is huge fun and I doubt anyone would feel bad about being able to go there without the drugs!  Stuck or not, you'd be kicking Robert Monroe's greedy butt.\n\nAnd if someone found themselves stuck there, some dark energy could get you out.\n\nWe could figure it out, if a heavy shroom user managed to overcome the laziness that shrooms cause, and made it to the bottom drug free.\n\nThe problem is possibly similar to Lucid Dreaming or Astral Travel.\n\nThose are false narratives which prevent you from learning.  People think they have \"skills\" and won't let go of the belief they've got an advantage long enough to work hard to learn the real thing.\n\nAstral Travel is especially delusional.  It teaches you there's an essence of \"you\" that lives inside your body, like you were a garage for the real thing.  With silver chords connecting you, and who knows what other untrue stuff.\n\nAnd it teaches you to confuse a dream with the dreaming double, in order to get attention for yourself.  And you have lots of \"buddies\" supporting your right to make up stuff and get attention. Even verifying your make believe, is not make believe.\n\nIt also harms the possibility of beckoning \"the double\" before you can actually see it.\n\nThe double is outside, always wandering around. But if you believe it's inside you, there's no chance to notice it.\n\nThe first time you notice it \"out there\", it'll just be a \"pull\" coming from a specific direction in the dark room.\n\nYou'll probably confuse it with an intercepted dream if you have incorrect understandings of the double in your mind.\n\nAside from destroying the correct *intent*, so that you won't get much help from the Olmec's *intent*, it seems to create people on such gigantic ego trips they just fall apart in here and curse everyone.\n\nI've gotten death threats from astral travelers who badly wanted to get \"the respect they deserve\" in a place that actually matters (here).\n\nBut many in here have taken shrooms.

When someone comes here, we make them fill out the questionnaire.\n\nFor instance:\n\n1 How often do you masturbate?\n\n2 Are you a drug addict?\n\n3 Are you an alcoholic?\n\n4 If you made friends with a demon, do you believe God would punish you?\n\nJeremy had a questionnaire to join the nearly gone \"sustained action\".\n\nI had a student get quizzed years ago, and he stormed out of there.\n\nAll they asked was, what's your favorite color...", "edited": 1630274131.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_haurwzs", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They get you stuck in the red zone, sideways shifted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Create a &amp;quot;flat spot&amp;quot;, so that as you do darkroom gazing and want to come up the front to the orange zone, you&amp;#39;re stuck at the bottom in the red.  You might even think you&amp;#39;re at the bottom, in the middle, and then you start to move, and you assume it&amp;#39;s forward and up the front again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beginners:  You can &lt;strong&gt;feel&lt;/strong&gt; that you are moving!  But in the red zone, it&amp;#39;s very hard to feel which direction it is.  It&amp;#39;s not so hard in the green zone, which is why we don&amp;#39;t talk about drugs trapping you up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan and I got stuck recently, just by playing around there in the red zone, drug free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with drugs it&amp;#39;s worse because it&amp;#39;s horizontally shifted quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the red zone is huge fun and I doubt anyone would feel bad about being able to go there without the drugs!  Stuck or not, you&amp;#39;d be kicking Robert Monroe&amp;#39;s greedy butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if someone found themselves stuck there, some dark energy could get you out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could figure it out, if a heavy shroom user managed to overcome the laziness that shrooms cause, and made it to the bottom drug free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is possibly similar to Lucid Dreaming or Astral Travel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are false narratives which prevent you from learning.  People think they have &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot; and won&amp;#39;t let go of the belief they&amp;#39;ve got an advantage long enough to work hard to learn the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Astral Travel is especially delusional.  It teaches you there&amp;#39;s an essence of &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; that lives inside your body, like you were a garage for the real thing.  With silver chords connecting you, and who knows what other untrue stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it teaches you to confuse a dream with the dreaming double, in order to get attention for yourself.  And you have lots of &amp;quot;buddies&amp;quot; supporting your right to make up stuff and get attention. Even verifying your make believe, is not make believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also harms the possibility of beckoning &amp;quot;the double&amp;quot; before you can actually see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double is outside, always wandering around. But if you believe it&amp;#39;s inside you, there&amp;#39;s no chance to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice it &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;ll just be a &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; coming from a specific direction in the dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll probably confuse it with an intercepted dream if you have incorrect understandings of the double in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from destroying the correct &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, so that you won&amp;#39;t get much help from the Olmec&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, it seems to create people on such gigantic ego trips they just fall apart in here and curse everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gotten death threats from astral travelers who badly wanted to get &amp;quot;the respect they deserve&amp;quot; in a place that actually matters (here).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But many in here have taken shrooms.

And trolls.\n\nThose are typically easy to detect because they never learn enough in here to tell convincing lies.\n\nBut if they did, it would be near to impossible to figure it out.\n\nWhen this place was much newer, some bad apples came along to pretend to be working, and having no results.\n\nIt seemed to me like Jeremy and his friend again, but Techno thought I was being paranoid.\n\nJeremy is a private class student who wanted to be famous as the one who exposed the fraud of Carlos.\n\nThis place made him look like an whiny baby idiot, so he tried to take it down a few ways and got banned.\n\nBut some \"weird\" people showed up not too long after that.\n\nOne was a couple.  The woman did all the talking.  If there even was one.  And it was odd. Sometimes she said it was her, and other times she claimed it was him, using her ID. Which would be consistant with a banned guy who needed another idea to post here.\n\nThey said they'd been following all instructions for 7 weeks, and nothing had happened.  Tried to guilt trip me a couple of times in private chat, before they posted their problems in the public posting area.\n\nTrying to discourage others I suppose?\n\nBad players often do that.  Running man ran around in private chat telling people Carlos thought I was a clown.  It was nice to see Amy disprove that in a magazine interview.\n\nNow running man has his own group, and has stolen what we do in here, claiming his is better.\n\nThere's really delusional people in this stuff.\n\nBut the \"couple\" that came here was so stupid, they gave themselves away with their crazy claims.\n\nAt one point the woman said BOTH of them had tried hard for 7 weeks, and nothing had happened.\n\nAnd that they'd \"reached enlightenment\" but still no colors.\n\nWhat would be nice is to have enough information to always tell when someone is making stuff up.\n\nAnd also enough info to help someone who's not going as fast as we'd hope.\n\nThis is waking dreaming.  And there's the whole thing about \"stalker\" versus \"dreamer\".\n\nI'm not sure why that separation exists.  Taisha is a stalker, but Zuleica is a dreaming instructor.  And Zuleica taught her all the way to bringing out her double, into the real world.\n\nMy guess: Everyone can do waking dreamer.  The stalker thing is more of a preference, than a limitation. Or perhaps it refers to 4 gates dreaming. Some just don't get the \"wake up\" call inside the dream.\n\nBut when it comes to waking dreaming, like we're doing, frankly, if the internal dialogue stops the world stops.\n\nIt can't be any other way. It's why a bump on the head causes hallucinations.  It's why power plants can cause them too. They alter the internal dialogue. You can notice that if you are sensitive.\n\nAnd meditation merely alters the internal dialogue by replacing it with a mantra and such.  All of it's cool effects are simply a partial job of shutting off the internal dialogue.\n\nSo we know it works on everyone.\n\nAnd  you get to see exactly why, near the purple zone on the J curve.\n\nYou can nearly shut the world on and off over and over, for periods of just a few seconds.\n\nAnd it's all internal dialogue controlled.\n\nBut a much deeper, \"trace level\" of the internal dialogue.\n\nAt that \"near purple\" position of the J curve, when it's \"on\" it's still crystalline dreaming fog you perceive, except in whitish light instead of the colorful stuff in the red zone.\n\nSo you can oscillate between amazing levels of visible magic, and the world coming to an end.\n\nIt makes you feel bad for people who have trouble seeing colors, because you know full well it's their periodic thinking in words causing that.\n\nBut they might feel that it's some sort of \"realness\" that is holding them back.

And trolls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are typically easy to detect because they never learn enough in here to tell convincing lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they did, it would be near to impossible to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When this place was much newer, some bad apples came along to pretend to be working, and having no results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed to me like Jeremy and his friend again, but Techno thought I was being paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeremy is a private class student who wanted to be famous as the one who exposed the fraud of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This place made him look like an whiny baby idiot, so he tried to take it down a few ways and got banned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; people showed up not too long after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One was a couple.  The woman did all the talking.  If there even was one.  And it was odd. Sometimes she said it was her, and other times she claimed it was him, using her ID. Which would be consistant with a banned guy who needed another idea to post here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They said they&amp;#39;d been following all instructions for 7 weeks, and nothing had happened.  Tried to guilt trip me a couple of times in private chat, before they posted their problems in the public posting area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to discourage others I suppose?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad players often do that.  Running man ran around in private chat telling people Carlos thought I was a clown.  It was nice to see Amy disprove that in a magazine interview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now running man has his own group, and has stolen what we do in here, claiming his is better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s really delusional people in this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the &amp;quot;couple&amp;quot; that came here was so stupid, they gave themselves away with their crazy claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point the woman said BOTH of them had tried hard for 7 weeks, and nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that they&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;reached enlightenment&amp;quot; but still no colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would be nice is to have enough information to always tell when someone is making stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also enough info to help someone who&amp;#39;s not going as fast as we&amp;#39;d hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is waking dreaming.  And there&amp;#39;s the whole thing about &amp;quot;stalker&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;dreamer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why that separation exists.  Taisha is a stalker, but Zuleica is a dreaming instructor.  And Zuleica taught her all the way to bringing out her double, into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess: Everyone can do waking dreamer.  The stalker thing is more of a preference, than a limitation. Or perhaps it refers to 4 gates dreaming. Some just don&amp;#39;t get the &amp;quot;wake up&amp;quot; call inside the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to waking dreaming, like we&amp;#39;re doing, frankly, if the internal dialogue stops the world stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t be any other way. It&amp;#39;s why a bump on the head causes hallucinations.  It&amp;#39;s why power plants can cause them too. They alter the internal dialogue. You can notice that if you are sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And meditation merely alters the internal dialogue by replacing it with a mantra and such.  All of it&amp;#39;s cool effects are simply a partial job of shutting off the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we know it works on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  you get to see exactly why, near the purple zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can nearly shut the world on and off over and over, for periods of just a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s all internal dialogue controlled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a much deeper, &amp;quot;trace level&amp;quot; of the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that &amp;quot;near purple&amp;quot; position of the J curve, when it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s still crystalline dreaming fog you perceive, except in whitish light instead of the colorful stuff in the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can oscillate between amazing levels of visible magic, and the world coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes you feel bad for people who have trouble seeing colors, because you know full well it&amp;#39;s their periodic thinking in words causing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they might feel that it&amp;#39;s some sort of &amp;quot;realness&amp;quot; that is holding them back.  That the world is &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, and we&amp;#39;re trying to override that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not!

The consistency, the overwhelming forces, the visiions that would overlay the \"story\" that was taking place in life, the abstractions - but perhaps that was only after I \"opened a door\" by taking an absolutely absurd amount of research chemicals after years of pushing laterally in the red zone on psychedelics. A barrier broke and the things that happened are often hard to explain. The first time it happened, for example, I could see all my thoughts and, while awake and in light, would be slammed with dozens of visions, back to back to back, the vast majority of them being so abstract I slowly lost my ability to even remember them over the next week.

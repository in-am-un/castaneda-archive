People interpret it in a greedy fashion, wishing they had that kind of power so they could show off for their friends.\n\nCastaneda fans always miss the key details of what was really going on in a story from the books, because it spoils their goal of attention seeking.\n\nI'm commenting about this, because someone in here switched to their double in a very nearly perfect copy of their real room.\n\nWe've both been trying to \"tune in\" this reality, with humorous results.\n\nAnd with Cholita interfering a bit too to make sure it doesn't go too well for us.\n\nThis \"principle\" is why Zuleica warned Taisha in her last book that she might suddenly find herself on the other side of the patio, without remembering how she got there.\n\nWhen the double finally manages to assemble a phantom copy of reality that is 90% the real copy, there's always some \"discrepancies\".  But the key to it all, is that you are perfectly lucid, and it's clearly not a dream. Yet, something about it is \"impossible\".\n\nRemember, all dreams are not equal. There are out of control sleeping dreams, dreams with a sorcery theme that are still just ordinary, and caused by your obsession with it.\n\nAnd waking dreams that are never perfectly real, but still fully visible and real with your eyes open, and completely sober.\n\nAnd there are waking dreams across portals, where you left your darkroom rightt through a solid wall, and find yourself in a perfectly real world, absolutely lucid and rational. For hours.\n\nThose are NOT the same things.\n\nThey're various levels of using the double, merged with your tonal awareness.\n\nBut if you've done these a few times, you learn to detect when it's really your double coming out into the real world.  And what sorts of side effects that has.\n\nAside from \"shock\" at some point as it dawns on you.\n\nIt is unfortunately a topic you can't discuss in an open learning environment like this one, because attention seekers can pretend it to get attention. So they feel better about never actually going any real work.\n\nBut when it happens for real, it's totally amazing.  \n\nAnd likely to be very rare, and only experienced by those who put in all the hard work to get there.\n\nI've only done it less times than I can count on my fingers.  That is, switch to my double, and find my way in the real world.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"To be a sorcerer is a terrible burden,\" don Juan said in a reassuring tone. \"I've told you that it is much better to learn to see. A man who sees is everything; in comparison, the sorcerer is a sad fellow.\"\n\n\"What is sorcery, don Juan?\"\n\nHe looked at me for a long time as he shook his head almost imperceptibly.\n\n\"Sorcery is to apply one's will to a key joint,\" he said. \"Sorcery is interference. A sorcerer searches and finds the key joint of anything he wants to affect and then he applies his will to it. A sorcerer doesn't have to see to be a sorcerer, all he has to know is how to use his will.\"\n\nI asked him to explain what he meant by a key joint. He thought for a while and then he said that he knew what my car was.\n\n\"It's obviously a machine,\" I said.\n\n\"I mean your car is the spark plugs. That's its key joint for me. I can apply my will to it and your car won't work.\"\n\nDon Juan got into my car and sat down. He beckoned me to do likewise as he made himself comfortable on the seat.\n\n\"Watch what I do,\" he said. \"I'm a crow, so first I'll make my feathers loose.\"\n\nHe shivered his entire body. His movement reminded me of a sparrow wetting its feathers in a puddle. He lowered his head like a bird dipping its beak into the water.\n\n\"That feels really good,\" he said, and began to laugh.\n\nHis laughter was strange. It had a very peculiar mesmerizing effect on me. I recollected having heard him laugh in that manner many times before. Perhaps the reason I had never become overtly aware of it was that he had never laughed like that long enough in my presence.\n\n\"A crow loosens its neck next,\" he said, and began twisting his neck and rubbing his cheeks on his shoulders.\n\n\"Then he looks at the world with one eye and then with the other.\"\n\nHis head shook as he allegedly shifted his view of the world from one eye to the other. The pitch of his laughter became higher. I had the absurd feeling that he was going to turn into a crow in front of my eyes. I wanted to laugh it off but I was almost paralyzed.

It was as if don Juan was not only doing something to my car but also to me. When he stopped cackling I was convinced the spell was over, and impetuously I turned on the starter again.

People interpret it in a greedy fashion, wishing they had that kind of power so they could show off for their friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda fans always miss the key details of what was really going on in a story from the books, because it spoils their goal of attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m commenting about this, because someone in here switched to their double in a very nearly perfect copy of their real room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve both been trying to &amp;quot;tune in&amp;quot; this reality, with humorous results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with Cholita interfering a bit too to make sure it doesn&amp;#39;t go too well for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;principle&amp;quot; is why Zuleica warned Taisha in her last book that she might suddenly find herself on the other side of the patio, without remembering how she got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the double finally manages to assemble a phantom copy of reality that is 90% the real copy, there&amp;#39;s always some &amp;quot;discrepancies&amp;quot;.  But the key to it all, is that you are perfectly lucid, and it&amp;#39;s clearly not a dream. Yet, something about it is &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, all dreams are not equal. There are out of control sleeping dreams, dreams with a sorcery theme that are still just ordinary, and caused by your obsession with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And waking dreams that are never perfectly real, but still fully visible and real with your eyes open, and completely sober.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are waking dreams across portals, where you left your darkroom rightt through a solid wall, and find yourself in a perfectly real world, absolutely lucid and rational. For hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are NOT the same things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re various levels of using the double, merged with your tonal awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;ve done these a few times, you learn to detect when it&amp;#39;s really your double coming out into the real world.  And what sorts of side effects that has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot; at some point as it dawns on you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunately a topic you can&amp;#39;t discuss in an open learning environment like this one, because attention seekers can pretend it to get attention. So they feel better about never actually going any real work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when it happens for real, it&amp;#39;s totally amazing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And likely to be very rare, and only experienced by those who put in all the hard work to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only done it less times than I can count on my fingers.  That is, switch to my double, and find my way in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To be a sorcerer is a terrible burden,&amp;quot; don Juan said in a reassuring tone. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve told you that it is much better to learn to see. A man who sees is everything; in comparison, the sorcerer is a sad fellow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is sorcery, don Juan?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked at me for a long time as he shook his head almost imperceptibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorcery is to apply one&amp;#39;s will to a key joint,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Sorcery is interference. A sorcerer searches and finds the key joint of anything he wants to affect and then he applies his will to it. A sorcerer doesn&amp;#39;t have to see to be a sorcerer, all he has to know is how to use his will.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him to explain what he meant by a key joint. He thought for a while and then he said that he knew what my car was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s obviously a machine,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I mean your car is the spark plugs. That&amp;#39;s its key joint for me. I can apply my will to it and your car won&amp;#39;t work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan got into my car and sat down. He beckoned me to do likewise as he made himself comfortable on the seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Watch what I do,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a crow, so first I&amp;#39;ll make my feathers loose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shivered his entire body. His movement reminded me of a sparrow wetting its feathers in a puddle. He lowered his head like a bird dipping its beak into the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That feels really good,&amp;quot; he said, and began to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His laughter was strange. It had a very peculiar mesmerizing effect on me. I recollected having heard him laugh in that manner many times before. Perhaps the reason I had never become overtly aware of it was that he had never laughed like that long enough in my presence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A crow loosens its neck next,&amp;quot; he said, and began twisting his neck and rubbing his cheeks on his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then he looks at the world with one eye and then with the other.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His head shook as he allegedly shifted his view of the world from one eye to the other. The pitch of his laughter became higher. I had the absurd feeling that he was going to turn into a crow in front of my eyes. I wanted to laugh it off but I was almost paralyzed. I actually felt some kind of enveloping force around me. I was not afraid nor was I dizzy or sleepy.

is still relevant for women.\n\nWithout removal of the internal dialogue, which is all about the blue line on the J curve, the assemblage point can't move far enough to make a big difference.\n\nYou may have trapped your attention using a dance, but if you are still thinking about the \"Fiesta Pack\" at Del Taco, or whether your job is in jeopardy at work, you have more attention focused on the ordinary level of reality.\n\nSo you could be simply sliding horizontally up at the blue line on the J curve, something we don't know much about. \n\nOr maybe going down a bit into the green, which meditation techniques and Sufi dancing can cause.\n\nOr Hari Krishna chanting and dancing.  That will move you down to the green too.   Far enough to feel \"high\". But no further.\n\nMake sure you move in **depth** as far and often as possible.\n\nAnd the best measure of that is to visibly see pieces of your energy body, then learn to scoop them into your hand, then learn to form them into objects (or energy body shapes like the tensegrity does).\n\nStill, it wouldn't be surprising at all for an Ally to teach by that method you encountered.\n\nJust keep in mind, we're trying to follow the path of the old seers because in the end there's no fixed reality. \n\nOnly what someone did before, being easier to perceive than the chaos of unknown realities in the emanations.  \n\nSo if you go off on something different you aren't  following the path of the old seers. And their path is THOUSANDS of years long.  By tens of thousands of old seers.\n\nIt's a nice, clear foot path in the mountains which goes very far.  A path to the top of the summit. Going around many twists and hazards that would prevent getting there.\n\nAnything one person can manage to accomplish, even in an entire life, is more like a barely perceptible rabbit trail that leads just to the huge granite boulders nearby, and no further.\n\nI used to roam the mountains near my home as a child. \n\nThat's one obvious flaw in Asian magical system.

That will move you down to the green too.   Far enough to feel &amp;quot;high&amp;quot;. But no further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure you move in &lt;strong&gt;depth&lt;/strong&gt; as far and often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the best measure of that is to visibly see pieces of your energy body, then learn to scoop them into your hand, then learn to form them into objects (or energy body shapes like the tensegrity does).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprising at all for an Ally to teach by that method you encountered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind, we&amp;#39;re trying to follow the path of the old seers because in the end there&amp;#39;s no fixed reality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only what someone did before, being easier to perceive than the chaos of unknown realities in the emanations.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you go off on something different you aren&amp;#39;t  following the path of the old seers. And their path is THOUSANDS of years long.  By tens of thousands of old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a nice, clear foot path in the mountains which goes very far.  A path to the top of the summit. Going around many twists and hazards that would prevent getting there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything one person can manage to accomplish, even in an entire life, is more like a barely perceptible rabbit trail that leads just to the huge granite boulders nearby, and no further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to roam the mountains near my home as a child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s one obvious flaw in Asian magical system.

don\u2019t mean to be rude or invasive it\u2019s just that my web is cast out wide in trying to make sense of my experiences and observations that I\u2019ve been trying to do my best to explore and especially define just enough to go further with research of the experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The few things I wanted to hopefully get  knowledge as well as your experiences on are something/s I\u2019ve perceived with many of my senses as what at first when what seemed like an awakening and my third eye going wide open was something like the air was holographic? \nI don\u2019t know how else to describe it and that is lacking in the least.\nLater I found that after in desperation to better ways to protect myself , others , my environment etc from all sorts of things that doorways etc that have some type of frame work would have the same energy , substance ,as what I\u2019d experienced as if it was air in a way.\nI discovered just like the energy webbing between my fingers that I can grab that and stretch it out as well as the framed in substance.\nI can usually shake of the attachment to the substance from my hand but the last time it became stuck to my fingers and the attachment remained all the way upstairs to my bedroom.\nI noticed that not only was it stuck but was also drawing something from my finger tips in a continuous stream /pull.\nTo be honest I\u2019m usually very rational and calm in any situation but I felt panic.\nI tried various things from objects to sound etc with magick intention. , science .. anything.\nSome how I finally got free of it I feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then days later a new happened.\nWhile I was out in front of the house playing with energy and the brass curtain rod I\u2019d found the power I the house as well as the neighborhood went out?\nCoincidence I\u2019m sure but What happened next was I saw/ perceived the flat type energy shield , field , substance not needing to be framed in but going up like flat shields, .. off of the top edges of houses and similar things.\nTo be honest this caused me to start having a panic attack because I\u2019ve perceived things Being able to come and go thru the framed in substance at will.\nSeeing a new skies the limit version was scary because skies the limit means bigger possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning there were way more astral spider webs to the point that I noticed them in and all over the kitchen for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days after this I got my biosonic tuning forks of various frequencies.\nI\u2019ve been experimenting with them when creative intuition is there and I experimented with a nice piece of what I\u2019m guessing is walnut the size of a larger kitchen cutting board.\nI was in the living room experimenting with the wood on my lap.\nAlso my 1oz silver coin, a disk shape of black Tourmaline about the same size and my new weighted biosonics om fork. 136 \nWith a clear quarts crystal gem foot on it.\nI was trying / creating energy lines and patterns in the wood for a bit when I looked up and noticed that emanating (  maybe wrong word!?)from the wood slab was a flat energy type shield , field filling up all the down stairs I could see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surprised and tapped into that good ol intuition and struck the om fork while using my hand balled up into a fist.\nImagening a connection to my fist I lessens my grasps intensity and with it the energy shield disappeared eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I had an intuition to test different forms out on the energy shield in my bedroom door frame.\nWhen I used my bio sonic Otto C 32 I used the mind , hand technique a clear door shaped opening happened in the shield momentarily.\nIt happens a few times on a row.\nBut I noticed the perceived strength of this shield weakened allot and I got nervous and I couldn\u2019t strengthen it with a tuning fork so I just used the mind fist and it worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today\u2019s experience was that right when it was getting dark out the ( air seemed like that substance and I sat and just perceived what ever I was able and I noticed breathing was t easy even tho o was calm and fine other wise?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always I\u2019m just trying to get insight from the great minds of others  In magick, science and all else.\nThanks for your time !!\nTruly your fellow seeker-T&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived":

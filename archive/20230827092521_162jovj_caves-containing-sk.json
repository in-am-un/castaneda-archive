There are many stories that I heard but I will only comment on those that you can verify for yourselves as a trace of true history and of a humanity that lived within silent knowledge.\n\nThe first is the **case of the Caves**, Spain is surrounded by caves, the most characteristic are Malaga and Cantabria (Altamira has a journalist who went inside and without realizing it, he himself recounts the experience of witchcraft, internal silence and the power of those caves)\n\nAll these caves have the same elements in common, it represents the bull, but they also have a room further inside this same cave, the door to this room is in **the shape of the female reproductive system**, the researchers say that this room was that of the shaman, and within that room, a large drawing of a **man with the head of a bull**\n\nI will leave the interview of a Spanish journalist who investigates paranormal stories, when they leave him inside those caves alone, and he obtains internal silence without realizing it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FwK0S\\_6LDc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FwK0S_6LDc) (subtitles can be activated, i**n case you don't understand it, just let me know and I will

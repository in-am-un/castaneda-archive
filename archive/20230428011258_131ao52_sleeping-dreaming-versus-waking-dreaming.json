A composite of an animation, and a still picture.\n\nHere's what Jadey posted in chat:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was going to post this exact quote when somebody asked about what a person in the blue line would see when a sorcerer is in heightened awareness, and today somebody at the cleargreen forum posted it:\n\n\"Don Juan had said that technically, as soon as the assemblage point shifts, we are asleep. I wondered, for instance, if I was sound asleep from the stand of an onlooker, just as Genaro had been asleep to me.  I asked don Juan about it as soon as he returned.  \"You are absolutely asleep without having to be stretched out,\" he replied.\n\n\"If people in a normal state of awareness saw you now, you would appear to them to be a bit dizzy, even drunk.\"\n\nHe explained that during normal sleep, the shift of the assemblage point runs along either edge of man's band. Such shifts are always coupled with slumber.\n\nShifts that are induced by practice occur along the midsection of man's band and are not coupled with slumber, yet a dreamer is asleep.\"\n\n\\- Fire from Within\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo in practice, you get to the deep red zone and realize you can do astonishing magic there.\n\nBut not in the middle of man's band.\n\nAs Juann suggested, this is the area of least resistance for moving along the J curve.\n\nPower plants push you FAR to the right, and thus you get the bizarre visions which are completely out of control.\n\nEven if you think you can alter them, that's not control.\n\nAnd down there in \"the shift below\" you can scoop up a puff, and it's brilliant.\n\nYou can stuff it on a pouch, and see it remain there just as Carlos described.\n\nBut it fades fairly fast.  Maybe 30 seconds?\n\nCarlos can be quoted from somewhere as saying it falls down to the floor.\n\nI never noticed that.  I'll have to look more carefully.\n\nSo you move down the J curve to the red zone, scoop up a puff, and you're still in the middle of man's band.\n\nWide awake!\n\nRemember, that's still NOT heightened awareness.  It's a long ways from that.\n\nBut you can play with that puff, as if it were \"real\".\n\nAnd that will cause your assemblage point to shift horizontally.\n\nAs this description from the books mentions.\n\nThe trick here is to shift far enough to the side that you simulate sleeping dreaming, where everything is perfectly real and vivid.\n\nBut without losing consciousness.\n\nIt's a tricky maneuver!\n\nBottom line: Just play with a puff as if it were real, and see if an \"idea\" comes to you on what you might do with it.\n\nYou can do ANYTHING with it.\n\nBut the idea has to come naturally.  You can't stand there and plan it, at our level.\n\nOnce you \"know\" you could do something with it, just proceed to use it for that purpose.\n\nAnd your assemblage point will shift horizontally.\n\nIt'll become very real, and you'll shapeshift.\n\nBut you'll be risking blanking out, and not knowing how it all ended.\n\nStrange anomalies happen when you shapeshift.\n\nBetter to keep going, if you've already seen the intense magic of the red zone.\n\nOut in the purple zone, you can do the same.\n\nBut you don't have to touch anything.\n\nYou just find some \"sparkle\" or a disturbance in the emanations, which become easily visible out there, and you \"expect\" that it can be revealed.\n\nIt's the \"expecting\" that \"treats it as real\".\n\nNow you have a problem.\n\nIf you haven't saved your energy, it won't get \"real enough\" to be convincing.\n\nSo you have 2 choices.\n\nWork harder to save energy, and stop indulging in whatever you indulge in.\n\nYou know what I mean!  Don't play dumb.\n\nAnd for the 16 year olds, no I'm not talking about masturbating...\n\nMan.\n\nWhy does that have to come up?\n\nCholita ought to handle those conversations.\n\nBut unfortunately, to stop indulging in stuff that only becomes significant in Silent Knowledge, is a very tall order.\n\nThat's when you see sorcerers with very odd behavior, who seem to be really picky about stuff going on around them.\n\nSuch as \"sugar eaters are evil\", or \"I don't drink coffee\".\n\nMan, what a sad life.  No treats, no coffee.\n\nIf I get that bad, I'll just tell my allies to take me right now.\n\nFortunately, there's an alternative to being so fussy about your actions.\n\nOr maybe greedy about them is closer to the truth.\n\nYou can cheat.\n\nFall asleep, in SK but without having to lay down.\n\nYour head might lean over a bit as if you were drunk, but you won't blank out over there.\n\nIt's almost as if in Silent Knowledge, you have to make the choice to stop practicing.\n\nAnd so you can go right to the edge of falling asleep, and that serves to deepen your silence until it's nearly perfect, while shifting the assemblage point horizontally.\n\nBut won't make you \"blank out\" and miss the ending of it all.\n\nIt's quite simply stunning to see that.\n\nYou realize you only need to learn to \"cross the edge\" out there in SK, and you can manifest anything or travel anywhere.\n\nI was all excited about it last night when a voice said, \"Big deal. Women do that all the time.\"\n\nBut then you try to think of how to explain it, perhaps so you can see if it's actually true that women can all do that, and you realize that explaining it can't be done.\n\nIt's like some SCI-FI I was watching last night.\n\nI don't remember how, but a male star got shot with some energy ray gun, and was complaining he couldn't find his nose.\n\nHe knew exactly where it was.\n\nBut his sense of feeling could not \"find it\".\n\nWe have no idea how to move any part of our body.\n\nWe just know what to do.  By feeling.\n\nYou can't make yourself walk by issuing commands to all the muscles needed.\n\nYou just \"feel\" how to walk and your body does it for you.\n\nThat's beginner's level stuff like \"Zen in the Art of Archery\" where \"it shot\".\n\nPure muscle memory, building up subconscious commands until it \"fires\" on its own.\n\nNo different than catching a falling glass before fully realizing it was falling.\n\nBut to do that \"consciously\" is impossible.\n\nAll you can do is \"want\" to do it, for a sustained period, and then your muscle memory does.\n\nIt's how the \"Siddhi power\" of levitation works.\n\nThe body leaps from a cross legged position, because muscle memory fires off.\n\nYou aren't going to levitate for real that way!\n\nBut it can lead to your double coming out at the same time, so that your double can fly.\n\nProbably why Milarepa is portrayed as flying around.\n\nIn his double...\n\nBut they neglect that little nasty detail.\n\nSo you can get cool things to happen with muscle memory, by loading up the intent of it. But doing nothing about it.\n\nAnd you can't tell someone how to do that.  They won't be able to \"find\" what makes it happen.\n\nEven though, people who practice the flying siddhi quickly learn that their body recognizes \"permission\" to jump on its own.\n\nSame as Zen archery.  Likely \"it shot\" is impossible at first, then later easy.\n\nBecause you \"found it\" in part.\n\nThat's what happens out in the deep purple, in silent knowledge.\n\nYou have to \"find\" that edge.\n\nBetween sleeping and being awake, but in silent knowledge where you don't blank out (for long).\n\nYou gaze at something and find yourself dozing off a very tiny instant, and the thing becomes super real and vivid.\n\nWhen you can find \"the edge\" of that, you can summon or materialize anything, or travel anywhere.\n\nI'll see if I can animate it with stills, and put the result here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sleeping Dreaming Versus Waking Dreaming", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"v8bynw6hxnxa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/131ao52/asset/v8bynw6hxnxa1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718049790%2CYjc5NzE1YzFlN2U5YmUyMjc5MDA2OGIzYTg3ZWIzOWExOTJjZTRiOGRmNTQ2YmUyYWYzNjY4OTFjOTRmOWYwNg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1080, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/131ao52/asset/v8bynw6hxnxa1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718049790%2COWVlYjI3ZWMzMTU4MzBkZTcxNjJlNmQwYjNlZjNiNDZhOGViNjdiMmVlZWQwY2RmZjU0YmQ4MDAwNzlkNjcxNQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "v8bynw6hxnxa1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_131ao52", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/20hnJooWfItnw0e-0ohRnGQRfc5hldqc5N1oXaqRRlo.jpg", "edited": 1683139898.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1682637178.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/131ao52/video/v8bynw6hxnxa1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/131ao52/video/v8bynw6hxnxa1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This won&amp;#39;t be surprising to someone who can make it to the deep red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to see Jadey post it in chat however, because I was experimenting with this very topic last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on an &amp;quot;animated still&amp;quot; to show it.

When don Juan did it for Carlos, there was a big fuss while he shifted into the second attention, at which point he could perceive what was there.\n\nAny kind of puzzlement in the mind causes it to go to work to understand and \u201csolve\u201d the problem being presented to it. If this weren\u2019t so, we\u2019d just lay around like blobs, not understanding or being able to utilize anything.

It\u2019s the final \u201cicing on the top\u201d, but not the actual cake.\n\nPuzzlement is the key to manifesting objects, using the same technique Carlos demonstrated for us.  Our brain is continuously trying to understand things.  Just below the internal dialogue, the results of that attempt to understand gather.  They sit in some form of buffer, so that our internal dialogue can examine them to see if the problem has been solved.\n\nThere are a lot more ideas floating around there, than ever see the light of day.  Every question or idea you have, and everything you see, hear or feel, goes into the mix. The mind comes up with potential answers and understandings for every single aspect.\n\nIf you wonder what to have for dinner, but then immediately go back to a more complex problem you were working on, that wonderment isn\u2019t lost.  The brain goes right to work, sorting lists of possible food substances, locations that are convenient, the atmosphere at those places, and the company we\u2019d encounter there.  All this takes place outside our normal awareness.\n\nIt has to.  There\u2019s just too much going on.  Eventually, a summarized result is created, and made available to the conscious mind.\n\nThe second attention is a place in the mind which has a better view of those results.  We\u2019ve blocked it out for the most part, because it\u2019s easier to deal with the world at a snail\u2019s pace.   We only take it a little at a time.\n\nBut in heightened awareness, that barrier is greatly reduced.\n\nWhen you stare at colors in the darkness you allow the second attention to come out.  You slowly lower the barrier, based on being silent and trying to understand something that makes no sense.\n\nThere can\u2019t be bright colors in the darkness. We all know that. But there they are.\n\nAnd as you focus your attention on them, no matter how vague, the brain tries to solve that new problem.  It processes and reprocesses the vague colors, compares them to past events, tries to find a reasonable match, but doesn\u2019t get a good hit. Even so, it presents the possible results and they become available to your conscious mind.\n\nNormally the conscious mind tosses out bad results.  Most of the time we aren\u2019t even aware of them, because they have no acceptable context.  But with the internal dialogue silenced, the normal context is less oppressive.

It\u2019ll get stuck for real eventually.  Carlos was plagued by a blue dot showing up on his toe. I\u2019ve seen those also, as have others who write to me. Yogananda's churches sometimes put that blue dot over their entry way.\n\nBut it\u2019s not important whether the colors are directional or whether they follow your head  movement as you stare straight ahead with your eyes. What\u2019s important is to puzzle the mind, in order to see what answer it comes up with.\n\nOnce you can \u201cscoop\u201d the colors, try to compress them with your palms.  Pretend like you have some of that green slime for children, except that it\u2019s weightless and has the color you found in the air.  Keep cupping your hands and massaging it or compressing it until it\u2019s very bright.  It should be shockingly bright, not imaginary bright.  And it will be, but you need silence for that.\n\nAt this point it\u2019s kind of pleasant to smear it on your leg.  I think you\u2019ll be very surprised what happens.\n\nBut that\u2019s not puzzlement, that\u2019s interaction.    To manifest an object we need some puzzlement.  Carlos occasionally called it, \"Cognitive Dissonance\".  He once told a joke about a duck in a bar. The punchline didn't live up to the buildup, thus the cognitive dissonance.  The Zen people like to use \"koans\" to create the puzzlement.\n\nWhen the colors are very bright and you are clearly holding them in your hands,  turn you hands so that you are doing what Carlos did in class.  It was as if he were holding an Easter egg in his hands, when he lifted the left one to show what was on his right palm.\n\nI did that 2 nights ago and the following occurred.  I had a purple blob in my hand that was so real, I could smear it on my leg, and scrape it back off.   After scraping it I cupped it again in both hands,  and lifted the mass up to eye level and slightly to my right. I wanted to  make sure my own body wasn\u2019t in the way.  I intended to manifest a real object, so it needed space to materialize.\n\nI lifted my right hand to reveal what was sitting on my left hand.  I did that with a little bit of a grandiose feeling, sort of like, \u201cTaDa!\u201d.  Don Juan did the same thing for Carlos by twisting his palm up in the air, like he was grabbing something from infinity.  He made the thing real for Carlos, then let his mind fill in the rest.\n\nYou do the same.  The first few times, I suggest it will likely just expand a little. I saw it expand into a cloud about 2 feet wide, and when I looked into the cloud, my mind filled in the details.  There were lines, structures, maybe even distant buildings or people.  I couldn't make it out well,  so I recompressed the blob, and tried it again.\n\nThe second time the cloud grew in size, then light rained down from it, going all the way to the floor.  It \"dripped\" down on all sides. The light now had mass and weight, as if were real.\n\nI rubbed my hands together, to make them warm, compressed more purple light, and tried it one final time.\n\nThe light expanded, details began to form, I saw a humanoid shape, and the light melted down to the floor, creating the shape of a ghost or spirit of some kind. It was standing right next to me.\n\nI wasn't surprised. I'd had the \"Witch of Endor\" in mind just before that.  She manifested a spirit for Saul.\n\nI was actually able to turn and face the \"spirit\".  I looked into it to see what kind of person it was, how it was dressed,  and whether I recognized it.\n\nThat was a mistake. I was doubting the solution my mind had given me, for what happens when the blob of light expands and is set free.\n\nAs I tried to look closer at the spirit, it melted and turned into a stool. Or maybe it was a chair.  But it was clearly something to sit on.  It was made out of fibers and lines of blue and white light, but the details were very clear and real looking.\n\nI had other things to do, and went to do them, but every time I looked back to that part of the room, the \u201cthing to sit on\u201d was still there.\n\nEdited: four times", "edited": 1559587731.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_epwpf2v", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find some colors in the darkness.

It was as if he were holding an Easter egg in his hands, when he lifted the left one to show what was on his right palm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did that 2 nights ago and the following occurred.  I had a purple blob in my hand that was so real, I could smear it on my leg, and scrape it back off.   After scraping it I cupped it again in both hands,  and lifted the mass up to eye level and slightly to my right. I wanted to  make sure my own body wasn\u2019t in the way.  I intended to manifest a real object, so it needed space to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lifted my right hand to reveal what was sitting on my left hand.  I did that with a little bit of a grandiose feeling, sort of like, \u201cTaDa!\u201d.  Don Juan did the same thing for Carlos by twisting his palm up in the air, like he was grabbing something from infinity.  He made the thing real for Carlos, then let his mind fill in the rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do the same.  The first few times, I suggest it will likely just expand a little. I saw it expand into a cloud about 2 feet wide, and when I looked into the cloud, my mind filled in the details.  There were lines, structures, maybe even distant buildings or people.  I couldn&amp;#39;t make it out well,  so I recompressed the blob, and tried it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second time the cloud grew in size, then light rained down from it, going all the way to the floor.  It &amp;quot;dripped&amp;quot; down on all sides. The light now had mass and weight, as if were real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rubbed my hands together, to make them warm, compressed more purple light, and tried it one final time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The light expanded, details began to form, I saw a humanoid shape, and the light melted down to the floor, creating the shape of a ghost or spirit of some kind. It was standing right next to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t surprised. I&amp;#39;d had the &amp;quot;Witch of Endor&amp;quot; in mind just before that.  She manifested a spirit for Saul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was actually able to turn and face the &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot;.  I looked into it to see what kind of person it was, how it was dressed,  and whether I recognized it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was a mistake. I was doubting the solution my mind had given me, for what happens when the blob of light expands and is set free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I tried to look closer at the spirit, it melted and turned into a stool. Or maybe it was a chair.  But it was clearly something to sit on.  It was made out of fibers and lines of blue and white light, but the details were very clear and real looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had other things to do, and went to do them, but every time I looked back to that part of the room, the \u201cthing to sit on\u201d was still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: four times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bwd26b/how_to_manifest_objects/epwpf2v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1559581521.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_bwd26b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "epxm7mk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1559604595.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_epxiz7g", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The one of seeing energy as it flows in the universe is darned accurate. \n\nA few others are likely.

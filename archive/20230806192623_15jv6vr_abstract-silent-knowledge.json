It's just knowledge about \"what is\", from the interplay of emanations in Man's Band of Awareness.\n\nIt gives access to anything any human has ever seen or known. Past, present, and even the future.\n\nExcept, according to Yoda, our patron saint of movies, \"always in flux, the future is\".\n\nIf you want to understand why silent knowledge doesn't mean silent \"truth\", read this account of the first time Carlos deliberately tried to \"see\" for don Juan. Here it is from the books. Just look for \"poodle\" to find it quickly.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\"Don't be bashful,\" he said. \"Tell me exactly what you see.\"\n\nI had a sudden and strange thought very similar to thoughts that usually come to my mind just before falling asleep. It was more than a thought. 'A complete image' would be a better description of it. I saw a tableau containing various personages.\n\nThe one which was directly in front of me was a man sitting behind a window frame. The area beyond the frame was diffuse, but the frame and the man were crystal clear. He was looking at me. Hs head was turned slightly to his left so he was actually looking askance at me. I could see his eyes moving to keep me within focus. He was leaning on the windowsill with his right elbow. His hand was clenched into a fist and his muscles were contracted.\n\nTo the left of the man there was another image in the tableau. It was a flying lion. That is, the head and the mane were those of a lion, but the lower part of its body belonged to a curly white French poodle.\n\nI was about to focus my attention on it, when the man made a smacking sound with his lips and stuck his head and trunk out of the window. His whole body emerged as if something were pushing him. He hung for a moment, grabbing the windowsill with the tips of his fingers as he swung like a pendulum. Then he let go.\n\nI experienced in my own body the sensation of falling. It was not a plummeting down, but a soft descent, and then a cushioned floating. The man was weightless. He remained stationary for a moment and then he went out of sight as if an uncontrollable force had sipped him away through a crack in the tableau. An instant later he was back at the window looking askance at me. His right forearm was resting on the windowsill, only this time his hand was waving good-by to me.\n\nDon Juan's comment was that my 'seeing' was too elaborate.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd if you've been keeping up, don Juan suggested to Carlos that we ought to avoid that kind of seeing, where it's too elaborate and we have to interpret it when it's done. And instead learn to read text. Text from infinity. As Carlos often did in private classes, when he didn't want to have to think of what to tell us next.\n\nThus Carlos made the \"Readers of Infinity\" publication to advise us on this, our ideal goal.\n\nNever forget this.\n\nANYTHING in the books, you WILL DO some day. Yourself.\n\nIf you will only follow the instructions Carlos left us. Give up the pretending, and work hard.\n\nNow myself, I've tried the \"Readers of Infinity\" thing over and over, and once in a while it works.\n\nBut it's SO MUCH MORE FUN to travel in time.\n\nSo I'll keep following orders, since Carlos was so serious about his last minute instructions. He even said that his companions (Taisha and Florinda) were in full agreement with him on this. That we need to learn to reach silent knowledge, and become readers of infinity. There, we'll find new guidance.\n\nBut in the meantime a little time travel can't hurt anyone, right???\n\nExcept last night, while trying to figure out why it took 20 minutes to get \"time travel offers\" even when I had already reached silent knowledge, I noticed there are \"rips\" in space.\n\nAnd deduced, that's \"Abstract Silent Knowledge\".\n\nSo here it is. If you find some, see what you think about it.\n\nOr, can't think. \"The Abstract\" is beyond language and thought.\n\nIt can only be lived.\n\nBut my Ally \"Fancy\" once said something equivalent to this:  \"Don't be an idiot about it. Of course you can describe it!  Just start with one tiny thing, and the rest will materialize around it.\"\n\nEven the word, \"flat\", or \"dark\" is enough for a start.  Or \"stationary\" and \"moving\".\n\nShe was right of course.  If you can describe the first piece, the rest becomes easier.\n\nBut I'm not sure you're supposed to be describing, the \"indescribable\"!\n\nThat puts limits on it and it's no longer the abstract. \n\nYou \"flattened it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Abstract Silent Knowledge", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"v8esyw7fyigb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98a08a91cd517a89e8c735c6f5eb5771efbd7eae"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14ecf10d25f9f34b713880d6b73f42f16b96b8dd"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86409bdc599f9ecf534a3eacd4694bee08ff593a"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c3c8297aacb52a7c7548e34d86902c36b220b3a"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d364a768469754d0d7627dee18f7dd6a0ae41a00"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7de0d9a0ae61eea1768d1e1245f3adea9ec826db"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f67440b97d82f49cf7e89ce795bad16007be9f58"}, "id": "v8esyw7fyigb1"}}, "name": "t3_15jv6vr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bFEUhHeM8RoWFMGogeGG9IjUKvlpahjidbLfcng3pgk.jpg", "edited": 1691343486.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1691342783.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f67440b97d82f49cf7e89ce795bad16007be9f58\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/v8esyw7fyigb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f67440b97d82f49cf7e89ce795bad16007be9f58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** from facebook ***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not quite sure why this wasn&amp;#39;t obvious to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge doesn&amp;#39;t mean &amp;quot;Silent Truth&amp;quot;.

each time you dream, if you have enough rationality left to examine it.\n\nSo I once dreamed I was a farmer bringing my prize cow to market.\n\nExcept, I was married to the cow.\n\nAnd I began to realize perhaps it was just a dream, having planned to look at my hands and take it over so I could find scouts.\n\nBut that initial \"urge\" to interrupt the dream, is the hard part for beginners.\n\nSo I stopped walking for an instant.\n\nIn the lucid dreaming subreddit, they have all sorts of \"tests\" you can do to see if it's a dream.\n\nBut you still have to have enough rationality to even remember those, so they aren't very helpful.\n\nIn my case I stopped walking, looked at my cow, and \"knew\" her name was \"Mirabel\".\n\nMy wife.\n\nI \"knew\" it!\n\nYou're kind of asking if that's silent knowledge, but it's more like \"close\",  but only because the principles of sorcery hold for everything you perceive.\n\nIt all works by the same process, so \"close\" isn't really the same.\n\nI got a weird idea looking at Mirabel, my cow wife.\n\nHow exactly did we have sex???\n\nBut I ruled that out since the details of sex are always ugly anyway.\n\nAnd gazed in the direction we came from.\n\nThere's my farm!\n\nI could see it.\n\nI even remembered when we decide to paint it, a few years back.\n\nSo I kept trying to figure out how this could possibly be a dream, when I got a new idea.\n\nFarming isn't all that profitable.\n\nHow did I make ends meet?\n\nAnd again, I \"remembered\" that I drive an ice-cream truck on the side.\n\nMaybe using home made

That's only at the blue line on the J curve, and at the green line, and the red line, and so on.\n\nEach has its own 20,000 copies.\n\nIf you learn to switch between them for real, daily for months so that you get over the \"Oh my God!!! I'll be so famous as a magic man\" part, you start to wonder how it's all possible.\n\nThat's when you discover what it means to see things more directly.\n\nWhen you start to notice what's behind all this.\n\nEnergy.  But also, phantoms and phantom locations.\n\nAmidst our \"reality\" is something actually real, but not the whole thing.\n\n99% is phantom.\n\nAnd like that movie \"Inception\", if you stay in one of the dream worlds for an entire lifetime, it's no longer phantom to you.\n\nThe \"without interpretation\" part only comes when you view the \"energy\" behind what you see.\n\nThe world becomes empty space with zillions of fibers of light going every possible direction, for an infinite distance.\n\nAnd to \"see without interpretation\", you have to isolate just ONE of those strands.\n\nThose are reality.\n\nAnd when you isolate just one and observe it, you'll find it gives off a very specific \"feeling\". And every other \"emanation\" likewise gives off it's own unique \"feeling\".\n\nThe feeling is far too tiny to even describe.\n\nNot even enough to form the head of a pin.  It would take millions of those feelings, to create the illusion of the head of a pin.\n\nThat's seeing the world without interpretation.\n\nSeeing that it's just made from those emanations.\n\nThey interact with each other as you observe them, giving the impression of a \"reality\".

That&amp;#39;s only at the blue line on the J curve, and at the green line, and the red line, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each has its own 20,000 copies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn to switch between them for real, daily for months so that you get over the &amp;quot;Oh my God!!! I&amp;#39;ll be so famous as a magic man&amp;quot; part, you start to wonder how it&amp;#39;s all possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when you discover what it means to see things more directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you start to notice what&amp;#39;s behind all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Energy.

And every other &amp;quot;emanation&amp;quot; likewise gives off it&amp;#39;s own unique &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The feeling is far too tiny to even describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not even enough to form the head of a pin.  It would take millions of those feelings, to create the illusion of the head of a pin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s seeing the world without interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing that it&amp;#39;s just made from those emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They interact with each other as you observe them, giving the impression of a &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot;.

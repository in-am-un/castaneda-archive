It's all in here.\n\nCarlos didn't exactly \"use\" the bible. He had some problem with Ellis, and a few other \"budding Catholics\".\n\nCarlos was also a \"reformed\" catholic, and it still loomed over him as you can read in the books.\n\nI suspect some of the anti-inorganic being sentiment in here is a hangover from being a Christian.\n\nCarlos used to make fun of the concept of \"heaven\", imitating someone walking around in Togo for eternity, with a phony smile on their face.  He pointed out, you have to take tiny steps in heaven.  \n\nHe would say, \"Nothing ever changes there,  forever?  What would I do there?  That's a dead world!\"\n\nHowever, I've seen heaven 4 times and it was nothing like that.  One time I even met someone there, whom I'd never seen before, and then ran into them at a line in a store the next day.\n\nMy attitude about things is, \"it's all good.\"  Demons, religion, Sees candy.  Reni is afraid of sugar, because Carlos used it as a corrective measure with the Chacmools. He was tricky that way. \n\nFor example, to make sure he could get access to the bathroom, with 3 \"Chacmools\" all wanting to use it the same time, he  convinced Kylie water was dangerous to her.  They had to sit on the toilet and sponge bath themselves.  \n\nThe sunday class women even got excited about the idea, and there were rumors some wormlike beings could crawl up your\u2026\n\nWell\u2026\n\nCholita talks like that too.  But darned if I ever get to watch!\n\nBottom line: don't indulge in denying yourself things.  It\u2019s a placebo.  Like believing Carlos is waiting to guide us into the big dome after death.\n\nEspecially don\u2019t work up phony anger or indignation when your sorcery inventory items don\u2019t align to reality.  You only do that to show how virtuous you are and get attention for your \u201cself\u201d.\n\nWhen studying a religion, BELIEVE it.  Otherwise there\u2019s no way to know what they\u2019re doing to themselves.\n\nIn fact, just now while practicing Zuleica's daytime gazing I noticed a very long fence in the path I was walking looked surprisingly like the road to hell Cholita brought me to. As I glanced along it, in near perfect silence, I saw a  being running along behind it.\n\nI got to thinking, I haven't visited hell enough yet.  The Hindus love to do that, and then make themselves a tasty book deal (See Muktananda as I recall).\n\nSo Carlos spoke about the bible, mostly because it was a barrier to getting his students to actually get some work done.\n\nHe brought Ellis up to the front of the class next to him, and started to joke with her about the book, \u201cSex Lives of the Popes\u201d. Apparently there are infant corpses in the catacombs. And nuns were up for grabs.\n\nHe put Ellis up to writing a book to expose the Jews as converted white Europeans, and not natural Jewish descendants.\n\nIt probably wasn\u2019t true, but Carlos and Ellis chuckled about it.\n\nIn fact, the majority of Caucasians are descendant from Iberian Jews, one way or the other.  They were forced to convert to Christianity at the point of a sword.\n\nOne of my little nieces is a direct Iberian Jew descendant. And she's as white as they come. White, but \"woke\".\n\nThe Iberian Jews were sorcerers who had big ships!  What could be cooler?  Likely they visited the sorcerers on our continents, at least a few times.\n\nFor a week or two, Carlos kept giving lectures about \u201cBishops\u201d.  I suppose Ellis, or someone else, pointed out some Bishop had said something or other, and he wanted to battle that back down.\n\nSame as I do in here, when someone says something potentially harmful to others.  As much as I don\u2019t like it, I have to go fight to correct that information.\n\nCarlos did the same.\n\nIn his ongoing rant against the church, he finally told us, looking right into my eyes, \u201cReally study the bible!  Really!!!\u201d\n\nSomewhere before that he\u2019d been pointing out what nonsense it was, if you read it honestly.\n\nSo I did.  \n\nCarlos had taught us from the beginning, that we needed to \u201cJump\u201d.\n\nJumping meant, you got off your lazy self-pity butt, and took him up on something.\n\nHe\u2019d give out assignments that had to be done that day, or it was too late.\n\nBut never could he get anyone to do it. Once he suggested we walk to San Diego, and that it would \u201ctransform\u201d us.\n\nAnd it would have!  I now understand that.  You were beckoning intent, which would then own you a really cool intent gift.  A single intent gift of that nature, is enough to change your mind about the world.\n\nCarlos was setting us up for magic, with that recommendation, as surely as preparing the smoking mixture got Little Smoke to give Carlos some wonderful lessons in the second attention.\n\nAfter he suggested that, and class was just ending, I got out my credit cards to show the women.  The men had already left, mumbling they had something they had to do that evening.\n\nBut a group of 3 hot young women surrounded me, to see if I was going to do it.  Cholita was not among them.\n\n\u201cSure, let\u2019s go!\u201d, I told them.    All the while thinking about hotel arrangements along the way. I\u2019d already been in a hotel or two with some of them.\n\nBut before you get the wrong idea, Carlos made me celibate, and I obeyed.\n\nThe women couldn\u2019t go. They would lose their place to live.  A boyfriend or husband was keeping close tabs, and didn\u2019t like them hanging out with Carlos.\n\nFor good reason.  Carlos separated Felix from his woman. Victoria was it?  Cholita told me more, but I don\u2019t recall. Cholita\u2019s bottom line was, Felix didn\u2019t really mind.  He could get a newer model.  Maybe one with money.\n\nAnd Victoria was a rolling stone looking for a \u201cspiritual man\u201d.  Later she snagged a \"Rinpoche\", and got him dethroned when the woman who was hosting him threw him out on hearing Victoria had had sex with him.\n\nCholita was sleeping in the room next to the Rinpoche.  Cholita is a rolling stone too, but mostly in search of a place to live for free.\n\nBut my memory of names is faulty, so if Victoria doesn't like this, please come tell us what really happened in private classes!  We'd all love it.\n\nI'd like to hear your version of Cleargreen Christmas party gift exchanges!  Cholita's version seems a little tilted in her favor.\n\nBut she tells a fun story about her mini-skirt and fabulous boots, which didn't motivate the men because they weren't \"nearly as randy as I expected that day\".\n\nAnyway, we passed on that \u201cjump\u201d assignment, involving walking all the way to San Diego from LA.  \n\nAnd all of the others he offered us over the years.  \n\nCarlos only got one woman to \u201cjump\u201d, one time.  Otherwise, none I knew of.\n\nBut when it was a long-term assignment, like studying the bible or being celibate, I always obeyed.  That way Carlos sort of \u201cowed me,\u201d meaning, intent owed me.\n\nAs far as projects, I can\u2019t collaborate with anyone. I\u2019m here under rules.  Which is not as mysterious as it sounds. Techno could explain them to you, and he never even heard them. It\u2019s just obvious. I\u2019m trying to restore Carlos\u2019 reputation. \n\nIt's a lot of fu...ing work! \n\nAnd I get beat up daily for my efforts.\n\nI have to hold the hands of sniveling attention seekers who have zero chance of every putting in any work, but insist on hanging around anyway.\n\nI can\u2019t afford anyone to point to something and say, \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s doing it!!!\u201d Not after all this work.\n\nThere has to be no obvious reason for me to be in here other than what it appears to be.\n\nBut anyone can use anything I post, for anything they like. As long as they don\u2019t make it appear I endorsed it, or make any benefit from it.  And please don\u2019t change anything.\n\nThe Jehovah\u2019s witnesses printed up a phony copy of King James, and modified a passage or two, so they could trick people going door to door.\n\nDon\u2019t do that\u2026\n\nIf you have any specific questions about classes or what I know of the inner circle, just ask.\n\nCarlos had some left-over people hanging on.  He was loyal, and always repaid debts.\n\nBut if you are also that type of person, as I am, you know very well. If you are kind to some people, they take advantage. In the end, they force you to be mean to them, so they can pretend to get their feelings hurt and blame you for the separation.\n\nThere was a tired, depressed woman, perhaps in her 50s, long gray hair, living in one of the little apartments surrounding his picnic yard at the back of his compound in LA.\n\nCarlos did some stalking, and I was assigned the task of \u201cwealthy buyer\u201d.  He had Corey as the powerful lawyer, and Felix as the tall handsome house boss.\n\nHe told us to come to his compound at a certain time.\n\nHe showed me the fine wood picnic area in the back, which was expansive, and pointed out the big stone paver or concrete covered area in the middle where they could hold infinity theater, and even pulled out the wooden drawers near the tables to show me they were filled with shiny forks, knives, and spoons. He seemed to insist I lift up one of the forks, and examine it to see if it had any water spots.  He kept looking over my shoulder at one of the apartments, which I believed were all empty.  The entire compound was surrounded by bushes and trees rising up high enough, that it was completely private back there.  Took up maybe the space of 3 lots of normal LA homes of that area.  It was on a corner too, on a street with a suitable name for a sorcerer.\n\nThen he led us over to one of the little apartments (there were perhaps 3-6), and had me shake the hand of the woman living in there. It seemed like we\u2019d gotten her out of bed, in the middle of the day.\n\nI sure hope my memory of that event is wrong.  I believe someone later suggested it was Joanie. But my father also possibly got mixed up with Joanie at one point, so I have too many vague memories connected to her and Morongo and UC System anthropologists in general.\n\nAt any rate, Carlos was dying.  \n\nThe woman had to find another place to live.

He had some problem with Ellis, and a few other &amp;quot;budding Catholics&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was also a &amp;quot;reformed&amp;quot; catholic, and it still loomed over him as you can read in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect some of the anti-inorganic being sentiment in here is a hangover from being a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used to make fun of the concept of &amp;quot;heaven&amp;quot;, imitating someone walking around in Togo for eternity, with a phony smile on their face.  He pointed out, you have to take tiny steps in heaven.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would say, &amp;quot;Nothing ever changes there,  forever?  What would I do there?  That&amp;#39;s a dead world!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;ve seen heaven 4 times and it was nothing like that.  One time I even met someone there, whom I&amp;#39;d never seen before, and then ran into them at a line in a store the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My attitude about things is, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s all good.&amp;quot;  Demons, religion, Sees candy.  Reni is afraid of sugar, because Carlos used it as a corrective measure with the Chacmools. He was tricky that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, to make sure he could get access to the bathroom, with 3 &amp;quot;Chacmools&amp;quot; all wanting to use it the same time, he  convinced Kylie water was dangerous to her.  They had to sit on the toilet and sponge bath themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sunday class women even got excited about the idea, and there were rumors some wormlike beings could crawl up your\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita talks like that too.  But darned if I ever get to watch!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: don&amp;#39;t indulge in denying yourself things.  It\u2019s a placebo.  Like believing Carlos is waiting to guide us into the big dome after death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially don\u2019t work up phony anger or indignation when your sorcery inventory items don\u2019t align to reality.  You only do that to show how virtuous you are and get attention for your \u201cself\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When studying a religion, BELIEVE it.  Otherwise there\u2019s no way to know what they\u2019re doing to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, just now while practicing Zuleica&amp;#39;s daytime gazing I noticed a very long fence in the path I was walking looked surprisingly like the road to hell Cholita brought me to. As I glanced along it, in near perfect silence, I saw a  being running along behind it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking, I haven&amp;#39;t visited hell enough yet.  The Hindus love to do that, and then make themselves a tasty book deal (See Muktananda as I recall).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos spoke about the bible, mostly because it was a barrier to getting his students to actually get some work done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He brought Ellis up to the front of the class next to him, and started to joke with her about the book, \u201cSex Lives of the Popes\u201d. Apparently there are infant corpses in the catacombs. And nuns were up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He put Ellis up to writing a book to expose the Jews as converted white Europeans, and not natural Jewish descendants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It probably wasn\u2019t true, but Carlos and Ellis chuckled about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the majority of Caucasians are descendant from Iberian Jews, one way or the other.  They were forced to convert to Christianity at the point of a sword.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my little nieces is a direct Iberian Jew descendant. And she&amp;#39;s as white as they come. White, but &amp;quot;woke&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Iberian Jews were sorcerers who had big ships!  What could be cooler?  Likely they visited the sorcerers on our continents, at least a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a week or two, Carlos kept giving lectures about \u201cBishops\u201d.  I suppose Ellis, or someone else, pointed out some Bishop had said something or other, and he wanted to battle that back down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as I do in here, when someone says something potentially harmful to others.  As much as I don\u2019t like it, I have to go fight to correct that information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos did the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his ongoing rant against the church, he finally told us, looking right into my eyes, \u201cReally study the bible!  Really!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere before that he\u2019d been pointing out what nonsense it was, if you read it honestly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had taught us from the beginning, that we needed to \u201cJump\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jumping meant, you got off your lazy self-pity butt, and took him up on something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019d give out assignments that had to be done that day, or it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But never could he get anyone to do it. Once he suggested we walk to San Diego, and that it would \u201ctransform\u201d us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it would have!  I now understand that.  You were beckoning intent, which would then own you a really cool intent gift.  A single intent gift of that nature, is enough to change your mind about the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was setting us up for magic, with that recommendation, as surely as preparing the smoking mixture got Little Smoke to give Carlos some wonderful lessons in the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After he suggested that, and class was just ending, I got out my credit cards to show the women.  The men had already left, mumbling they had something they had to do that evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a group of 3 hot young women surrounded me, to see if I was going to do it.  Cholita was not among them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSure, let\u2019s go!\u201d, I told them.    All the while thinking about hotel arrangements along the way. I\u2019d already been in a hotel or two with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before you get the wrong idea, Carlos made me celibate, and I obeyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women couldn\u2019t go. They would lose their place to live.  A boyfriend or husband was keeping close tabs, and didn\u2019t like them hanging out with Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For good reason.  Carlos separated Felix from his woman. Victoria was it?  Cholita told me more, but I don\u2019t recall. Cholita\u2019s bottom line was, Felix didn\u2019t really mind.  He could get a newer model.  Maybe one with money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Victoria was a rolling stone looking for a \u201cspiritual man\u201d.  Later she snagged a &amp;quot;Rinpoche&amp;quot;, and got him dethroned when the woman who was hosting him threw him out on hearing Victoria had had sex with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was sleeping in the room next to the Rinpoche.  Cholita is a rolling stone too, but mostly in search of a place to live for free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my memory of names is faulty, so if Victoria doesn&amp;#39;t like this, please come tell us what really happened in private classes!  We&amp;#39;d all love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to hear your version of Cleargreen Christmas party gift exchanges!  Cholita&amp;#39;s version seems a little tilted in her favor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she tells a fun story about her mini-skirt and fabulous boots, which didn&amp;#39;t motivate the men because they weren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;nearly as randy as I expected that day&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we passed on that \u201cjump\u201d assignment, involving walking all the way to San Diego from LA.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all of the others he offered us over the years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos only got one woman to \u201cjump\u201d, one time.  Otherwise, none I knew of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when it was a long-term assignment, like studying the bible or being celibate, I always obeyed.  That way Carlos sort of \u201cowed me,\u201d meaning, intent owed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as projects, I can\u2019t collaborate with anyone. I\u2019m here under rules.  Which is not as mysterious as it sounds. Techno could explain them to you, and he never even heard them. It\u2019s just obvious. I\u2019m trying to restore Carlos\u2019 reputation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lot of fu...ing work! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I get beat up daily for my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to hold the hands of sniveling attention seekers who have zero chance of every putting in any work, but insist on hanging around anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t afford anyone to point to something and say, \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s doing it!!!\u201d Not after all this work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There has to be no obvious reason for me to be in here other than what it appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But anyone can use anything I post, for anything they like. As long as they don\u2019t make it appear I endorsed it, or make any benefit from it.  And please don\u2019t change anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jehovah\u2019s witnesses printed up a phony copy of King James, and modified a passage or two, so they could trick people going door to door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t do that\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any specific questions about classes or what I know of the inner circle, just ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had some left-over people hanging on.  He was loyal, and always repaid debts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you are also that type of person, as I am, you know very well. If you are kind to some people, they take advantage. In the end, they force you to be mean to them, so they can pretend to get their feelings hurt and blame you for the separation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a tired, depressed woman, perhaps in her 50s, long gray hair, living in one of the little apartments surrounding his picnic yard at the back of his compound in LA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos did some stalking, and I was assigned the task of \u201cwealthy buyer\u201d.  He had Corey as the powerful lawyer, and Felix as the tall handsome house boss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told us to come to his compound at a certain time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He showed me the fine wood picnic area in the back, which was expansive, and pointed out the big stone paver or concrete covered area in the middle where they could hold infinity theater, and even pulled out the wooden drawers near the tables to show me they were filled with shiny forks, knives, and spoons. He seemed to insist I lift up one of the forks, and examine it to see if it had any water spots.  He kept looking over my shoulder at one of the apartments, which I believed were all empty.  The entire compound was surrounded by bushes and trees rising up high enough, that it was completely private back there.  Took up maybe the space of 3 lots of normal LA homes of that area.  It was on a corner too, on a street with a suitable name for a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he led us over to one of the little apartments (there were perhaps 3-6), and had me shake the hand of the woman living in there. It seemed like we\u2019d gotten her out of bed, in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sure hope my memory of that event is wrong.  I believe someone later suggested it was Joanie. But my father also possibly got mixed up with Joanie at one point, so I have too many vague memories connected to her and Morongo and UC System anthropologists in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate, Carlos was dying.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman had to find another place to live.  I suppose he didn\u2019t want to just toss her out, so he tried to convince her we were buying the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_khwxit", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/khwxit/any_other_good_subs_on_this_spectrum/gh08v2f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1608922181.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1608922181.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gh02xew", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1608918246.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ggzvc13", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/khwxit/any_other_good_subs_on_this_spectrum/gh02xew/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gh02xew", "created": 1608918246.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gir5nwe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "wikipedia_text_bot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gir5naf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8pm6pzxo", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "**[Mimesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis)**\n\nMimesis (; Ancient Greek: \u03bc\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, m\u012bm\u0113sis) is a term used in literary criticism and philosophy that carries a wide range of meanings, including imitatio, imitation, nonsensuous similarity, receptivity, representation, mimicry, the act of expression, the act of resembling, and the presentation of the self.The original Ancient Greek term m\u012bm\u0113sis (\u03bc\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) derives from m\u012bmeisthai (\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, 'to imitate'), itself coming from mimos (\u03bc\u1fd6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, 'imitator, actor').

One of the women had a pleasing dream, in which she was already dead.\n\nCarlos liked it, so he explained that \"dead dreaming\" was a good thing to look for.\n\nBut he didn't suggest, you should dig yourself a grave, sit on the edge, and pretend you are going to shoot yourself in the head.\n\nSomething suggested by a angry male who passed through here.  Seeing all the magic being practiced in her, that's what he came up with to add to the collection.  Never actually tried to learn the real thing.\n\nUnfortunately, this is something \"shamans\" out there can sell for cash.  So you have people sincerely interested in learning magic, who never get any. They just get placebo after placebo. Workshops, techniques, but no actual magic.\n\nFor that reason,  \"symbolic death\" is a sore spot with me.  Because it's the enemy. It stops people from actually getting to work.\n\nHowever, don Juan does mention it.\n\nI suggest the only way to really get rid of yourself (die) is to learn to shut off the internal dialogue, and then stop the world.\n\nAnd it's a lot more fun!  When you try to stop the world, you can \"bounce off\" that.  You can end up reliving the past of one of the sorcerers in Carlos' books (while awake, I'm not talking about a bad dream here).\n\nOr (most likely), you can \"translocate\".\n\nBut if you get lucky (super silent), the world simply goes away, and you find yourself in a blazing fire of lines of amber and yellow light, stretching into infinity.  In those trillions of lines of light, you can find \"bundles\".\n\nIf you gaze into a bundle, you get sucked into another world in which you can remain.\n\nDoesn't that sound a lot more fun than playing cowboy and Indian with a \"shaman\", and pretending you got shot to death? For $1500.\n\nYes, the human form!  Good point.\n\nI have to remind myself about this periodically.\n\nYou can learn to visit God.  It's not even difficult.\n\nThat's the \"mold of man\".  Everything that humans aspire to be. \n\nIn Jewish mysticism, it was already present when God created the big bang.  It was there beside him as a companion.\n\nBut when you perceive it, it sure looks like God.  You can even ask it for something.  And, I can tell you from experience, if you don't remember you can ask for something, he'll remind you.\n\nBut the result of the \"mold of man\" in humans, is probably \"the human form\".\n\nThere's an interesting reference in the bible to God complaining to Satan.\n\nCarlos had me study the bible, which extended into me finding it necessary to study religions and magic in general, in order to understand the bible better.\n\nGod complains to Satan, \"I made you the full pattern!\"\n\n\nMeaning, how come you can't live like a nice guy, with all the gifts I gave you, when others are only partial pattern?\n\n(Jewish mysticism is along the same lines with us, except they lied like dogs.)\n\nIn fact, losing the human form is even beyond stopping the world.  You'll be stopping the world for a decade before you manage to get rid of the human form.  You can find that in the books, where once in a while Carlos gets close, long after he's been able to stop the world.\n\nI believe, the human form is the traces of our internal dialogue, but embedded in our physicality.  Our body has been trained to move (exist) according to the dialogue we were given.\n\nIf you shut off the internal dialogue, your assemblage point drifts, and reality changes.\n\nHowever, it's still \"you\" visiting other worlds.\n\nGetting rid of that \"you\" completely simply requires a lot of time, learning sorcery and being silent.  There's no technique to do it. It's the end result of the practice.\n\nBut imagine if we could discover  a technique to do it!  It's not impossible, if we gain enough people practicing.\n\nIt would probably be a horrible experience though, to have it removed all at once.  But THAT would be a symbolic death worth paying the $1500.\n\n&gt;everything was literally wavy like I was under water\n\nThat's not uncommon.  I experienced it at a workshop.\n\nAnd Carlos spoke about it.\n\nThe eyes have 3 modes of functioning.  Aside from the fact that the left eye sees wavy, and the right bubbly.  Or something like that. I only saw the wavy part.\n\nWe're stuck in the horrible mode our eyes can be in.  Perceiving social reality.\n\nBut they can also learn to perceive the second attention. In that case, they \"borrow\" the eyes of the dreaming double.  To some extent.  Percentage determines how cool it is.\n\nThen, they can switch over to \"seeing energy\".  It's a mode we always have running, but our mind blocks it.  \n\nAt that level you see the emanations themselves, awareness lighting them up, and containers around collections of that awareness (beings).\n\nBut you can cheat!

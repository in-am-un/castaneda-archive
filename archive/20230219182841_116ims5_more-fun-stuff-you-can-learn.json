Tried to erase it from history.\n\nI'm afraid to say, Wikipedia falls into that category.  On multiple topics.\n\nBut so does the Buddhist System.\n\nBig time!\n\nI can't calculate the abuse Castaneda fans took from delusional Dzogchen over the years.\n\nAnd the church of scientology was also after Carlos, hoping to erase his magic from the public mind so they could steal as much money as possible with their pretend magic.\n\nI'm afraid to say, I even have a vendetta against \"Genuine Native American Shamanism\".\n\nFor starters, Shamanism is extremely lame.  It's 90% book deal mind with 10% drug trips.\n\nYou can get that from \"The Rolling Stones\"!  Why bother with all the rambo headbands?\n\nEven among it's own \"native\" population, people misrepresent what it does.  And there's no magic going on there, anywhere I have found.  Or that any of my many \"spies\" have seen.\n\nNone.\n\nJust the same old \"green line meditation effects\" the Buddhists, Hindus, Daoists, and everyone else takes advantage of.\n\nKeep in mind, Shamanism is NOT what we do.\n\nOurs is \"Sorcery\".\n\nCarlos used the term shamanism almost interchangeably, because it's really hard to have to define sorcery each time you write a paper new people might read.\n\nIf you just say, \"Shamans\", everyone feels like they know what you're talking about.\n\nAnd all Mesoamerican Shamanism comes from the Olmecs.  Where our sorcery also comes from.\n\nIt's just a \"different branch\".\n\nThere's the \"working magic\" branch of Olmec knowledge.   From \"The Old Seers\" sorcery.\n\nAnd the \"pointless rituals designed to suck up money by fooling people with weird procedures they can copy despite the fact that they do nothing at all\".  \n\nIt's just easier to call it \"Shamanism\" than it is to tell the truth of what it really is.\n\nIt's from \"The Men of Knowledge\".\n\nThe enemies of Olmec sorcerers.\n\nAnd if you think I'm being harsh on our native american friends, don't forget.\n\nEvery population is 99% bad player mentality.\n\nThem too.\n\nSo in some ways, Shamans are our enemies.  Not our comrades.\n\nJust stick around this subreddit, and you'll see that's true.\n\nBut in fact however you feel about it, no one in their right mind would want to be a Shaman.\n\nThat's like being a rodeo clown.\n\nAll face paint and costume, but no actual bull riding.\n\nSo if you can make up your mind that you want the real thing,  you've already achieved that part.\n\nYou have it. Right here.\n\nNow you have to make up your mind to actually do some work.\n\nThat seems to be an insurmountable barrier for most.   That it actually takes work, to learn sorcery.\n\nBut if you can also do that, you will eventually find some VERY entertaining things to do with your nights.\n\nAnd one of them is surely \"seeing energy\".\n\nSome seers dedicate themselves to doing what you see in this picture.\n\nWatching the emanations.\n\nMostly trying to understand \"what they want\", according to the books.\n\nOr more precisely, \"What is the Eagle, and what does it want from us?\"\n\nIt's the most basic question a life form can ask.\n\nBut I say, \"screw that\"!\n\nIt's bad thinking.\n\nThe kind of thinking spoiled seers engage in.\n\nThe silver spoon generations of the lineages.\n\nBorn with a silver spoon in their mouth, they feel they have time for such luxuries as endlessly watching the Eagle, to try to figure out how to get an even bigger silver spoon the next time.\n\nI suggest you just give up on living forever, and enjoy the fireworks of sorcery.\n\nIt beats any movie sorcerer you've seen, as far as special effects go.\n\nBut you have to be silent!  This all hinges on not forcing reality to fit a little mold you were taught.\n\nYou can't reason with it, bully it, book deal it into submitting, or anything else you can think of.\n\nYou have to stop thinking.  That's the only way you'll get to see the show.\n\nOnce you can view it for hours each night, THEN you can judge my vendettas.\n\nSee if you still think some of them aren't justified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "More Fun Stuff You Can Learn!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"f70mu5cyj6ja1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c3c7361a59950ec7a667f67b2753f301a146eaf"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e52b5894d9355a62d8f5c250a563592f8885fa"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc1f307752c467e96404c3d43a959597df73f6db"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=222434e9ad3504c2d7fdb80e53f7846625caa0f0"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6a03045a41c1bea16bed2d52562f6e2ed015f9c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4d14a47773cb98892953f4c9daab54b92366b94"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00afe22876d307324a309b87aecce3f0539f224e"}, "id": "f70mu5cyj6ja1"}}, "name": "t3_116ims5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vzpErPcku0R1hHYSK9Od-XMtreo1UdXbycPbDt5e8mM.jpg", "edited": 1676831890.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1676827721.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=00afe22876d307324a309b87aecce3f0539f224e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/f70mu5cyj6ja1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=00afe22876d307324a309b87aecce3f0539f224e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case you haven&amp;#39;t noticed, I have &amp;quot;vendettas&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Towards all who tried to destroy our sorcery.

Carlos gave a mini-lecture on that once, mostly because there was someone in the room who's double tended to visit.\n\nI suppose it will be fascinating to learn why we can recall bits of it's escapades, if our tonal goes to sleep.\n\nDid it \"become visible\" due to internal silence, due to being asleep???\n\nSo that when were read that the double \"becomes visible\" when you reach silent knowledge, and think how cool that would be, we don't realize we do that daily.\n\n\\&gt;So then it's easy to assume that silence is the entrance to dreaming and the double, but weirdly enough it's also the way to move your AP?\n\nNo, silence is the way to let your attention get free from obsession over this reality, which requires holding the assemblage point here, so that you can perceive it.\n\nTo say it's an entrance is kind of misusing words.  The meaning isn't precise, and so the implications are \"off\".\n\n\\&gt;But you probably need silence to be aware of being 2 places at once?\n\nI suspect that's also slightly off, so that it makes no sense to try to answer it.\n\nBut I'm not far enough along to be sure of the answer.\n\nHow about this:  In the process of trying to become lucid, many try to go directly into dreaming, from laying in bed.\n\nIt's common to see the dream and the bedroom at the same time.\n\nSometimes...\n\nIn that case, if you ask them carefully, and get them to elaborate, you'll find they aren't actually aware of both at once.\n\nThey have to move back and forth.\n\nBut they get into a state where it's easy to do that.  To look back to yourself in bed, but then \"turn your head\" back into the dream.\n\nThat's a VERY good thing to do. If you get the chance, try to do it longer.\n\nBetween the \"here\" and the \"there\" (in the double) is \"the abstract\".\n\nI have the vaguest memory of Fancy teaching me how powerful \"the abstract\" is.\n\nThat if you can see it, you can simply leap from one place to the other.\n\nAs if the world were made of swiss cheese, and the holes lead from one place to the other.\n\nShe also hinted you could do really wicked things to other people, using the abstract.\n\nBut then, that's Fancy.  She's like that.\n\nHasn't been seen for more than a week now!\n\n\\&gt;The reason you want us to do dark room is to focus on moving the AP rather then focusing on the double?\n\nI want you to do darkroom, because it includes all the techniques Carlos was giving out in the last month before he died.\n\nAnd you can't lie to yourself using darkroom.\n\nOut there in Castaneda land, everyone lies to themselves.\n\nWe had that guy yesterday who came to piss on the subreddit.  To mark it like the dog in that bad player post.\n\nHe let us know, while seeming to be friendly, Carlos has valid critics, there are valid other \"Toltec\" books out there (probably a student of Victor or one of the others), and that he can *see*.  But he's following path after path, so we're not important.\n\nHe's lied himself into never learning.\n\nI suppose someone could post their darkroom results and lie, but they can't lie to themselves. They know what happened, and it's entirely based on learning to be silent.\n\nThat's why darkroom. Because anything else will not work at this point.\n\nWhich could change with more successes.\n\n\\&gt;Does 4 gates of dreaming even move the AP then?\n\nYes. Try some.  You'll even feel it.\n\nYou get grumpy.  So it moves sideways, to the right.\n\nThat's grumpyland.\n\nAnd down of course.\n\n\\&gt;And also does the double have an AP?\n\nI might say, \"we don't know\", except Taisha's book doesn't agree with Carlos, on what the double is.\n\nTaisha's book seems to equate it to the energy body.\n\nThe energy body has one. It's where you wiggle your fingers in darkroom.\n\n(Everyone be sure to keep that up; it does things you aren't aware of).\n\nBut if I had to guess, since it assembles a specific location (sometimes standing right next to you), it has to have one.\n\n\\&gt;I think i used to associate getting to the end of the j curve with crossing the forth gate. That kinda mislead my thinking .\n\nPeople love those \"gates\"!\n\nMaybe we should call the colored lines, \"gates\" instead of zones?\n\nSo you could ask people, \"Did you cross the red gate?\"\n\nSounds kind of bad ass!\n\nThe Dragon's Gate...\n\nHey!  Maybe I can beat Juan on that new J curve diagram.\n\nHe's using pinball.\n\nBut you could use some kind of dragon oriented fantasy.\n\nMaybe  sort of like \"Gauntlet\".\n\nIs that too old?\n\nThe blue gate is a drunken dragon, and so on.\n\nYou have to \"sneak\" by them without waking them, and they're telepathic so they sense thoughts.\n\n\\&gt;But if the goal really is just to get to the end of the j-curve as fast as possible, then why even reach the forth gate?\n\nPassing the 4th gate is automatic with darkroom.\n\nBecause the double becomes visible, and even comes out to help you.\n\nAs in Taisha's book. When Taisha got the double to do kung fu on the ground, she had passed the 4th gate.\n\nBut I suppose, sleeping dreaming is an entirely different arena.\n\nMy darkroom skills could be slightly enhanced by all the four gates dreaming I did.\n\nI haven't heard of anyone doing as much as I did, by a long shot.\n\nSo probably both are good.\n\nI just don't like four gates, because it creates bullies who never learn any sorcery at all.\n\nThey pretend everything.\n\nO'Neil is one of those.  He's likely harmed thousands of people over the years, with his bogus dreaming accounts. He lures them on Facebook, then starts building himself up and putting Carlos down.  Claims don Juan and the dreaming emissary told him he was special in dreaming.  And he can't be wrong, because he can \"see energy\".\n\nWhich of course, he cannot.\n\nUsed to claim to be a Nagual according to some who pay more attention to people like him.\n\nThat's what 4 gates dreaming leads to.\n\nBut otherwise, it's pretty cool.\n\nJust makes you live in grumpland.", "edited": 1623794129.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h1wbrr6", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Ok so from your explanation i get that we are always dreaming just we don&amp;#39;t notice it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes.

It&amp;#39;s where you wiggle your fingers in darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Everyone be sure to keep that up; it does things you aren&amp;#39;t aware of).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if I had to guess, since it assembles a specific location (sometimes standing right next to you), it has to have one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;I think i used to associate getting to the end of the j curve with crossing the forth gate. That kinda mislead my thinking .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People love those &amp;quot;gates&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should call the colored lines, &amp;quot;gates&amp;quot; instead of zones?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could ask people, &amp;quot;Did you cross the red gate?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds kind of bad ass!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dragon&amp;#39;s Gate...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey!  Maybe I can beat Juan on that new J curve diagram.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s using pinball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you could use some kind of dragon oriented fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe  sort of like &amp;quot;Gauntlet&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is that too old?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blue gate is a drunken dragon, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to &amp;quot;sneak&amp;quot; by them without waking them, and they&amp;#39;re telepathic so they sense thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;But if the goal really is just to get to the end of the j-curve as fast as possible, then why even reach the forth gate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Passing the 4th gate is automatic with darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the double becomes visible, and even comes out to help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As in Taisha&amp;#39;s book. When Taisha got the double to do kung fu on the ground, she had passed the 4th gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suppose, sleeping dreaming is an entirely different arena.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My darkroom skills could be slightly enhanced by all the four gates dreaming I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t heard of anyone doing as much as I did, by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So probably both are good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t like four gates, because it creates bullies who never learn any sorcery at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They pretend everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;O&amp;#39;Neil is one of those.  He&amp;#39;s likely harmed thousands of people over the years, with his bogus dreaming accounts. He lures them on Facebook, then starts building himself up and putting Carlos down.  Claims don Juan and the dreaming emissary told him he was special in dreaming.  And he can&amp;#39;t be wrong, because he can &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which of course, he cannot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Used to claim to be a Nagual according to some who pay more attention to people like him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what 4 gates dreaming leads to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, it&amp;#39;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just makes you live in grumpland.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_o0imp1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o0imp1/people_in_dreams/h1wbrr6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1623793383.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1623793383.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h1w6u5v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ItsBeyoondMee", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1623791146.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h1vt9i2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_bgj6frr6", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Ok so from your explanation i get that we are always dreaming just we don't notice it?\n\nAnd when we relax and get silent we start noticing it. \n\nSo then it's easy to assume that silence is the entrance to dreaming and the double, but weirdly enough it's also the way to move your AP? \n\nOr is it possible to move the AP without silence? \n\nOr is it vise versa, where it's possible to dream without silence? \n\nI guess the second one makes sense since the sorcerers where 2 places at ones all the time. \n\nBut you probably need silence to be aware of being 2 places at once? \n\nOr is it even possible to be dreaming without moving the AP? \n\n\nIt's all kinda confusing to me although i should probably know the answer by now. \n\n\n\nOk i am getting it slowly i think.\n\nThe reason you want us to do dark room is to focus on moving the AP rather then focusing on the double?\n\nDoes 4 gates of dreaming even move the AP then? \n\nAnd also does the double have an AP?\n\n\n\nI think i used to associate getting to the end of the j curve with crossing the forth gate.

Sometimes even standing right next to you.\n\nIt's a dream!\n\nIt's also another portion of your total energy, separated when we got born here.\n\nSilence is part of the physical body, which isn't the double.\n\nSilence belongs to the organic body.\n\nSo that statement kind of makes no sense.  In total silence, the double becomes \"visible\" to the organic body.\n\nBut while searching for \"total silence\", I did notice Carlos gave instructions to do a specific series of magical passes in total silence.\n\nIf anyone had obeyed, they would have discovered darkroom. In the light.  I had done that at a workshop without knowing I was trying to do that.  So it's an automatic result of the silence.\n\nIt's our own fault the Tensegrity didn't work!\n\n\\&gt;I mean, does anyone know how deep the AP moves during sleep?\n\nYou have to keep in mind, Carlos lectured about the J curve only once.\n\nSo you won't find that information easily.\n\nEspecially since the apprentices got their assemblage points moved with the Nagual's blow.\n\nWhat we're doing was foreign to them.  The idea of \"depth\" (the way we understand it) is a relatively new thing.\n\nBut Blue to green zone is what Carlos indicated was common during the J curve lecture.\n\nAnd sideways.\n\nAnd, it sort of also makes no sense. The assemblage point belongs to the organic body primarily.\n\nThe dream is the double.\n\nHowever, you can kind of tell what your assemblage point must be doing,  by what the dream looks like.  If it's a hellish copy of your daily world, with all the same crap, it's a sideways movement at the blue line.\n\nIf it gets a little more fun and weird, it's green line.

You can detect those by forcing them to dissolve.\n\nWhen you use the term, \"imagination\", you don't realize it's a poor category created by the social order.\n\nIt implies something that just isn't true.  That there's a single, real world.  And anything else has no real existence.\n\nBut it's not like that.  Reality is far more complex than that.\n\nYou can experiment with this yourself, you don't have to believe anyone.\n\nBut you'd have to become lucid to do it.\n\nJust go around pointing your finger at the people in the dream, and stare hard at even the tiniest details,  to see what happens.  Are they staying steady?\n\nNope, they're mutating!  What are they becoming???\n\nThat forces the image to dissolve.\n\nMost will dissolve into a pile of old clothes, and not the ones they actually had on.\n\nSomeone's energy body visiting you won't dissolve, and if you can see energy (the whitish stuff), you'll see that they are an energy source (they glow).\n\nLike Cholita.  Won't dissolve.  But runs away if she notices someone.

Carlos banned me from the books, wrote 3 more, and then I discovered some of what was in them, on my own.\n\nWhich is always more convincing.\n\n\\&gt;Would be really nice if someone explain what let's say phantom intent is.\n\nPhantom intent is a more complex term than it seems.\n\nBut essentially, if there's no energy behind it, but it's there anyway, that's phantom intent.\n\nI suppose you have to be able to see energy before you can detect that.\n\nBut there's also common sense.\n\nIf I produce a dream in my room, that's phantom intent.\n\nUNLESS I accidentally tuned in on a real place.\n\nThen it's not.\n\nI think you'll do well to remember,  if you are on the trail of doing magic in the darkroom, and you can't do it,  and you feel frustrated, you'll eventually find out darkroom is like weight lifting.\n\nThe results aren't obvious for days.\n\nAnd the results are that when you look, you see more than before.\n\nA very puzzling thing!\n\nOne night you look, and there's nothing in the darkness.\n\nA  year later you look, and no space is unfilled with something.", "edited": 1623787081.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h1vt9i2", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Also DJ said &amp;quot;there are no dreams in total silence&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t find it.

Some of you have read my early notes on dreaming, on sustained action.\n\nI haven\u2019t read those for years, so I apologize if I tell it differently this time. In fact, in the world of sorcery no story remains the same.\n\nIt\u2019s always evolving.  Even if circumstances remain the same, our understanding of it changes.\n\nWorse, you remember stuff that you didn\u2019t before. Memories require some kind of trigger, to let you find them.\n\nThe color of someone\u2019s dress. The time of day. A smell nearby.\n\nEvents submerged in dreaming may have no such trigger available in the waking world. You can completely forget them at the next movement of the assemblage point.\n\nYou already did!\n\nTell me half the dreams you had last night.\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nWhen dreaming reaches the more advanced stages, it\u2019s not even possible to talk about it, or think about it. It doesn\u2019t yield to words.\n\nIt just happens, and you can interact with it. Or, you can get stuck in it for hours.\n\nBut you can\u2019t tell anyone about it.\n\nIf you force yourself to think of words to explain it, they\u2019ll come out as, \u201cblah, blah, blah.\u201d\n\nBut a very sincere blah. You\u2019ll really mean that.\n\nLet me introduce myself, if you haven\u2019t heard about me.  I\u2019m hoping this document moves to other places. It started in a subreddit.\n\nI was first introduced to the topic of Carlos, at age 9. I was associated with archaeological digs near Morongo.\n\nI might have met him at 12, when Willie Boy was filmed at Morongo, but I wasn\u2019t really thinking about such things.\n\nSusan Clark had just spoiled my Polaroid of her, by lifting her skirt up too high.   It might even have been where Carlos first noticed me.\n\nI like to think so.  I can't imagine Carlos missing a view of Susan Clark's panties. She was the sexy star of the movie.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhkH1FE1mZA&amp;t=1m59s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhkH1FE1mZA&amp;t=1m59s) \n\nThrough suspicious circumstances, I found myself invited to Carlos Castaneda\u2019s private classes, nearly 30 years later.\n\nI attended all of the workshops in the mid 90s, up until he died.\n\nCarlos died before he could teach anyone waking dreaming.   I believe that had a devastating effect on the results.\n\nPeople declared him a fraud. And that spread over the internet.\n\nWe\u2019ve still got Cleargreen. But if you ask any doubters, they\u2019ll point out that Cleargreen is in it for the money.\n\nGood thing too! Russia is filled with Tensegrity practitioners, specifically because Cleargreen is charging to create new teachers.\n\nCarlos succeeded there. Tensegrity will be around a long while.\n\nAnd Russians have a very long history of real magic. They thrive on it. Just ask Rasputin.\n\nI\u2019m trying to add some magic back into the mix, so it\u2019s obviously not just weird martial arts.\n\nAnd so, Russians won\u2019t be able to resist it.\n\nI want to let them know that Tensegrity can assemble other worlds.\n\nIt just needs a little tweaking to do that.  I\u2019m too busy, but they could figure it out from this document.\n\nThe modifications are nothing Carlos would object to.\n\nAnd dreaming leads to obvious violations of the laws of physics, as we know them.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more convincing than that.\n\nCarlos often tried to explain certain \u201csorcerer\u2019s moods\u201d to us.\n\nHe\u2019d read a poem, or play some music, and point out the longing of the author, and how he had managed to intuit the feeling of a true sorcerer.\n\nI\u2019m not after that.\n\nI\u2019m after, \u201cOh yea? Carlos was a fake? Well watch this sucker!!!\n\nCan your fat guru do that?!\u201d\n\nAs I mentioned, there\u2019s no impeccable warrior here.\n\nBut my companion is!\n\nShe\u2019s also from private classes.\n\nTrouble is, she went mad.\n\nIt was inevitable. Carlos knew it. He\u2019d seen her type before. Zuleica.\n\nShe\u2019s a westerly dreamer. As crazy as Zuleica, and just as foul at times as Zoila.\n\nAs Carlos would say, yowser mowser!\n\nShe would have gone mad regardless of learning from Carlos. It was just her fate.\n\nI was (sort of) given instructions to protect her more than 20 years ago, when Carlos was still alive.\n\nShe can move objects just by looking at them.\n\nBut afterwards, if you ask how on Earth she did that, she says,\n\n\u201cWhat, am I Jesus now? Do I have to be the virgin sacrifice to save all of humanity? Will your little friends on reddit expect to drink my holy  blood???\u201d\n\nAnd she runs away to be homeless, often for days.\n\nShe really believes the bit about the blood.  She's absolutely certain someone is making millions of dollars off her and not giving her a cent.\n\nParanoid Schizophrenia is the probable diagnosis.\n\nCholita is a lot of fun. I hope that if Cleargreen is reading this, they\u2019ll remember to protect Margarete\u2019s feisty little friend, in case I don't live long enough.\n\nI'm older than Cholita.\n\nHer dreaming double is aggressive, and if you get silent it will come to visit you.  Just sit up in perfect silence, in darkness, and wait.\n\nI once chased her across Mexico in dreaming, until I had to smash a small town there.\n\nIt works best if she\u2019s in the next room.\n\nShe\u2019s a little vain. She may fudge the age of her dreaming double a bit.\n\nBut she can\u2019t deposit a check in the bank. She needs help for everything.\n\nBefore I give my tips for passing the gates of dreaming, I hate to see someone waste their time.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t after \u201cthe real thing\u201d, this isn\u2019t for you.\n\nThe real thing isn\u2019t something you share with others, to get attention.\n\nThe real thing doesn\u2019t make you a better or happier person.\n\nWhen the dreaming characters refuse to remain in the dream, and chase you around the bed, even coming to visit you at work, then you can talk about whether you\u2019re a better person.\n\nYou\u2019ll just be different, that\u2019s all.\n\nIt\u2019s a cold feeling. Don\u2019t expect dreaming to be warm and fuzzy. Dreamers sink to the depths and like to stay there.\n\nOn a more practical level, you\u2019ll wet the bed for sure. If that bothers you, put a thick towel under yourself.\n\nAnd as to how much work it will be, would you clean your entire neighborhood with a toothbrush?\n\nIf not, you won\u2019t make it.\n\nBut don\u2019t fret. If you just clean one house, you\u2019ll at least see the sidewalk.\n\nIn fact, just clean the driveway and you\u2019ll be rewarded, if you follow my advice.\n\nBaby steps, baby proof. That\u2019s the idea.\n\nA dreamer also has to be prepared to shake hands with the devil himself.\n\nBefore you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll surely meet a demon or two.\n\nYou\u2019re warned.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already done a bit of lucid dreaming Ala Carlos, maybe you can skip to the 4th gate: shared dreaming.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have enough energy to do both.\n\nHow to choose?\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what a shift of the assemblage point feels like, or if you are unclear on what \u201cthe second attention\u201d is,  start at the first gate.\n\nIf you clearly know about both to some extent, skip to the fourth gate.\n\nEither path is the same. Neither is harder or requires less effort.\n\nI have a preference for just skipping to the fourth gate. That\u2019s where you do things no one else will believe.\n\nThat\u2019s fun!  Someone may even call you \u201cdelusional\u201d.\n\nJackpot!\n\nBut I didn\u2019t do it that way. I passed all the gates up to where a partner was needed, and then I stopped because I had none.\n\nSo if you skip to the 4th without passing the first three, I might have misdirected you.\n\nOr to put it planer, if it\u2019s all real for you at this point, skip to the 4th. But don\u2019t blame me if you have to go back to the start.\n\nIn truth, the first 3 gates are only to convince you that weird shit happens.\n\nOnce you know that, you\u2019re ready to step right through your bedroom wall, fully awake, and enter into dreaming.\n\nThat\u2019s the shortcut to the 4th gate.\n\nBut is your assemblage point flexible enough, and can it anchor itself well?\n\nThere\u2019s the rub.\n\nNote: none of this is made up. I wouldn\u2019t waste my time. There\u2019s no money in this for me.\n\nI\u2019m only here to repay Carlos.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a list of the 4 gates.\n\nI liked the excellent 1-page description on Wikipedia, but it was too serious.\n\nIt must have been written by an impeccable warrior.\n\nI took some liberties with it.  And also, I don\u2019t care how Carlos got there.\n\nI know some shortcuts.\n\nBut they go through thorn bushes. It won\u2019t be pretty.\n\n**1st Gate of Dreaming (Boring yourself to death)**\n\n**2nd Gate of dreaming (Messing with the locals)**\n\n**3rd Gate of Dreaming (So many worlds?)**\n\n**4th Gate of Dreaming (Kidnapping other dreamers)**\n\nMany other shortcuts are available. I\u2019ve heard of some, from Russians.\n\nHere\u2019s how much fun each stage will be, when using my techniques:\n\n1st Gate:  Horrible. The worst thing you ever tried to do. If you make it through, you\u2019ll either scare the hell out of yourself and return to Church, or you\u2019ll make it all the way. Abramelin will have nothing on you, if you pass this step.\n\n2nd Gate: Fun! Just remember, whoever you assault might be real. You never know at first.  So be kind to the locals, unless they try to stop you. In that case, ***smash***.\n\n3rd Gate: Confusing. Maybe Carlos wasn\u2019t telling us *everything*? How do we know what\u2019s real? Hint: it\u2019s all real.\n\n4th Gate: Stupendously fun! Except, now you\u2019re **insane**.\n\nNo one\u2019s perfect. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nBut tomorrow, unless Cholita murders me tonight.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to Pass the Four Gates of Dreaming", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"um2fc5clhm741": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 107, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/um2fc5clhm741.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0581f30479e084fbfab410ee775158750fa82bd"}, {"y": 214, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/um2fc5clhm741.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d240a7079bfa49ce4d2780f83f381ea63b4c8837"}, {"y": 318, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/um2fc5clhm741.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8826d266e44b7eab36e4b0aa8be3713704baff73"}], "s": {"y": 518, "x": 521, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/um2fc5clhm741.jpg?width=521&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7eae98809c6328be93494bfd3e95341486df173"}, "id": "um2fc5clhm741"}}, "name": "t3_egkz4l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 57, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhkH1FE1mZA?start=119&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 459, "scrolling": false, "height": 344}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE Trailer", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhkH1FE1mZA?start=119&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 344, "width": 459, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "Umbrella Entertainment", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AhkH1FE1mZA/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/UmbrellaEntAU"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhkH1FE1mZA?start=119&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 459, "scrolling": false, "media_domain_url": "https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/egkz4l", "height": 344}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 57, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/QpslHaHV6Jv-TtAvwNwPqQ1_B1LlyYcKMpcgicxkmUA.jpg", "edited": 1577841527.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1577500919.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/um2fc5clhm741.jpg?width=521&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f7eae98809c6328be93494bfd3e95341486df173\"&gt;Art by Bear&amp;#39;s Daughter Nina Stanley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m Dan from Carlos Castaneda\u2019s private classes.

If you just clean one house, you\u2019ll at least see the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, just clean the driveway and you\u2019ll be rewarded, if you follow my advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Baby steps, baby proof. That\u2019s the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A dreamer also has to be prepared to shake hands with the devil himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll surely meet a demon or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re warned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve already done a bit of lucid dreaming Ala Carlos, maybe you can skip to the 4th gate: shared dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don\u2019t have enough energy to do both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to choose?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don\u2019t know what a shift of the assemblage point feels like, or if you are unclear on what \u201cthe second attention\u201d is,  start at the first gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you clearly know about both to some extent, skip to the fourth gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either path is the same. Neither is harder or requires less effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a preference for just skipping to the fourth gate. That\u2019s where you do things no one else will believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s fun!  Someone may even call you \u201cdelusional\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackpot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn\u2019t do it that way. I passed all the gates up to where a partner was needed, and then I stopped because I had none.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you skip to the 4th without passing the first three, I might have misdirected you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to put it planer, if it\u2019s all real for you at this point, skip to the 4th. But don\u2019t blame me if you have to go back to the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In truth, the first 3 gates are only to convince you that weird shit happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you know that, you\u2019re ready to step right through your bedroom wall, fully awake, and enter into dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the shortcut to the 4th gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But is your assemblage point flexible enough, and can it anchor itself well?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s the rub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: none of this is made up. I wouldn\u2019t waste my time. There\u2019s no money in this for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m only here to repay Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s start with a list of the 4 gates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I liked the excellent 1-page description on Wikipedia, but it was too serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It must have been written by an impeccable warrior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took some liberties with it.  And also, I don\u2019t care how Carlos got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know some shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they go through thorn bushes. It won\u2019t be pretty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Gate of Dreaming (Boring yourself to death)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Gate of dreaming (Messing with the locals)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd Gate of Dreaming (So many worlds?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th Gate of Dreaming (Kidnapping other dreamers)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many other shortcuts are available. I\u2019ve heard of some, from Russians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s how much fun each stage will be, when using my techniques:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1st Gate:  Horrible. The worst thing you ever tried to do. If you make it through, you\u2019ll either scare the hell out of yourself and return to Church, or you\u2019ll make it all the way. Abramelin will have nothing on you, if you pass this step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd Gate: Fun! Just remember, whoever you assault might be real. You never know at first.  So be kind to the locals, unless they try to stop you. In that case, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;smash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd Gate: Confusing. Maybe Carlos wasn\u2019t telling us &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;? How do we know what\u2019s real? Hint: it\u2019s all real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4th Gate: Stupendously fun! Except, now you\u2019re &lt;strong&gt;insane&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one\u2019s perfect. Let\u2019s get started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But tomorrow, unless Cholita murders me tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OZVkEy9_ECjZDRr40SKtxWEcnwZRVrP7B-Y3SCIKJWY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3df8b00147d61b401c8ac64366decd78f9812cf0", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OZVkEy9_ECjZDRr40SKtxWEcnwZRVrP7B-Y3SCIKJWY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c981e43e408249eff51aa35db666fcd3044b8f0", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OZVkEy9_ECjZDRr40SKtxWEcnwZRVrP7B-Y3SCIKJWY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a892d7dbe4356f2078fd831d4ded2077dcda7e", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OZVkEy9_ECjZDRr40SKtxWEcnwZRVrP7B-Y3SCIKJWY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a7a862e2c110fb17e84dd59b11c3c38841c5cde", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "We0CztmgUtgLNsageN5EtAZOfQNUQXrWGeG4TCP-klY"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "egkz4l", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 96, "send_replies": true, "media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE Trailer", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhkH1FE1mZA?start=119&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 344, "width": 459, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "Umbrella Entertainment", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AhkH1FE1mZA/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/UmbrellaEntAU"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1577500919.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fch2z1p", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fcatypt", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I guess I'll move part 3 to posts under the top, instead of replying like this.

You don\u2019t like to be put out, doing things you aren\u2019t sure really work.\n\nActually, you\u2019re lazy. I don\u2019t mean lazy in the normal way.  I mean mentally lazy. It actually hurts to go against your normal thinking process.\n\nRemember this: we're building \"silence muscles\" here.\n\nIt hurts to build muscle!\n\nAnd never forget this: If you struggle like a son of a bitch to get silent, and nothing happens, you just built more lean muscle that you would have, had you succeeded easily.\n\nYou can't lose!\n\nEven so, the idea of dragging yourself to a chair to practice my technique likely just represents continuous torture in your mind.\n\nYou\u2019ll put if off. But you\u2019ll feel guilty, so you\u2019ll end up laying in bed, trying to give it a try from there.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like it, you can just go to sleep.  No big deal.\n\nOk.  Yea.  I admit it. You could do that. But I wish you wouldn\u2019t.\n\nAnd if you do, you didn\u2019t fully **JUMP**. You just stuck your toe over the edge.\n\nAlso, if you aren't sitting up, your head can't fall forward when you become unconscious, jarring the heck out of your neck, and reminding you to get back to work.\n\nYou'll just keep going, deep into sleep, and your practice time will be next to nothing.\n\nIn the chair, you are facing infinity with your eyes closed.\n\nOn the bed, you're facing slumber and loss of consciousness.\n\nTake your pick.  Infinity and hard work, or unconsciousness and less effort.\n\nAnd don't miss my analogy,  of \"which way\" you are facing.  Infinity or slumber.\n\nThere are many places along those routes.\n\nAt the 4th gate, you'll only need to turn your head, to enter another world.\n\nReally.  No kidding. I'll have you jumping into a tea cup if you'll follow my advice.\n\nThere really aren't any techniques in sorcery, but at first you need some reason to practice, so you're given a technique.\n\nIf you choose the easy path (shades of Yoda there?), then modify the technique slightly.\n\nYou need to find a cozy \u201ccocoon\u201d to wrap yourself up in, while you do the technique. Try to always use the same position of your body. And over time, try to visualize what the \"cocoon\" looks like.  Even if it's just the comforter on your bed.\n\nTry to include the second attention in that.  Wikipedia suggests a heavy feeling, or blackness. Those are good.  But bliss is better.\n\nA train station (had that once) is even better.  Don't take the books so literally!\n\nYour goal now is altered.  It\u2019s the same technique, but you\u2019re likely going to fall to sleep.  Look for \u201ccozy\u201d.  Wrapped in your cocoon of reduced thought, looking for anything different.  If you happen to see any dreaming images, play with those any way you can think of.\n\nTingling or bliss is excellent.  Soak in it!\n\nOne of these methods, the chair, or the lazy-pants method, will lead you to waking up inside a dream.\n\nI\u2019m afraid, even with my techniques you won\u2019t wake up in a dream as often as you\u2019d like.  Maybe once a month at first.  I\u2019m sorry.  But other weird stuff will likely happen, if you follow instructions.  You\u2019ll be rewarded.\n\nWaking up inside a dream means, your assemblage point has to lock into dreaming, but also bring along a little of the first attention.\n\nYou only learn that by **doing**. Unless someone else comes up with another technique to do it directly.\n\nI don\u2019t know one.\n\nWhen you first wake up in the dream, you might not be sure.  You might think, \u201cReally?  That can\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nYou have to test it.\n\nJump up as high as you can, and see if it hurts like shit when you land.\n\nOr find something to read.  The text will keep mutating.\n\nEven \u201cDr. Who\u201d knows that technique.\n\nI'm referring to the grumpy version of the doctor. That\u2019s what you turn into, with too much dreaming.\n\nIf you\u2019re like the first female \u201cDr. Who\u201d, I probably can\u2019t give you the best advice.\n\nSome women are just witches. They simply *know* it.  And they like it that way.\n\nThey\u2019ll probably glance over my post as if it were uninteresting cliff notes, and do whatever the hell they want.\n\nI suspect this is why there's some controversy on whether women can learn dreaming this way.\n\nIt's because they don't want to. But once they're in it, watch out men!  They'll kick your butt.\n\nWhen Cholita (a private class witch) meets me in dreaming, I can barely keep up with her.\n\nEither way, as soon as you realize you\u2019re in the dream look at your hands!!!!!\n\nIt doesn\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d if you don\u2019t.\n\nYou MUST look at your hands. Then look at your arms.    They\u2019ll both be weird and distorted.  You\u2019re trying to fix that.  Look down at your feet.\n\nThat\u2019s good enough. Take a look around.  After you view an object or phantom, look back to your hands.\n\nWhy?\n\nLooking at the hands makes sure you have a body, instead of being a cow, or an observer.  Dreaming is irrational until you add rationality.\n\nWe\u2019re adding that.\n\nLooking at the objects, and then back at your hands, creates perspective.\n\nIt sets up the environment such that you can interact with it.\n\nBut don\u2019t do it too long!  You\u2019re going to lose this fast.\n\nYou have to hold on to it!\n\nAt first, 30 seconds is amazing. Later on, 2 weeks is no problem.\n\nYes, I\u2019m not lying here.\n\nBut 2 weeks is near the 4th gate level. And please don\u2019t ask me if your \u201creal\u201d body fades away during that 2 weeks.\n\nI don\u2019t know.  But time doesn\u2019t run the same in dreaming.\n\nAnd you didn\u2019t access one of the \u201creal\u201d worlds yet. This one is mostly a phantom world.\n\nSo you\u2019ll almost surely be thrown back into the bed when you\u2019re done.\n\nIf not, I owe you a beer.\n\nLikely you\u2019ll be lucky to last 10 seconds.\n\nYou need to learn to hold the dream. Here\u2019s my favorite techniques:\n\n1). If the dream fades into darkness, fall to your knees and grab dirt. Feel anything you can, to keep the dream going.  Actually, you\u2019ve just done a \u201cdream change\u201d.  The best dream change is \u201czooming\u201d, but if you can\u2019t see anything, you have to feel.\n\nIt\u2019s a new dream of feeling around, even if you can\u2019t see anything. As long as you have something still in your hand, you didn\u2019t wake up. Remember that.\n\n2). If the dream is merely *starting* to fade, stomp your feet on the ground.  Isn't that amazing?! Feels solid, doesn't it?\n\nShout.  Make a big fuss.  If things get more stable, start walking quickly.  Look closely at everything, find your hands again, but don\u2019t stare too long at any one thing. That causes a dream change, and you can\u2019t handle that.\n\n3). If the locals start to hassle you, you found a \u201cscout\u201d.  At least one.  But that\u2019s gate 2, and you haven\u2019t passed gate 1 until you can do it over and over.    Ask them kindly to come back in a few days, but for now, leave you alone.\n\nIf they won\u2019t, grab them with one hand on their leg, and one on their shoulder, upper arm, or neck, lift them, turn them upside down, and crush them into the ground.\n\nBut that\u2019s second gate stuff.\n\n4). You can also do the following: close your eyes and walk through a wall or door.  Just walk!  Shit, you\u2019re in dream!  Don\u2019t worry about bumping your darned head!  You don\u2019t really have one.\n\nIf you bump, or pass through the wall, you changed dreams.  Each dream change gets you more time.  Maybe 10 seconds only at first.\n\nYou can also jump into a painting. If you succeed at that, you\u2019ll pass the 4th gate for sure. If you keep trying.\n\n5). Shout as loudly as you can, \u201cDOES ANYONE WANT TO PLAY?!?\u201d\n\n6). Get yourself killed as soon as possible. Or if you became lucid in the dream because you were mortally wounded, that\u2019s perfect!  As long as you\u2019re dead, you can relax. Nothing in the dream can have any effect on you. Just go around being dead, and enjoy the feeling. It\u2019ll extend the dream enormously. But probably not the first few times.  It almost has to happen naturally.\n\nIf you find yourself trapped impossibly high up, like on the top of the tallest building around, jump to your death.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about killing entities and jumping to your death, if you follow my advice. It\u2019s designed to make sure you can\u2019t possibly actually be awake, in some kind of psychotic break.\n\nYou can\u2019t pick people up and turn them upside down, except in a dream.  And you won\u2019t find yourself on the top of the highest building around worrying that you\u2019re about to wake up, in the real world.\n\nIf you do, sorry about that\u2026 Dreaming isn\u2019t completely safe.  Mentally unstable people can still do it, but I have no idea what steps they should take differently.\n\nMaybe just don\u2019t hurtle yourself off a tall building.\n\nI could go on and on with such techniques, but each one is a \u201cdream change\u201d.  When the assemblage point moves to a location you aren\u2019t used to, it releases energy.\n\nThat energy can be used to prolong *dreaming*.  Think of it like a movie projector whos light source is half a birthday candle. When the candle burns out you can't see the movie, and someone turns on the lights.\n\nWhen it\u2019s used up, your assemblage point drifts back to being awake.\n\nA dream change alters the position a tiny bit, so that you have more energy.\n\nThe crazier the new dream, the more time you\u2019ll get. Zooming over to a mountain is my favorite, but that\u2019s 2nd gate.\n\nWhat to do if you fail and wake up after only a few seconds?\n\nIf it's the first time, give a big happy sigh.  You did good!\n\nBut always remember this:\n\nYou CAN\u2019T fail. It\u2019s not possible. Waking up just means you've been sent back to the 2nd grade, because you weren\u2019t doing well in the 3rd grade.\n\nTake it like a big boy.  Remain motionless.  Focus your imagination on the last thing you saw. Even a palm tree is enough.  If you changed dreams to feeling dirt,then remember the dirt feeling.\n\nThose emanations inside your luminous cocoon are still lit up, so remembering it reminds the assemblage point, \u201cHey, it was kind of fun over there!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll seem like too long. But if you don\u2019t allow yourself to think about anything else, you\u2019ll find yourself back in.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll realize, Hey! It was only 15 second to get back in.\n\nEdited three times", "edited": 1577844118.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fcatypt", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2B:  1st Gate of Dreaming (Hanging on for dear life!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now a warning:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you!  You don\u2019t like to be put out, doing things you aren\u2019t sure really work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, you\u2019re lazy. I don\u2019t mean lazy in the normal way.  I mean mentally lazy. It actually hurts to go against your normal thinking process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember this: we&amp;#39;re building &amp;quot;silence muscles&amp;quot; here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It hurts to build muscle!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And never forget this: If you struggle like a son of a bitch to get silent, and nothing happens, you just built more lean muscle that you would have, had you succeeded easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t lose!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, the idea of dragging yourself to a chair to practice my technique likely just represents continuous torture in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll put if off. But you\u2019ll feel guilty, so you\u2019ll end up laying in bed, trying to give it a try from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don\u2019t like it, you can just go to sleep.  No big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok.  Yea.  I admit it. You could do that. But I wish you wouldn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you do, you didn\u2019t fully &lt;strong&gt;JUMP&lt;/strong&gt;. You just stuck your toe over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you aren&amp;#39;t sitting up, your head can&amp;#39;t fall forward when you become unconscious, jarring the heck out of your neck, and reminding you to get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll just keep going, deep into sleep, and your practice time will be next to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the chair, you are facing infinity with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the bed, you&amp;#39;re facing slumber and loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take your pick.  Infinity and hard work, or unconsciousness and less effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t miss my analogy,  of &amp;quot;which way&amp;quot; you are facing.  Infinity or slumber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many places along those routes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the 4th gate, you&amp;#39;ll only need to turn your head, to enter another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really.  No kidding. I&amp;#39;ll have you jumping into a tea cup if you&amp;#39;ll follow my advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There really aren&amp;#39;t any techniques in sorcery, but at first you need some reason to practice, so you&amp;#39;re given a technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you choose the easy path (shades of Yoda there?), then modify the technique slightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to find a cozy \u201ccocoon\u201d to wrap yourself up in, while you do the technique. Try to always use the same position of your body. And over time, try to visualize what the &amp;quot;cocoon&amp;quot; looks like.  Even if it&amp;#39;s just the comforter on your bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to include the second attention in that.  Wikipedia suggests a heavy feeling, or blackness. Those are good.

Or if you became lucid in the dream because you were mortally wounded, that\u2019s perfect!  As long as you\u2019re dead, you can relax. Nothing in the dream can have any effect on you.

That was the trick. In the course of hooking you, he had to take liberties with the story line.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he made things up, but if you read my posting about making yourself a 3D fairy, you need to know 2 things.\n\nIt absolutely will work. But it won\u2019t go just like I said. A hell of a lot more will happen during your practice, and if you want to make a story out of it you have to leave that out.\n\nThat was Carlos\u2019 trick, to make the path seem clear.\n\nOnce he had over 100 students in private classes he told us to stop reading his books. He wanted us to develop our own understanding.\n\nRemember an important lesson. We want to be \u201cMen of Knowledge\u201d. Not sorcerers. Sorcery is just an alternate description of the world given to us so we can find the place in the middle which is common to both.\n\nThat place in the middle is technical.  It\u2019s the \u201chow to\u201d, of switching views.\n\nPut out of your mind that you\u2019re after a particular goal. It\u2019s the \u201chow to\u201d that you\u2019re learning.\n\nLearning also requires \u201cenergy\u201d. In the course of doing this you\u2019ll also learn about that. In fact, the \u201chow to\u201d becomes unnecessary if you have enough energy. But the \u201chow to\u201d can teach you to save it.\n\nWhat is energy, the way Carlos intended to use the word?\n\nIs it that well dressed tall, thin guy up on stage at a \u201csuccess\u201d seminar, with a wireless microphone and ear plugs on his head, telling you how to make more money than you\u2019ll ever want?\n\nYes!  I hate to admit it, that is energy.\n\nIs it also the high you get from jogging?\n\nI\u2019m not sure, but probably.\n\nIt\u2019s surely the high you get from tensegrity.\n\nCarlos emphasized one thing over all, in private classes.\n\nSaving energy. He\u2019d criticize us one day, by looking at our feet and commenting our energy had fallen.\n\nThen on another occasion, he\u2019d look out proudly over the crowd, and comment how well we were doing. He could see our energy level rising up from our toes, similar to a sugar coating on a doughnut. Someone had licked all of the sugar off, leaving the bare doughnut, except for the part they couldn\u2019t get at with their tongue. The bottom most part near our toes.\n\nCan you yourself *see* that? Yep. If you get to the 4th gate and cross it, you\u2019ll be able to *see* that too.\n\nNot as easily as you\u2019d like. Not in any way that\u2019s satisfying. You\u2019ll just look down, *see* it, and think, \u201cOh, I guess Carlos wasn\u2019t lying.\u201d\n\nBut you won\u2019t be thrilled. In fact, you have to toss the thrill out. Get rid of it. You have to not care about what things are or should be, to pass the 4th gate. It\u2019s the \u201cwhat they are\u201d, and \u201cwhat they should be\u201d that directs the assemblage point. And always back to your normal place. To venture out, you have to drop those.\n\nHow? This technique for reaching the first gate teaches you that. But you won\u2019t understand fully until you stop the world. That\u2019s also 4th gate level.\n\nWe need 2 things. Energy, and entry into dreaming directly from awake.\n\nIt\u2019s just too slow to try to learn lucid dreaming through coincidence. Coincidences that help you wake up inside a dream include someone else explaining it to you in an enthusiastic way, thus lending you their energy. That\u2019s why many report having successes the first night, after learning about it, but then never again. Or only one or two times a year.\n\nOther coincidences can be too complicated to figure out. Success after a long time trying to do something, bumping into a double being by accident, but especially GETTING LOTS AND LOTS OF SLEEP.\n\nIf you're very old, you have to have 12 hours of sleep to succeed at this.\n\nBut we can\u2019t afford to rely on coincidences and too much sleep!\n\nWe have to be successful one or two times a night, if we expect to pass the 4 gates.\n\nI\u2019m banned from reading the books, so my categorization of each gate and what you can do to exploit it, will vary slightly from Carlos.\n\nHe wanted it that way. I hope someone else comes along later and writes an entirely different (but proven) explanation of how to pass the gates.\n\nWe\u2019re going to pass this 1st gate by saving energy, learning about the assemblage point, and learning what the second attention feels like.\n\nI can\u2019t afford a story line for this. Reddit doesn\u2019t allow enough characters per post. I\u2019ll do an A and B part when needed, but some techniques can\u2019t be described in as much detail as they should be.\n\nHere\u2019s your main technique:\n\nSit in a chair with eyes closed. Find a comfortable chair with arms on the side in case of sleep paralysis. Make sure the light in the room is at least dimmed.\n\nFollow that little voice in your head. It\u2019s talking. Mostly complaining in all likelihood.\n\nIt has to go to sleep. But you have to remain awake.\n\nYou have 2 choices. Either force it off, as fiercely as you can (unpleasant but more effective), or relax it off.\n\nRelaxing it off is \u201ccheating\u201d, meaning, you look for something else to pay attention to. Something coming from the second attention.\n\nYou know that feeling if you meditate. It\u2019s sort of like \u201cbliss\u201d, but you don\u2019t actually have to have the bliss. It\u2019s what you see, when your eyes are closed and the darkness seems to change. It\u2019s still plain darkness, but it takes on some feeling of depth.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll see colors. That\u2019s great. Just watch them. And let that internal voice relax away. Gently try to reduce the number of words. As they reduce, try to notice how many seconds between words.\n\nWe aren\u2019t exactly trying to force it off, as long as we can feel something from the second attention. It\u2019ll be enough to pay attention to that, and gently let the internal dialogue reduce.\n\nIf you have a mantra, and have felt bliss in meditation, you can use that for a while, but still try to reduce the internal dialogue.  The mantra is a good substitute when you're upset, in pain,  or tired. If you don't have one, here:\n\nAing.\n\nRepeat it slowly.  Thank hippy flowers for that one.  I mean it.  Thank them.\n\nWhat\u2019s the feel of the second attention? If you woke up on a day when you don\u2019t have to go to work, and you\u2019re laying in bed realizing you can stay there longer, it\u2019s the \u201chigh\u201d or tingly feeling you have. It\u2019s cozy, blissful.  Call it the \u201csnooze alarm high\u201d.\n\nThere are many other ways to get that tingly feeling, but the main thing is it\u2019s different. It\u2019s somehow not like you normally feel. Colors are also good, depth, or hypnogogic images.\n\nThat\u2019s the second attention.  If you can watch and let yourself drift, you\u2019ll be creating a passage directly into dreaming. A conscious pathway. If you do this for 1 hour each day, you\u2019ll begin to *see* dreaming images. Just a little thing here and there. A light, a spinning thing.\n\nYou\u2019ll also feel a tingle running up your spine at times, or even get goosebumps. Or have a feeling of moving down, or falling. That\u2019s the assemblage point moving.\n\nPlay with the things you *see* coming from the second attention. If you *see* a light, roll your gaze and fan it. Make it brighter.  Blow into it. Figure out some way to make that light brighter. You can open a portal to the inorganic beings realm if you do that a bunch.  It only has to start spinning on its own, so that it can expand.\n\nIf you were exposed to Carlos' allies, they can meet you at the entrance.\n\nBut if you only see a dreaming image, of any kind, talk to it.\n\nDon't forget, we\u2019re trying to let that internal dialogue reduce. Keep letting it reduce. If you find yourself fuming over some social situation, that was the command to take an inventory. Something out there wants you to look inside. The problem is, you always look for the things that have you imprisoned here. Try to look at the second attention instead. If you get stuck and start fussing again for a long time, just remember to return to practicing.\n\nDon\u2019t worry! There\u2019s a trick built into all of this. Just trying is actually what we\u2019re after. You\u2019re *intending* *dreaming*.\n\nYou ***JUMPED***!\n\nWe're **already** sorcerers!  Didn't you get that?\n\nIf you can\u2019t see the second attention you have to do it the hard way. Absolutely force off any words. Stop that voice at all costs! You\u2019ll pass out, fall asleep, but you have to struggle by resuming the attempt.\n\nEventually you\u2019ll find a place in the middle. Some people build devices to hold their chin up, so that it doesn\u2019t dangle and hurt.\n\nKeep careful track of blacking out, and how long it takes you to realize it. Gently lift the head back up if it fell, and keep trying. When you can catch your chin just as it begins to fall, you\u2019re in the sweet spot. Look for tingling. That\u2019s the assemblage point moving.\n\nAnd let me warn you: sleep paralysis. You\u2019re conscious, but can\u2019t move. The prince of darkness might even be hovering over you.\n\nYou can roll. Just a little at the stomach. Roll yourself awake. Don\u2019t panic, or you\u2019ll pee. And remember, as long as you remain there, with all the nerves in your body on fire, you're rapidly learning to anchor your assemblage point.\n\nIt\u2019s just hard to take.\n\nYou\u2019ll know you are doing very well forcing silence  if you can figure out how many seconds between words. I don\u2019t care how many seconds you figure out. It could be 1 to 10 seconds at first.  As long as you understand what we\u2019re talking about, with \u201cthe internal dialogue\u201d, then you\u2019re doing good.\n\nIf you fail even this step, then you have homework. Go  on the web and read what Krishnamurti says the internal dialogue is, find westernized Zen masters who will talk,  and generally google until you understand.  Even Socrates has a thing or two to say about it.\n\nYou\u2019ll find some of that already in this subreddit. But until you're clear what's \u201cyou\u201d and what's not (the internal dialogue), you can\u2019t proceed using my methods.\n\nIn that case, resort to the only proven method from the lucidity institute. All day long, as often as you think of it, check to see if you are dreaming.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1577843215.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fcam0t3", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2A: 1st Gate of Dreaming (Boring yourself to death)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing that\u2019s important to know is, Carlos tricked you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hooked you with his books.

As long as you understand what we\u2019re talking about, with \u201cthe internal dialogue\u201d, then you\u2019re doing good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you fail even this step, then you have homework. Go  on the web and read what Krishnamurti says the internal dialogue is, find westernized Zen masters who will talk,  and generally google until you understand.  Even Socrates has a thing or two to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll find some of that already in this subreddit. But until you&amp;#39;re clear what&amp;#39;s \u201cyou\u201d and what&amp;#39;s not (the internal dialogue), you can\u2019t proceed using my methods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, resort to the only proven method from the lucidity institute. All day long, as often as you think of it, check to see if you are dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/fcam0t3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577571905.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_egkz4l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fcnlvj8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fclrwdy", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "The wall is merely a projection of our second attention, on something in the environment.\n\nYou could just as easily learn to gaze into crystal balls.\n\nI'll have to remember that, and teach Cholita to do it!\n\nCrystal balls and seances.

For this reason, the old shamans called them\u00a0inorganic beings.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I told you that it&amp;#39;s our twin world, so it&amp;#39;s intimately related to us.\u00a0&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_egkz4l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/fclm4w6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577751015.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "johbheb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_joh7gpr", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "You need to do a lot more studying.\n\nThere's no path to sorcery through lucid dreaming.\n\nNothing anywhere ever said that.

It\u2019s worth taking a look.\n\nHe\u2019s captured the perspective of some manifestations of the inorganic being\u2019s world in a few of his paintings.\n\nSpace is compressed.

Use Google Images to search for, \"Hieronymus Bosch\", check out a few, but there's a lot less nudity.   And no one is being tortured.\n\nChances are there\u2019s some water in the middle. You\u2019ll find inorganic beings stationed everywhere you look. There could be dozens of them, all engaged in some bizarre activity which gives an alien feeling.  It\u2019s soundless.\n\nTheir habitat is obviously hard dirt worn into little basins, with steps on which the beings can sit.  If you headed out to open country in the desert, you could find this kind of landscape where water runoff carves into the clay and dirt for millions of years.\n\nThe beings dress all kinds of extreme ways.  Some have shiny metal buckets for a hat, and some are turning cranks that control their lower body.  Every disturbing cartoon image you can imagine will be represented.  Even a jack in the box, with a human head.\n\nThey sort of sit in place, trying to lure you to come over and interact. On the surface, they don't seem to be all that interested in you.  They're moving rather slowly too.\n\nPerspective is so distorted you\u2019re afraid to walk towards them. The road you took behaved normally, but now you can\u2019t figure out how to walk into that mess. And could you get out?\n\nYou can pay attention to each entity, as if you were standing right next to it.\n\nIt\u2019s probably the realm that your scout came from, but you\u2019re not viewing it as it really is.\n\nYou\u2019re still interpreting it the same way you\u2019d interpret an inorganic being\u2019s collection of lights, to be something else.\n\nThey reflect back our own thoughts into shapes. And the perspective and the landscape are also projections of our own interpretations.\n\nYou can tell it\u2019s an inorganics being\u2019s realm by the \u201calien\u201d feeling you get.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to describe. But you\u2019ll know it when you feel it.  It's like \"dark energy\", but minus the energy part. It's like a luke warm wind blowing ripples onto your shirt, but you feel nothing and hear nothing.\n\nI had zoomed around until all I felt was boredom. Then I had the idea that maybe I needed to have other beings around, and ended up zipping to the entrance to the ultimate in entertaining activity.\n\nEach inorganic wants to interact. Faced with dozens of them peddling their wares, I was in the opposite situation.\n\nI was saturated with too much alien activity.  None of it was important, because there was too much of it.\n\nI had to start over.\n\nI became curious how far you could go with transforming dreaming entities, and turning them into sidekicks.\n\nAnd, yes, can you have sex with them?\n\nAbsolutely.  Pervert!!!\n\nJust say no.\n\nThe basic procedure for making sidekicks is as before. If you find a phantom you can turn it into whatever you like.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to worry if it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d, meaning, an actual inorganic.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. If you play around with one of the phantoms, the inorganics will take it over.\n\nI don\u2019t mean they zip into it while you watch. But the instant you turn away, they can replace it.  If you're fast, you'll notice it moved a foot or two without you seeing it move.\n\nMost likely is you'll never know, except that it tends to try to stand a little closer to you.\n\nYou can transform entire small groups for yourself, but don\u2019t expect the body count to remain the same.\n\nSmall dogs can be created too.\n\nOnce you engage in that type of activity, the dreaming phantoms seem to become a little smarter.  You're generating a new type of energy, and the inorganics take notice.\n\nI was once chased by a stack of ordinary wooden pallets, with wheels. Someone had put another pallet at an angle in the front, for a \u201cface\u201d, and it had 2 reigns attached so you could stand on it, and make it go like a horse.\n\nIt chased me around, despite my having sidekicks.  They just got out of the way.\n\nThe smarter the dreaming phantoms get, the more bizarre things are. That alien energy starts to permeate everything.\n\nBy the time you can do all this, you\u2019ll have forgotten about retaining lucidity. You\u2019ll be able to hold the dream for a half hour with no effort.\n\nAnd if you kept up your silence technique before sleeping, you\u2019ll find yourself entering directly into dreaming without losing consciousness.\n\nNot all the time. Forget about \u201cmastery\u201d of the gates. It\u2019s still hit or miss most of the time. And if you stop practicing, your skills fade away fast. 6 months of not practicing, and you\u2019ll be back to wishing you could find your hands at all.\n\nHere\u2019s some other things you can learn, at the second gate.\n\nIf you can fall asleep directly without losing consciousness, you might find yourself in a blackness. But with a feeling of space.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you went to bed or are still sitting in a chair.\n\nWhen you realize you are silent, and the view is blank but the second attention can be felt, you can think a single word, then return to silence.\n\nThis is Patanjali\u2019s technique. He has sutras (mental formulas) for just about any super power you could think of.\n\nYou think a word, then drop it.\n\nThe word produces echoes in the second attention. If you think, \u201cSpatula\u201d, a spatula will appear.\n\nIt will be floating right in front of you. Even with eyes closed, you can examine it closely. It might even rotate for you, so you can see all sides.\n\nStay away from thinking about sexual things. Sure, you can do that. But it's a waste of time.\n\nGo for something bigger. Think, Santa Monica.\n\nYou\u2019ll find yourself looking down at Santa Monica. Since it\u2019s an entire city, you have to be floating above it to see that.\n\nNow make it scroll. You can intend it to move, as if you were flying. Except that you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\n\nIt feels more like watching a tablet sitting on your lap,  and making the image pan along.\n\nIt\u2019s remote viewing.\n\nThe first thing people tend to ask on hearing that, is did you verify it?\n\nWe aren\u2019t trying to learn to do something specific and practical.\n\nThat\u2019s witchcraft.\n\nForget it. It\u2019s enough to have a view that looks perfectly real, and to be able to move along and watch the rest of the city go by.\n\nDon\u2019t verify stuff.\n\nCholita moved a dim sum plate with her eyes. That's good enough for all of us.  No verification beyond that is needed.\n\nJust learn to manipulate your awareness.\n\nYou can also learn to enter dreaming while awake. In this case, your eyes are closed.\n\nYou are forcing silence in the chair, or maybe you had a headache that day and decided to use the mantra.\n\nEither way, you\u2019ll occasionally find that you blanked out, opened your eyes and began to stare at the room, but without any thoughts.\n\nActually, what happened was your assemblage point jumped to a new position, and you lost consciousness for an instant. A fast movement causes a blank out period.\n\nWhen it refocused, you were placed into your dreaming body.\n\nGuess what?\n\nYour eyes are in fact still closed, despite seeing the room perfectly.\n\nNow, don\u2019t be an idiot like most people who practice meditation. They view this as a slightly cool effect, that you should just ignore.\n\nIt\u2019s almost not even worth mentioning to your fellow meditation buddies, in some systems.\n\nIn fact, YOU JUST ENTERED YOUR DREAMING BODY!\n\nWhile awake.  Shit!\n\nIf you don't believe it, move your little finger.  You'll be pulled back to your real body.\n\nStop moving and you'll resume being in the dreaming body.\n\nYour dreaming body is sitting on a dreaming chair.\n\nThink it though the wall, like a go-cart.\n\nYou\u2019ll pass right through, and keep going down the road.\n\nLean on the left arm to go left, on the right to go right.\n\nOnce you get far away you can get out, and you\u2019ve just entered lucid dreaming directly from waking.\n\nThere\u2019s an infinite number of things you can learn at the second gate, but it always leads to one inevitable result.\n\nThe third gate.\n\nBut it's not going to be what you expected!", "edited": 1577845720.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fcipasj", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 3B:  2nd Gate of Dreaming (Conquering boredom)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Kush has an art gallery in Laguna Beach.

If you find a phantom you can turn it into whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s no need to worry if it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d, meaning, an actual inorganic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t matter. If you play around with one of the phantoms, the inorganics will take it over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t mean they zip into it while you watch. But the instant you turn away, they can replace it.  If you&amp;#39;re fast, you&amp;#39;ll notice it moved a foot or two without you seeing it move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most likely is you&amp;#39;ll never know, except that it tends to try to stand a little closer to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can transform entire small groups for yourself, but don\u2019t expect the body count to remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Small dogs can be created too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you engage in that type of activity, the dreaming phantoms seem to become a little smarter.  You&amp;#39;re generating a new type of energy, and the inorganics take notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was once chased by a stack of ordinary wooden pallets, with wheels. Someone had put another pallet at an angle in the front, for a \u201cface\u201d, and it had 2 reigns attached so you could stand on it, and make it go like a horse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It chased me around, despite my having sidekicks.  They just got out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The smarter the dreaming phantoms get, the more bizarre things are. That alien energy starts to permeate everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time you can do all this, you\u2019ll have forgotten about retaining lucidity. You\u2019ll be able to hold the dream for a half hour with no effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you kept up your silence technique before sleeping, you\u2019ll find yourself entering directly into dreaming without losing consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all the time. Forget about \u201cmastery\u201d of the gates. It\u2019s still hit or miss most of the time. And if you stop practicing, your skills fade away fast. 6 months of not practicing, and you\u2019ll be back to wishing you could find your hands at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s some other things you can learn, at the second gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can fall asleep directly without losing consciousness, you might find yourself in a blackness. But with a feeling of space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t matter if you went to bed or are still sitting in a chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you realize you are silent, and the view is blank but the second attention can be felt, you can think a single word, then return to silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is Patanjali\u2019s technique. He has sutras (mental formulas) for just about any super power you could think of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think a word, then drop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word produces echoes in the second attention. If you think, \u201cSpatula\u201d, a spatula will appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will be floating right in front of you. Even with eyes closed, you can examine it closely. It might even rotate for you, so you can see all sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay away from thinking about sexual things. Sure, you can do that. But it&amp;#39;s a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go for something bigger. Think, Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll find yourself looking down at Santa Monica. Since it\u2019s an entire city, you have to be floating above it to see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now make it scroll. You can intend it to move, as if you were flying. Except that you\u2019re sitting in a chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels more like watching a tablet sitting on your lap,  and making the image pan along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s remote viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing people tend to ask on hearing that, is did you verify it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren\u2019t trying to learn to do something specific and practical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget it. It\u2019s enough to have a view that looks perfectly real, and to be able to move along and watch the rest of the city go by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t verify stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita moved a dim sum plate with her eyes. That&amp;#39;s good enough for all of us.  No verification beyond that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just learn to manipulate your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also learn to enter dreaming while awake. In this case, your eyes are closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are forcing silence in the chair, or maybe you had a headache that day and decided to use the mantra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, you\u2019ll occasionally find that you blanked out, opened your eyes and began to stare at the room, but without any thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, what happened was your assemblage point jumped to a new position, and you lost consciousness for an instant. A fast movement causes a blank out period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it refocused, you were placed into your dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guess what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your eyes are in fact still closed, despite seeing the room perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, don\u2019t be an idiot like most people who practice meditation. They view this as a slightly cool effect, that you should just ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s almost not even worth mentioning to your fellow meditation buddies, in some systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, YOU JUST ENTERED YOUR DREAMING BODY!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While awake.  Shit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t believe it, move your little finger.  You&amp;#39;ll be pulled back to your real body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop moving and you&amp;#39;ll resume being in the dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your dreaming body is sitting on a dreaming chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think it though the wall, like a go-cart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll pass right through, and keep going down the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lean on the left arm to go left, on the right to go right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you get far away you can get out, and you\u2019ve just entered lucid dreaming directly from waking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s an infinite number of things you can learn at the second gate, but it always leads to one inevitable result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not going to be what you expected!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award":

It is.\n\nHow do you know the difference?\n\nThey \u201cfeel\u201d different. Your dreaming double feels like your long-lost prankster friend. He\u2019s athletic, spry, confident, and although you wouldn\u2019t trust him with your back turned, he\u2019d be unlikely to do worse than give you a wedgie.\n\nCholita\u2019s dreaming double is rather friendly, compared to the real thing. In that case, I\u2019d trust it more than I do Cholita.\n\nShe\u2019s fully capable of (and has) smacking me on the face at random, if I turn away from her.\n\nBut in shared dreaming, she\u2019s merely busy and fast.\n\nAn inorganic being feels like darkness, the wind, electricity, and blankness. If you got a very creepy feeling as a child, riding on the \u201cscary rides\u201d at the carnival, you know that feeling.\n\nThey have no thoughts. You can feel it. It\u2019s just blankness staring back at you.\n\nI don\u2019t have to teach you how to wrestle an inorganic being. If you find yourself in that position, you\u2019ll have no choice.\n\nThey simply move in on you slowly, feeding on your fright, and you have to push them back to stop it.\n\nWhen your fear is gone, they relax. You\u2019ve won. They\u2019re now accepting your acknowledgement as energy enough. As you pay attention to them as a \u201creal\u201d thing, your assemblage point is pulled further and further into the second attention.\n\nThey like that!\n\nThey\u2019ll become companions if you learn to summon them any time you like, through waking dreaming. Their goal seems to be to teach you, although they probably do that to get more energy from you.\n\nYou might come to realize, when they interfere in dreaming, it\u2019s often to teach. Or lure. It\u2019s hard to say which.\n\nThat first time I went to sleep inside a dream, I pretty much had no choice because of their actions.  They pinned me in, and threatened to harm me. I had to escape by going to sleep inside the dream.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly nice to dream of a copy of your own living space. It has a very unique energy to it.\n\nBut are you really there? If you move a book, will it still be moved?\n\nWhen Cholita first arrived to live with me (off and on), I wanted very badly to get her to do the flying technique for me.\n\nI\u2019m loathe to pee in my own hands. But Cholita doesn\u2019t mind.\n\nIn dreaming, I traveled to work, where the ceiling in the warehouse is very high.\n\nIt was absolutely real. A perfect copy of my business.\n\nExcept that, the flying technique worked. At home, it had only produced red lines of light.\n\nI leaped as high as I could, and put an X on some dusty boxes, so far up you needed a ladder to even see them.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t there when I checked. Or if it was, not where I remembered putting it.\n\nSo can the dreaming body affect real objects, in the real world?\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nBut instead, you can learn to move objects just by looking at them.\n\nIsn\u2019t that cool enough for now?\n\nYou do it by bringing the 3rd gate into your bedroom, while you are awake.\n\nYou don\u2019t wake up in a dream of your own bedroom.\n\nYou dream in the actual bedroom. Awake.\n\nIf you want to see yourself sleeping just look down. There\u2019s your legs. And if you are doing *dreaming* *awake*, you are in fact asleep.\n\nYou\u2019re dreaming, looking at yourself sleeping.\n\n3rd gate bypassed!\n\nIt was too much trouble anyway.\n\nHow do you know you\u2019re dreaming, a new person might ask?\n\nIdeally, this is all done in a perfectly dark room. There should be no way to see anything at all.\n\nIf you scan the windows, which are covered, or look under the door, which has a towel blocking the bottom, you should find absolutely no spots of light.\n\nIf those bright little leaks aren\u2019t there, your room can\u2019t have any light.\n\nIf you lift your hand, you should see nothing.\n\nNow, just shut off that internal dialogue.\n\nAfter an hour or two, look down. If you can see your legs, you\u2019re dreaming!\n\nBut why doesn\u2019t it feel different?\n\nIt will! You\u2019ll notice, minor pains and aches are gone. If you have asthma, it\u2019s gone. Your breathing is perfect.\n\nI mean perfect, as in \u201cideal breath\u201d.  Carlos gave us a demonstration of this in class, to clue us in on how to detect heightened awareness just by watching someone breathe.\n\nAnd you aren\u2019t doing the breathing. It\u2019s automatic. Only the stomach moves in and out. Each breath has that happy feeling you get at the end of a yawn.\n\nYou also feel bliss. In fact, it sort of feels like what you expected, \u201cenlightenment\u201d,  would feel like.\n\nIt\u2019s not permanent, so don\u2019t start planning your new Rinpoche nickname.\n\nYou\u2019re simply *dreaming awake*.\n\nYou\u2019re AT the third gate.  And you can do it any night you want!\n\nNo more random chance.\n\nI\u2019m risking annoying the purists with all this.\n\n**This isn\u2019t what Carlos wrote!!!**\n\nIf you\u2019re ***really*** dreaming, can you leave your bedroom and walk around in the dream?\n\nYes!\n\nBut you aren\u2019t limited to a phantom copy of this world. When you reach dreaming from silence, the worlds are more \u201creal\u201d.\n\nIf you enter one, you never have to worry about lucidity or time. You\u2019re awake. You never lost lucidity.\n\nYou can enter the worlds by jumping through portals, by surrounding yourself with one and walking off into it, or you can bring activity from other worlds, right into your room, so you can watch it in safety.\n\nYou can even be half in your bedroom, and half in the realm of the inorganic beings.\n\nThat\u2019s how you learn to move objects by merely looking at them. Get the inorganic beings realm on the walls of your room, and play with as many of them as you can.\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t you be in your dreaming body, looking at yourself sleeping on the bed?\n\nI guess you could technically argue you have to have that, except that you can manifest whoever you like.\n\nSpirits, demons, a girl in a Japanese Sailor Suit, a copy of yourself.\n\nJust smash some of that purple light you see floating around, and you can produce whatever shape you like.\n\nMake a copy of yourself in bed if you like.  Or lie down and look at your toes, plain to see, in total darkness.\n\nBut it seems rather pointless.  No reason to obsess over \"*the law*\" of the Gates, from Art of Dreaming.\n\nSo then, how are you going to ***solve***  the third gate this way?\n\nRemember, you can **arrive** at the 3rd gate, **solve** it, and **cross** it. It\u2019s worth putting this up again, so we can examine it like a real lawyer:\n\nAbout the 3rd gate Wikipedia says, *\u201c****Arrived*** *at when one dreams of looking at oneself.* ***Solved*** *when the dreaming and physical bodies* ***become one****.* ***Crossed*** *when one is able to control the dreaming body in the physical realm and move around at ease.\u201d*\n\nYou\u2019re dreaming, and looking at your own legs. You ***arrived***.\n\nYou already ***solved*** it when you looked down and actually saw them, despite the fact that the room has absolutely no light.\n\nThat\u2019s your dreaming body.  Pinch your leg. If it hurts, your dreaming body and your physical body have \u201c***become one***\u201d.\n\nThen how to ***cross*** it using waking dreaming?\n\nFrom a lawyers\u2019 point of view, of course. The purists won\u2019t like it.\n\nGo to the bathroom.  That's what a lawyer would do.\n\nYou just moved around with \"ease\", using your dreaming body in the physical realm.\n\nFrom here, it only gets weirder and more fun!\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1577831674.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fcoc1ht", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 4B: 3rd Gate of Dreaming (Which bedroom is the real bedroom?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who have read posts in here for the last few months might be wondering at this point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A black inorganic being?!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn\u2019t that the description some have for their dreaming double?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well yea.

Or if it was, not where I remembered putting it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So can the dreaming body affect real objects, in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead, you can learn to move objects just by looking at them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn\u2019t that cool enough for now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do it by bringing the 3rd gate into your bedroom, while you are awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don\u2019t wake up in a dream of your own bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You dream in the actual bedroom. Awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see yourself sleeping just look down. There\u2019s your legs. And if you are doing &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;awake&lt;/em&gt;, you are in fact asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re dreaming, looking at yourself sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd gate bypassed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was too much trouble anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you know you\u2019re dreaming, a new person might ask?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this is all done in a perfectly dark room. There should be no way to see anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you scan the windows, which are covered, or look under the door, which has a towel blocking the bottom, you should find absolutely no spots of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If those bright little leaks aren\u2019t there, your room can\u2019t have any light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you lift your hand, you should see nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, just shut off that internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After an hour or two, look down. If you can see your legs, you\u2019re dreaming!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why doesn\u2019t it feel different?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will! You\u2019ll notice, minor pains and aches are gone. If you have asthma, it\u2019s gone. Your breathing is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean perfect, as in \u201cideal breath\u201d.  Carlos gave us a demonstration of this in class, to clue us in on how to detect heightened awareness just by watching someone breathe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you aren\u2019t doing the breathing. It\u2019s automatic. Only the stomach moves in and out. Each breath has that happy feeling you get at the end of a yawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also feel bliss. In fact, it sort of feels like what you expected, \u201cenlightenment\u201d,  would feel like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not permanent, so don\u2019t start planning your new Rinpoche nickname.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re simply &lt;em&gt;dreaming awake&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re AT the third gate.  And you can do it any night you want!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more random chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m risking annoying the purists with all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn\u2019t what Carlos wrote!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; dreaming, can you leave your bedroom and walk around in the dream?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you aren\u2019t limited to a phantom copy of this world. When you reach dreaming from silence, the worlds are more \u201creal\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you enter one, you never have to worry about lucidity or time. You\u2019re awake. You never lost lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can enter the worlds by jumping through portals, by surrounding yourself with one and walking off into it, or you can bring activity from other worlds, right into your room, so you can watch it in safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even be half in your bedroom, and half in the realm of the inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s how you learn to move objects by merely looking at them. Get the inorganic beings realm on the walls of your room, and play with as many of them as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But shouldn\u2019t you be in your dreaming body, looking at yourself sleeping on the bed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you could technically argue you have to have that, except that you can manifest whoever you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spirits, demons, a girl in a Japanese Sailor Suit, a copy of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just smash some of that purple light you see floating around, and you can produce whatever shape you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make a copy of yourself in bed if you like.  Or lie down and look at your toes, plain to see, in total darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it seems rather pointless.  No reason to obsess over &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;the law&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; of the Gates, from Art of Dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then, how are you going to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;solve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  the third gate this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, you can &lt;strong&gt;arrive&lt;/strong&gt; at the 3rd gate, &lt;strong&gt;solve&lt;/strong&gt; it, and &lt;strong&gt;cross&lt;/strong&gt; it. It\u2019s worth putting this up again, so we can examine it like a real lawyer:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the 3rd gate Wikipedia says, &lt;em&gt;\u201c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrived&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;at when one dreams of looking at oneself.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;when the dreaming and physical bodies&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;become one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crossed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;when one is able to control the dreaming body in the physical realm and move around at ease.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re dreaming, and looking at your own legs. You &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;arrived&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You already &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;solved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it when you looked down and actually saw them, despite the fact that the room has absolutely no light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s your dreaming body.  Pinch your leg. If it hurts, your dreaming body and your physical body have \u201c&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;become one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then how to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it using waking dreaming?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a lawyers\u2019 point of view, of course. The purists won\u2019t like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to the bathroom.  That&amp;#39;s what a lawyer would do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just moved around with &amp;quot;ease&amp;quot;, using your dreaming body in the physical realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From here, it only gets weirder and more fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/fcoc1ht/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577828567.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_egkz4l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fcxyq1y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1578072357.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fcvanlb", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I was  using this technique last night, just to see if there was anything else I ought to say about it.\n\nUnderstand this:  There are phantoms in dreams, and we all know how those behave.\n\nThere are hypnogogic images you can see while awake, and manipulate into beings you can be friends with.

Make a dark bedroom. Aluminum duct tape is good. It must be absolutely dark, and you must be able to walk around in it, to position yourself next to a specific dream. The larger the room, the more dreams you can intercept. Even LEDs on electronics must be covered. If you can look around and find a bright spot of light on a window or door, you\u2019ll be handicapped.\n\n2). Set up some pillows at the head of the bed where you can sit. It\u2019s ok to lean against the headboard. Sitting position isn\u2019t important, but it\u2019s good to be able to bend over and get your forehead as close to your toes as possible. It stirs up energy.\n\n3). Sit up on the bed with your eyes open, and force yourself silent. All internal dialogue must be removed. This is true for the entire remainder of the procedure. When you can be silent for at least 30 seconds, it\u2019s time to get up. It\u2019s also time to get up if you feel sleepy.\n\nRemember that even if you get fully silent and can hold it, the universe issues a command to take an inventory from time to time. Notice that. Your internal dialogue will try to resume. You must drop it the instant you notice that\u2019s happening. If you\u2019ve found details in the darkness, focus on those and take the inventory there.\n\n4). Get up and walk around, looking for colors and lines of light. Look on all surfaces for the lines, and gaze high towards the ceiling, looking for puffs of color. Once in a while, bend yourself back so that your spine is heavily bent. Turn your head to look all around, bending at the waist.  You're \"redeploying\" energy.  Eventually, doing this technique, you'll come to realize that moving any part of the body redeploys energy, and that Tensegrity is inevitable.\n\nAnd don\u2019t think about why any of that works. There\u2019s often a mechanical explanation at this point. But later on, no one will be able to explain what you learn to do.\n\nAn example: I was bending backwards last night, and saw a huge collection of yellow lights above me. Everyone is familiar with this, and we say you got \"light headed\" or you \"saw stars\".\n\nI was thinking the same thing, but I kept watching it, instead of panicking and thinking I had to sit down fast, or pass out.\n\nWhen I finally sat, the collection of lights drifted down slowly, until I was literally facing it, in a normal sitting position.\n\nA weird man emerged from it.\n\nSo don't discount \"physical effects\". That might just be our society's excuse for why we should ignore that thing, and keep magic away.  Just try asking the eye doctor about weird lights. He'll never entertain it might be something non-physical. (Unless he's Asian or Hindu).\n\n5). If you can\u2019t see colors or lines, you have to keep it up for as long as you can, hopefully at least 2 hours. It takes 1 hour for beginners to see colors in perfect darkness, even if they\u2019ve done that many times before. When you find colors, \u201cscoop\u201d them with your hand, and apply to the energy vortexes mentioned in Carlos\u2019 tensegrity book. Try to observe what happens to puffs of color placed over a vortex, and puffs merely placed onto your thigh. Also scoop some towards the spot 1.5 feet from the center of your belly button and your crotch, and 4 inches to the right. That\u2019s the assemblage point of the second attention. If you keep focusing only on the colors, and forcing all thoughts out, your breathing will eventually change. It\u2019ll become slow, automatic, and only the stomach will move.\n\nYour minor aches and pains, and even asthma, will go away. You'll feel \"bliss\".\n\nYou\u2019re sleepwalking!  But feel free to do any tensegrity you like, as long as you can sustain the automatic breathing.  The dreaming moves from Westwood are promising in this situation.  I like the second one, with palms down in front and back. It never fails, so far, to cause a visible disturbance in the air, and to summon hypnogogic images after a while.\n\n6). Heightened awareness alone won\u2019t let you intercept dreaming *intent*. You need to be in a fog made from light.  It's needed to help focus *intent* on specific spots in the room.\n\nTo help extend the colors, look closely at flat surfaces for lines made out of light. Crawl around looking at them on the floor, and on the bed.\n\nThat's the \"finding your spot\" technique!  Don Juan taught Carlos all he needed to know, the first day.\n\nA real sorcerer would do that, in case they might never meet up again.  At least, from the vantage point of *intent*,  he gave them a chance.\n\nReturn to sitting on the pillows. Watch the bedroom wall in front of you, to see what the colors do. Wave your hand in front of your eyes, and try to detect \u201cdark waves\u201d.  Do more scooping towards the assemblage point of the second attention. Wiggle your fingers there once in a while, looking for those dark waves.\n\n7).  When the colors and lines have formed a virtual surface in front of you, which Carlos called, \u201cthe wall\u201d, gaze at it in silence and try to extend it all around you, on all 4 bedroom walls. But don\u2019t turn yourself around too hard, to check the one behind you. That\u2019ll redeploy too much energy and alter the process.\n\n8). When the colors and lines are obvious on all bedroom walls, look for details to emerge. I typically see them first nearer to the floor. When you see some details, such as vague blurry trees or buildings in the distance, CUT THAT OUT.  You\u2019ll assemble another world if you keep that up. That\u2019s not the *intent* we\u2019re after. We want the fog of *intent*, instead.\n\n9). Now the hard part.  Gaze at the colors all around you, without moving your head. Identify any images in your mind. Arguments, people, bills, worries. You must have no internal dialogue at this point, but that\u2019s not enough.\n\nYou must get rid of those images too, but only while gazing at the lights in general.  If you let your focus go inside, you\u2019ll accidentally stop the world, and you won\u2019t end up making this technique work during that session. You\u2019ll be too excited to continue.\n\nYou must *intend* to fill the room with light, not just to have it on your walls. But you don\u2019t do that by thinking. You do it with your gaze.\n\n10). When you have all images and all internal dialogue removed, you\u2019re right on the edge. But you need 1 more thing. You must reach a state of perfect innocence.\n\nYou must not care in any way what you are looking at. You have no opinion about it. Your double take mechanism, the one people use to shake off things they\u2019re seeing, which they\u2019ve been taught not to see, must go.\n\nIt\u2019s a foreign installation, composed of worry and self-pity. Toss it out. You aren't a baby anymore. You don't need to struggle to keep up.\n\nWhen you succeed, the room will be filled with the magic of *intent*. The lights will indeed fill the room with a fog of sorts. I\u2019ve seen it as an even mist, as bars of purple color stretching in different directions, and I\u2019ve seen it as thousands of floating lights, both small and large.  Some might even be called, \"orbs\".\n\nThere\u2019s where you can intercept the *intent* of dreamers. In those details which fill the room with activity.\n\nGaze around carefully, moving your head slowly left and right, the same way you do in recapitulation.\n\nYou have a \u201cbeam\u201d in the middle. Use it to find anything that stands out, no matter how vague. The beam will light up wherever it's pointed.  Just a little that is.\n\nThere on the right, you see an intersection of lights, that seems to form a focal point.\n\nGaze at it to see if it has more information.  It could be anywhere in the room however, this is just an example.\n\nEventually a person will materialize, engaged in some activity. They\u2019ll be associated with that part of the room. You can look away, then look back, and find them still there, on that spot, doing whatever it is they are dreaming about.\n\nIf they notice you, they\u2019ll likely leave. So don\u2019t disturb them at first. We\u2019re trying for multiple dreams.\n\nWhen you can form at least 2 dreams at a time, and they remain where they should in the room, which you can verify with your gaze, get up.\n\nSit on the edge of the bed, near the right side and the right wall. Continue to look for dreamers.\n\nChances are the next one will show up at your side. Close to you. At first you\u2019ll only detect a vague smoke, or that the fog on your left is somehow brighter. And you\u2019ll be in doubt, of course! That\u2019s always the case in the beginning.\n\nFeeling silly, gaze into the vague \u201cdifference\u201d. You\u2019ll see a few more details. Maybe the outline of a head.\n\nWhen enough details form so that you are SURE that\u2019s a head, the rest of the body will fill itself in. The dreaming scene will even start to solidify, perhaps no more than 3 feet around the person.\n\nIf it\u2019s someone you know, you\u2019ll completely recognize them. You\u2019ll even discover the \u201cessence\u201d of parts of that person.\n\nWith Cholita, it\u2019s her hair. It\u2019s so Cholita. There\u2019s nothing more you can say about it, except it\u2019s \u201cher\u201d.\n\nNow, according to Josefina, you just need to grab them.\n\nThe last time I tried that, Cholita\u2019s dreaming body noticed me, she glared at me in anger, and walked away so fast, I couldn\u2019t keep up. I walked past the bedroom wall without realizing it, noticed I lost her in a forest,  then returned to the bed like an idiot.\n\nI still can\u2019t explain how I walked through that wall. But I guess it\u2019s no weirder than jumping into a dreaming portal seen on the wall in front of the bed. That\u2019s another thing you can learn to do with this technique.\n\nEdited three times", "edited": 1578277781.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fcvanlb", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 5C: 4th Gate of Dreaming (The \u201chow to\u201d)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1). Make a dark bedroom. Aluminum duct tape is good. It must be absolutely dark, and you must be able to walk around in it, to position yourself next to a specific dream. The larger the room, the more dreams you can intercept. Even LEDs on electronics must be covered. If you can look around and find a bright spot of light on a window or door, you\u2019ll be handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2). Set up some pillows at the head of the bed where you can sit. It\u2019s ok to lean against the headboard. Sitting position isn\u2019t important, but it\u2019s good to be able to bend over and get your forehead as close to your toes as possible. It stirs up energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3). Sit up on the bed with your eyes open, and force yourself silent. All internal dialogue must be removed. This is true for the entire remainder of the procedure. When you can be silent for at least 30 seconds, it\u2019s time to get up. It\u2019s also time to get up if you feel sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that even if you get fully silent and can hold it, the universe issues a command to take an inventory from time to time. Notice that. Your internal dialogue will try to resume. You must drop it the instant you notice that\u2019s happening. If you\u2019ve found details in the darkness, focus on those and take the inventory there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4). Get up and walk around, looking for colors and lines of light. Look on all surfaces for the lines, and gaze high towards the ceiling, looking for puffs of color. Once in a while, bend yourself back so that your spine is heavily bent. Turn your head to look all around, bending at the waist.  You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;redeploying&amp;quot; energy.  Eventually, doing this technique, you&amp;#39;ll come to realize that moving any part of the body redeploys energy, and that Tensegrity is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don\u2019t think about why any of that works. There\u2019s often a mechanical explanation at this point. But later on, no one will be able to explain what you learn to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example: I was bending backwards last night, and saw a huge collection of yellow lights above me. Everyone is familiar with this, and we say you got &amp;quot;light headed&amp;quot; or you &amp;quot;saw stars&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking the same thing, but I kept watching it, instead of panicking and thinking I had to sit down fast, or pass out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finally sat, the collection of lights drifted down slowly, until I was literally facing it, in a normal sitting position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A weird man emerged from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t discount &amp;quot;physical effects&amp;quot;. That might just be our society&amp;#39;s excuse for why we should ignore that thing, and keep magic away.  Just try asking the eye doctor about weird lights. He&amp;#39;ll never entertain it might be something non-physical. (Unless he&amp;#39;s Asian or Hindu).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5). If you can\u2019t see colors or lines, you have to keep it up for as long as you can, hopefully at least 2 hours. It takes 1 hour for beginners to see colors in perfect darkness, even if they\u2019ve done that many times before. When you find colors, \u201cscoop\u201d them with your hand, and apply to the energy vortexes mentioned in Carlos\u2019 tensegrity book. Try to observe what happens to puffs of color placed over a vortex, and puffs merely placed onto your thigh. Also scoop some towards the spot 1.5 feet from the center of your belly button and your crotch, and 4 inches to the right. That\u2019s the assemblage point of the second attention. If you keep focusing only on the colors, and forcing all thoughts out, your breathing will eventually change. It\u2019ll become slow, automatic, and only the stomach will move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your minor aches and pains, and even asthma, will go away. You&amp;#39;ll feel &amp;quot;bliss&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re sleepwalking!  But feel free to do any tensegrity you like, as long as you can sustain the automatic breathing.  The dreaming moves from Westwood are promising in this situation.  I like the second one, with palms down in front and back. It never fails, so far, to cause a visible disturbance in the air, and to summon hypnogogic images after a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6). Heightened awareness alone won\u2019t let you intercept dreaming &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;. You need to be in a fog made from light.  It&amp;#39;s needed to help focus &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; on specific spots in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help extend the colors, look closely at flat surfaces for lines made out of light. Crawl around looking at them on the floor, and on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;finding your spot&amp;quot; technique!  Don Juan taught Carlos all he needed to know, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A real sorcerer would do that, in case they might never meet up again.  At least, from the vantage point of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;,  he gave them a chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Return to sitting on the pillows. Watch the bedroom wall in front of you, to see what the colors do. Wave your hand in front of your eyes, and try to detect \u201cdark waves\u201d.  Do more scooping towards the assemblage point of the second attention. Wiggle your fingers there once in a while, looking for those dark waves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7).  When the colors and lines have formed a virtual surface in front of you, which Carlos called, \u201cthe wall\u201d, gaze at it in silence and try to extend it all around you, on all 4 bedroom walls. But don\u2019t turn yourself around too hard, to check the one behind you. That\u2019ll redeploy too much energy and alter the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8). When the colors and lines are obvious on all bedroom walls, look for details to emerge. I typically see them first nearer to the floor. When you see some details, such as vague blurry trees or buildings in the distance, CUT THAT OUT.  You\u2019ll assemble another world if you keep that up. That\u2019s not the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; we\u2019re after. We want the fog of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9). Now the hard part.  Gaze at the colors all around you, without moving your head. Identify any images in your mind. Arguments, people, bills, worries. You must have no internal dialogue at this point, but that\u2019s not enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must get rid of those images too, but only while gazing at the lights in general.  If you let your focus go inside, you\u2019ll accidentally stop the world, and you won\u2019t end up making this technique work during that session. You\u2019ll be too excited to continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must &lt;em&gt;intend&lt;/em&gt; to fill the room with light, not just to have it on your walls. But you don\u2019t do that by thinking. You do it with your gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10). When you have all images and all internal dialogue removed, you\u2019re right on the edge.

Like  everything  else.&amp;quot;  She pointed  all  around  her.  &amp;quot;There  is  no  way  to  tell  how  it  happens,  but  it  does.  Remember  always what  I&amp;#39;ve  told you:  this  is  the  mystery of  intending in the  second attention.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To  fend  off  my  worries,  I  began  to  look  around.  If  this  was  a  dream,  as  I  believed  it  was,  there was  a  way  to  prove  or  disprove  it.  I  pointed  my  finger  at  the  houses,  at  the  church,  at  the pavement  in  the  street.  I  pointed  at  people.  I  pointed  at  everything.  Daringly,  I  even  grabbed  a couple  of  people,  whom  I  seemed  to  scare  considerably.  I  felt  their  mass.  They  were  as  real  as anything  I  consider  real,  except  that  they  did  not  generate  energy.  Nothing  in  that  town  generated energy. Everything seemed real  and normal, yet  it  was  a  dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  turned to the  woman, who was  holding on to my arm, and questioned her  about  it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We  are  dreaming,&amp;quot;  she  said in her  raspy voice  and giggled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But  how  can people  and things  around us  to be  so real, so three-dimensional?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The  mystery  of  intending  in  the  second  attention!&amp;quot;  she  exclaimed  reverently.  &amp;quot;Those  people out  there  are  so real  that  they even have  thoughts.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_egkz4l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/fcuxhru/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577990499.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1577990499.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fcuo0mq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fcu346m", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I tried to search for village to figure out why I thought it was Clara, but the searchable pdf doesn't seem to search very well.\n\nThat village is kind of key to understanding some aspects of intent.\n\nFor example, La Gorda saw don Juan's allies as big threatening indian men.

One has to have gathered enough strength into the dreaming body through the previous gates in order to travel to other people's dreams.\u201d\n\nThere are 2 things of interest to me there.\n\n\u201cintended dream reality\u201d.\n\nBingo! That tells you how to do it. At least, by my method.\n\nI have a problem with the word \u201ctravel\u201d, in there. I find it to be unnecessary. They\u2019ll travel to you.\n\nEmilito showed us that, in Carlos\u2019 books:\n\n\u201cThe nagual Julian recommended that people like me should never have sex; this way we can store the little energy we have. He said the same thing to Silvio Manuel and to Emilito. He *saw* that the others had enough energy. They were not the result of bored sex. He told them that they could do anything they wanted with their sexual energy\u2026\u201d\n\nOops.\n\nSomeone has been asking about that.\n\nI guess I got obsessed when I read that it\u2019s ok to do what you want as long as it feels good.\n\nI was just searching the pdf for \"Emilito\" by mistake, and ran across that.\n\nBut where\u2019s that real quote about shared dreaming?\n\nTurns out, it was Josefina and Eligio snatching La Gorda. It\u2019s here:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u201cWhat kind *of dreaming* do you do, Josefina?\" I asked.\n\n\"The only kind I know,\" she snapped.\n\n\"I've told you how I do mine,\" I said. \"Now tell me how you do yours.\"\n\n\"I close my eyes and I see this wall,\" she said. \"It's like a wall of fog. Eligio waits for me there. He takes me through it and shows me things, I suppose. I don't know what we do, but we do things together. Then he brings me back to the wall and lets me go. And I come back and forget what I've seen.\"\n\n\"How did you happen to go with la Gorda?\" I asked.\n\n\"Eligio told me to get her,\" she said. \"The two of us waited for la Gorda, and when she went into her *dreaming* we snatched her and pulled her behind that wall. We've done that twice.\"\n\n\"How did you snatch her?\" I asked,\n\n\"I don't know!\" Josefina replied. \"But I'll wait for you and when you do your *dreaming* I'll snatch you and then you'll know.\"\n\n\"Can you snatch anyone?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" she said, smiling. \"But I don't do it because it's a waste.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like there are any procedures for shared dreaming. At some point, when you get skilled enough at dreaming, you simply discover you can do that.\n\nYou pick up the trail of their *intent*.\n\nCholita introduced me to it. A few days after moving in to live with me (but now she\u2019s gone homeless again), a purple fog replaced the patches of color I find in darkness.\n\nCholita emerged from it. As long as she\u2019s in my house, I can often find her dreaming body at night.\n\nWhen she\u2019s gone, she simply doesn\u2019t show up.\n\nOne night a while back, when she\u2019d run away again, I found her. She walked right through the door, into my dark bedroom.\n\nI thought I\u2019d proven that her presence in the house was unnecessary, and that she might show up no matter where she was sleeping.\n\nBut a couple of hours later she slammed her bedroom door, and went into the bathroom.\n\nI realized she\u2019d snuck back into the house, quietly. She\u2019d been sleeping in her room all along.\n\nIn her case, proximity is an aid to intercepting her *dreaming intent.*\n\nUsing silence to intercept *intent* works for all kinds of things, but especially shared dreaming.\n\nThat Wikipedia description of the 4th gate also says, \u201cOne has to have gathered enough strength into the dreaming body through the previous gates..\u201d\n\nI kind of cheated on the 3rd gate (so far). I never remembered to turn around and check to see if I was still sleeping.\n\nI really couldn\u2019t even do that now, unless I decided to give up waking dreaming and go back to hit and miss lucid dreaming.\n\nAnd yet, I do seem to have managed to learn to pick up the *intent* of other dreamers.\n\nThat sort of shows us that it\u2019s ok to mess up the order of the steps outlined in the Art of Dreaming.\n\nIn fact, you can likely even skip that type of dreaming altogether, and still learn sorcery through Tensegrity, stalking and recapitulation.\n\nBut we have to be a little careful. We still don\u2019t really know to what extend *intent* is proprietary.\n\nMeaning, one former apprentice of Carlos is out there, claiming to be an enlightened yogi.\n\nHis web page admonishes people to pick up his method, since he\u2019s \u201cgone around\u201d Carlos\u2019 goals.\n\nHe never learned to get silent, but it seems he\u2019s found some meditation technique as a substitute and believes he\u2019s gone deeper into reality than Carlos did.\n\nI have to trust him on that one, and assume he\u2019s sincere.\n\nBut why did he never learn to be silent? How is it possible to go deeper into reality, with a petty tyrant yapping in your head all day long?\n\nDifferent *intent*?\n\nEven Lorenzo (Bruce), who\u2019s said to still be somewhat interested in Cleargreen, and owns the right to Castaneda\u2019s books for television and film, cited the Indian guru Ramesh Balsekar on his Wikipedia page.\n\nAnd his page has been redone recently. He kept the reference to Balsekar.\n\nHe\u2019s still wanting to promote something other than Carlos\u2019 teachings.\n\nBoth of those men are advising followers of Carlos, to go elsewhere.\n\nMyself, when I read the writings of gurus and spiritual experts these days, they seem true.\n\nBut somewhat limiting.\n\nAll of the cool things they say, can be summed up with one thing: internal silence is good.\n\nBut they take a different path while explaining it, and seem unaware of what else you might learn to do.\n\nWhich is odd. About the only thing you can really do, to change yourself, is learn to be silent.\n\nWhat else could you change?\n\nBut once you do, how come you don't end up discovering the same things, as someone following a different path (*intent*)?\n\nZen masters are a good example. We know they\u2019ve gotten silent. That\u2019s really all they do. Westernized Zen masters readily admit that, and the Asian ones still hint at it, with complicated puzzling sayings.\n\nYet I doubt they\u2019d even have a useful thing to say about my little Fairy entity.\n\nEven finding one of their own, they\u2019d still not want to talk about that because it\u2019s just not what they are *intending*.\n\nCheck out how this Zen master feels about fairies:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=1714&amp;v=xF5V9r7\\_ZHI&amp;t=25m40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;t=25m40s)\n\nIf he rejects visitors from another realm as being more suitable for \u201cphilosophers\u201d, then what about traveling to other worlds?\n\nWhat about shared dreaming?\n\nWhat about the mastery of *intent*?\n\nThat\u2019s what don Juan suggested his sorcery really ought to be called.\n\nFor those of you who have other practices, such as meditation, I suggest the following.\n\nWhen in Rome, be 100% roman.\n\nEat the foods, play with the locals, and avoid being ungrateful. Whatever you\u2019re there for is fine.\n\nBut we **cannot** say that everything is the same. Each path seems to be following some historical *intent*.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to do that. We want to **master** *intent*.\n\nWe want to learn what it is, not be burdened by it, the way the rest of humanity has been.\n\nFor the 4th gate, you need to at least understand that you can\u2019t really intercept another person\u2019s dream.\n\nBut you can intercept their *intent*, and build a dream world of your own, around it.\n\nTo what extent your own view of that dream world will match theirs, I don\u2019t know.\n\nIf Cholita wasn\u2019t completely crazy, I could ask her.\n\nBut she won\u2019t talk about anything to do with such topics. Her latest scouting expedition, into homelessness, was partly motivated by me asking her too many questions about her sorcery abilities.\n\nEven Josefina had to be coerced by Carlos, before she\u2019d talk about it.\n\nI have a few shared dreaming experiences from the hit and miss method. I mean, the one where at least one person has to become lucid in a dream, and find another person they know in there. And, the other person has to at least remember the dream, if not become lucid in it.\n\nThat sort of thing is automatic if you learn to become lucid. You simply find people you know while running around in a lucid dream, and then you have the chance to try to verify that they were really there, after you wake up.\n\nMost of the time, they can't even remember their dreams from the night before, let alone several days later, when you finally catch up with them to ask.\n\nAnd other times, they readily agree they remember that, even if they don't.\n\nThat's why we don't have a lot of solid accounts of this. It's a lot harder to verify, than it is to do it.\n\nAnd it's darned hard to get lucid in the first place.\n\nSo humanity in general doesn't know about it.\n\nYet I've clearly shared dreams with people to whom I had an energetic connection. It was unmistakable from the accounts we both had.\n\nIn all cases,  the precise details were off.\n\nThe dream *intent* didn\u2019t seem to be strong enough for me to make a perfect copy of what they were seeing.\n\nThe best we could do was exchange information.\n\nI expect, it\u2019s like the virtual village that one of don Juan\u2019s group created, complete with church.\n\nThey all had to work on visualizing it perfectly, from a single object and onwards, before they were able to share it like a real place.\n\nBut you can still have fun, even if the two views of the dream are different.\n\nI once engaged Cholita in a dreaming game of hide and seek, across more than one continent.\n\nAt the end, I was watching her from 50 feet up. Whatever part of her *intent* I picked up, wasn\u2019t all about the details of what she was seeing in her dream.\n\nI mentioned it to her the next day, and she got angry.\n\nI broke a small village in Mexico trying to catch up with her. She wanted to know what I had against Mexico.\n\nAay...  Cholita!?\n\nDreaming is weird when you learn to *see* energy.\n\nContinued\u2026", "edited": 1577942294.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fctbzld", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 5A: 4th Gate of Dreaming (Kidnapping other dreamers)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 4th gate of dreaming, according to Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2026consists of being able to share the intended dream reality of other people.

We still don\u2019t really know to what extend &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, one former apprentice of Carlos is out there, claiming to be an enlightened yogi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His web page admonishes people to pick up his method, since he\u2019s \u201cgone around\u201d Carlos\u2019 goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He never learned to get silent, but it seems he\u2019s found some meditation technique as a substitute and believes he\u2019s gone deeper into reality than Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to trust him on that one, and assume he\u2019s sincere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why did he never learn to be silent? How is it possible to go deeper into reality, with a petty tyrant yapping in your head all day long?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Different &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Lorenzo (Bruce), who\u2019s said to still be somewhat interested in Cleargreen, and owns the right to Castaneda\u2019s books for television and film, cited the Indian guru Ramesh Balsekar on his Wikipedia page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And his page has been redone recently. He kept the reference to Balsekar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s still wanting to promote something other than Carlos\u2019 teachings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of those men are advising followers of Carlos, to go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, when I read the writings of gurus and spiritual experts these days, they seem true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But somewhat limiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the cool things they say, can be summed up with one thing: internal silence is good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they take a different path while explaining it, and seem unaware of what else you might learn to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is odd. About the only thing you can really do, to change yourself, is learn to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What else could you change?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you do, how come you don&amp;#39;t end up discovering the same things, as someone following a different path (&lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zen masters are a good example. We know they\u2019ve gotten silent. That\u2019s really all they do. Westernized Zen masters readily admit that, and the Asian ones still hint at it, with complicated puzzling sayings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet I doubt they\u2019d even have a useful thing to say about my little Fairy entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even finding one of their own, they\u2019d still not want to talk about that because it\u2019s just not what they are &lt;em&gt;intending&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out how this Zen master feels about fairies:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;amp;t=25m40s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;amp;t=25m40s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he rejects visitors from another realm as being more suitable for \u201cphilosophers\u201d, then what about traveling to other worlds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about shared dreaming?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about the mastery of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what don Juan suggested his sorcery really ought to be called.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have other practices, such as meditation, I suggest the following.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in Rome, be 100% roman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eat the foods, play with the locals, and avoid being ungrateful. Whatever you\u2019re there for is fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; say that everything is the same. Each path seems to be following some historical &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don\u2019t want to do that. We want to &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to learn what it is, not be burdened by it, the way the rest of humanity has been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the 4th gate, you need to at least understand that you can\u2019t really intercept another person\u2019s dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can intercept their &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, and build a dream world of your own, around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To what extent your own view of that dream world will match theirs, I don\u2019t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Cholita wasn\u2019t completely crazy, I could ask her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she won\u2019t talk about anything to do with such topics. Her latest scouting expedition, into homelessness, was partly motivated by me asking her too many questions about her sorcery abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Josefina had to be coerced by Carlos, before she\u2019d talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a few shared dreaming experiences from the hit and miss method. I mean, the one where at least one person has to become lucid in a dream, and find another person they know in there. And, the other person has to at least remember the dream, if not become lucid in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sort of thing is automatic if you learn to become lucid. You simply find people you know while running around in a lucid dream, and then you have the chance to try to verify that they were really there, after you wake up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, they can&amp;#39;t even remember their dreams from the night before, let alone several days later, when you finally catch up with them to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And other times, they readily agree they remember that, even if they don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of solid accounts of this. It&amp;#39;s a lot harder to verify, than it is to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s darned hard to get lucid in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So humanity in general doesn&amp;#39;t know about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet I&amp;#39;ve clearly shared dreams with people to whom I had an energetic connection. It was unmistakable from the accounts we both had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all cases,  the precise details were off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dream &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; didn\u2019t seem to be strong enough for me to make a perfect copy of what they were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best we could do was exchange information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I expect, it\u2019s like the virtual village that one of don Juan\u2019s group created, complete with church.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all had to work on visualizing it perfectly, from a single object and onwards, before they were able to share it like a real place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can still have fun, even if the two views of the dream are different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once engaged Cholita in a dreaming game of hide and seek, across more than one continent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end, I was watching her from 50 feet up. Whatever part of her &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; I picked up, wasn\u2019t all about the details of what she was seeing in her dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned it to her the next day, and she got angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I broke a small village in Mexico trying to catch up with her. She wanted to know what I had against Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aay...  Cholita!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreaming is weird when you learn to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/fctbzld/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577938542.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_egkz4l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fchxb0v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1577655219.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_egkz4l", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Part 3A: 2nd Gate of Dreaming (Messing with the locals).\n\nI\u2019m going to explain this the way I learned it.\n\nI made a mistake, and later realized I got lucky.\n\nAll of this is of course, just something you might do. The important thing is the \u201chow to\u201d. Not what happens.\n\nMy mistake inevitably leads you into the world of the inorganic beings.\n\nYou could sum up this method by saying, \u201cHulk?!

You kill every character you find until you\u2019re left all alone in the dream. All the while, you\u2019re jumping around on tall things.\n\nTurn the characters upside down and smash them into the ground.\n\nI\u2019ll also teach you to disintegrate them with your eyes.\n\nAnd how to \u201crepair\u201d them.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ll assume you\u2019ve done at least one dream change. You found your hands, looked at objects, and then ran out of energy. And then you managed to restore the dream.\n\nWhen it comes back, still take the time to look at your hands once.\n\nThe first thing you need now,  is some wheels.\n\nUnfortunately, when you first try this it\u2019ll be hard to get the motor running.\n\nYou\u2019ll risk losing the dream by trying this the first time.\n\nBut once you can do it, you can extend the dream by minutes.\n\nFrom within the dream, find a spot with no one around where you can stand for at least 15 seconds.\n\nIf they catch up with you, and it seems like they might try to stop you, smash them.\n\nIt\u2019s also ok to run away from the dreaming phantoms.\n\nIf just one manages to press against your back while you\u2019re trying this, just let them ride along.\n\nInorganic beings like to press up against you in dreaming, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any loss. But multiple phantoms can prevent you from leaving.\n\nFirst find the tallest, furthest away surface where you might \u201cland\u201d if you flew to it.\n\nI suggest you\u2019re better off with a mountain top. When you choose things inside a city, the inorganics tend to try to pin you down with whatever is around.\n\nFor instance, if you zoom over to the top of the Sears Tower and from there try to find another place to zoom to, you\u2019ll often be unable to find a clear spot from which to launch.\n\nAs you walk around looking for a clear ledge, stuff tends to keep blocking you. A single inorganic can project a small crowd, or manifest objects like pipes and fencing.\n\nIt can pin you in. You\u2019ll have to wake up.\n\nTry to stick with a mountain at first, and if you get stuck on the top of the Sears Tower, with stuff starting to block you, forget about zooming.\n\nJump off of it. Don\u2019t be afraid. You have to get used to that sensation of realizing you can\u2019t be hurt, despite your fear.  Lucidity is one thing. Being willing to jump is entirely different.\n\nIf you get lucky and do a successful jump, you\u2019ll find that you fall like a son of a bitch only for a bit, and then it slows down until you gently land on the concrete.\n\nOr not. Sorry if that happens. It won\u2019t hurt, much.\n\nA successful jump should be followed by greed. Zoom to the top of the same building, or another, and do that jump again. Do as many as you can.\n\nIf you find a mountain, you\u2019ll be relatively alone when you get there and there won\u2019t be tons of mechanical stuff to trap you.\n\nThat was my goal at first. To be left alone. I saw the phantoms as things that can wake you up.\n\nSo I wanted to be alone.\n\nI believe Carlos called this form of dreaming transportation, \u201czooming\u201d.\n\nYou stare at the most distant place you can see. Preferably high up, because it\u2019s easier to see during the entire zoom.\n\nIf it\u2019s a mountain, try to find some bushes, a tree, or a big rock.\n\nStare at it. Lean in a tiny bit, like you expect it to pull you.\n\nWhat pulls you is your stare. You really have to try hard to see the exact details over there.\n\nIt\u2019s a dream change. Each zoom is another dream change. A dream, within a dream.\n\nTime slows down, and it becomes more stable.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s similar to simply flying in dreaming, zooming is always reliable.\n\nFlying in dreaming is not. Some days you can fly high, others you can\u2019t.\n\nZooming is a technique, using your gaze. It summons your assemblage point to move to a specific spot.\n\nYou can zoom super fast by staring very hard, or slow it down and gaze at what you\u2019re passing over.\n\nYou can also land at any point.\n\nOr you can change directions by changing what you want to stare at.\n\nYou could zoom over to a mountain, but before you land you see a higher one, and redirect your gaze to it.\n\nIf you have a hitchhiker, likely you won\u2019t be able to zoom that fast.\n\nLanding is no big deal. It\u2019s about same as any normal dream of flying. You just sort of swoop up a bit so that you aren\u2019t horizontal, and gently fall onto your feet.\n\nLook around to make sure no one is there.\n\nIf you find a single entity, burn him with your eyes.\n\nStare at his chest or face. Examine every tiny detail, to see if it changes.\n\nIt has to change! If you find a book,  try to read it in dreaming. You\u2019ll understand why it must change.\n\nIf the phantom is troublesome and not changing quick enough, point your finger at him and command, \u201cChange!!!!!\u201d\n\nIdeally it will stay where it is, contort a little, change to a different look, and eventually just fall to the ground, leaving perhaps a pile of clothes.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible you found an \u201cEaster egg\u201d. That\u2019s an actual inorganic being.  A scout.\n\nIt will change until it\u2019s just a collection of lights.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you what to do, if you unmask an actual inorganic. You\u2019ll get to see it, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nBut I have no memory of what happens next. It\u2019s been too long since I used sleep to enter dreaming.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to stop halfway, when it\u2019s just beginning to reveal the lights.\n\nI unmasked one of Carlos\u2019 allies that way. It was a waiter, and I was asking him how to get to the kitchen.\n\nHe pointed to a weird trap door, and I realize he wanted me to go down it and get stuck.\n\nI stared him down but he moved so close that all I could see was his chest. When it revealed a bar of light, I stopped.\n\nI just walked away and he didn\u2019t try to follow me.\n\nIf you like having a sidekick, you can stop long before the phantom goes away.\n\nAs soon as it begins to mutate, tell it what you want. Pick something that can\u2019t be threatening.\n\n\u201cBecome Shirley Temple!!!!\u201d, you can order it.\n\nIt might take some \u201cnegotiation\u201d. That\u2019s a combination of staring just enough to make it unstable, and finger pointing to show how insistent you are.\n\nThis is much the same as wrestling an ally, except that it\u2019s less scary.\n\nIf it has something wrong with it when it\u2019s done, you can \u201crepair\u201d it.\n\nTake that same finger you used to stare them down, and spray liquid from it.\n\nJust intend that you feel liquid coming from the tip, and spray it all over the defect.\n\nYou can heal your dreaming body the same way.\n\nWhen it runs out, you have to wait until it charges up.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in to sidekicks, so if I found someone riding my back, I landed only long enough to get them off, and zoomed away again.\n\nThe longest one ever managed to follow me was through 3 zooms.\n\nContinue to zoom around, smashing any obstacles, until you can remain in dreaming as much as a half hour if you like.\n\nEventually you'll realize, this is boring!   If you wanted this, you could go hiking.\n\nHow can Castaneda's sorcery turn out to be boring?\n\nSo you try zooming to the moon, to the stars, and to anything you can, to find a place where you can stay that isn't boring.\n\nBut you find none.\n\nMaybe you need the phantoms after all?\n\nContinued...\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1577844987.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fchxb0v", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 3A: 2nd Gate of Dreaming (Messing with the locals).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m going to explain this the way I learned it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a mistake, and later realized I got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this is of course, just something you might do.

A dream, within a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time slows down, and it becomes more stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it\u2019s similar to simply flying in dreaming, zooming is always reliable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flying in dreaming is not. Some days you can fly high, others you can\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zooming is a technique, using your gaze. It summons your assemblage point to move to a specific spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can zoom super fast by staring very hard, or slow it down and gaze at what you\u2019re passing over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also land at any point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can change directions by changing what you want to stare at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could zoom over to a mountain, but before you land you see a higher one, and redirect your gaze to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a hitchhiker, likely you won\u2019t be able to zoom that fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Landing is no big deal. It\u2019s about same as any normal dream of flying. You just sort of swoop up a bit so that you aren\u2019t horizontal, and gently fall onto your feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look around to make sure no one is there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find a single entity, burn him with your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stare at his chest or face. Examine every tiny detail, to see if it changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to change! If you find a book,  try to read it in dreaming. You\u2019ll understand why it must change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the phantom is troublesome and not changing quick enough, point your finger at him and command, \u201cChange!!!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally it will stay where it is, contort a little, change to a different look, and eventually just fall to the ground, leaving perhaps a pile of clothes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s also possible you found an \u201cEaster egg\u201d. That\u2019s an actual inorganic being.  A scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will change until it\u2019s just a collection of lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t tell you what to do, if you unmask an actual inorganic. You\u2019ll get to see it, that\u2019s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I have no memory of what happens next. It\u2019s been too long since I used sleep to enter dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s also possible to stop halfway, when it\u2019s just beginning to reveal the lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I unmasked one of Carlos\u2019 allies that way. It was a waiter, and I was asking him how to get to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a weird trap door, and I realize he wanted me to go down it and get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stared him down but he moved so close that all I could see was his chest. When it revealed a bar of light, I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just walked away and he didn\u2019t try to follow me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you like having a sidekick, you can stop long before the phantom goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as it begins to mutate, tell it what you want. Pick something that can\u2019t be threatening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBecome Shirley Temple!!!!\u201d, you can order it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might take some \u201cnegotiation\u201d. That\u2019s a combination of staring just enough to make it unstable, and finger pointing to show how insistent you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is much the same as wrestling an ally, except that it\u2019s less scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it has something wrong with it when it\u2019s done, you can \u201crepair\u201d it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take that same finger you used to stare them down, and spray liquid from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just intend that you feel liquid coming from the tip, and spray it all over the defect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can heal your dreaming body the same way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it runs out, you have to wait until it charges up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn\u2019t in to sidekicks, so if I found someone riding my back, I landed only long enough to get them off, and zoomed away again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The longest one ever managed to follow me was through 3 zooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continue to zoom around, smashing any obstacles, until you can remain in dreaming as much as a half hour if you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you&amp;#39;ll realize, this is boring!   If you wanted this, you could go hiking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can Castaneda&amp;#39;s sorcery turn out to be boring?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you try zooming to the moon, to the stars, and to anything you can, to find a place where you can stay that isn&amp;#39;t boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you find none.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you need the phantoms after all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/fchxb0v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577655219.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_egkz4l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fcnxjh2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1577820396.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_egkz4l", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Part 4A: 3rd Gate of Dreaming (So many worlds?)\n\nWikipedia has an excellent short description of \u201cThe Art of Dreaming\u201d, obviously written by someone taught directly by Carlos. There\u2019s an interesting warning:\n\n\u201cBy acting a certain way while dreaming, one can cause psychosomatic changes in one's being, including an alternate way of dying.\u201d\n\nWow.\n\nDreaming is a lot of fun!  We don\u2019t need to live forever in order to justify it.\n\nLet\u2019s stay out of the religion business.\n\nSorcery is difficult enough, even when treated as a simple technology. Once you start talking about alternate ways of dying, people start putting on the monk robes and carrying around crosses for fending off vampires.\n\nCarlos was crucified on his death by cross carrying monks.\n\nPerhaps we should rethink the whole mood of this?\n\nIt\u2019s just something you can learn to do.\n\nNo one gets bent out of shape if you like badminton, even though it\u2019s a little weird spanking that birdie around with paddles, next to women prancing around with their panties showing.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it like that. Sorcery is just a hobby.\n\nWikipedia also defines the gates as \u201cobstacles to awareness\u201d.\n\nYou can \u201carrive\u201d at a gate, \u201csolve\u201d it, and \u201ccross\u201d it.\n\nAbout the 3rd gate it says, \u201cArrived at when one dreams of looking at oneself. Solved when the dreaming and physical bodies become one. Crossed when one is able to control the dreaming body in the physical realm and move around at ease.\u201d\n\nGood luck crossing the 3rd gate!\n\nThings get really weird at that point. And a whole lot of exaggerating is going on out there, especially in the OBE community.\n\nMy advice, go around the 3rd gate. I\u2019ll write how to do that later.\n\nAnd if you want to arrive at the 4th gate you\u2019re going to be handicapped if you keep using sleep to enter dreaming.\n\nLearn waking dreaming instead. BUT, with your eyes open, walking around. Don\u2019t get lazy and do it in a chair with them closed.  That method induces a **sleepy** *intent*.\n\nLearn about espresso double shots, and get up and walk around while you're dreaming awake.  Carlos' apprentices have slept far too long.\n\nThe third gate is also heavily infected with very frightening inorganic beings.  The worst experience you will ever have with them, will likely be when they first fully manifest in dreams at the 3rd gate.\n\nAt least, it was for me. But I\u2019d been exposed to Carlos\u2019 high energy inorganics.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that will happen to the rest of you. But I\u2019d bet there\u2019s some scary characters in dreaming, when you arrive to this point.\n\nMy first encounter with the third gate is hard for me to recall, because after many of them I now realize we run into the 3rd gate anytime our dreaming awareness persists until we get close to being awake.\n\nIt\u2019s a disturbed dreaming situation, where the body is more alert than normal, and possibly when it\u2019s well rested but still dreaming.\n\nOur dreaming body becomes imbued with \u201cnormalness\u201d, or thoughts of what needs to be done on waking up.\n\nThat sets up *intent*. You\u2019ll find yourself walking around in your own apartment or home getting ready.\n\nIf anything is different, it\u2019ll be that you don\u2019t feel any pain.\n\nI mean, no pain. That\u2019s not normal. Check yourself out right now. Any pain? Sure, it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nEven walking creates pain.\n\nThat\u2019ll be missing. And you\u2019ll be very alert, not tired at all, like you should be if you just got out of bed.\n\nSomething will seem off, and you won\u2019t be sure what it could be.\n\nChances are this feeling won\u2019t last long. I mean, you aren\u2019t going to get up, take a shower, get dressed, and discover you are still in a dream.\n\nThat *can* happen! I\u2019ve driven all the way to work before I realized I was still asleep.\n\nBut in the beginning, a tiny something is going to be in the air. A feeling. Nothing substantial.\n\nA very weird thought will occur to you. Maybe this is a dream? You\u2019ll probably feel silly for even thinking it. You\u2019ll look around and insist, this is real!\n\nIf you were a 5 year old, that thought wouldn\u2019t even enter your mind. You\u2019d just wander around in your dreaming body, like nothing was wrong.\n\nWe\u2019ve probably all done it a lot as children. If it\u2019s ever uncovered, there are all kinds of explanations to hide magic seeping through into our socialized world.\n\n\u201cChildren just sleep walk, that\u2019s all\u201d.\n\nNever mind that objects were moved around in the kitchen. Or that your child tells how he went out the door and flew away.\n\nChildren arrive at the 3rd gate as soon as they can walk.\n\nBut as an adult practitioner of lucid dreaming, you\u2019re going to think about that possibility. That it\u2019s a dream.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when inorganics can show up. It\u2019s that realization that you are possibly in a dream.\n\nYou\u2019ve lost connection with time and space!\n\nWhen we\u2019re awake, we can trace where we\u2019ve been, all the way back to our childhood. It\u2019s unbroken.\n\nBut in this case, you aren\u2019t sure where you really are.\n\nThere\u2019s 3 possibilities now.\n\nYou freak out and wake up. If that happens, don\u2019t move. Force yourself back in, which you ought to have learned by the time you arrive at the 3rd gate.\n\nThe copy you return to won\u2019t have the same feeling. It\u2019ll likely be back in the phantom world of ordinary dreams.\n\nWaking up is a dream change. Don\u2019t feel bad when you get back in, and it\u2019s not your own room.\n\nYou did reach the 3rd gate. You were just lame and didn\u2019t realize it. But you get the extra lucidity, if you can go back in.\n\nIf you don\u2019t freak out, you might instead do a test to see if you are dreaming, discover you are, and then proceed to exploit the lucid dream.\n\nYou might walk out of your apartment knowing you are in fact in a dream, marveling at how everything looks normal, just the way it does in the real world.\n\nIt\u2019s slightly cool, but you haven\u2019t fully realized it\u2019s something new. As the dream goes on the landscape becomes more bizarre, and the sense of being in the real world is lost. Every step while dreaming is a dream change.\n\nAt the 3rd gate, something is pulling on us, not to let the dream change too much. But eventually it will.\n\nYou didn\u2019t entirely lose the benefits of the 3rd gate. In fact, it\u2019s a valid choice to just leave your home, when you discover the dream is very close to reality.\n\nOr, you might take the \u201cideal\u201d alternative on realizing you might be in a dream copy of your real dwelling.\n\nYou might go back to the bedroom and take a look. See if you\u2019re still sleeping there.\n\nThat\u2019s what Carlos wrote has to happen, to reach the 3rd gate.\n\nBut what the heck? Why would you think of that?\n\nI never did.\n\nThe whole \u201cgates of dreaming\u201d thing is mostly just a description of what\u2019s possible, to encourage people to practice. It\u2019s good, but things will never be exactly as written.\n\nCarlos wrote it over the course of 2 weeks, in heightened awareness. He could \u201csee the oncoming time\u201d when he wrote it.\n\nHe *intended* a path in *dreaming* for us. It\u2019s similar to him saying that some of the women in his group had an actual connection to sorcery lineages, when everyone knew they didn\u2019t.\n\nHe invited them to join the myth, and follow *intent*.\n\nConsider that when you try to copy the path in his books.\n\nI\u2019d say, the 3rd gate is where your dreaming body starts to learn to move around in \u201cthis\u201d world, instead of just phantom projections. Or more accurately, you begin to assemble dreaming worlds, which include more of the emanations used to assemble your normal world.\n\nSo it feels \u201crealer\u201d.\n\nIdeally, seeing yourself in bed would be too cool!\n\nThe problem is, that likely never happens. \n\nI'd guess that if you went to see if Zsa Zsa Gabore was in your bed, you'd find her too.\n\nNor do people commonly experience seeing themselves  with OBEs.\n\nPeople just ignore evidence to the contrary.\n\nDreams won\u2019t stay the same. If you stare at an object, it changes.\n\nIt\u2019s a virtual world, generated by *intent*. It\u2019s not generated by your senses, and real information.\n\nEven if you are fully awake, in your real body, doing waking dreaming, you can\u2019t make things remain the same.\n\nWhy would your dreaming body be any better at that?\n\nAnd it\u2019s pretty irrational. It won\u2019t notice things that are out of place, as long as it  \u201cfeels\u201d normal.\n\nMore likely is, you won\u2019t notice that the person you\u2019re looking at in the bed, has his heavy black shoes on.\n\nOr, he\u2019s 20 years younger than he should be.\n\nOr, the bedroom is perfect, except that you haven\u2019t lived there for years.\n\nFinding yourself *really* in the bed, seems highly unlikely to me.\n\nStill, something is very different about this type of dream. You can feel it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s another reason it seems unlikely to me that you\u2019d go look at yourself.\n\nYour sense of something being off, will turn to a certainty that something terrible is about to happen!\n\nThe hairs on the back of your neck may stand up, and you may find yourself frozen on the spot. You\u2019ll be feeling some kind of electricity in the air.\n\nIn that case, you have an inorganic being nearby.\n\nIf you can manage to move your neck, slowly turn your head to look around.\n\nWhen you find it, it might appear as a fully dark person. You can make out the shape. It is indeed human. And maybe even just the same size as you.\n\nThe first time this happened to me, I had *both* of Carlos allies in the dream.\n\nYou\u2019ll be in shock at that point, as if someone removed all the weight from your body, letting you float, and also attached electrodes to send a strong current through your entire body.\n\nDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s just an inorganic being doing what they do.\n\nFear is good, they like it. They\u2019ll make more of it, given a chance.\n\nBut after that burst, they seem to let up. Maybe a big bite of food causes them to pause before the next bite.\n\nThe fright will go away, and you\u2019ll be more curious to see the details of this visitor.\n\nOften it has no light coming from it, to provide the details. It looks like a man dipped in dull tar.\n\nChances are, you\u2019ll have to wrestle that inorganic being.\n\ncontinued...\n\nEdited", "edited": 1577824804.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fcnxjh2", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 4A: 3rd Gate of Dreaming (So many worlds?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has an excellent short description of \u201cThe Art of Dreaming\u201d, obviously written by someone taught directly by Carlos.

It\u2019s unbroken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in this case, you aren\u2019t sure where you really are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s 3 possibilities now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You freak out and wake up. If that happens, don\u2019t move. Force yourself back in, which you ought to have learned by the time you arrive at the 3rd gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The copy you return to won\u2019t have the same feeling. It\u2019ll likely be back in the phantom world of ordinary dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waking up is a dream change. Don\u2019t feel bad when you get back in, and it\u2019s not your own room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You did reach the 3rd gate. You were just lame and didn\u2019t realize it. But you get the extra lucidity, if you can go back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don\u2019t freak out, you might instead do a test to see if you are dreaming, discover you are, and then proceed to exploit the lucid dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might walk out of your apartment knowing you are in fact in a dream, marveling at how everything looks normal, just the way it does in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s slightly cool, but you haven\u2019t fully realized it\u2019s something new. As the dream goes on the landscape becomes more bizarre, and the sense of being in the real world is lost. Every step while dreaming is a dream change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the 3rd gate, something is pulling on us, not to let the dream change too much. But eventually it will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn\u2019t entirely lose the benefits of the 3rd gate. In fact, it\u2019s a valid choice to just leave your home, when you discover the dream is very close to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, you might take the \u201cideal\u201d alternative on realizing you might be in a dream copy of your real dwelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might go back to the bedroom and take a look. See if you\u2019re still sleeping there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what Carlos wrote has to happen, to reach the 3rd gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what the heck? Why would you think of that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole \u201cgates of dreaming\u201d thing is mostly just a description of what\u2019s possible, to encourage people to practice. It\u2019s good, but things will never be exactly as written.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wrote it over the course of 2 weeks, in heightened awareness. He could \u201csee the oncoming time\u201d when he wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; a path in &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; for us. It\u2019s similar to him saying that some of the women in his group had an actual connection to sorcery lineages, when everyone knew they didn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He invited them to join the myth, and follow &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider that when you try to copy the path in his books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d say, the 3rd gate is where your dreaming body starts to learn to move around in \u201cthis\u201d world, instead of just phantom projections. Or more accurately, you begin to assemble dreaming worlds, which include more of the emanations used to assemble your normal world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it feels \u201crealer\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, seeing yourself in bed would be too cool!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, that likely never happens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d guess that if you went to see if Zsa Zsa Gabore was in your bed, you&amp;#39;d find her too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nor do people commonly experience seeing themselves  with OBEs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People just ignore evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreams won\u2019t stay the same. If you stare at an object, it changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a virtual world, generated by &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;. It\u2019s not generated by your senses, and real information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you are fully awake, in your real body, doing waking dreaming, you can\u2019t make things remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why would your dreaming body be any better at that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it\u2019s pretty irrational. It won\u2019t notice things that are out of place, as long as it  \u201cfeels\u201d normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More likely is, you won\u2019t notice that the person you\u2019re looking at in the bed, has his heavy black shoes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, he\u2019s 20 years younger than he should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, the bedroom is perfect, except that you haven\u2019t lived there for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding yourself &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; in the bed, seems highly unlikely to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, something is very different about this type of dream. You can feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s another reason it seems unlikely to me that you\u2019d go look at yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your sense of something being off, will turn to a certainty that something terrible is about to happen!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hairs on the back of your neck may stand up, and you may find yourself frozen on the spot. You\u2019ll be feeling some kind of electricity in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, you have an inorganic being nearby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can manage to move your neck, slowly turn your head to look around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you find it, it might appear as a fully dark person. You can make out the shape. It is indeed human. And maybe even just the same size as you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time this happened to me, I had &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of Carlos allies in the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll be in shock at that point, as if someone removed all the weight from your body, letting you float, and also attached electrodes to send a strong current through your entire body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t worry. That\u2019s just an inorganic being doing what they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear is good, they like it. They\u2019ll make more of it, given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after that burst, they seem to let up. Maybe a big bite of food causes them to pause before the next bite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fright will go away, and you\u2019ll be more curious to see the details of this visitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often it has no light coming from it, to provide the details. It looks like a man dipped in dull tar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chances are, you\u2019ll have to wrestle that inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;continued...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/fcnxjh2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577820396.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_egkz4l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fcxsmjc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1578069895.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fcwn02x", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yea, they're all just \"props\" as don Juan put it.\n\nOn the other hand, the entire world is a prop.

Dreams inside dreams.\n\nZooming is also a dream inside a dream.\n\nSo is jumping into a painting.\n\nAny dream change is a new dream, inside the old one.\n\nLaying down and closing your eyes is not much different.\n\nBut it *is* really cool!!!\n\nAnd there\u2019s some *intent* involved. It\u2019s like dead *dreaming*. It\u2019s easier to retain lucidity when you dream that you\u2019re already dead.\n\nSome of you might have seen the movie \u201cInception\u201d, from 2010.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoHD9XEInc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoHD9XEInc0)\n\nIn that movie, spies go to sleep inside dreams, sharing them with others. Every time they go to sleep in a dream,  time slows down.\n\nSince the movie came along after Carlos and sustained action, I have to think it was influenced by them.\n\nI have a theory about why time slows down. And I\u2019d like to propose, it doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nIt slows down because you have the *intent* that your dream is protected. If you wake up, you\u2019ll still be in a dream.\n\nThat gives you an extra boost of confidence.  As you remain for a very long time, you start to skip freely from event to event.\n\nSo you don\u2019t actually take out the garbage, but your wife thanks you for it. And you have the historical context. The memories. Somehow we pick those up when we enter the dream.\n\nFrom my experience, at the 3rd level (dream inside a dream inside a dream) you don\u2019t have to fight for lucidity or time anymore. You have it as long as you choose to remain in the dream.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry if that isn\u2019t what happens to you. You have my full permission to be different.\n\nAnd Carol Tigg\u2019s too, from the last workshop notes with her speaking.\n\nThe same amazing level of stability happens with dreaming worlds reached through silence.\n\nYou force yourself silent while awake, perceive a dreaming world you can enter, you go into it and can remain as long as you like.\n\nYou never lose lucidity because there\u2019s no transition. No blank out.\n\nWaking up inside a dream is different. It\u2019s more like someone drugged you unconscious, and then you slowly come to, in a confused state.\n\nBut from there, you can walk into another dream, much the same way you can when awake.\n\nAnd both are stable.\n\nOnce you can become lucid, going to sleep inside a dream is also ridiculously easy. It\u2019s got to be the easiest flashy thing you can learn to do.\n\nYou only need to be able to retain your lucidity for 30 seconds, and you can give it a try.\n\nBut it\u2019s not without its hazards as you\u2019ll read later.\n\nI have to apologize for not remembering my experiences with this fully. I remember all the events.  But some are similar to others, and they might end up mixed here.\n\nI\u2019ll have to cheat a bit, and put them into a sequence that makes a good story.\n\nIt might even be the exact way it happened. But if it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s close enough. Nothing is made up, except possibly connecting one event from dreaming, to another.\n\nI first tried this technique as an emergency escape.\n\nI\u2019d zoomed over to a place and gotten hopelessly trapped.\n\nI\u2019d gotten over my \u201cHulk. Smash!\u201d phase, and generally tried to avoid the locals unless I had a reason.\n\nActually, I was starting to feel bad when I killed any. I had a few returning friends by then.\n\nIf I thought about them, they often would show up, just around the corner.\n\nBut friends or not, the locals never let you alone in dreaming.\n\nThey never learn either.\n\nAnd if you observe them for too long,  they approach.\n\nI had zoomed far off into San Bernadino county, perhaps 100 miles from Los Angeles.\n\nI was searching for peyote. It used to grow there. I wanted to see what it looked like in dreaming.\n\nI landed in a dirt pit dug by people. The walls were at least 15 feet high.\n\nIt was part of some construction project.\n\nPhantoms were around, working at the site. When I saw them, a few started to walk my way.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see anything outside the pit. The walls were too high. So I couldn\u2019t \u201czoom\u201d away.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to zoom a short distance. You can\u2019t focus your concentration on only the place you want to go.\n\nYou see the up close stuff too, and you take off at a very slow pace, as if you were zooming high up, but started to watch the ground. That slows you down too.\n\nThere was a platform in that pit, made from pipes and plywood.\n\nI zoomed on top of it, to get away from the phantoms. I intended to find a mountain from that high perch, and escape the dirt pit.\n\nI could see a mountain in the distance, but when I leaned in a bit to zoom over to it, the platform tipped over.\n\nI fell back into the pit, and the pipes came crashing down on me.\n\nAs I realized I was nearly pinned, I tried to crawl out. A phantom or two stepped in my path and blocked that escape route with their feet.\n\nThe pipes started to mutate, twisting around me until I was not only completely trapped, but my arms were in danger of being cut up by the metal.\n\nI had to get out of there fast. There were only 2 choices. Wake up, or change dreams.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to wake up. The night was early and I was used to being able to extend any lucid dream for hours.\n\nBut I still hadn\u2019t figured out how to wake up and get lucid every single night. I really, really didn\u2019t want to lose this chance.\n\nAlthough I\u2019d never gotten around to trying it before, I decided to go to sleep inside the dream. I was pinned, but the phantoms couldn't get at me either, so I had time to try to sleep.\n\nIf I got lucky, I wouldn\u2019t wake up in the real world.\n\nI closed my eyes to sleep, wondering how long that would take. It seemed like a long time, when I suddenly realized, I was already in the new dream!\n\nI was standing up on a desert trail, at Joshua Tree. I\u2019d been there all along.\n\nAnd it had only been seconds at the most since I believed I was in that pit.\n\nI was so surprised, I bounced back to the previous dream. Finding myself still trapped under sharp metal, I woke up.\n\nNot only had I succeeded, but when I woke up from level 2, I was right back where I started in level 1.\n\nI didn\u2019t try it again for months. I\u2019m the kind of guy who eats only one item at a time, from his restaurant meal. If I start on the corn, I eat all of it before I try anything else.\n\nPeople don\u2019t like that. I always get, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your meal?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m the same in dreaming. I hadn\u2019t finished learning to change dreams so as to extend them, and in my mind, going to sleep inside a dream was the next step. I hadn't completed this one.\n\nBut one day I woke up in bed, and couldn\u2019t explain how I\u2019d gotten there. I had been in the recapitulation crate. It has door that locks from the inside. I got up to see if it was still locked.\n\nHalfway across the living room, I realized it was a dream. It felt real. It was absolutely my apartment. But there was a creepy energy in the room, as if an inorganic being was lurking behind the curtains.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a dream of your own dwelling, and everything seems absolutely real, look out!\n\nInorganic beings love that. If your skin begins to crawl, you have one nearby.\n\nThat was 3rd gate stuff, so I took that as a sign and decided to start practicing dreams within dreams. To finish the second gate as fast as possible.\n\nShortly after that I became lucid in a dream. It was a desert style garden.\n\nI walked around enough to determine no one was near by, and laid down on the dirt and wild grass path to go to sleep.\n\nI tucked my arms under my head and lay on my side.\n\nAgain, it seemed like it was taking a long time, until I woke up to find myself sitting on a bench.\n\nIt had only been a second or two!\n\nIt was so easy, I decide to do it again, right then. I closed my eyes while setting on the bench. I literally went to sleep in the first dream, and bounced through the second in less than 5 seconds.\n\nIn the third dream, I found myself in a living room. It was so large, it seemed more like an antique mall.\n\nThere were no walls between the \u201crooms\u201d.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see the end of it.  I noticed that the lighting was a golden yellow color.\n\nI lived there!  I thought maybe I even had a wife.\n\nI heard a woman across the room.\n\nI spent 2 weeks there. Towards the end I got worried if I was dying in bed.\n\nI tried to wake up, but kept ending up in a phantom copy of my own bedroom.\n\nThe first one was my bedroom from childhood, but at the time I didn\u2019t realize that. It was real. I had no doubt until things started to get strange.\n\nI woke myself again, now in the \u201cright\u201d bedroom.\n\nBut in fact, it was from an apartment I no longer had.\n\nThree more attempts to wake up failed.  I started to panic, thinking maybe I\u2019d never escape.\n\nIn the last wake up,  I had sleep paralysis. I rolled to get out of it, stumbled out of bed, and spent the next half hour waiting for things to get weird.\n\nIt had only been 14 hours. I was a consultant at the time, so no one expected me to arrive at work at any particular hour.\n\nI got ready in the bathroom, and it wasn\u2019t until I showered that I was confident, I really had awakened.\n\nAs you get better with lucid dreaming, you run into a few hazards.\n\n1. Sleep paralysis\n2. Can\u2019t wake up\n3. Inorganic beings who like to frighten you\n4. Dreaming characters who follow you out when you wake up\n5.

Every time they go to sleep in a dream,  time slows down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the movie came along after Carlos and sustained action, I have to think it was influenced by them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a theory about why time slows down. And I\u2019d like to propose, it doesn\u2019t have to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It slows down because you have the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; that your dream is protected. If you wake up, you\u2019ll still be in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gives you an extra boost of confidence.  As you remain for a very long time, you start to skip freely from event to event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you don\u2019t actually take out the garbage, but your wife thanks you for it. And you have the historical context. The memories. Somehow we pick those up when we enter the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my experience, at the 3rd level (dream inside a dream inside a dream) you don\u2019t have to fight for lucidity or time anymore. You have it as long as you choose to remain in the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don\u2019t worry if that isn\u2019t what happens to you. You have my full permission to be different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carol Tigg\u2019s too, from the last workshop notes with her speaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same amazing level of stability happens with dreaming worlds reached through silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You force yourself silent while awake, perceive a dreaming world you can enter, you go into it and can remain as long as you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You never lose lucidity because there\u2019s no transition. No blank out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waking up inside a dream is different. It\u2019s more like someone drugged you unconscious, and then you slowly come to, in a confused state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But from there, you can walk into another dream, much the same way you can when awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And both are stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can become lucid, going to sleep inside a dream is also ridiculously easy. It\u2019s got to be the easiest flashy thing you can learn to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You only need to be able to retain your lucidity for 30 seconds, and you can give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s not without its hazards as you\u2019ll read later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to apologize for not remembering my experiences with this fully. I remember all the events.  But some are similar to others, and they might end up mixed here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll have to cheat a bit, and put them into a sequence that makes a good story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might even be the exact way it happened. But if it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s close enough. Nothing is made up, except possibly connecting one event from dreaming, to another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first tried this technique as an emergency escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d zoomed over to a place and gotten hopelessly trapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d gotten over my \u201cHulk. Smash!\u201d phase, and generally tried to avoid the locals unless I had a reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, I was starting to feel bad when I killed any. I had a few returning friends by then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I thought about them, they often would show up, just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But friends or not, the locals never let you alone in dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never learn either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you observe them for too long,  they approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had zoomed far off into San Bernadino county, perhaps 100 miles from Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was searching for peyote. It used to grow there. I wanted to see what it looked like in dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I landed in a dirt pit dug by people. The walls were at least 15 feet high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was part of some construction project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phantoms were around, working at the site. When I saw them, a few started to walk my way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t see anything outside the pit. The walls were too high. So I couldn\u2019t \u201czoom\u201d away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s very difficult to zoom a short distance. You can\u2019t focus your concentration on only the place you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see the up close stuff too, and you take off at a very slow pace, as if you were zooming high up, but started to watch the ground. That slows you down too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a platform in that pit, made from pipes and plywood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I zoomed on top of it, to get away from the phantoms. I intended to find a mountain from that high perch, and escape the dirt pit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see a mountain in the distance, but when I leaned in a bit to zoom over to it, the platform tipped over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fell back into the pit, and the pipes came crashing down on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I realized I was nearly pinned, I tried to crawl out. A phantom or two stepped in my path and blocked that escape route with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pipes started to mutate, twisting around me until I was not only completely trapped, but my arms were in danger of being cut up by the metal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to get out of there fast. There were only 2 choices. Wake up, or change dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t want to wake up. The night was early and I was used to being able to extend any lucid dream for hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I still hadn\u2019t figured out how to wake up and get lucid every single night. I really, really didn\u2019t want to lose this chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I\u2019d never gotten around to trying it before, I decided to go to sleep inside the dream. I was pinned, but the phantoms couldn&amp;#39;t get at me either, so I had time to try to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I got lucky, I wouldn\u2019t wake up in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I closed my eyes to sleep, wondering how long that would take. It seemed like a long time, when I suddenly realized, I was already in the new dream!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was standing up on a desert trail, at Joshua Tree. I\u2019d been there all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it had only been seconds at the most since I believed I was in that pit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so surprised, I bounced back to the previous dream. Finding myself still trapped under sharp metal, I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only had I succeeded, but when I woke up from level 2, I was right back where I started in level 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t try it again for months. I\u2019m the kind of guy who eats only one item at a time, from his restaurant meal. If I start on the corn, I eat all of it before I try anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People don\u2019t like that. I always get, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your meal?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m the same in dreaming. I hadn\u2019t finished learning to change dreams so as to extend them, and in my mind, going to sleep inside a dream was the next step. I hadn&amp;#39;t completed this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one day I woke up in bed, and couldn\u2019t explain how I\u2019d gotten there. I had been in the recapitulation crate. It has door that locks from the inside. I got up to see if it was still locked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Halfway across the living room, I realized it was a dream. It felt real. It was absolutely my apartment. But there was a creepy energy in the room, as if an inorganic being was lurking behind the curtains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re in a dream of your own dwelling, and everything seems absolutely real, look out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings love that. If your skin begins to crawl, you have one nearby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was 3rd gate stuff, so I took that as a sign and decided to start practicing dreams within dreams. To finish the second gate as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that I became lucid in a dream. It was a desert style garden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked around enough to determine no one was near by, and laid down on the dirt and wild grass path to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tucked my arms under my head and lay on my side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, it seemed like it was taking a long time, until I woke up to find myself sitting on a bench.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had only been a second or two!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so easy, I decide to do it again, right then. I closed my eyes while setting on the bench. I literally went to sleep in the first dream, and bounced through the second in less than 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the third dream, I found myself in a living room. It was so large, it seemed more like an antique mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were no walls between the \u201crooms\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t see the end of it.  I noticed that the lighting was a golden yellow color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lived there!  I thought maybe I even had a wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard a woman across the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent 2 weeks there. Towards the end I got worried if I was dying in bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to wake up, but kept ending up in a phantom copy of my own bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first one was my bedroom from childhood, but at the time I didn\u2019t realize that. It was real. I had no doubt until things started to get strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke myself again, now in the \u201cright\u201d bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, it was from an apartment I no longer had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three more attempts to wake up failed.  I started to panic, thinking maybe I\u2019d never escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the last wake up,  I had sleep paralysis. I rolled to get out of it, stumbled out of bed, and spent the next half hour waiting for things to get weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had only been 14 hours. I was a consultant at the time, so no one expected me to arrive at work at any particular hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got ready in the bathroom, and it wasn\u2019t until I showered that I was confident, I really had awakened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you get better with lucid dreaming, you run into a few hazards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sleep paralysis&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can\u2019t wake up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inorganic beings who like to frighten you&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dreaming characters who follow you out when you wake up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Abstract dreams where you get stuck&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/egkz4l/how_to_pass_the_four_gates_of_dreaming/fclxyq9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577759207.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_egkz4l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fcxrr6j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fcx8n3b", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "In my experience, that's rare.

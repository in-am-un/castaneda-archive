I tried my normal gaze, and could only produce a broken dream scene, floating in the air.  It was obviously burning, exactly as she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I switched to her gaze, and there room was instantly filled with dreaming scenes.  But they &amp;quot;weren&amp;#39;t there&amp;quot; until I noticed one I liked, and gave it more attention.  I only &amp;quot;intuited&amp;quot; they were there, but if I had to draw them, I&amp;#39;d make them all very transparent and faint.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that lesson is pretty much like a drop of water in the ocean, compared to mastering sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your experience is super cool, and reminds me of a Nagual being able to look into the mirror of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, we all look in mirrors often, so it could just be the intent of looking in a mirror, making it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen an ice cream truck driving across my floor in the darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was because one drives around our neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to believe it was a magical ice cream truck, or I might go the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;#39;s worth trying to get the ice cream truck to drive by again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if I could get it to drive by every night, that would start to be something worth exploring in depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ovqmgq/white_light_skeleton/h7c6h0n/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1627841087.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ovqmgq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h7b32cy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1627821707.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ovqmgq", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's probably in the second attention sonar (\"x-ray?\") category, and somatic like you suppose.

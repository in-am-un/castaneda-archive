My amazon purchasing skills were poor back then.\n\nI just kept putting that off.\n\nI finally got to thinking, I'd better do it.  I went for a walk around my business park, and when I got back to my own office there was a brand new sleeping mask on the grass, where I couldn't possible miss it.  I would have stepped right on it if I hadn't looked down.\n\nBut there's a story in the books like that too.\n\nThe one where don Juan convinces Carlos that the wind is alive, and is chasing him.\n\nIn the story Carlos tries anything he can think of to prove that's impossible, and yet it seems to be true.\n\nIn another story from the books the same leaf keeps falling over and over, while Carlos tries to see from any angle he can without standing up, how that's possible.\n\nIt just happens.  That's all.  Because in fact reality isn't what we have been told it is.\n\nSo consider this:\n\nThere's no reality at all. Just an infinite number of phantom realms.\n\nFrom the dark sea of those infinitely long \"emanations\".\n\nAnd the awareness we were given.\n\nEach person a certain amount, held in place in a bubble on the dark sea of emanations.\n\nWe can flow the portion we have into trillions of emanations, and each tiny emanation sends back a feeling.  That creates our current reality.\n\nEach of the trillions sends back a super tiny bit of a feeling, an impression, or whatever.\n\nA single one can't even be described.  It's too tiny to have much meaning.\n\nIt simply \"is what it is\".\n\nAnd 10,000 of them might make a hubcap on your car.\n\nAnother 50,000 of them form the blue sky above you.\n\nThose numbers are just a guess, because in fact an even smaller number can form visible things for you.\n\nThat's the truth about reality.\n\nIt's just the echo of superstring like \"fields of energy\" (as Carlos called them), reacting to you \"noticing\" them.\n\nI guess in quantum physics, it might be somehow related to the spooky effect where noticing something (measuring it), actually causes it to be located at a specific time and place.\n\nBefore you noticed it it was in flux and could have been in more locations than we could count.  Once you notice it however, it's fixed at a single point.\n\nI'm not a big fan of recycling science to explain sorcery.\n\nIt ought to be the other way around.\n\nBut ChatGPT came up with that, when I questioned it about \"what if\" in relation to how sorcery works. I was testing to see if it was prejudiced against Carlos because his books violated it's understanding, or if it had been programmed to be hostile towards Carlos.\n\nSo ultimately what happens is, a sorcerer can see that dark sea. See the individual emanations, and watch energy flow in the universe.\n\nAnd if they like create a phantom world to go off and live in there for a few hundred years instead of where they currently are.\n\nWe also have 600 other worlds we can instantly switch to, with 600 other lives as real as this one.\n\nSome of the old seers did that.

Muscular tension, sweaty palms, itchy skin and so on... but I found my self sort of analphabetic, not able to comprehend or connects this \"symptoms\" with my state at the very moment.\n\nSo such things push me into exercising to contact the body.

And I'll give it a try to dark room too.\n\nIf it's of any help, I also practiced some daily tensegrity for months some years ago, and tried out recapitulation several times. Which is hard and boring as f. although I won't exclude to give it a go again. It's also fascinating.\n\nOther smaller practices such as long walks and trekking with eyes crossed. Then I stopped practices for years until last couple of months, getting slowly back into topics, books, and some very gentle practice to start with.\n\nMaybe that can explain, in the remote case those visual effects are something promising for real, why I get them.\n\nOr maybe it's just the lack of oxygen in my brain. I'm quite ok with that too.\n\nBut really don't need attention here on Reddit, I wanted to share and listen to your sincere opinions, since it seems you digged a lot into Toltec knowledge.\n\nI can also shut up and read more or comment what other people write.\n\nDon't have much to show off and I sell nothing..

But I would have not posted about vision coming after some substances use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I texted happens when I&amp;#39;m sober, and I&amp;#39;m not a regular user of nothing but water, food, caffeine and tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;#39;m quite enthusiastic about this small things, it is exciting indeed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t forget I just have no freaking idea what to do with those &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s call them&amp;quot; small visions o visual effects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far for me it&amp;#39;s just a side effect of trying to build a connection with the physical body - which I believe it has wisdom and knowledge - (to start with) and I just found myself not being able to listen, feel, notice it - physical body despite my sports background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That someone may think - yes, that&amp;#39;s a way to know your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think sport by it&amp;#39;s own teaches not so much about the body, when I cannot fit in different social situations or approaching well a job interview or get stuck in difficult relations with my family members, isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through all this struggles the body reacts. Muscular tension, sweaty palms, itchy skin and so on... but I found my self sort of analphabetic, not able to comprehend or connects this &amp;quot;symptoms&amp;quot; with my state at the very moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So such things push me into exercising to contact the body. Tensegrity it&amp;#39;s very interesting to do that. And I&amp;#39;ll give it a try to dark room too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s of any help, I also practiced some daily tensegrity for months some years ago, and tried out recapitulation several times. Which is hard and boring as f. although I won&amp;#39;t exclude to give it a go again. It&amp;#39;s also fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other smaller practices such as long walks and trekking with eyes crossed. Then I stopped practices for years until last couple of months, getting slowly back into topics, books, and some very gentle practice to start with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that can explain, in the remote case those visual effects are something promising for real, why I get them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it&amp;#39;s just the lack of oxygen in my brain. I&amp;#39;m quite ok with that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really don&amp;#39;t need attention here on Reddit, I wanted to share and listen to your sincere opinions, since it seems you digged a lot into Toltec knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can also shut up and read more or comment what other people write.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t have much to show off and I sell nothing..

You go to their social media and find they have their hand out for cash.  With breath work being one of the services they offer.\n\nThey somehow tie it to sorcery, as if they've found the key after all this time, and can help others learn sorcery.\n\nWhen they have 0 actual sorcery knowledge.\n\nOften they're using a delusional system like Wim Hof, who claims there's Tibetan holy men who gave him his magical breath techniques.\n\nWhen in fact, there's only Buddhist con artists up in Tibet.  Or anywhere else.\n\nApparently Wim felt bad about his \"invention\" later on, and his son took over the gigantic enterprise he created with his make believe magical breath techniques.\n\nSo \"breath work\" often involves egotism and greed, the very things we fight so hard to eliminate during darkroom.\n\nAlso, it interferes with the natural change in the breath that takes place when you actually do manage to move your assemblage point.\n\nTo use a very crude analogy, if you took a teenage boy who was a virgin to a brothel and told the girls to use him any way they like for the next month, his first encounter with an actual teenage girl who likes him would not be the same at all.\n\nToo much sex would ruin that first time and likely awkward experience.\n\nSame for breathwork. It spoils the natural breath change that marks an achievement during darkroom by signaling when the assemblage point has switched sides on the body.\n\nEven worse, doing breathwork convinces people they're on the path to learning, when they are not.\n\nIt functions as a placebo to make people put off doing what really needs to be done if you seriously want to learn sorcery.\n\nThey take a placebo, in place of real medicine.\n\nThat didn't go well for Steve Jobs, I've heard.\n\nStill, there are instructions about how to control the breath during Tensegrity, and Carol Tiggs taught at one workshop that you could blow through straws as a sorcery technique.\n\nAnd in some realms in the second attention, blowing on another person can cause dramatic effects.\n\nSo I tried it out myself, and Carol Tiggs was right.

You go to their social media and find they have their hand out for cash.  With breath work being one of the services they offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They somehow tie it to sorcery, as if they&amp;#39;ve found the key after all this time, and can help others learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they have 0 actual sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often they&amp;#39;re using a delusional system like Wim Hof, who claims there&amp;#39;s Tibetan holy men who gave him his magical breath techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact, there&amp;#39;s only Buddhist con artists up in Tibet.  Or anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently Wim felt bad about his &amp;quot;invention&amp;quot; later on, and his son took over the gigantic enterprise he created with his make believe magical breath techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;breath work&amp;quot; often involves egotism and greed, the very things we fight so hard to eliminate during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, it interferes with the natural change in the breath that takes place when you actually do manage to move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To use a very crude analogy, if you took a teenage boy who was a virgin to a brothel and told the girls to use him any way they like for the next month, his first encounter with an actual teenage girl who likes him would not be the same at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too much sex would ruin that first time and likely awkward experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for breathwork. It spoils the natural breath change that marks an achievement during darkroom by signaling when the assemblage point has switched sides on the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even worse, doing breathwork convinces people they&amp;#39;re on the path to learning, when they are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It functions as a placebo to make people put off doing what really needs to be done if you seriously want to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They take a placebo, in place of real medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That didn&amp;#39;t go well for Steve Jobs, I&amp;#39;ve heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, there are instructions about how to control the breath during Tensegrity, and Carol Tiggs taught at one workshop that you could blow through straws as a sorcery technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in some realms in the second attention, blowing on another person can cause dramatic effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I tried it out myself, and Carol Tiggs was right. It did indeed work. I could literally set things I could barely see in the second attention fog on fire by blowing on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done it nightly ever since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be used to make a phantom room more vivid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the bottom line is, breath work is fine as long as it actually makes the second attention visible to you in such a manner that you can exploit the effect and make it grow.

I got the impression they were mostly meeting in dreaming, and not in the real world.  \n\nI didn't see proof of that in his book, because when you tell a story you leave out as many details as you include.  And the act of doing that creates a very misleading impression. \n\nBut there was certainly something hinky going on with Carlos' claims about getting together with don Juan so often.  He's almost taunting us in that last book, to take the final step and figure out what's up.\n\nOne time he said in class that some of the women high up in the group had even met don Juan.  I guess it couldn't have been one of the witches, because they were already woven into the story with their books.  Unfortunately, I don't remember which women it was. I only remember that it was probably 2 of them, and they had a sort of puzzled look on their faces, something which happened often when he included group members for \"proof\".  \n\nFor example, one day he told us that the witches had disappeared.  Lost in the second attention!  He was seemingly distraught over it.  We had no way to know if it was true. They didn't attend all classes.  \n\nBut in the next class, there they were.  When asked one of them said, with an obviously puzzled expression, \u201cWe went shopping...\"\n\nLikewise, we had a dissenter in the group, a beautiful young woman who refused to cut her long hair. Even so, she was highly favored by Carlos.  Her husband was also fairly high up in the group, but Carlos had sort of pulled them apart (and permanently I've been told).\n\nBeing both \"in\" and not in the inner circle made her the perfect gossip source.  She wasn't obligated to secrecy, but she still got to see almost everything.  She didn't gossip openly. It was usually in a whisper, very discretely, and at an appropriate time.  She was backed up by a couple of female friends who would also spread the information they got from her, and sometimes they all did it so well you couldn't remember who had told you. \n\nIt was common for a woman to walk behind me, even though I was standing right up near Carlos who was still lecturing, and whisper a correction in my ear.   Unless I dared to turn and call attention to her, I couldn't see who it was.\n\nThere were also impromptu discussions which broke out after class, but while Carlos and the witches were still around, perhaps still talking to people. And so one time someone was quietly discussing whether it was true that those women saw don Juan in Alameda park. And one of the gossip sisters said they had told her about it.  They were sitting on a bench, Carlos pointed to some random man, and told them that \"now they'd seen don Juan\".\n\nI hope the newbies aren't put off by this kind of info. It was common in classes.  Just see if the techniques work, by practicing them. After you realize they work, the mystery of who don Juan was will be even more meaningful.  It's more like a gift to us, than a doubt.\n\nMy take on it, right now, is that Carlos met someone in the Mojave Desert region who realized Carlos was a unique chance to spread the knowledge all over the world.  They contrived the books for that purpose.    But I can't prove that.\n\nThe even more weird explanation would be that Carlos made it all up himself.  That explanation is weirder, because what he taught is unique and truer than anything else I've run into.  I get to do things these days that Buddhists and Yogis refuse to believe.  I've tried talking to them, to try to match notes.

He&amp;#39;s almost taunting us in that last book, to take the final step and figure out what&amp;#39;s up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time he said in class that some of the women high up in the group had even met don Juan.  I guess it couldn&amp;#39;t have been one of the witches, because they were already woven into the story with their books.  Unfortunately, I don&amp;#39;t remember which women it was. I only remember that it was probably 2 of them, and they had a sort of puzzled look on their faces, something which happened often when he included group members for &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, one day he told us that the witches had disappeared.  Lost in the second attention!  He was seemingly distraught over it.  We had no way to know if it was true. They didn&amp;#39;t attend all classes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the next class, there they were.  When asked one of them said, with an obviously puzzled expression, \u201cWe went shopping...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we had a dissenter in the group, a beautiful young woman who refused to cut her long hair. Even so, she was highly favored by Carlos.  Her husband was also fairly high up in the group, but Carlos had sort of pulled them apart (and permanently I&amp;#39;ve been told).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being both &amp;quot;in&amp;quot; and not in the inner circle made her the perfect gossip source.  She wasn&amp;#39;t obligated to secrecy, but she still got to see almost everything.  She didn&amp;#39;t gossip openly. It was usually in a whisper, very discretely, and at an appropriate time.  She was backed up by a couple of female friends who would also spread the information they got from her, and sometimes they all did it so well you couldn&amp;#39;t remember who had told you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was common for a woman to walk behind me, even though I was standing right up near Carlos who was still lecturing, and whisper a correction in my ear.   Unless I dared to turn and call attention to her, I couldn&amp;#39;t see who it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were also impromptu discussions which broke out after class, but while Carlos and the witches were still around, perhaps still talking to people. And so one time someone was quietly discussing whether it was true that those women saw don Juan in Alameda park. And one of the gossip sisters said they had told her about it.  They were sitting on a bench, Carlos pointed to some random man, and told them that &amp;quot;now they&amp;#39;d seen don Juan&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope the newbies aren&amp;#39;t put off by this kind of info. It was common in classes.  Just see if the techniques work, by practicing them. After you realize they work, the mystery of who don Juan was will be even more meaningful.  It&amp;#39;s more like a gift to us, than a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My take on it, right now, is that Carlos met someone in the Mojave Desert region who realized Carlos was a unique chance to spread the knowledge all over the world.  They contrived the books for that purpose.    But I can&amp;#39;t prove that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The even more weird explanation would be that Carlos made it all up himself.  That explanation is weirder, because what he taught is unique and truer than anything else I&amp;#39;ve run into.  I get to do things these days that Buddhists and Yogis refuse to believe.  I&amp;#39;ve tried talking to them, to try to match notes.  They&amp;#39;re nowhere near this territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/aznw46/becoming_accessible_to_power/eid275e/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1552409172.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_aznw46", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eib29k5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "HeyHeyJG", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1552340040.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_aznw46", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_619z0", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Thank you", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eib29k5", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/aznw46/becoming_accessible_to_power/eib29k5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1552340040.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_aznw46", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eib3blb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TheDongJuan", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1552340764.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_aznw46", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_1rmyhqva", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Yess", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eib3blb", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yess&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/aznw46/becoming_accessible_to_power/eib3blb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1552340764.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_aznw46", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

How technology affects socialization.  Look up \"The Book of Adam\" and commentaries on it, if you want to know more.   Since Adam was a farmer, God taught him the technology that farmers need.  Metallurgy to make tools, animal husbandry, and a host of other things you would need to maintain that grove of fruit and nut trees, which included at least one fig tree for covering up your private parts as Eve did after having being impregnated by both Adam, and the \"Serpent\".  Thus Cain and Abel were born of 2 separate fathers.\n\nThe knowledge of metalurgy and agricultural science gave the descendants of Adam (the Jewish peoples) an advantage over the fishers and hunters created 2 days earlier in Genesis.  Adam was the \"farmer\" (a man to till the field) among the first people created by God (in that fictional story).\n\nIn my opinion, the Bible is actually the sad story of the rise of agriculture, and the bad results it had on the world.\n\nSome Qabalists are aware of that, but it rains on their \"magic man\" parade, so you'd get some angry responses if you asked them about it.\n\nIt's a pity.  Cabalism is the closest thing around these days, to what we do.\n\nIt's a silence based technology.\n\nAbsolute silence. Not pretend silence such as you get from eastern practices which use substitute internal dialogues in the form of mantras, Koans and meditation.\n\nThe Jewish Prophets bent in half (putting the forehead near the ankles as can happen when learning to switch to the energy body), and forced all thoughts and feelings from their entire body.\n\nWhen the second attention inevitably emerges, and probably due to keeping their eyes closed, they see the \"colors\" we see.  But with emphasis towards whitish yellows and pinks.\n\nAt least, having done a similar technique I'd assume they're getting that less \"colorful\" stuff.  Pink can be used to visit heaven and God.\n\nChair silence people also tend to see those colors at first.\n\nBut then the Jewish prophets went haywire, and assumed that was the \"light of God\", or some other such religiously motivated thing, and once they managed to interreact with inorganic beings they started making up book deals for themselves.\n\nIOB + greedy sorcerer = book deal.\n\nAnd they succeeded in the ultimate book deal!  The bible.\n\nI shouldn't criticize them so strongly, because in fact the world was a pretty harsh place back then, and some \"rules from God\", if well designed, certainly was  helpful to mankind in general.\n\nBut still, a lie is a lie.\n\nWe can know for a fact that they were making it up, because you don't interact with inorganic beings (demons and angels) more than a few times, before it becomes obvious they'll take on any form, and \"say\" anything you might have expected.\n\nBut instead of clarifying that point after their initial writings (or verbal story telling), they created \"The Book of Job\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "John Dee's Mirror", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"95za2m5cj1s71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/95za2m5cj1s71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=665b66fc9ccc08fe4d3a61446d367ce010734c20"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/95za2m5cj1s71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89af5a82a66c3965669047001efec61cffa65287"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/95za2m5cj1s71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3bbaba015d73806a0bf555938b54ae71f4a70c9"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/95za2m5cj1s71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97855c3b1fa7dce2b93a464d8766cec5adaa1fe1"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/95za2m5cj1s71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54a257f7d22bba044d3cdeb490078f88fcaa4002"}], "s": {"y": 543, "x": 965, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/95za2m5cj1s71.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01386af4131812bac68c9316877cf609719f0641"}, "id": "95za2m5cj1s71"}, "rs11mopdk1s71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 130, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rs11mopdk1s71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a0b718936b0800870a9549d3c4b70cf43321460"}, {"y": 260, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rs11mopdk1s71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca074db6d99c377f6814f412bdf116ba296fd6cb"}, {"y": 385, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rs11mopdk1s71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7673a89be867a7b90031b94d672e72b2d191024c"}], "s": {"y": 590, "x": 490, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rs11mopdk1s71.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dac29dbe78090393f198a9ea28c083e60216f62"}, "id": "rs11mopdk1s71"}, "g0fkzc62u1s71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 153, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g0fkzc62u1s71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=376adc81951f44fb40fe7199db36e06041acc0c8"}, {"y": 307, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g0fkzc62u1s71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8fb4b3d6de100c640568d171bc46203b7cf6bb5"}], "s": {"y": 370, "x": 260, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g0fkzc62u1s71.jpg?width=260&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bc678786b787a5ac8e0bd06dbb7a4e1e1b055cb"}, "id": "g0fkzc62u1s71"}}, "name": "t3_q3as0p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 18, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bl2TRC2DzeQL_IkadbbsQRwcVQEJq5AMZfb9-l60U6U.jpg", "edited": 1633710235.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1633618302.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/95za2m5cj1s71.png?width=965&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01386af4131812bac68c9316877cf609719f0641\"&gt;

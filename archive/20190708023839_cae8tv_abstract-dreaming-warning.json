[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "Carlos talked about abstract dreaming a few times in classes, but never completely defined it.  It was clear that it was different than ordinary dreams, or even *dreaming*.  It was also clear that while engaging in abstract *dreaming*, you probably weren\u2019t anything like yourself.  It was abstract, and almost impossible to describe.\n\nI doubt if anyone of us hasn\u2019t experienced abstract dreaming.   Just about any injury or stress can trigger it.\n\nI'll try to define it:  Silence loosens the assemblage point.  Tensegrity, stalking, and peering into the second attention can move it.\n\nBut so can damage.  You can start off with some damage or poor health issue which sets the assemblage point movement slightly off, it goes right or left more than normal, and you end up with abstract dreaming.  Carlos used to trace the paths the assemblage point could go, and there were quite a few he never outlined. They involved a sideways shift.\n\nAs a child, I used to have a feverish dream anytime I got a major virus like the flu. I was a sphere about the size of big marble, rolling down a reddish tube, and finally plunging into a pool of yellow static.  It was such a regular and predictable dream that I knew for a certainty, after I plunged into the pool of static I could start it over by waking up, and closing my eyes again.  I liked that ride down the tube, and into madness.  I had actually become familiar with every dip and turn in that tube, and knew how long it would be before the big plunge.\n\nWhen I got older, I described the dream to someone esoterically minded and they said, \u201cYou had a dream about being born!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think so, but that\u2019s the kind of thing you get out of abstract dreams.  And then they get colored by your own beliefs, or those of the people around you. In this case, Buddhist or Hindu, thus the belief in someone being aware of the birthing process.\n\nIt's not a good idea to bring your religion along, when trying to understand abstract dreams.  Belief is a very heavy object to carry around there.\n\nI\u2019m writing this now, because I fear all of you will have to pass through an abstract dreaming barrier, in order to learn to change worlds. Abstract dreams are at least a little outside the human form. And if you experience them before losing that,  the interaction between the two can be somewhat unpleasant.\n\nI don\u2019t mean you won\u2019t change worlds at all before you overcome this barrier.  I just mean, as you get better and better at silence and manipulating the second attention, things will evolve. What was exciting the first time will become common.  You won\u2019t even count it as a successful experience.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to keep searching for new avenues, because any new position of the assemblage point releases energy, which gives you a boost.   With those initial boosts you\u2019ll certainly have some amazing experiences.  But each time, you\u2019ll use up the energy from that position of the assemblage point, and have to find another thing to try.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the problem;  greed.\n\nGreed is good.  But only if you\u2019re a *clever* greedy bastard.  You have to be able to evaluate an experience at the time it\u2019s happening, not later on.    That means ignoring your greed temporarily, and making use of that merchant mind.  When your greed worries, bring out the merchant mind (rationality) to check out what's really going on.\n\nDon Juan said you have to overcome the merchant mind, but as a Stormtrooper, you don\u2019t have to follow the Warrior rules.  The merchant mind is great;  don Juan was just too wealthy to value it.\n\nBe an impeccable merchant. That\u2019s one who can instantly evaluate an experience, and determine if it\u2019s time to change directions, because there just isn\u2019t enough profit in it.\n\nBe the Ferengi of merchant minds (a StarTrek reference).    If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll make less progress because the world of sorcery is as vast as the universe, and it\u2019s easy to waste your time on something that\u2019s not valuable enough to pursue.\n\nFor starters, give up *dreaming*.  Go for silence, and the dreaming worlds only accessible from there.  Those are more valuable than the kind you get by waking up inside a normal dream, because you don\u2019t have to fight for lucidity or time.  You\u2019ll remain lucid there as long as you don\u2019t get absorbed in the details of the dream, and believe you belong there too much.  And you can remain for weeks in that kind of dream.\n\nNot being an impeccable merchant has cost me many wonderful experiences.\n\nFor example, last night I was practicing silence and gazing at colors in the darkness, when I found myself at a familiar boundry.  I had assembled another world, and it was right in front of me. But it felt bad.  Sad.\n\nI was all caught up in the sadness of that world I was staring at, trying to figure out what made it feel bad.   I was sitting up on the bed with my eyes open, and the abstract world was straight ahead.  I could have gotten up and walked into it, except that I didn\u2019t get the urge.  Although it was very vivid and real, and right in front of me, I didn\u2019t have the feeling it would remain if I moved. And to be honest, I can't recall if I actually had a body at that point.\n\nPink slime was dripping off the ruins of old buildings.  The whole place was dissolving into the ground, ravaged by time.  Maybe that's what made it sad?\n\nI heard a voice telling me to, \"Put that down!  Drop that thing!\"\n\nI looked over to someone\u2019s hands, and they were holding a piece of the abstract world. It was lit up like a cheesy christmas ornament with too many LEDs.  But if you looked deep inside, it was indeed a piece of that world.\n\nThey showed me how to lean it up against the wall, and only use it as a guide.\n\nThere\u2019s where I could have used that impeccable merchant mind.  Who was talking to me?  How come they had hands?  What was the wall I could lean it against?  Was there any profit in this information?  How were the LEDs soldered to the thing?\n\nMaybe knowing that  was worth more than staring at a sad world.  Except perhaps the part about how the LEDs were soldered.\n\nWe all carry our obsessions. An impeccable merchant can't get caught up in small details.\n\nBut I *was* caught up in the abstract dream, possibly triggered by too high of an intoxicant level.  Left over chardonnay.  It had worn off, but I\u2019d exceeded recommended levels earlier in the day.  I suggest some of you will discover this.  There are ultimately reasons for some rules. But it's best to wait until you discover them yourself, than to pretend to know about it.  The pretending itself will create a barrier.\n\nI peered back into the abstract melting world, then turned my head to the right, to make sure the object was only leaning against the wall now, as I was advised, and that I wasn\u2019t overusing it.\n\nI had to admit; the dream was less sad that way.  I decided I\u2019d been looking through it full on, and the multi-colored glow of that object was too overpowering.  Thus the sadness.  When it was only leaning there, barely present, things were more managable.\n\nA voice said, \u201cDo you even know who you are?\u201d\n\nI was offended.  Of course I know who I am!  But after a few more minutes of staring at the unattainable world, I lay on my side to ponder what had gone so wrong in my dreaming.\n\nThe next morning when I awoke, I realized the truth.  I literally jumped up in bed and said, \u201cWho the hell was that????\u201d\n\nI could have used a Ferengi escort in that dream.  I'd have gotten a talking to for sure.\n\nEdited: six times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Abstract Dreaming Warning", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cae8tv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562609143.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562546319.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos talked about abstract dreaming a few times in classes, but never completely defined it.

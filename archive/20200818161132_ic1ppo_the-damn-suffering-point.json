On my second dream I recall being in the dream (do not remember what happened) but was not able to move within the dream (meaning I had no control of the dream AKA lucid dreaming). The part the I remember is being aware of the dream and trying to wake up... which I did, but then I was in another dream without knowing. This time I did not knew I was sleeping until I actually woke up by my alarm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am talking to &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; and calling for IOB&amp;#39;s during my practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ic1ppo/the_damn_suffering_point/g20dcae/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1597772791.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ic1ppo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g23gshx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1597841427.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g22txba", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It depends on each person, on whether they have consumed power plants, their commitment and sometimes just \"luck\" or \"Intent gifts\".\nA girl here reached heightened awareness (what they call enlighment) in her 3rd day of practice.\nBut before reaching that, you can feel small shifts.

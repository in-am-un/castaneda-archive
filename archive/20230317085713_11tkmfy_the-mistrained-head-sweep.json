And the details are irrelevant.\n\nThat's actually a rather \"too good to be true\" thing about sorcery.\n\nAnd yet, talk about too good to be true!  Did  you know that three people in our present and past, found a picture of the Nagual Julian out there in all the realities you can travel to, once you master silence?\n\nI mean, who doesn't want to see what Julian looked like?\n\nAnd with 3 having seen it, myself included, doesn't that give you a little confidence that the books describe sorcerers who actually did exist?\n\nMeaning, maybe Carlos didn't hide all of those identities by making up most of those details in the books?\n\nLet me back off on that.\n\nOne theory in the past was that Carlos learned sorcery in Peru when he was just a teen, and then made up the whole \"don Juan thing\" to pass on something important through a story.\n\nLike the cartoons I hope to make.  They have no basis in reality.  And yet, we can in fact create a wave of real magic out there.  How long it can last is unknown.   Greed always buries magic over time.\n\nWe still ought to try regardless.\n\nDespite the fact that we all watch too many Batman type heroes always win in their tales of power.\n\nThey get bloody, some die and are brought back to life, but the overall flow is that the good guys always win.  Otherwise, who would watch it?\n\nOf course the fake magic systems also pitch heros that never lose.  The amazing Grand Poobah!  He's achieved the ultimate, and will teach you for a small fee or some free labor helping him market his product.\n\nWe're saturated with phony successes.\n\nBut the reality of magic is that the hero often dies of cancer before he's done.\n\nOr that people say he's cranky, unreasonable,  a pervert, or just plain mean.\n\nThis is one reason I kind of like the jewish religion.  The \"good guys\" in their writings, screw up mostly.  And their lives kind of suck.\n\nStill, the jews managed to pull that very long sad story off, because it has a happy ending.  You just have to die, to see it all work out in heaven.\n\nDonations please...\n\nWe all have unrealistic goals when it comes to learning magic, and some beginners even seem to believe they get to pick and choose.\n\nIf they don't like the idea that there's actually no heaven, no angels, and no God, they can simply take their business elsewhere.\n\nWhere \"love\" is the principle of the universe.  I mean, why join an ugly belief system which claims we live in a predatorial universe?  That's so pessimistic!\n\nBut as always those darned witches confuse everything, so that a sincere male can't actually make any valid points along those lines.\n\nWhich hopefully I can hint at soon.\n\nWomen just need inspiration.  They have the magic built into them.\n\nThe womb.\n\nMen get inspired too, but their inspiration is for how they can take over the tribe, and dominate everyone around them.  They don't get inspired and produce magic the way witches do.  They get inspired to greed.\n\nI have a problem here, and that's that I saw this just now in a \"cartoon\" in the air.\n\nAnd the points it made flowed naturally, one after the other.\n\nThat's how Silent Knowledge, our goal, works.\n\nBut the points that flow one to the other are quite a bit like a stoner's revelations.\n\nWatch Cheech and Chong movies and they might have that kind of \"surfer dude\" dialogue going on.  Or a Bill and Ted movie.  One stoner says something like, \"What if life was just a cosmic bran muffin?\"\n\nAnd the other is so high he says, \"Dude...   That's so profound!\"\n\nSo they head to the local mini mart to stock up on bran muffins.\n\nOr according to a family friend from when I was a child hearing about shamans and native americans from anthropologists, he liked the idea of a don Juan but the shamans he talked to didn't sound like college professors. They sounded more like those surfer dude stoners.\n\nI really should find Lowell's famous description. It was something like, the real native american shamans talk more like, \"When the yellow mushroom flies over the mountain, than the spirit flies into the lake.\"\n\nShamans are schizophrenic from lots and lots of drugs.  But don Juan didn't sound like that.\n\nThat was Lowell's mistake.  Don Juan wasn't an asshole (shaman).  Said so himself.\n\nDon't let that confuse beginners.  Among shamans, you have those who rose higher. Sorcerers.  And they dumped the drugs 8000  years ago.\n\nShamans are the lazy ones who like many of those who read this, found that learning to be silent was more effort than they were willing to make. So they turned to Devil's Weed.\n\nYet it's really all about moving what we call \"the assemblage point\".  Drugs can move it, but so can silence, used to retrain your view of the world.\n\nBut how does silence retrain your view?\n\nThere's where you have a sort of \"chicken or egg?\" situation.\n\nSo you get silent, and retrain your very being?\n\nOr do you retrain your being using sustained action, and that produces silence?\n\nYes!\n\nTo both.\n\nThat's the problem.\n\nCarlos realized it was very difficult for us to learn to get silent,  early on in private classes.\n\nDue to that \"superman effect\" I hinted at, where beginners expect the heroes to always win, we didn't really notice when he discovered everyone was a lazy bastard.\n\nExcept the witches.  I always have to add that.\n\nHe realized that while he COVETED silence above all else, with hundreds of hours of \"the right way of walking\", and gazing, and even becoming Joe Cordoba the fry cook expert on eggs, his followers really didn't want to do all that work.\n\nSo he created \"silence toys\" for people to play with.\n\nToys which I'll readily tell everyone, serve no purpose at all.\n\nAnd yet, work wonders for beginners.\n\nThere's the \"silence stick\".  A 2.5 foot or so long pole with a pad on the end, on which you sit cross legged and lean into it, forehead on the pad.\n\nIt has a dual purpose.  One is to make you horribly uncomfortable so you want to \"get it over with\", with silence on your mind.\n\nBut the other is to alert you to an interesting thing.  How while forcing silence in a comfortable armchair with your eyes closed, it's interesting that the head suddenly falls forward and you can't keep it up. And it kind of hurts!\n\nBut the struggle to keep your head from painfully falling onto your chest, causes you to explore the middle range between dozing off, and remaining conscious. That's the \"Second Attention\"!\n\nYou also have the stones you put between your fingers.\n\nAlso completely useless!  And yet by squeezing those you have symbolically represented the horrors of your internal dialogue, as a terrible pain between your fingers.\n\nYou rounded that demon up into a tiny little area, and  are crushing it.\n\nSo one important cartoon we could make is the one to explain what internal silence really is, and how to get it.\n\nSo that people don't get confused by some fake magic system where silence is when you remove all thoughts of hate from your mind, and let the love thoughts shine.\n\nSome even thought it just meant taking a \"vow of silence\" like a monk.\n\nIn this cartoon about silence you show what it is clearly, and even show some humorous \"don't be like this guy\" examples.\n\nBut then, you can't go any further to explain it from the mouth of the Carlos in the cartoons.\n\nWe must not modify what he wrote!\n\nThat will break the link to intent he created. A link back to the old seers, 8000 years ago.\n\nAs far as we know, what they discovered in terms of sorcery is no more \"real\" than the surfer dudes pondering the profound idea that the universe is a bran muffin.\n\nIt's just perhaps that, they pondered that for thousands years.  Until surprisingly, it started to really make sense and they used it to do \"practical magic\".\n\nWho cares if a magical system is delusional, as long as the magic is real?\n\nIn other systems the magic is always \"over there on the highest mountain in Tibet\", and you aren't worthy yet to see it.  Let alone learn it.\n\nIn this cartoon, so as not be alter what Carlos created, all we ought to do is have Carlos push some unfortunate soul out in front of the class, and have them explain what they believe will help people learn to be silent.\n\nWe ought not put words in the mouth of Carlos.\n\nBut that's not a misrepresentation of what Carlos actually did to teach.\n\nHe gave very few details most of the time.\n\nBecause unfortunately, when he did start to discuss advanced sorcery he sounded more like Lowell Bean's stoned indian guy saying, \"When the yellow mushroom flies over the...\"\n\nI find that myself these days.  I get a silent knowledge lecture, in the form of cartoons on my darkroom walls!\n\nSorcery is weird.\n\nSo one person might be pushed in front of the class in this cartoon, and explain what they think is the best path.\n\nIf you push a Cholita out there, you'll get an earful.\n\nAnd it won't make much sense, because you'll hear echoes of Florinda in it.\n\nIf you read all of the books, and all of the lecture notes, you'll have noticed that when the witches lecture, some in the audience cry.\n\nThe chacmools had to tell them to please tone it down?\n\nWe don't need to hear that Juan Tuma stuck his scrotum in the face of Carol Tiggs, saying she had to stare at it to remove a \"blockage\".\n\nThat's HORRIBLE.  Techno once found my experiment with that approach on an enthusiastic young woman who found the subreddit, quite amusing.\n\nIf not a little sad.\n\nShe was eager to learn witchcraft, until I told her the scrotum story.\n\nAfter that Techno said, \"Well... She's gone now...\"\n\nAs if that weren't expected.\n\nActually, I was a tiny bit surprised.\n\nBecause I get to talk to real witches, and in fact they're far nastier than men!\n\nBut our social order has decided we must pretend that women are shocked by sex, and it's the beastly men who force it on them.\n\nWhen actually the opposite is true.\n\nWhich might explain why when Cholita leaves her notebook out to a page she hopes I'll notice and read, thus violating her privacy, I might see something like \"February 12th. Seduced Dan to get what I wanted.\"\n\nShe likes to do the old, \"Oh my, I dropped my pen. I'll just bend way over to pick it  up.  And that evil Dan better not be staring at my butt while I do it.\"\n\nI love that...\n\nShe even does it in the phantom copy of our home she created.  While her evil little demon friend Minx, takes a sledgehammer to the bathroom tiles.\n\nBut back to the cartoon.\n\nCarlos pushes Westerly Witch up there, and she gives a lecture on how to get silent which causes more questions than it gives answers.\n\nAnd most of the audience at Dance home is scratching their head.\n\nBut one or two of the females there look like, \"Well said Westerly Witch!  You always have the best advice!\"\n\nThen Carlos pushes the overthinking it guy up there, and he says he's discovered some really interesting things about silence.\n\nThat you can actually train your muscles to produce it, by focusing on the smoothness of the movements during Tensegrity.\n\nBoth to retrain the muscle memory part of the brain to take over, as if being silent were mandatory for that particular physical movement.\n\nOur muscle memory gets trained both to do movements well, but also to have the correct \"attitude\" doing them.\n\nIt even comes with rituals, like jumping up and down on one foot saying, \"ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch...\" before the pain of smashing your toe against the leg of the coffee table has actually kicked in.\n\nOften to find, you didn't actually hurt it much.\n\nMuscle memory is supreme, and can temporarily control all aspects of our behavior.\n\nSo the nerd man explains that silence can be achieved by paying attention to muscle movements, using the best silence you can currently manage.\n\nHe even finds it amusing that you will fail horribly doing that, not realizing that each day you train it slightly better.\n\nAnd it learn towards what you intended. Even if you believe it isn't working.\n\nAt that point in the cartoon you might have Westerly Witch say, \"Yea, that's what I said!  You just WANT to be silent.  That's all.\"\n\nA valid female point of view.\n\nBut not any help to the men.\n\nAnd so the nerd guy, who can put any words we like into the mouth of Cartoon Carlos, without any damage to what real Carlos created, and especially if we have our cartoon Carlos raise his eyebrows to cast some doubt on what the confident male nerd is \"mansplaining\",  goes on to tell everyone his \"big realization\".\n\nThe breakthrough idea he had just last night.\n\nWhich is in fact very good, but useless to half the class.\n\nUseless to the women, beyond giving them the feeling there is in fact a group in the process of learning real magic here.\n\nWhich inspires them to work harder.\n\nAll you really need with witches.\n\nBy the way, Carlos did in fact use the '\"raised eyebrow\" approach to teaching.\n\nI learned Zuleica's pass by that method.\n\nCarlos taught it to me on my first day in private classes in 1994.\n\nIt was before \"long forms\". He taught only individual movements for a while.\n\nHe showed it to us, then walked up to me and wanted me to show him.\n\nI did the best I could.\n\nHe raised his eyebrows.\n\nSo I was thinking, \"No? I got it wrong???\"\n\nI emphasized what I thought to be the key details.\n\nHow the hips shift left and right gently, but also rotate.  So that you are literally \"sweeping the floor\", with an invisible broom stuck to your stomach.\n\nI believe Carlos told Jadey, it sweeps the glow of awareness off the spot down between your toes.\n\nThus reducing the \"me, me, me\" obsession.\n\nBut Carlos didn't seem to buy my second try at doing the new \"Zuleica's Pass\" right.\n\nHis eyebrows raised even higher.\n\nSo I desperately tried to vary it a tiny bit every few seconds, hoping for a smile of recognition.\n\nWorried that the entire class was watching me.  Embarrassed to do badly on my first day.\n\nCarlos noticed that. It was obvious.\n\nAnd he finally shook his head a tiny bit,  as if \"this is really sad...\"\n\nAnd walked off to the next person with a sly smile.\n\nCarlos liked to make us uncomfortable.\n\nIt brings the double around, to see what the hell is going on.\n\nSo nerd guy explains his big idea.\n\n\"The head sweep in recapitulation stores the intent of silence!  That's also why it works during darkroom, to gaze for dream bubbles left and right.\n\nThat's also why recapitulation hasn't produced magic all these years.\n\nEveryone is mistraining their headsweep to store the intent fantasizing instead of recapitulating.\n\nThey store the intent of boredom, instead of teaching the smooth muscle movement of the neck to invoke silence!\"\n\nActually quite true.\n\nAnd yet, also totally useless for learning silence.\n\nIt really only serves to inspire people to find their own \"tips\".\n\nWhich causes them to \"treat sorcery as real\".\n\nWhich causes the assemblage point to shift horizontally, to make it so.\n\nJust like Westerly Witch would say.\n\nYou learn sorcery, by KNOWING you are learning it.\n\nFor women that is.\n\nMen? Not so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Mistrained Head Sweep", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 139, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ngeb4nkllboa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 107, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9877babf6a73b7b5676e57c4dcd75befda30e2b"}, {"y": 214, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39dc5c56376d7de51b03c393bae94cd518d649e7"}, {"y": 318, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5b1868c2462c32b8e2f07fd8468935eceb3722e"}, {"y": 636, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f507206f308af44ae243f9a07b7f252c923db236"}, {"y": 955, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=875b1c7059c38ae5353b79cf99e197fe48b54274"}, {"y": 1074, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69e0bd83538cc9bc45c2b841df7c0a9df3d1f2bd"}], "s": {"y": 1596, "x": 1604, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=1604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e3913ba039648e66b5380d8daf460e28a5f452"}, "id": "ngeb4nkllboa1"}}, "name": "t3_11tkmfy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/n9M9BTtxW37d4-t3ILIiYYRpuRAwDhT6KTIcAQURnSg.jpg", "edited": 1679237316.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1679039833.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=1604&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1e3913ba039648e66b5380d8daf460e28a5f452\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ngeb4nkllboa1.png?width=1604&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1e3913ba039648e66b5380d8daf460e28a5f452&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will go right over the heads of beginners, but it&amp;#39;s still good for them to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intermediate will suddenly realize this was obvious!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And anyone who can see advanced stages will wonder if it doesn&amp;#39;t actually indicate what don Juan meant when Carlos asked for more information on how to learn some aspect of sorcery, thinking it was a good question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don Juan answered that it was not, because any advice he could give Carlos would simply be &amp;quot;what he himself did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the advanced might also wonder if anything we might do to &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; is completely misguided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that the simplest explanation for how you learn sorcery is simply that you intend it.

Drugs can move it, but so can silence, used to retrain your view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how does silence retrain your view?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s where you have a sort of &amp;quot;chicken or egg?&amp;quot; situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you get silent, and retrain your very being?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or do you retrain your being using sustained action, and that produces silence?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos realized it was very difficult for us to learn to get silent,  early on in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to that &amp;quot;superman effect&amp;quot; I hinted at, where beginners expect the heroes to always win, we didn&amp;#39;t really notice when he discovered everyone was a lazy bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except the witches.  I always have to add that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He realized that while he COVETED silence above all else, with hundreds of hours of &amp;quot;the right way of walking&amp;quot;, and gazing, and even becoming Joe Cordoba the fry cook expert on eggs, his followers really didn&amp;#39;t want to do all that work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he created &amp;quot;silence toys&amp;quot; for people to play with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Toys which I&amp;#39;ll readily tell everyone, serve no purpose at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, work wonders for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;silence stick&amp;quot;.  A 2.5 foot or so long pole with a pad on the end, on which you sit cross legged and lean into it, forehead on the pad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has a dual purpose.  One is to make you horribly uncomfortable so you want to &amp;quot;get it over with&amp;quot;, with silence on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the other is to alert you to an interesting thing.  How while forcing silence in a comfortable armchair with your eyes closed, it&amp;#39;s interesting that the head suddenly falls forward and you can&amp;#39;t keep it up. And it kind of hurts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the struggle to keep your head from painfully falling onto your chest, causes you to explore the middle range between dozing off, and remaining conscious. That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;Second Attention&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also have the stones you put between your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also completely useless!  And yet by squeezing those you have symbolically represented the horrors of your internal dialogue, as a terrible pain between your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You rounded that demon up into a tiny little area, and  are crushing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one important cartoon we could make is the one to explain what internal silence really is, and how to get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that people don&amp;#39;t get confused by some fake magic system where silence is when you remove all thoughts of hate from your mind, and let the love thoughts shine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some even thought it just meant taking a &amp;quot;vow of silence&amp;quot; like a monk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this cartoon about silence you show what it is clearly, and even show some humorous &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t be like this guy&amp;quot; examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, you can&amp;#39;t go any further to explain it from the mouth of the Carlos in the cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We must not modify what he wrote!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That will break the link to intent he created. A link back to the old seers, 8000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as we know, what they discovered in terms of sorcery is no more &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; than the surfer dudes pondering the profound idea that the universe is a bran muffin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just perhaps that, they pondered that for thousands years.  Until surprisingly, it started to really make sense and they used it to do &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who cares if a magical system is delusional, as long as the magic is real?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other systems the magic is always &amp;quot;over there on the highest mountain in Tibet&amp;quot;, and you aren&amp;#39;t worthy yet to see it.  Let alone learn it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this cartoon, so as not be alter what Carlos created, all we ought to do is have Carlos push some unfortunate soul out in front of the class, and have them explain what they believe will help people learn to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ought not put words in the mouth of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not a misrepresentation of what Carlos actually did to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave very few details most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because unfortunately, when he did start to discuss advanced sorcery he sounded more like Lowell Bean&amp;#39;s stoned indian guy saying, &amp;quot;When the yellow mushroom flies over the...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find that myself these days.  I get a silent knowledge lecture, in the form of cartoons on my darkroom walls!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one person might be pushed in front of the class in this cartoon, and explain what they think is the best path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you push a Cholita out there, you&amp;#39;ll get an earful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it won&amp;#39;t make much sense, because you&amp;#39;ll hear echoes of Florinda in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read all of the books, and all of the lecture notes, you&amp;#39;ll have noticed that when the witches lecture, some in the audience cry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chacmools had to tell them to please tone it down?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need to hear that Juan Tuma stuck his scrotum in the face of Carol Tiggs, saying she had to stare at it to remove a &amp;quot;blockage&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s HORRIBLE.  Techno once found my experiment with that approach on an enthusiastic young woman who found the subreddit, quite amusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not a little sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was eager to learn witchcraft, until I told her the scrotum story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that Techno said, &amp;quot;Well... She&amp;#39;s gone now...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if that weren&amp;#39;t expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, I was a tiny bit surprised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because I get to talk to real witches, and in fact they&amp;#39;re far nastier than men!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But our social order has decided we must pretend that women are shocked by sex, and it&amp;#39;s the beastly men who force it on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When actually the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which might explain why when Cholita leaves her notebook out to a page she hopes I&amp;#39;ll notice and read, thus violating her privacy, I might see something like &amp;quot;February 12th. Seduced Dan to get what I wanted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She likes to do the old, &amp;quot;Oh my, I dropped my pen. I&amp;#39;ll just bend way over to pick it  up.  And that evil Dan better not be staring at my butt while I do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love that...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even does it in the phantom copy of our home she created.  While her evil little demon friend Minx, takes a sledgehammer to the bathroom tiles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to the cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos pushes Westerly Witch up there, and she gives a lecture on how to get silent which causes more questions than it gives answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And most of the audience at Dance home is scratching their head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one or two of the females there look like, &amp;quot;Well said Westerly Witch!  You always have the best advice!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Carlos pushes the overthinking it guy up there, and he says he&amp;#39;s discovered some really interesting things about silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That you can actually train your muscles to produce it, by focusing on the smoothness of the movements during Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both to retrain the muscle memory part of the brain to take over, as if being silent were mandatory for that particular physical movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our muscle memory gets trained both to do movements well, but also to have the correct &amp;quot;attitude&amp;quot; doing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It even comes with rituals, like jumping up and down on one foot saying, &amp;quot;ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch...&amp;quot; before the pain of smashing your toe against the leg of the coffee table has actually kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often to find, you didn&amp;#39;t actually hurt it much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Muscle memory is supreme, and can temporarily control all aspects of our behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the nerd man explains that silence can be achieved by paying attention to muscle movements, using the best silence you can currently manage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He even finds it amusing that you will fail horribly doing that, not realizing that each day you train it slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it learn towards what you intended. Even if you believe it isn&amp;#39;t working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point in the cartoon you might have Westerly Witch say, &amp;quot;Yea, that&amp;#39;s what I said!  You just WANT to be silent.  That&amp;#39;s all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A valid female point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not any help to the men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so the nerd guy, who can put any words we like into the mouth of Cartoon Carlos, without any damage to what real Carlos created, and especially if we have our cartoon Carlos raise his eyebrows to cast some doubt on what the confident male nerd is &amp;quot;mansplaining&amp;quot;,  goes on to tell everyone his &amp;quot;big realization&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough idea he had just last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is in fact very good, but useless to half the class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Useless to the women, beyond giving them the feeling there is in fact a group in the process of learning real magic here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which inspires them to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you really need with witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, Carlos did in fact use the &amp;#39;&amp;quot;raised eyebrow&amp;quot; approach to teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass by that method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos taught it to me on my first day in private classes in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was before &amp;quot;long forms&amp;quot;. He taught only individual movements for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He showed it to us, then walked up to me and wanted me to show him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He raised his eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was thinking, &amp;quot;No? I got it wrong???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I emphasized what I thought to be the key details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How the hips shift left and right gently, but also rotate.  So that you are literally &amp;quot;sweeping the floor&amp;quot;, with an invisible broom stuck to your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Carlos told Jadey, it sweeps the glow of awareness off the spot down between your toes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus reducing the &amp;quot;me, me, me&amp;quot; obsession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos didn&amp;#39;t seem to buy my second try at doing the new &amp;quot;Zuleica&amp;#39;s Pass&amp;quot; right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyebrows raised even higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I desperately tried to vary it a tiny bit every few seconds, hoping for a smile of recognition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worried that the entire class was watching me.  Embarrassed to do badly on my first day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos noticed that. It was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he finally shook his head a tiny bit,  as if &amp;quot;this is really sad...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And walked off to the next person with a sly smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos liked to make us uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It brings the double around, to see what the hell is going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So nerd guy explains his big idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The head sweep in recapitulation stores the intent of silence!  That&amp;#39;s also why it works during darkroom, to gaze for dream bubbles left and right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also why recapitulation hasn&amp;#39;t produced magic all these years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone is mistraining their headsweep to store the intent fantasizing instead of recapitulating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They store the intent of boredom, instead of teaching the smooth muscle movement of the neck to invoke silence!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually quite true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, also totally useless for learning silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really only serves to inspire people to find their own &amp;quot;tips&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which causes them to &amp;quot;treat sorcery as real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which causes the assemblage point to shift horizontally, to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like Westerly Witch would say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learn sorcery, by KNOWING you are learning it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For women that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b5a42f16-6005-11ea-af1f-0e3247926003", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "11tkmfy", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 26, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11tkmfy/the_mistrained_head_sweep/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/11tkmfy/the_mistrained_head_sweep/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1679039833.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jclhbnf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1679076837.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcjze4s", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Not completely screw yourself over.\n\nThey are a good exercise for old people.\n\nMy bones do in fact crack now, just as described about don Juan.\n\nIt's surprising!\n\nAnd possibly they do in fact have some tiny \"chi gung effect\" of giving more vitality.\n\nBut who wants to be Jack Lalanne?\n\nWe want to be Dr. Strange.\n\nIn the case of Tensegrity, you can \"change your evil ways\" at any time.\n\nOther things, like getting mixed up with fake magical systems, sometimes can't be undone.\n\nI hear Mantak Chia and \"The Nagual\" Carlos Castillejos are big in Brazil.\n\nThey're totally screwed...\n\nSo maybe Carlos created Tensegrity also, as something that couldn't easily be corrupted.\n\nEven if people didn't practice it according to his instructions that the muscle memory will help aid you in attaining silence.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jclhbnf", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not completely screw yourself over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are a good exercise for old people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My bones do in fact crack now, just as described about don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s surprising!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And possibly they do in fact have some tiny &amp;quot;chi gung effect&amp;quot;

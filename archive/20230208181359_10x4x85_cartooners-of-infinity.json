It produces some internal dialogue noise, but it's not serious enough that you can't dismiss it with a little effort.\n\nIt's not like it was a \"childhood trauma\". Just an annoying run in with people hopelessly stuck in the river of shit who want you to suffer the same as they're suffering.\n\nThat happens all the time so that \"ignoring\" it is fairly easy. But not completely trivial.\n\nSo as the assemblage point moves along the J curve, it \"flutters\" a bit.\n\nLike a feather dropping in the air, swaying left and right on a curve as it drops.\n\nIf you can just \"brush it off\", it has huge benefits to your sorcery.\n\nIt's why people are told they must find a petty tyrant if one doesn't come along.\n\nBut no one needs to go looking!  We have a constant flow into the subreddit of such people. As your sorcery knowledge grows, give it a shot.  See if you can talk some sense into them.\n\nI'm not good at it.\n\nAnd there's nothing we can do about it, in this subreddit format.\n\nI keep hoping we can move to the next level where people who don't actually want to learn, or even worse have no idea where they are, don't even show up.\n\nBut how?\n\nI don't know.\n\nLast night my Ally Fancy was showing me how to use \"The Abstract\" to make the magic you see during Tensegrity more vivid and real looking.\n\nBut to do that, you have to ignore it.\n\n\"You can't focus your attention right on it!  That burns off dreaming energy\", she explained.\n\nI complained in my mind that in the darkness anything you can see is all magic.  There was nothing to see BUT magic in the air.\n\nSo where could I focus, that wasn't directly looking at the \"special effects\"?\n\nShe said, \"You saw it yesterday.  The abstract is always present between the movements of Tensegrity, once your double is assisting you.\n\nLook between the cracks at the \"smoothness\" of the movements, until you can actually perceive the \"surface\" of the abstract in the move.  Don't just feel your muscles. Turn the feeling into a visual effect, so you can look at that instead of the magic generated by the Tensegrity Form.\n\nShe was right.\n\nI could \"find\" that surface. But only because I'd seen it the day before.\n\nIt was sort of like a bed sheet spread out and floating into the air, except it was the \"shape\" of the tensegrity form.\n\nI got all sorts of paranoid ideas about how Carlos could possibly have pulled that off.\n\nTo design something as complex as Tensegrity, which turns out to have endless layers you can perceive, beyond the obvious sight of the movements.\n\nI told Fancy I was worried I'd forget all this.\n\nBut if I could remember it, I could make a folder on my computer for a cartoon to show what I had learned.\n\nShe said, \"Like this cartoon?\"\n\nAnd my south wall began to play a perfectly formed, finished cartoon I could copy if I could only remember it.\n\nStaring \"Westerly Witch\" going shopping in Santa Monica.\n\nWe need to learn to become \"Readers of Infinity\" if for no other reason than, that's what Carlos wanted us to do.\n\nAND, Silent Knowledge is in fact \"bewildering\" and hard to interpret.  So we ought to try very hard to see text, see \"the whorl\", and even see the pomegranate dot that spits out the text.\n\nWhen you do that you \"fine tune\" your ability to intend, from Silent Knowledge.\n\nAn analogy:\n\nYou might go to a HUGE antique mall, looking for a gift for a friend. I mean, it's VAST.\n\nThose are often located where real estate is cheaper, so they can occupy an entire huge department store style floor, or even more.  Every section of the \"mall\" has a little theme going on.  Sometimes, the theme is as simple as \"Dead Aunt Wilma's Most Prized Possessions\".\n\nThey get a lot of merchandise from estate sales. And often use that as an organizing method to display merchandise.\n\nIf you just walk in with no plan, you'll find an ideal gift within 50 feet of the cash register.\n\nThey put them there on purpose.  Because the mall itself is too burdensome to scour for the good stuff.\n\nIf you pick up one of those antiques near the cash register, then when you leave the store owner will go fetch another to put on that spot. They know the best sellers immediately when they come into the store.\n\nBut if you have a \"goal\" and MUST get your friend a \"brass monkey clock\", you have to search the entire store.\n\nAnd in so doing you become an expert on that particular Antique Mall, and on antique malls in general.\n\nThat's probably why don Juan recommended we learn to read text, instead of taking anything that silent knowledge presents.\n\nNot for the reason he stated. But because it teaches us \"control\".\n\nBut it's still ok to watch cartoons from infinity when they show up on your darkroom wall!\n\nJust don't stare too hard.\n\nDream images don't stand up to being stared at. Even if you are awake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cartooners of Infinity?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"z121mblvuzga1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z121mblvuzga1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d585ed06427f28695974379fc3e7a258152e18ca"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z121mblvuzga1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52c651bac3234f504bba54c50baa36394ac67fce"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z121mblvuzga1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf86c8df539a931f3c692ba8fdb06bd4504393f2"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z121mblvuzga1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43c6c3dbe847bfc9ec97985df694c66239811fd4"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z121mblvuzga1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c65881dab11afa34710ba64b1673d25a11e5b3df"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z121mblvuzga1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26fb3f1af387e79df62d0a7453def0327c14a4bf"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z121mblvuzga1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b401af3897d4479eec7f6ed0abdc6d88fb109111"}, "id": "z121mblvuzga1"}}, "name": "t3_10x4x85", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/HwSCjwmJgqiUFLK2yuI9veZ7IS2RnOMCbZCS1ZSKYvU.jpg", "edited": 1675878721.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1675876439.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z121mblvuzga1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b401af3897d4479eec7f6ed0abdc6d88fb109111\"&gt;Bad Post Hangover?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For trying to bring some reason to that post yesterday, with every religious lurker from India to Tibet coming out of the woodwork to pitch their own self-soothing angry delusions, I had my J curve pathway a bit scrambled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what dealing with petty tyrants does.

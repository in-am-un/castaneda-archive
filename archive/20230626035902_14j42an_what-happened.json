With no concern for how you deviate another person's life, towards something that's an ugly lie.\n\nYou might easily fall victim to those.\n\nThe quality you should look for in yourself is what we call, \"Sobriety\".  Where you look honestly to see what's in front of you, instead of glossing it into what you wish it was.\n\nThat's how our entire reality is currently formed.  By glossing.  The truth leaks in all the time, but we dismiss it as an aberration.\n\nThat principle carries all the way out into actual tunnels to other worlds you can enter using the sorcery explained in here. Tunnels of passage ways will materialize in front of you,  fully visible, while you are awake and walking around with your eyes open.  Completely sober.\n\nAnd you can walk right in there, to visit an alien world.\n\nNot in a dream.  Awake.\n\nThat's what you miss out on if you don't develop sobriety.  Freedom.\n\nAs it is now you're a slave to the social order, trying to find something to make yourself feel better on reddit.  Self-soothing.\n\nBest to develop that ability to tell what's really happening now, before you get mixed up with fake magic.\n\nBut it's not surprising when people do get fooled. In fact, it's virtually all of what goes on in the world of magic and religion.\n\nThere probably is no founder of Daoism. It was simply made up over time.  People aren't even sure if Lao Tzu, one supposed source,  ever existed at all.  But they can track down some Daoist writings to successive generations, which couldn't possibly have known the origin. They just picked it up to have some way to earn a living.\n\nSame for Buddhism. If you ask ChatGPT about \"The Buddha\", you'll find he was nothing like the one Asians worship.  He pretty much never left northern India, and was only a small cult at the time. Surrounded by other Hindu Gurus just as we are today.  Some of those gurus still have \"schools\". They just didn't branch out into China.\n\nThe huge expansion of the Buddha to \"godhood\" was all made up as the original tiny cult spread across Asia.  \n\nWhere the environment was ripe for a more organized religion.\n\nEach successive \"franchise\" added more \"bad ass\" stories to the tale of the amazing Buddha man, and it got elevated so high that it was offensive to even point out the obvious.\n\nIt's all made up.  \n\nAnd only a tiny part of it even does what they claim.  Just barely enough to keep the practitioners hopeful.\n\nBut every other system has the same crummy tiny part.  We call it, \"green zone magic\".\n\nIt's better than nothing!  \n\nBut not by much.\n\nSome are just more honest about what their system has, so that they seem less impressive.\n\nWhich means, the impressive ones are the bigger liars.\n\nSame for the Judeo/Christian traditions.  \n\nAll made up, piece by piece and by franchisees.\n\nFor example, the amount of historical evidence for Jesus is next to none.\n\nWe just have the writings of the franchises.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jpkx9gl", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful of other &amp;quot;topics&amp;quot; like reality shifting or astral plane surfing.

I could see  but there was this blueish dark mist(?) that clouded everything.\n\nIt sounds like what I call, \"dreaming fog\".\n\nI didn't discover that until a witch named Cholita came to live in my house.\n\nIt's a doorway to many things.  Shared dreaming,  alternate worlds.  Cholita even uses it for necromancy.\n\n(Which she hasn't yet given up.)\n\n\\&gt; Then I realized that I had sleep paralysis.\n\nThat means you can learn dreaming awake, and save yourself a lot of time.\n\nThe supernatural is at your finger tips, once you can dream while awake.\n\nSomeone who hates this type of stuff would say, it's not real!  It's  a hallucination!\n\nWhat use is that???\n\nWell first, do you actually know anyone who can do it? I mean, come on!  How cool is that?\n\nSo why does it have to produce revenue, or help you make better pancakes?\n\nFirst rule of sorcery: don't ignore or dismiss anything.\n\nBut as it turns out, it is real.  Dreaming bodies can tough real objects. And they can transmit unknown information from person to person.\n\nAnd, if you play with those beings you mentioned, you'll eventually start to see objects in your home fall off shelves. Water will form into gigantic drops at your water faucet, and fly off at a weird angle.\n\nIt's all real.\n\n\\&gt; You can go thru walls and stuff while OBEing.\n\nJust be warned, going through a wall causes a \"dream change\".\n\nA dream change gives you more energy to keep going (not wake up or go unconscious).  But it also changes what was just happening.\n\nYou can end up in an entirely different place.\n\nBut if any of the characters follow you through the dream change,  you should pay attention to those. They might be \"scouts\".  Beings sent from a parallel world, to look for energy in our realm.\n\n\\&gt;The thing was getting closer and I freaked out. I have never felt so  much fear in my life. It was coming towards me and I had no way out.\n\nThat's 100% inorganic being.  You can wrestle them if you want them under your control.\n\nHere's how that happens:   You're pinned, no where to go, and they keep coming. Eventually they're right on top of you, and super human strong.  You can't possibly resist them.\n\nThe fright cause goosebumps, and a feeling of electricity.\n\nThat's what they're after!  That's all.  They don't want anything else, but that energy.\n\nIt's really cold where they live. Or slow.  We're hot and rapid, and give them super powers if they can just hang out with us.\n\nAs the inorganic being continues to push against you, and you continue to try to stop it, the energy released is reduced.\n\nThere's only so much fright you can muster, then it's lessened.\n\nThat causes them to move back.  Or, it causes them to not be so insistent, and if you want to wrestle them down, they'll go along with it.\n\nAt that point, point yourfinger right at their chest, and command them to turn into something you prefer.  A small animal, a woman, a child.   Even a movie star.\n\nThey'll change if you just keep staring at them.  Do it like you would do if you tried to read a book in a dream.  Never let up. Stare at the small details!\n\nThey'll mutate, distort, and generally look like you're beaming energy at them, and they can't take it.\n\nIf there's a real \"scout\" there, it'll remain in some form or the other. If it's a dreaming phantom, it will go away.  Maybe just leave a pile of clothes on the floor.\n\nEdit:\n\nIn this subreddit, I suppose the prevailing attitude is that dreaming and OBE are the same thing. It just depends on how close you are to the real world when you do it.\n\nSo a perfect OBE would have you absolutely in your own real bedroom. You could possibly even push light objects with your fingers.\n\nBut you have to \"fine tune\" your dreaming to get there.\n\nSo usually, when people relate OBE experiences, they don't admit that the room was slightly off. \n\nThat damages the story telling, so they leave it out.\n\nUnfortunately, that also sets up other people, who find the topic interesting, to assume too much has to happen, or it doesn't \"count\".\n\nIt sets the bar too high.\n\nIt takes years to fine tune the dreaming location to be real.\n\nI haven't done it. \n\n I gave up on that, and learned to dream while awake, so I knew for a fact which world I was in.\n\nNow I can stand in the middle of my room, and watch dreams on the walls for as long as I like.

It inevitably leads deeply into the second attention. He might have held back on it while he was healthy, thinking it would be too much trouble if people got it to work too soon.\n\nThe top is the first full manifestation I ever saw.\n\nI fell into heightened awareness for 2 weeks as a result of extended stalking, traveling (automatic erasing personal history), and silence (nothing to do at night but walk around in silence).\n\nIt was ultra-stable!\n\nWhenever I closed my eyes, there was the burlap covered wall.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how pleasing that is, to have magic stick around so reliably.\n\nI kept checking often during the day, not believing it was still there.\n\nI could even memorize details of the fabric, open my eyes, close them again, and they were still the same.\n\nI doubt that would work the next day, but just being stable a few seconds is unusual.\n\nA dreaming image isn\u2019t that way, so \u201cthe Wall\u201d is something else.\n\nI could gaze through the burlap, and see energy in things. People coming around corners, still hidden behind the walls.\n\nI saw a Nepalese Monk eating curry, gazed through the wall, and saw that he\u2019d risen his energy up quite high.\n\nThat pic is sort of like it, but I just used stock photos.\n\nAnd my GIMP skills are poor, so it's just an isolated monk.\n\nIt was actually an entire cafeteria I saw through \"the wall\". The monk was just the most interesting thing.\n\nHe looked ordinary until I saw how much energy he had saved up.  Before that my thinking was, \"Monks are all fakes!\"\n\nAfter that I had to admit, some were not.\n\nThe lotus flower wasn\u2019t perfectly formed like my depiction.\n\nBut it did give the appearance he was sitting inside a flower.\n\nHey!  He wasn't meditating like that, trying to get attention!!!\n\nYou, I'm talking to you!!!\n\nMr. Book Deal mind.\n\nI just couldn't find a sad looking Nepalese monk eating a bowl of cheap curry in Bangkok Airport.\n\nGoogle isn't that helpful.\n\nSo please don't put on your Hindu diapers, sit on a mountain top, and scream OOOMMMMM!!!!! to get attention.\n\nAt least, don't say I told you that was ok.    And keep in mind, you'll NEVER learn sorcery if you're obsessed with other people.\n\nThe monk's energy was the same \u201cenergy\u201d Carlos kept nagging us about, wanting us to save up enough to raise it above our ankles.\n\nThat was the single most important part of private classes.  Carlos wanted enough \"energetic mass\" to cause people's assemblage points to move on their own, while doing the tensegrity.\n\nIt's the same energy you can *see*, using the \"Mashing Energy\" Tensegrity move.\n\nThe middle depiction is how \u201cThe Wall\u201d can help you to assemble other worlds.\n\nYou\u2019re walking around in darkness, eyes open,  and notice there are lines on things.\n\nYou gaze at a wall in your pitch-black room, and you can actually see the wall, formed by the vague white or grey lines.\n\nYou can't actually locate any of the lines!  When you try to say, \"There's a line right there\", there isn't.\n\nThey seem to be canceled out by a dark echo.  And while they are stationary, they also wave and switch locations.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cThe Wall\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t mean your bedroom wall.\n\nI mean, that\u2019s what ***the wall*** looks like.\n\nIt\u2019s just a flat surface, made out of stuff that isn\u2019t there.\n\nLights if you\u2019re using darkness to see it.\n\nIt's a concrete manifestation of the second attention. VERY USEFUL!\n\nBut in the day, it can be a real physical \"thing\", like the top view.\n\nGood thing too. You wouldn\u2019t notice a vague wall made out of grey lines being present when you close your eyes, if you were walking around in full daylight.\n\nIf you\u2019re a newbie and see \u201cthe Wall\u201d as those grey lines forming a flat surface, your job is just to watch it in silence.\n\nDon\u2019t try to make it \u201cdo something\u201d.\n\nThe whole point is to let the wall pull your assemblage point further into heightened awareness.\n\nIf you keep watching, crazy stuff like the bottom picture will happen.\n\nWarning: You're far gone at that point.  You're fully asleep, but with your eyes open and fully conscious.\n\nSo you won't get any \"WOW!!! WOULD YOU FUCKING LOOK AT THAT???\"\n\nI'm afraid it's more like, \"Head.  Indian.  Light.  Jump???   Yes.\"\n\nIt's a \"don't care\" situation.\n\nNot so with assembling \"other worlds\".\n\nYou can be in the \"Shit!!!!\" mode when you see those.\n\nStill mostly awake.\n\nVery much rational.\n\nAnd other worlds are cool too!\n\nIf you see \"the wall\", glance around the room, to see if it\u2019s on all of the walls.\n\nIf it is, you have a 360 degree virtual world viewer.\n\nYour bedroom.\n\nForce absolute silence, and the vague lines will start to show the details of another world.\n\nThat one in this post is \u201cthe bamboo forest\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve seen it 5 or 6 times. Once it was obvious I could enter.\n\nIt had left the walls, and some of the stalks were right  up against my bed. All I had to do was step off.\n\nBut I was afraid of piercing my bare feet.\n\nYou don\u2019t go walking into bamboo growth!\n\nThe little shoots will pierce your foot.  Not to mention the mosquitoes!\n\nThe bottom part of the picture is the *Cirque Du Soleil* of \u201cthe wall\u201d.\n\nMeaning, a really cool circus of strange stuff.\n\nMinus the big noses. What's up with French people and their \"beaks\"???\n\nI'm told that's supposed to look Jewish...\n\nJust about any crazy thing can happen on The Wall.\n\nI once had that visitor you see there. The Indian looking head. He showed up when I had a dozen or so dreams on the wall, all rotating and recombining, to find me an answer to why Carlos was messing with so many women.\n\nI gazed at the dream scenes. There were the Chacmools running amidst a group of other women, some classmates arguing, and at least 8 other scenes, each containing at least one woman.\n\nI got an answer to my question only after the Indian head guy caused only one dream view to be left.\n\nThey sort of burst into each other as they collided, like 2 bubbles becoming one.\n\nAnd he spoke the answer to me!\n\nOr at least, the \"voice of seeing\" did.\n\nIt said, \u201cWomen Re-purpose Men!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Carlos was messing with the women!\n\nTo prevent their natural instinct to re-purpose all the men in class, to their own bidding.\n\nLook...\n\nI\u2019m sorry about women\u2019s lib #2, but it was bullshit.\n\n\"Fly me to San Francisco\" is sexist?\n\nThat's your big issue at 18 years old back in the 70s, wearing \"hot pants\"?\n\nWait till you're 45, and want more than anything else in the world to be treated like a \"sex object\" again.\n\nWomen's lib #1 was good. Yes vote. Work, whatever you like.\n\nWomen's lib #2 was stupid.  A media manipulation.\n\nAsk witches!  They taught me that.\n\nWomen are women.  And they actually control the world.\n\nThe men DO NOT.  The women just let them believe that, because men are brutes.\n\nYou can't stop men from fighting, but you can whisper sweetly in their ear, and brainwash their children.\n\nWomen run things.  They just tolerate a little too much violence from the men, that's all.\n\nDon\u2019t tell  women they can only be happy when they think like men.\n\nYou\u2019ll just end up with self-righteous, virtue signaling nonsense.\n\nLet the women be witches.\n\nBut as I\u2019ve learned from Cholita, don\u2019t turn your back on them.\n\nThey\u2019re **way** smarter than men are.  And they believe they know what's best for you, more than you do.\n\nAside from the Indian man, you can see that catholic candle in the distance.\n\nI suspect that was the actual source of the Indian head. That glowing bar.\n\nIt was projecting him.\n\nProbably one of Carlos' allies. They have that bar inside the projection.\n\nBut at the time, I saw a catholic candle back there.  Complete with Jesus picture on it!\n\nIt was very saintly.  Jesus floating in the distance, glowing with his splendidness. \n\nActually it was probably \"Pajamas\", Carlos' daytime ally.\n\nThat window is exactly what I once saw.\n\nA weird sunlit scene of absolute realness, through a window that had formed on my bedroom wall.\n\nTrue, the frame was different.  But it was still an obvious \"frame\".\n\nAnd I stood up from cross legged, sitting on pillows on my bed in the dark, and leaped right through the window.\n\nI landed in an absolutely stable world, where I was lucid the entire time and nothing faded or changed when I looked at it too long.\n\nIt's a pretty darned cool way to go directly from waking, into dreaming.\n\nI believe it was what Carlos mentioned in his last books:\n\nWorlds only accessible through silence.\n\nBut how did I know I could leap?\n\nThat pic isn\u2019t quite right. I was looking down at a slight angle at the ground. I was only perhaps 10 feet above it.\n\nI could see that.\n\nIt looked very much like a real open window.\n\nIt was obvious I could leap out it, and land safely.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI remained in the dream for 3 hours, and found myself laying on my side in bed, when I woke up.\n\nEdited three times\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Manifestations of \"The Wall\"", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Illustrations"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"y0pfjl3vfly41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 129, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a985e85447f7310fe5eb1c678aa90e04b69ba277"}, {"y": 259, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f170a073255d2c46701139f22a2bc4b1891ecd"}, {"y": 384, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41adb425b55c17b0034137da9b5822c416c810ac"}, {"y": 768, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e529265bc1d82de2f2660b594e2a4e3458b3b2f"}, {"y": 1152, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b564ba7b30318cc7be81c5d5bb44cca53babcf8"}, {"y": 1296, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47394d1de05831683bf8f9a29d602a0b9f2165e8"}], "s": {"y": 1536, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cdee2f6cbbc33a3d28a4041e3aaf159b3ba6725"}, "id": "y0pfjl3vfly41"}}, "name": "t3_gj7ald", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Illustrations", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9PusYImuuAWNWF_pLZrLTXmEzx1W04el2bhZxmNuHjw.jpg", "edited": 1589498286.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1589402485.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9cdee2f6cbbc33a3d28a4041e3aaf159b3ba6725\"&gt;Three manifestations of \\&amp;quot;The Wall\\&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This picture depicts 3 manifestations of \u201cThe Wall\u201d, two of which I see daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Wall&amp;quot; is real magic that Carlos gave us, when he found out he was dying.

The women just let them believe that, because men are brutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t stop men from fighting, but you can whisper sweetly in their ear, and brainwash their children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women run things.  They just tolerate a little too much violence from the men, that&amp;#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t tell  women they can only be happy when they think like men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll just end up with self-righteous, virtue signaling nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let the women be witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I\u2019ve learned from Cholita, don\u2019t turn your back on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019re &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; smarter than men are.  And they believe they know what&amp;#39;s best for you, more than you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from the Indian man, you can see that catholic candle in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that was the actual source of the Indian head. That glowing bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was projecting him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably one of Carlos&amp;#39; allies. They have that bar inside the projection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the time, I saw a catholic candle back there.  Complete with Jesus picture on it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was very saintly.  Jesus floating in the distance, glowing with his splendidness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually it was probably &amp;quot;Pajamas&amp;quot;, Carlos&amp;#39; daytime ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That window is exactly what I once saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A weird sunlit scene of absolute realness, through a window that had formed on my bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True, the frame was different.  But it was still an obvious &amp;quot;frame&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I stood up from cross legged, sitting on pillows on my bed in the dark, and leaped right through the window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I landed in an absolutely stable world, where I was lucid the entire time and nothing faded or changed when I looked at it too long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a pretty darned cool way to go directly from waking, into dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe it was what Carlos mentioned in his last books:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worlds only accessible through silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how did I know I could leap?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That pic isn\u2019t quite right. I was looking down at a slight angle at the ground. I was only perhaps 10 feet above it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looked very much like a real open window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was obvious I could leap out it, and land safely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remained in the dream for 3 hours, and found myself laying on my side in bed, when I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "fb9e20b2-b0f5-11ea-aec6-0e725ac6deb5", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "gj7ald", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gj7ald/manifestations_of_the_wall/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gj7ald/manifestations_of_the_wall/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1589402485.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fqmoh4x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqm6px5", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Read my first post.

They just want others to believe they have, for personal gain.\n\nBut there are \"magic nerds\" out there, and even some women who are talented enough to develop sorcery knowledge without overcoming the flaws we all have. Those women  become interested for the sake of \"power\", once that becomes a real possibility for them.\n\nPerhaps, that's what the nerds wanted anyway.  They just try to reach it by understanding it so they can manipulate it.  Make a better club than the other caveman has.\n\nWhatever the motivation that makes people learn for real, eventually you get better \"tools\" to help you.\n\nSuch as \"the abstract\".\n\nI don't know who said it, but likely don Juan. It's said that women \"start out in the abstract\".\n\nPerhaps, while men have to find it?\n\nThe abstract is a view of reality about which you CANNOT think.  Can't write about it, can't speak about it, and likely can't even portray it.\n\nAlthough I keep thinking you could, if your drawing skills were good enough. Because one thing that's true about the abstract, is that you can \"experience it\".\n\nIt's just that once you stop experiencing it you can't define what was going on. Even though it was perfectly normal seeming at the time.\n\nOddly, it's likely the experience of the flow of the sensations from the dark sea, in a meaningful combination, but absent any trace of \"humanness\".  Or perhaps, any trace of \"rationality\".\n\nOr more likely, absent any trace of limitations from physicality.\n\nIt's a flow of perceptions, time.  and space with no prejudices to complicate or put limits on it.\n\nYou don't wake up in the middle of perceiving the abstract and think, \"Hey, I'm not a pineapple!  This makes no sense at all.\"\n\nYou just enjoy being a pineapple spinning in a field of mellow red spots.\n\nIt's only later when you try to think about whether you are actually a pineapple, and whether those were in fact red dots, that you realize neither of those was true.\n\nJust trying to recall it, even alters it. Even if you are no longer there, that event still exists in the dark sea and can be altered after the fact.\n\nSo you can't even define it once you leave it.\n\nHere's an attempt to show what \"the self\" looks like, at its most fundamental level.\n\nIt's you as a shape curled in on itself, so that your hard outer shell protects you from the world, while the softer middle part of you clings to some authority or power that can't be defined.\n\nAs long as it keeps facing that \"structure of authority\", the self cannot be eliminate from your awareness.\n\nBut if that shell just \"turns away\" from what it clings to, it transforms.  It's no longer a shell, no longer a victim, and no longer has an interest in obsessive \"humanness\".\n\nOnly sorcerers can see at that level.\n\nThat is, if you mean out of the human population.\n\nThe Allies see very clearly at that level.\n\nIn fact, they likely see US much better at that level.\n\nOur bizarre human obsessions are almost surely nonsense to them.  Just something they have to go along with, in order to keep us around.\n\nAnd so they can replace the \"power structure\" our \"shell\" is clinging to,  in that picture, which creates our \"self\", and turn it to face something simple which repeats.  And doesn't have all the unnecessary complications of clinging to that power structure.\n\nWe still get to \"cling\" for protection, but our energy isn't wasted on the resulting internal dialogue.\n\nThey stick a pacifier in our mouth.\n\nTrapping us in a loop of trying to perceive what we always seek (shelter and pity for the self),  while finding only very basic elements of reality which don't lead to waking up.\n\nOr to our internal dialogue resuming.\n\nFor a while, our rationality can't assert itself, and pull us free from their manipulations.\n\nSince the new elements of what we are made to cling to are sparse, we keep going back to review them over and over.\n\nWhile the Allies suck out energy.  Perhaps at the edges of the perceptual loop where a tiny bit of rationality worries the loop has ended,  and is puzzled by it, so that some energy is lost to us.\n\nBut we resume the loop anyway.\n\nOnce you can perceive at this level it's most likely they can't manipulate you anymore.\n\nThus don Juan used to be impassive, even when he and Carlos were under attack by the allies.\n\nAnd don Juan commented that once Carlos could use his luminous fibers to push his energy body to \"stand up\", he would be beyond the reach of the Allies.\n\nBut still, they make wonderful companions.\n\nDon't be afraid of them. They expose our deepest flaws.\n\nIf they scare you, that's your own fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A View Of The Self", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"kswdbad1mssb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232777a0de8ed32abfd95ff470a742334e4ec7d4"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=098dc98cde516e8f860e16d8cf538dd289d609d9"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e731f840352195e2478f313b6fe63783b279d351"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c13fdebeb6576a8f5f42b812ff8436b78c48c36d"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803717836740c5a22a6331f1c2064e76b61c3942"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=157701d4c3dfffbeec4fdc73fc1e58b7bec07b32"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c75c8f244e3b6a21a47742fc469ce9339a8afa"}, "id": "kswdbad1mssb1"}}, "name": "t3_1727cha", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3cuxD5M2tiv0rtbEGnmDXOi9j6V99GmmZO-nlBy6O9g.jpg", "edited": 1696689857.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1696687972.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c1c75c8f244e3b6a21a47742fc469ce9339a8afa\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/kswdbad1mssb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c1c75c8f244e3b6a21a47742fc469ce9339a8afa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New people believe they can &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; their way to becoming a sorcerer, not realizing all of their thoughts just go back and forth and never escape a limited range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even that &amp;quot;limited range&amp;quot; is not what they believe at all.

Probably just an odd coincidence i am putting more importance into than i should, but still curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1727cha/a_view_of_the_self/k3vxjvj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1696704060.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1727cha", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k3yvpi0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1696758143.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k3yp4tm", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "There's nothing you can do.\n\nAt first.\n\nThe Allies can trap you for hours.\n\nI don't mind myself, but a few of the women who fell victim to \"Fancy\" or maybe even \"Minx\", didn't like it at all.\n\nOne took 3 weeks to recover.\n\nJust remember, they most likely need \"permission\".\n\nBut their idea of what constitutes permission is difficult to understand.\n\nFor example, if you steal from them, you gave them permission to kidnap you.\n\nAnd if you have a \"teacher\", your teacher can give permission on your behalf.\n\nThe problem is, their definition of a teacher is pretty broad.\n\nThey're kind of like bad little kids, where the older brother tells the younger brother \"Mom gave us permission!

To the point that at the end of life this accident of being eaten by the Eagle no longer happens.\n\nTo enumerate this to somebody new may not be effective, but if seeing it as a whole thing, what is it other than a healing process?\n\nNo one can deny that life on this earth as a whole is in need of healing. Higher taxes cannot change that. Technology as it's used means more and more dependence on machines. And more machines mean more and more dirt. It's not technology that has to change, but people.\n\nFor example, we watch the dullest things on TV because we forgot to have adventures in our dreams. So video games have to become more and more realistic. Movies need 3D technology.\n\nAnd then we can say that no other system manages to counteract this trend, which leads to ever greater dependency. Technology shows through environmental damage it causes that something's going wrong. You don't have to be a seer to see that. But nobody cares as long as there is some way to make a profit from it. Money has become the substitute for energy.\n\nWe are obviously the last ones who still want the real thing. No substitute. Real healing, no placebos.

So video games have to become more and more realistic. Movies need 3D technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then we can say that no other system manages to counteract this trend, which leads to ever greater dependency.

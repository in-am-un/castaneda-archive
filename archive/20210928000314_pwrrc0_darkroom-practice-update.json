Same for green puffs.\n\nFloating in the air, \"out there\", I'm not so sure.\n\nAnd you can look way up while leaning backwards and inhale deeply, and find yellow.  Little kids do that.  That's blue zone stuff.  But it's flecks or broken pieces of yellow, smaller than puffs.\n\nThe green zone can produce scenes. But they tend to be more \"daydream\" like, than floating in the air in front of you.  You blank out and realize you were looking at a scene.\n\nOr they're \"inside\" something like a puff but you can't see them in there, without \"relaxing\" in some odd way.\n\nI haven't seen them float up and smack you in the face, in the green zone.\n\nThey do that in the zones further on.\n\nIt's like a pie in the face!  No mercy, no doubt. That's a dream floating in the air, and it's even coming a little too close and becoming too real to be comfortable.\n\nIn the green zone, it's like an 8 year old zoning out and daydreaming.\n\nNeeds more research I suppose before we can say if the nature of dream visions indicates where you are from green zone onward.\n\nI can't tell anymore!\n\nEven if I wanted to, I can no longer stop at the green zone and test what is \"normal\" there.\n\nIf I did that, I might find myself sitting on a bench in a park with Lily next to me, saying, \"That one over there isn't normal.  See it?\"\n\nAnd I might reply, \"But the grass isn't as green here, so that one doesn't count. We were only looking for green zone thoughts.\"\n\nLily wouldn't correct me.  I suppose she doesn't mind if her date is dazed and confused.  She's a 70s kind of girl.\n\nAnd I wouldn't notice the oddness until the next day.\n\nRed zone,  naturally, can make visions more abundantly than the green.  That's about all you could really say.\n\nIn the orange zone too, but they're floating in darkness that's free of  the puffs of color now, and only whitish light is seen around the room.\n\nI'd say your situation is halfway between green and red zone.\n\nMy best results are at 4AM-7AM.   But I don't pay attention to the time anymore and once had some very good results, uncovered the electronic clock, and it was 7PM.\n\nI suppose people are still waking up and taking showers at 7AM,  and mostly aren't at work yet.\n\nAnd so they're not fussing over ME, ME, ME as much.\n\nPeople aren't the problem, it's what they focus on.\n\nIf you can manage to identify \"ME\" thoughts while you are doing darkroom, you can find \"Non-ME\" perceptions floating in the darkness, and only let yourself look at that while forcing silence.\n\nThat sort of means, instead of just forcing silence, you identify that some thoughts have a little picture of you hidden in the middle, with the world attacking.  Or at least, focusing on you as a person who's guilty, or bad, or cool, or whatever.\n\nBut a thought that's a weird square with lines in it is ok.\n\nThat sort of \"thought categorization\" can get out of hand though.\n\nIf you follow the \"ME, ME, ME\" thoughts all the way through to the orange zone, \"judging\" those as bad, and the others as good, you can end up with a  horizontal slide generated \"ME\" obsession.\n\nI must have had that last night, and didn't realize it until now.\n\nSo while it's really hard to describe looking at your thoughts like they were items in a store, and you want to avoid purchasing some,  if you manage to do that,  then by the time you get to the orange zone they **become** items in a store!\n\nThe store is a bit overboard for an analogy, but not by much.\n\nSome kind of \"mental structure\" forms in the air of the darkroom, based on however you were visualizing the thoughts hanging out in your mind.\n\nYou'll now be looking at what's left.\n\nSo you'll look off into the darkness and see a little man, all black, standing on the sidewalk.\n\nWithout words you'll realize, \"That's not me.\"\n\nSo it's not a ME thought!\n\nYou gaze around more, and there's a robot.\n\nHimm.... Is that a me thought?\n\nHard to judge.  You like robots.\n\nBut you decide, it's not a me thought.\n\nAnd certainly the water flowing in that pond in the north corner of the room isn't \"ME\"!\n\nYou gaze closer to make sure. There's a frog.  Nope.  Not me. I'm not a frog for sure.\n\nThat's 1/1000th of what I did last night.  I'd forgotten that weirdness.\n\nMaybe it was caused by the text message I got from Cholita, for paying her phone bill.\n\nHer phone had shut off for 4 days, because she was gone and I forgot to go pay it.\n\nShe has a month to month plan.\n\nWhen the phone was turned back on, she thanked me by texting the message, \"Stop impersonating me.  You are not me.\"\n\nDarn...  One more thing I have to keep track of.\n\nMaking sure I'm not Cholita in the dark room.\n\nThat's actually harder than you could imagine!\n\nI once say Cholita sitting on the corner of my bed, near my feet.\n\nBut she was a little chubby.\n\nI quickly realized, it was my double, impersonating Cholita!\n\nThey can be anyone they like!", "edited": 1632785244.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hej2806", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know enough about colors yet, but yellow, if it&amp;#39;s in a solid puff I can hold on my hand, is red zone stuff.

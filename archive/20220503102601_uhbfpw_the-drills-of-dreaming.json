Through *dreaming*, a sorcerer can perceive and explore other total worlds.\n\nTo perform *dreaming,* one must have cleaned their link with intent and developed their dreaming attention. *Dreaming* is not merely lucid dreaming, but one can use their ordinary lucid dreams as a training ground to develop their dreaming attention. Once an internal threshold of attention has been reached, one can enter *dreaming.*\n\nIn *The Active Side of Infinity,* Carlos travels through the dark sea of awareness from his room in Los Angeles to a town in Mexico to meet with don Juan. \u201cThe dream was so vivid, so terrifyingly real\u201d. Don Juan tells him that it is not a mere dream and that there are no dreams from inner silence.\n\n\u201cDon Juan went back again to the topic under discussion: my journeys through the dark sea of awareness. He said that what I had done from my inner silence was very similar to what is done in *dreaming* when one is asleep. However, when journeying through the dark sea of awareness, there was no interruption of any sort caused by going to sleep, nor was there any attempt whatsoever at controlling one's attention while having a dream. The journey through the dark sea of awareness entailed an immediate response. There was an overpowering sensation of the here and now. Don Juan lamented the fact that some idiotic sorcerers had given the name *dreaming-awake* to this act of reaching the dark sea of awareness directly, making the term *dreaming* even more ridiculous.\u201d\n\nHe gives Carlos the definition of *dreaming* included at the beginning of this post.\n\n\u201c\"*Dreaming* is a term that has always bugged the hell out of me,\" he continued, \"because it weakens a very powerful act. It makes the act sound arbitrary. It gives it a sense of being a fantasy, and this is the only thing it is not. I tried to change the term myself, but it's too ingrained.\u201d\u201d\n\nIn the *Silent Knowledge* publication, Carlos refers to this confusing distinction again:\n\n\u201cDon Juan made a significant differentiation in Spanish, between two verbs; one was to dream, so\u00f1ar, and the other was enso\u00f1ar, which is to dream the way sorcerers dream. In English, there is no clear distinction between these two states: the normal dreaming. sue\u00f1o, and the more complex state that sorcerers call ensue\u00f1o. Don Juan also described dreaming as a state of profound meditation in which a shift of perception plays a key role.\u201d\n\nOf most pragmatic relevance to our post here, he also refers again to dreaming attention:\n\n\u201cThrough discipline, they succeeded in developing their dreaming attention to an extraordinary degree. They were able to focus it on any element of their dreams, and found out, in this fashion, that there were two kinds of dreams. One was the dreams that we are all familiar with, in which phantasmagorical elements come into play, something which we could categorize as the product of our mentality, our psyche; perhaps something that has to do with our neurological makeup. The other kind of dreams, they called energy-generating dreams.\u201d\n\nFrom *The Art of Dreaming:*\n\n\u201c\"And how! *Dreaming* has to be a very sober affair. No false movement can be afforded. *Dreaming* is a process of awakening, of gaining control. Our dreaming attention must be systematically exercised because it is a door to the second attention.\" \u2026 \"The second attention is like an ocean, and the dreaming attention is like a river feeding into it. The second attention is the condition of being aware of total worlds, total like our world is total, while the dreaming attention is the condition of being aware of the items of our dreams.\"\u201d\n\n**The take-away is this: our dreaming attention must be exercised and developed in order to perform** ***Dreaming.***\n\nWhether that is of the \u2018travelling directly from inner silence\u2019 kind or not.\n\nBut isn\u2019t that what we want to do? That\u2019s where the dark sea of awareness opens up and true exploration becomes possible.\n\nI can tell you emphatically that those \u2018terrifyingly real\u2019 dreams-that-are-not-dreams are very, very different to ordinary lucid dreams and well worth the effort to get there. But they do require effort and practice.\n\nI\u2019m going to share what I have learnt about developing dreaming attention from direct experience. These are techniques that I learnt from the publications of Carlos and the Witches, or that I was taught directly from my Ally and other inorganic beings.\n\nThere are other drills in Carlos\u2019 books that I haven\u2019t included but you can easily find them there. This is not just a recap of *The Art of Dreaming* and this isn\u2019t about the Gates. This is about practicable methods for building dreaming attention and stabilising the dream body.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to mistake lucid dreaming as the be-all and end-all of dreaming practices. It is only a training ground. If you are doing sleeping dreaming practices, this is a guide to getting the most out of them.\n\nA final note before we start: Sleeping dreaming practices are not the only path and should definitely not be the only practice that you employ. Recapitulation, tensegrity, darkroom gazing, etc. are all recommended and if you are doing any of these you need to find and follow their instructions. Sleeping dreaming practices are the \u2018not-doing\u2019 of sleep. You might as well use that time that would only be spent on ordinary dreams to get a little extra practice in.\n\n**Ultimately, it does not matter what the content of your dreams is as long as you are exercising your dreaming attention.**\n\nMost of the important things that are happening in a dream are normally not the things that you can see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Point of Departure**\n\nI am going to assume that if you are reading a guide like this, that you already know somewhat how to lucid dream. \u2018Lucid dreaming\u2019 is presently defined as being aware that you are dreaming while you are in a dream. There are different depths of lucidity. You should feel like you are actively present and have a relatively clear mind, but when starting out it\u2019s okay if your lucidity is quite low. As you train your dreaming attention, the clarity of your lucidity should also improve alongside it.\n\nThe Point of Departure is an object that we first place our dreaming attention on and then regularly return to. It has an energising effect on the dreamer. The Point of Departure can be anything. Don Juan gives Carlos the task of looking for his hands in a dream, but it could be any object or body part. I recommend looking for your hands. We know our hands are always with us and we are visually very familiar with them, at least more-so than the rest of our bodies.\n\nFrom your hands, look around the dreamscape allowing your attention to fall briefly on different objects, and then return to your hands. Returning to your hands helps maintain your lucidity and your energy. At this stage, you are just starting to stretch your dreaming attention. You may not have exerted much control over it before, so you find your dreams quickly break down. That\u2019s fine, just keep at it. Look at your hands, then look around and return again. As time goes on it will become easier to control where your attention falls and for how long you can sustain the sight of other objects.\n\nThis is not just about being able to perceive the dreamscape. Exercising the dreaming attention is about choosing specifically which objects to attend to and how long you perceive them for.\n\n**Window Shopping**\n\nIf you can find and return to your Point of Departure, then exercising your attention becomes much easier. You have probably noticed that you seem to have a reserve of energy or attention before you lose either your lucidity or the dream itself. Certain acts (like becoming emotional or excited) will burn through your attention very quickly. One of the best ways to get the most out of your energy is to take on the mood that you are window shopping.\n\nWhen you are window shopping you have no money so you can\u2019t buy anything. All you can do is look from object to object. You can sustain the sight of things longer now, so spend some time noticing the fine detail on the objects you encounter, but don\u2019t linger too long with any of them. Feel them with your other senses too. Pick them up and feel their texture. Notice the way that light reflects off their surface. If they are edible, taste them. Feel their weight in your hands. But then move on. If you linger too long, the shop assistant might notice and try to commit you into buying something and dealing with an assertive shop assistant is going to burn through your energy until you are forced to leave.\n\nWindow shopping is a casual act that is done for the sheer sake of it. Enjoy it. Move your attention across each object in your view, returning to your Point of Departure as you need to.\n\n**Practicing Awake**\n\nThe act of controlling where you place our attention is something that you can practice while awake as well, with the benefit that we do not run out of dreaming attention so we can sustain the sight of things for longer. This practice has a positive impact on our lucid dreams.\n\nGo out into the world, somewhere that you can take your time to slowly wander around. Pretend that you have just found yourself in a lucid dream. Take a moment to look at your hands or your usual Point of Departure. Let your gaze linger on them a little longer, really soaking up not only their detail but also the mood of being aware in a dream.\n\nWhile keeping your mind as calm and quiet as possible, slowly look around. Feel the depth of the world around you. Do objects that are close to you feel the same as objects that are far away? Choose a nearby object and get close to it. Hold your gaze steady and examine its detail. How much fine detail can you draw into view on its surface? Spend some time with that object until you feel like you can really see it in focus, and then move onto another object. Notice as much as you can about these objects; their colour, texture, lustre. Use your other senses if you can. If you are lacking any senses (such as being deaf) just skip them and focus on using your available ones.\n\nIf you can, going window shopping for real is a great way to practice this. Return to your Point of Departure regularly. Move your attention from object to object in the shop display as consciously and intentionally as possible. Soak up as much of the sensory information as you can. Feel it as though it is power itself and you are absorbing it through your body. Move slowly. Notice the way that light reflects off different surfaces and the way objects parallax as you move past them.\n\nBy learning how to sustain the sight of an object in waking, it becomes easier to repeat the process in dreaming. You become more able to ascertain detail, which in turn helps hook your attention.\n\n**Stabilisation and Cohesion**\n\nDreaming practice requires us not just to move our assemblage point but also to fixate it in place. This act of fixating is called *stalking* and the effect of fixation is called *cohesion*. We have cohesion with a dreaming location if we are able to maintain the sight of it. The greater the clarity of our perception within a dream, the greater our cohesion.\n\nWe have an incredible degree of cohesion with our daily world. Hence, we can practice wielding our attention in the previous exercise without worrying too much if we are suddenly going to lose sight of the dream. But when we are practicing in a dream, it is easy to lose cohesion and either find ourselves changing dreams unintentionally or waking up in our beds.\n\nStabilisation techniques help increase cohesion when the dream starts to break down. My preferred method is to rub my hands together and run my hands over my body. This allows me to continue dreams for much longer than I would be able to without stabilising. Other methods exist such as the twin positions and spinning around in a circle. Figure out which one works best for you and try to extend your dreams for as long as you can.\n\n**Total Dream Breakdown and Dream Re-Entry**\n\nSometimes the stabilisation techniques will not be enough and for whatever reason you will find yourself losing the dream anyway. When cohesion drops is an excellent time to practice moving your AP back to a location that it was just fixed on. If you wake up completely, or \u2018wake up\u2019 to an intermediate dream, try not to move. Remain still and relaxed. Feel for the mood or energy of the dream you just left and allow yourself to fall back asleep, keeping your intent to return to where you were. You might pass through intermediary dreams on the way back to your destination so try not to linger too long on these on the way through. If you were previously with an IOB it should be easier to make it back to your original location as they will normally hold the dream open for you.\n\nIf you feel the dream breaking down but have not woken up yet, try placing your hand on a surface within the dream. Usually your vision will go but your sense of physicality will remain a little longer. Focus on keeping contact with that surface until a new dream forms around you.\n\nIn addition, continue with whatever you were doing in the dream to engage with it further. If you were walking down a hallway to someone's office in the dream when your vision shut off and you felt your cohesion slip, just press on anyway. Intend that you are still going to that office and continue with the doing of the dream for as long as possible. That will help you slip back into it and you will probably find that you appear at your destination (the office at the end of the hall) rather than having your vision return in the hallway that you were in. You can continue for a very long time with these small drop-outs without waking up or losing the dream completely if you continue to just press on.\n\nThese aren\u2019t just methods of recovering from losing a dream, they are also drills to train you in how to move between different positions of the AP. These become very useful if you decide to tackle the gates from *The Art of Dreaming*.\n\n**Avoiding the Creepers**\n\nLooking at objects is one thing, looking at scouts with your dreaming attention is another. There are a lot of things out there that are moved by their own agency. Some of them can be followed like scouts, but a lot of them are really not very useful to interact with. It is not that they are harmful, but they will drain your dreaming energy like nobody's business and you'll get dropped from the dream.\n\nIt comes down to the same method though, glance at things without staring. If you detect some movement or energy in the dream and suspect it might be a dream character or inorganic being, only glance at them. Don't stare. Even we can tell when someone is looking at us from out of our view. You don't want to alert them to the fact that you can perceive them or they'll bound over and want ALL your attention. \n\nIt's like walking down the street in a weird part of town, especially if you're a woman. Don't make eye contact with men standing on the road. They'll take that as an invitation to come over and talk to you, and strange men who try to talk to you on the street ALWAYS want your energy. \n\nBut maybe as you're walking along trying not to make eye contact with anyone you notice somebody selling food. They aren't out here looking for people's energy to steal. They are very clear about the fact that they are looking for an exchange, a little energy for some homemade donuts, and maybe some advice about where the best coffee is in town. Now you can make the conscious decision to go and interact with them and you have the energy to do it because you've avoided all the creepers. \n\nDon't let the weird little animal IOBs drain you. Just pretend they aren't there and keep walking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo conclude, if you are having difficulties with your dream practices, remember to slow down. If you are moving quickly, you probably don\u2019t have as much control over your attention as you think. Move slowly, take your time. Practice moving slowly when you are awake too. There\u2019s no rush. Train yourself to move your dreaming attention exactly as slowly as you intend.\n\nWe don't learn sorcery.

You become more able to ascertain detail, which in turn helps hook your attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stabilisation and Cohesion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreaming practice requires us not just to move our assemblage point but also to fixate it in place. This act of fixating is called &lt;em&gt;stalking&lt;/em&gt; and the effect of fixation is called &lt;em&gt;cohesion&lt;/em&gt;. We have cohesion with a dreaming location if we are able to maintain the sight of it. The greater the clarity of our perception within a dream, the greater our cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have an incredible degree of cohesion with our daily world. Hence, we can practice wielding our attention in the previous exercise without worrying too much if we are suddenly going to lose sight of the dream. But when we are practicing in a dream, it is easy to lose cohesion and either find ourselves changing dreams unintentionally or waking up in our beds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stabilisation techniques help increase cohesion when the dream starts to break down. My preferred method is to rub my hands together and run my hands over my body. This allows me to continue dreams for much longer than I would be able to without stabilising. Other methods exist such as the twin positions and spinning around in a circle. Figure out which one works best for you and try to extend your dreams for as long as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Dream Breakdown and Dream Re-Entry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the stabilisation techniques will not be enough and for whatever reason you will find yourself losing the dream anyway. When cohesion drops is an excellent time to practice moving your AP back to a location that it was just fixed on. If you wake up completely, or \u2018wake up\u2019 to an intermediate dream, try not to move. Remain still and relaxed. Feel for the mood or energy of the dream you just left and allow yourself to fall back asleep, keeping your intent to return to where you were. You might pass through intermediary dreams on the way back to your destination so try not to linger too long on these on the way through. If you were previously with an IOB it should be easier to make it back to your original location as they will normally hold the dream open for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you feel the dream breaking down but have not woken up yet, try placing your hand on a surface within the dream. Usually your vision will go but your sense of physicality will remain a little longer. Focus on keeping contact with that surface until a new dream forms around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, continue with whatever you were doing in the dream to engage with it further. If you were walking down a hallway to someone&amp;#39;s office in the dream when your vision shut off and you felt your cohesion slip, just press on anyway. Intend that you are still going to that office and continue with the doing of the dream for as long as possible. That will help you slip back into it and you will probably find that you appear at your destination (the office at the end of the hall) rather than having your vision return in the hallway that you were in. You can continue for a very long time with these small drop-outs without waking up or losing the dream completely if you continue to just press on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These aren\u2019t just methods of recovering from losing a dream, they are also drills to train you in how to move between different positions of the AP. These become very useful if you decide to tackle the gates from &lt;em&gt;The Art of Dreaming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding the Creepers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at objects is one thing, looking at scouts with your dreaming attention is another. There are a lot of things out there that are moved by their own agency. Some of them can be followed like scouts, but a lot of them are really not very useful to interact with. It is not that they are harmful, but they will drain your dreaming energy like nobody&amp;#39;s business and you&amp;#39;ll get dropped from the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It comes down to the same method though, glance at things without staring. If you detect some movement or energy in the dream and suspect it might be a dream character or inorganic being, only glance at them. Don&amp;#39;t stare. Even we can tell when someone is looking at us from out of our view. You don&amp;#39;t want to alert them to the fact that you can perceive them or they&amp;#39;ll bound over and want ALL your attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like walking down the street in a weird part of town, especially if you&amp;#39;re a woman. Don&amp;#39;t make eye contact with men standing on the road. They&amp;#39;ll take that as an invitation to come over and talk to you, and strange men who try to talk to you on the street ALWAYS want your energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe as you&amp;#39;re walking along trying not to make eye contact with anyone you notice somebody selling food. They aren&amp;#39;t out here looking for people&amp;#39;s energy to steal. They are very clear about the fact that they are looking for an exchange, a little energy for some homemade donuts, and maybe some advice about where the best coffee is in town. Now you can make the conscious decision to go and interact with them and you have the energy to do it because you&amp;#39;ve avoided all the creepers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let the weird little animal IOBs drain you. Just pretend they aren&amp;#39;t there and keep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To conclude, if you are having difficulties with your dream practices, remember to slow down. If you are moving quickly, you probably don\u2019t have as much control over your attention as you think. Move slowly, take your time. Practice moving slowly when you are awake too. There\u2019s no rush. Train yourself to move your dreaming attention exactly as slowly as you intend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t learn sorcery. We can only clean our link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "uhbfpw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "the-mad-prophet", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/uhbfpw/the_drills_of_dreaming/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/uhbfpw/the_drills_of_dreaming/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1651566361.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i79nayn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "the-mad-prophet", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1651651515.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i75y1ks", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_4dz9kepm", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;But instead I'll say, you \"challenged\" the Eagle with an interesting story.

It's like selling drugs to Junior High School students.\n\nHere's those twin positions:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Where are we going?\" I asked her.  &lt;- Carlos.\n\n\"Nowhere,\" she replied.  &lt;- Death Defier\n\n\"We simply came out here to have more space, more privacy. Here we can talk our little heads off.\"\n\nShe urged me to sit down on a quarried, half-chiseled piece of limestone.\n\n\"The second attention has endless treasures to be discovered,\" she began. \"The initial position in which the dreamer places his body is of key importance. And right there is the secret of the ancient sorcerers, who were already ancient in my time. Think about it.\"\n\nShe sat so close to me that I felt the heat of her body. She put an arm around my shoulder and pressed me against her bosom. Her body had a most peculiar fragrance: It reminded me of trees or sage. It was not that she was wearing perfume: Her whole being seemed to exude that characteristic odor of pine forests. Also the heat of her body was not like mine or like that of anyone else I knew. Hers was a cool, mentholated heat; even; balanced. The thought that came to my mind was that her heat would press on relentlessly but knew no hurry.\n\nShe began then to whisper in my left ear. She said that the gifts she had given to the naguals of my line had to do with what the old sorcerers used to call the twin positions. That is to say, the initial position in which a dreamer holds his physical body to begin dreaming is mirrored by the position in which he holds his energy body, in dreams, to fixate his assemblage point on any spot of his choosing. The two positions make a unit, she said, and it took the old sorcerers thousands of years to find out the perfect relationship between any two positions. She commented, with a giggle, that the sorcerers of today will never have the time or the disposition to do all that work, and that the men and women of my line were indeed lucky to have her to give them such gifts. Her laughter had a most remarkable, crystalline sound.\n\nI had not quite understood her explanation of the twin positions. Boldly, I told her that I did not want to practice those things but only know about them as intellectual possibilities.\n\n\"What exactly do you want to know?\" she asked softly.\n\n\"Explain to me what you mean by the twin positions, or the initial position in which a dreamer holds his body to start dreaming.\" I said.\n\n\"How do you lie down to start your dreaming?\" she asked.\n\n\"Any which way. I don't have a pattern. Don Juan never stressed this point.\"\n\n\"Well, I do stress it,\" she said and stood up. She changed positions. She sat down to my right and whispered in my other ear that, in accordance with what she knew, the position in which one places the body is of utmost importance. She proposed a way of testing this by performing an extremely delicate but simple exercise.\n\n\"Start your dreaming by lying on your right side, with your knees a bit bent,\" she said. \"The discipline is to maintain that position and fall asleep in it. In dreaming, then, the exercise is to dream that you lie down in exactly the same position and fall asleep again.\"\n\n\"What does that do?\" I asked.\n\n\"It makes the assemblage point stay put, and I mean really stay put, in whatever position it is at the instant of that second falling asleep.\"\n\n\"What are the results of this exercise?\"\n\n\"Total perception. I am sure your teachers have already told you that my gifts are gifts of total perception.\"\n\n\"Yes. But I think I am not clear about what total perception means,\" I lied.\n\nShe ignored me and went on to tell me that the four variations of the exercise were to fall asleep lying on the right side, the left, the back, and the stomach. Then in dreaming the exercise was to dream of falling asleep a second time in the same position as the dreaming had been started. She promised me extraordinary results, which she said, were not possible to foretell.\n\nShe abruptly changed the subject and asked me, \"What's the gift you want for yourself?\"\n\n\"No gift for me. I've told you that already.\"\n\n\"I insist. I must offer you a gift, and you must accept it. That is our agreement.\"\n\n\"Our agreement is that we give you energy. So take it from me.

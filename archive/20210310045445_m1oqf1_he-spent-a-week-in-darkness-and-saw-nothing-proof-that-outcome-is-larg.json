Not necessarily.  While reading, that's words in your mind. But that's \"talking\". It's part of us.\n\nOne of \"8 points\" on human being's energy bodies (only a seer can perceive those).\n\nIf you stop reading and start thinking, \"This is hard to understand.  What does it mean by...\"\n\nThat's internal dialogue.  Even if you think the opposite: \"This is easy!\".\n\nThat's also internal dialogue.  \n\nBut reading is not. It's a process which requires forming words.\n\n2. Not necessarily.  A sorcerer can be silent in his mind, and still answer your questions.  The internal dialogue is NOT fast enough to create the words. Those come from the massive processing power of the brain.\n\nI regularly talk to my demon girlfriend Fancy.  I can say, \"Wow Fancy, I love that new outfit!\"\n\nIt's talking, not internal dialogue.\n\n3. Just stop talking to yourself.  In words.  Don't worry about what the rest of the  brain is doing!\n\nFor example, you want to think, \"Man, my brother stinks!\"\n\nHow can you create that, using  the internal dialogue???  Like this???:\n\n\"I need to think about my brother, something such as he stinks.\"\n\nBut, that's already internal dialogue!\n\n4.  Just sit in a chair, close your eyes, and if a word pops into your mind, shut if off. Find out how long you can go, with no words.\n\nTypical is 2 or 3 seconds only.\n\nWhen someone says, \"10 minutes\", it's hopeless to teach them. \n\nThey're out to lunch.  Or, they have some abstract internal dialogue which is very rare.  My father claimed his internal dialogue was typewriter text.\n\nBut I doubt that.

For example if I tell you an enigma very hard to resolve and ask you to resolve it for a week, then this enigma will consume some of your energy and often be an &amp;quot;internal dialogue&amp;quot;, but you can choose to put this enigma on the side, that is to not think about it; for example if you go shoping you may be distracted and think about the enigma and not your lists but then you can put it aside and focus on your lists. So would an enigma be an internal dialogue ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example I had an enigma that I choosed for myself that forced me to sleep 16h straight the first day because it was taking all my energy, but this isn&amp;#39;t linked to negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I must say that I would have grudge only against one individual but I try to not keep it or put it aside of my brain to avoid the negativity on me., does what you call remove the internal dialogue mean I would have erased memory of such individual for ever or simply that I put it aside ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also confused Castenada wasn&amp;#39;t a shaman, doesn&amp;#39;t they focus more on trance than dreams ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now secondly I recently discovered that I have quasi-&amp;quot;aphantasia&amp;quot; that is I don&amp;#39;t have a strong ability to vizualise, I have more a memory of concepts.

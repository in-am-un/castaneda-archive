I can't remember what.  I've learned that you can't choose your own lesson plan if you want best results.\n\nYou do what you're offered. It's ok to have an idea in your mind. That's intending.\n\nBut it's not ok to say, \"I think I'll learn to do this or that tonight, so I can go out and use it to...\"\n\nForget it.\n\nAnd by the way, how rude??!\n\nYou think you're doing all this?\n\nThat's about as silly as a 4 year old you were helping to do something they can't possibly do, who slams down some random object to show you his frustration,  and shouts \"LET ME DO IT!!!\"\n\nGood luck kid...\n\nWe don't get to choose yet.  That's way at the end, and long after you stop trying to gain things for yourself, which you should no longer care about.\n\nTo choose, you have to be 0% bad player.\n\nWe're all a very long way from there.\n\nSo last night I was on a marathon 4 day practice, laying in bed pondering if the abstract is really the size of small worms.\n\nI mean, sure. It can manifest as small worms everywhere, but is that actually its form?\n\nA man came into my room through a whitish corridor in the solid wall, took his outstretched arm and swished it across the air, scattering my worms into infinity.\n\n\"Worms??!@$?!!!\" he said.\n\nI sat up quickly shouting, \"NO!!!!\"\n\nBut the worms were gone.  I could still see a few, spinning out of control as they were flung so far away they disappeared.\n\nFortunately, sitting up was enough to cause me to regain some sobriety.\n\nI sat up on pillows to tried to \"fix\" the situation.\n\nThere was a chrome beam with writing on it.  It was putting pressure on my thought process.\n\nIt was somewhat unpleasant.\n\n\"Intel Aires\" it said.\n\nThe writing was in red raised letters with black trim, at the top of the shiny chrome beam which was curved a little around my bed and reaching up to the ceiling.\n\nI spent 2 hours trying to \"fix\" it, without understanding that made no sense.\n\nI suppose I need to say, I was fully awake, eyes open, no drugs.  A lot of coffee maybe.  I didn't keep track. But if I had much, it had been hours.\n\nI couldn't fix the chrome thing, so I stood up to do tensegrity.\n\nMashing energy, I reasoned. That's all I need.\n\nThe chrome vanished, I could see the worms in the distance, and the room started to respond to the tensegrity.\n\nIt was turning into a clearer and clearer phantom room.\n\nA woman said, \"Sorry about him.    He's rough, but he gets to the point.  Now, let me explain this to you...\"\n\nAnd it's all gone.\n\nBut not because I forgot it.  It's because most of it stretched into the abstract.\n\nThe abstract isn't just a single \"thing\".\n\nStuff that isn't abstract, actually is.\n\nDon't ask me why.  That's one thing the woman told me.\n\n\"It's **all** abstract\", she insisted.\n\nBut some sticks up out of the fluid realms and into the familiar.\n\nThat's what you're used to.\n\nBut if you try to follow anything at all, no matter how real it seems, it inevitably sinks back into the abstract and you can no longer think about it.\n\n\"Which is kind of nice, isn't it?\", she added.\n\nShe showed me how to follow the tensegrity movements partially into the abstract, as a \"trick\" to silence the internal dialogue.\n\n\"When you reach with your arm, reach into the abstract and leave your internal dialogue out there.   It'll turn down so low, it might as well be gone.\n\nAnd using that, I created several very nice phantom bedrooms.\n\nI got the idea, \"You know what would be really cool???\"\n\nShe said, \"Of course!  Look over there!\"\n\nI saw pink shiny pearls the size of baseballs, leaving through the solid wall and out into Cholita's phantom copy of our home.\n\n\"Those are the same thing.\", she said.\n\n\"And they're also more energetic and thus easier to find, using Tensegrity.\"\n\nShe suggested if you do tensegrity until you are in the yard area of Pandora, the house where Carlos lived and the Chacmools practiced a lot, storing up intent in the forms themselves, the entry way to their phantom realm ought to become visible.  And if you enter, you'll find that time stopped in there. It's waiting.\n\nBut I suppose we have a ways to go for that...\n\nHow does all this work?\n\nIn the orange zone, a whitish light becomes visible.\n\nThat's \"seeing energy\".\n\nIf you gaze at it, it forms things, places, beings.\n\nYou can \"help it\" by using your fingers.    Just tickle it a foot or two in front of your face, and gaze in there.\n\nThe gaze is what causes it to take form.  The wiggling adds awareness, so intent has something to work with.\n\nIf you don't \"add to it\", you'll pick up the strongest energetic influence intent can find there.\n\nFor instance, I've been keeping track of Pleiades.  I can point right to where it is currently located if you looked towards it, within a few inches in space.\n\nEven when it's on the other side of the planet.\n\nBecause of that, if I tickle the whitish light Pleiades flickers in the distance.\n\nGiven that (which you can all easily learn), the tensegrity does the same thing.\n\nBut the \"awareness\" it adds is stored in your body.  The feeling in your shoulders after doing a long form, the movements that echo in your hands, how your feet now feel from walking or tapping the floor during the tensegrity.\n\nEven the explanations given by Carlos for what the form does, contribute to the awareness available to intent for reskimming what's in front of you.\n\nSilence of course, is what makes it possible.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tensegrity Assisted Phantom Manifestations", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"bmgq8dq3ak281": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmgq8dq3ak281.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a45e71b1dbd2a1d53fe262cd69392d99612ef4c2"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmgq8dq3ak281.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6993a71063908877e43f084d260bf490e8728643"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmgq8dq3ak281.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2e0cec0e4cc4bdfd8092a2d98b4ee7b602d9e17"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmgq8dq3ak281.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df10219b890dcdf477a4dd168ecca9a3cff9e70a"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmgq8dq3ak281.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd56ee81d737b81ec9154e914e9514599dd8f035"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmgq8dq3ak281.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fee34b0e4faf660c9a1ce9d72461ed866f11bfc"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bmgq8dq3ak281.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71033bcf8204da761eb5a810c59f6c7062088c1a"}, "id": "bmgq8dq3ak281"}}, "name": "t3_r4zym8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ftH2f3eQmYeOkKnkBrlzHmZFlLCOduTJLEi9GQxIVUs.jpg", "edited": 1638206423.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1638204496.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bmgq8dq3ak281.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=71033bcf8204da761eb5a810c59f6c7062088c1a\"&gt;That&amp;#39;s only 1/4th of what I learned.

Those lessons depend on the position of your assemblage point, since that determines how they can interact with you.\n\nThe other is from *intent*.  Or maybe \"the spirit\" when it's teaching you.\n\nBut both types of lessons have to use the same mechanism. Directing your awareness to notice something, and then combining things you noticed, to cause you to draw a conclusion.\n\nIf you think about it, that's how we learn in school also. A well designed text book for a class such as geometry, doesn't tell you the facts and formulas. It tries to lead you to notice something, and draw  your own conclusion.  You feel as if you are \"discovering\" geometry on your own.\n\nBut really, someone is guiding you to notice the topics which connect together to make that science.\n\nI suppose science sounds like an odd word to apply there, because it's mathmatics, but the same word could be applied to Olmec shamanism. It's really a form of very old science.\n\nNormally a lineage lets one of the senior members \"teach\", but you can't really teach sorcery the way you'd expect.  Memorizing facts and rules just makes you an inventory warrior.\n\nThe fliers LOVE inventory warriors.  Pretending to be doing sorcery stirs up the remaining awareness they have,  after being eaten down to their toes, and that stirred up awareness, \"fluffed\" by the pretending they are engaged in using their warrior's inventory, is easier to lick up.\n\nThe fliers basically divert our attention into fantasies, so that we can't learn by the two ways of getting a lesson from outside.\n\nWe're fixed on our own fantasy of getting attention from other people.\n\nYou have to think that if fliers exist exactly as Carlos portrayed them, they have some actual planning going on.  In fact, once in a while Carlos came under attack and would blame it on the fliers, analyzing what they were doing to try to trap people's attention.  To keep them from noticing the lessons the spirit is constantly trying to give them.\n\nFor example, they might plan out different fantasies based on understanding the variety of delusions humans fall into.\n\nMost of those don't involve doing much work.  Humans are too lazy to trap them with something requiring actual effort, and worse, when a human is engaged in real effort, the spirit tries to help them along their path.\n\nSo the fliers design delusion systems that require no work, and give plenty of opportinuty for fake learning.  Memorizing facts.  By focusing their attention on accumulating facts, they also focus it on obsession with other people, from whom they get the facts, and with whom they demonstrate their knowledge, to get the attention they want.\n\nIn some ways, \"the fliers\" are a teaching tool Carlos left to us.  Whether you believe they exist or not, they are a \"worthy opponent\".\n\nThat's an external threat designed to break the cycle of fantisies and attention seeking that humans  have fallen into, perhaps by direct planning of the fliers.  Or maybe not.\n\nIt's a \"worthy opponent\" that's been turbo charged.  A super villian if you will.\n\nAs a worthy opponent, a witch like La Catalina has limited power.  But in that teaching environment, you don't want an all powerful worthy opponent because you have a human teacher (don Juan) directing the awareness of the student, in his interactions with the worthy opponent.\n\nWith a group such as ours, you need a different order of worthy opponent.\n\nCarlos gave us an all powerful enemy, who attacks by modifying your own behavior.  Making it incompatible with sorcery learning.\n\nSo you could infer that the fliers have designed traps for different types of people, in order to prevent any descent by individuals,  which could spread and cause their food source to dry up.\n\nThe main trap is, \"the principle of the universe is love\".\n\nThis particular delusion works very well on the women, since they often need self-soothing, from horizontal movements of their assemblage points in response to the reproductive cycle.\n\nIf you look around on magic and personal growth system's web pages, you often find women trying to redefine that system as being based on love.    I suppose you could say those women have realized the main delusion is false, and does not lead to happiness, so they've expanded the love delusion to include outside weird stuff, like magic.  You've got your main pacifier, \"love\", and then when that fails they can pretend they have some form of magic.  Which makes them, \"love warriors\".\n\nOutside that love swamp you have dissatisfied people who don't care about that factor much at all. For those you design complete \"isolation suits\".  So they can put on their delusions, other people can see their attention seeking activity, and they can pretend to be a superior being instead of trying to participate in the love fest delusion.\n\nThey have the classics.\n\nBuddha Boy who's super powers are to be wiser than everyone else, and to have gained magical powers due to his amazing wiseness.\n\nBuddha boy's main environment is to sit around relaxing with his eyes closed.  While searching inside himself for anything interesting going on.\n\nThat stirs up whatever remaining awareness he still has, so that the fliers can lick that up more easily.  The goal is to tranqualize descenters as much as possible, since the ones stuck in the love delusion have plenty of other slaves to the fliers, to keep them in line.\n\nBut Buddha boy doesn't appeal to everyone who's rejected the love delusion, so the fliers created \"Magic Man\".\n\nMagic man is a procedural being. He's superior because of his knowledge of rituals.  That of course requires different kinds of magic men, because of local cultural differences in rituals.\n\nThere's Dao Master,  Euro Wizard,  Culture Rejector (includes shamans), and Drug Lord.\n\nWe've seen those in here, but it's important to remember, they're all placebos to trap awareness and block people from getting lessons from intent itself, along their chosen path.\n\nThe fliers need our attention trapped in our thoughts, so we can't discover what's going on outside of us and learn to move our awareness into other realms.\n\nI suppose in some ways, each delusion is a slightly different trap for the attention of humans, refocusing it on some secondary obsession, slightly different than the main delusion controlling mankind.\n\nA sorcery teacher ought to notice the delusion diversion that's taken control of his apprentices.\n\nWhich brand of alternate delusion the fliers have used to tie up the awareness of that person.\n\nHowever, that's a difficult task, requiring deep insight into people.\n\nEasier is to help them build a new phantom reality.\n\nCreate a new \"story\" to attract their awareness, but then make it more real than the other alternate \"stories\" such as Buddha Boy or Dao Master, by placing that story inside a phantom reality which has visible and real attributes to it.\n\nIt's not just a story, it contains real elements that are outside what is known in the normal attention traps the fliers imposed on people.\n\nSomething which is outside the known and difficult to perceive, falls into the category of dreaming when observed from the outside, so you could say that sorcery is the process of dreaming yourself into another phantom reality.\n\nFortunately a given phantom reality leaves traces of awareness on the specific emanations skimmed by intent, to produce that new reality.\n\nWhich makes it easier for a different person to \"skim\". Over a very long period of time, you can make an alternate reality which is available to anyone, just as our \"real\" reality is universally available.\n\nThe fliers don't like that, which accounts for the endless nature of the attacks on this subreddit, all designed to divert attention back to the normal cages the fliers use.  \n\nChief of which in here, is the inventory warrior delusion.\n\nNot much of a lesson, was that?\n\nIn fact, you can stretch that lesson to include analysis of phantom realities created by tensegrity, and the mechanics of how they work.\n\nFor example (one you can try yourself), \"building an energy body\".\n\nIt actually makes no sense if you think about it, from outside the story it is part of.\n\nIt works, as a phantom reality, and is the main phantom reality we imploy to learn sorcery\n\nBut it actually doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nWhy not leave the puffs of awareness where they want to go inside the luminous shell, instead of pushing them into the middle?\n\nSo, rather than \"scoop\" puffs and move them, why not investigate \"natural puff flow\"?\n\nThat's one of the lessons I got. \n\nAt the end of the lesson I realized, Carlos hid that in the Tensegrity also.\n\nSome of the long forms teach \"puff flow\".\n\nThere's also \"cobweb physics\".\n\nSlightly different \"stories\" possible inside the Tensegrity story.\n\nIf this placce matures, we might discover that the fliers are right.  You need slightly different \"stories\" for different types of people.\n\nWe'd possibly do weell to add \"puff flow\" and \"cobweb physics\" to our \"puffery\" practices.\n\nBoth of those were taught by  Carlos.  I just didn't notice those before, as an actual topical path.", "edited": 1638275243.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hmnj7a8", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight I was investigating whether a given long form produces a consistant phantom room, for a specific person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While investigating I tapped into something and got a series of &amp;quot;lessons&amp;quot; on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two common ways you can get a &amp;quot;lesson&amp;quot; from outside your own understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is from an inorganic being.  Those lessons depend on the position of your assemblage point, since that determines how they can interact with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other is from &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.  Or maybe &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; when it&amp;#39;s teaching you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But both types of lessons have to use the same mechanism. Directing your awareness to notice something, and then combining things you noticed, to cause you to draw a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, that&amp;#39;s how we learn in school also. A well designed text book for a class such as geometry, doesn&amp;#39;t tell you the facts and formulas. It tries to lead you to notice something, and draw  your own conclusion.  You feel as if you are &amp;quot;discovering&amp;quot; geometry on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, someone is guiding you to notice the topics which connect together to make that science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose science sounds like an odd word to apply there, because it&amp;#39;s mathmatics, but the same word could be applied to Olmec shamanism. It&amp;#39;s really a form of very old science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally a lineage lets one of the senior members &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot;, but you can&amp;#39;t really teach sorcery the way you&amp;#39;d expect.  Memorizing facts and rules just makes you an inventory warrior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fliers LOVE inventory warriors.  Pretending to be doing sorcery stirs up the remaining awareness they have,  after being eaten down to their toes, and that stirred up awareness, &amp;quot;fluffed&amp;quot; by the pretending they are engaged in using their warrior&amp;#39;s inventory, is easier to lick up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fliers basically divert our attention into fantasies, so that we can&amp;#39;t learn by the two ways of getting a lesson from outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re fixed on our own fantasy of getting attention from other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to think that if fliers exist exactly as Carlos portrayed them, they have some actual planning going on.  In fact, once in a while Carlos came under attack and would blame it on the fliers, analyzing what they were doing to try to trap people&amp;#39;s attention.  To keep them from noticing the lessons the spirit is constantly trying to give them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, they might plan out different fantasies based on understanding the variety of delusions humans fall into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of those don&amp;#39;t involve doing much work.  Humans are too lazy to trap them with something requiring actual effort, and worse, when a human is engaged in real effort, the spirit tries to help them along their path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the fliers design delusion systems that require no work, and give plenty of opportinuty for fake learning.  Memorizing facts.  By focusing their attention on accumulating facts, they also focus it on obsession with other people, from whom they get the facts, and with whom they demonstrate their knowledge, to get the attention they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some ways, &amp;quot;the fliers&amp;quot; are a teaching tool Carlos left to us.  Whether you believe they exist or not, they are a &amp;quot;worthy opponent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an external threat designed to break the cycle of fantisies and attention seeking that humans  have fallen into, perhaps by direct planning of the fliers.  Or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;worthy opponent&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s been turbo charged.  A super villian if you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a worthy opponent, a witch like La Catalina has limited power.  But in that teaching environment, you don&amp;#39;t want an all powerful worthy opponent because you have a human teacher (don Juan) directing the awareness of the student, in his interactions with the worthy opponent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a group such as ours, you need a different order of worthy opponent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave us an all powerful enemy, who attacks by modifying your own behavior.  Making it incompatible with sorcery learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could infer that the fliers have designed traps for different types of people, in order to prevent any descent by individuals,  which could spread and cause their food source to dry up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main trap is, &amp;quot;the principle of the universe is love&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This particular delusion works very well on the women, since they often need self-soothing, from horizontal movements of their assemblage points in response to the reproductive cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look around on magic and personal growth system&amp;#39;s web pages, you often find women trying to redefine that system as being based on love.    I suppose you could say those women have realized the main delusion is false, and does not lead to happiness, so they&amp;#39;ve expanded the love delusion to include outside weird stuff, like magic.  You&amp;#39;ve got your main pacifier, &amp;quot;love&amp;quot;, and then when that fails they can pretend they have some form of magic.  Which makes them, &amp;quot;love warriors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside that love swamp you have dissatisfied people who don&amp;#39;t care about that factor much at all. For those you design complete &amp;quot;isolation suits&amp;quot;.  So they can put on their delusions, other people can see their attention seeking activity, and they can pretend to be a superior being instead of trying to participate in the love fest delusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have the classics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddha Boy who&amp;#39;s super powers are to be wiser than everyone else, and to have gained magical powers due to his amazing wiseness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddha boy&amp;#39;s main environment is to sit around relaxing with his eyes closed.

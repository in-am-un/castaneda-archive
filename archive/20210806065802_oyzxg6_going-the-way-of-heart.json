Do you have to paint the nails?    Do you have to give a blessing to Gaia?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does it use trigonometry, chemicals, special clothing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day you just do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a gift from &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, an outside conscious force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You WILL understand that, after a few months of serious darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you won&amp;#39;t feel as stupid shouting &amp;quot;Intent!&amp;quot; outdoors, when you need some help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, intent is connected to a &amp;quot;phantom reality&amp;quot;, the same as the phantom bedroom you will eventually have, from practicing sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the phantom reality of the Olmecs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We &amp;quot;hook&amp;quot; ourselves to it by only following that, and rejecting everything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we work  hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure it really matters what kind of work you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just that you are putting in effort, and need some help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure you could dig a very deep ditch, one mile long, and that could count as hard work on the path of sorcery, as long as that was what you had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then intent notices your hard work, looks in it&amp;#39;s Santa Claus book that tells all there is to know about everyone, finds your name and sees, &amp;#39;Olmec shamanism&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it gives you help along the Olmec Shamanism path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you also have the Oneirosophy interest listed in that book, you&amp;#39;re going to get some kind of mutated path with a little of both. Intent will help you with both at the same time, which doesn&amp;#39;t really help with either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which will NOT get you to the destination we seek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos emphasized this over and over in his final books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was almost embarrassing to read him, going on and on about &amp;quot;The &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has don Juan saying it&amp;#39;s our only viable intent path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a destination that anything you want to practice leads to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it will only be  you, and so 100 times harder to travel that path than if you have thousands of sorcerers from the past, pulling on you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If on the other hand, you can fit that system into &amp;quot;stalking&amp;quot;, then it&amp;#39;s ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just modify it a tiny bit, to be a form of Olmec practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you like to cross dress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fine. Go ahead.  But do it as a stalking maneuver, like it suggests in one of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is also one aspect of being, &amp;quot;Impeccable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep all of your activities in the &amp;quot;approved&amp;quot; form of &amp;quot;official Olmec Shamanism&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If every action is &amp;quot;impeccable&amp;quot;, then all are sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t get confused about exactly what type of help you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Daoist sorcerers out there are screwed. The Castaneda people in love with cheap Chinese philosophy, thinking they have an advantage because they&amp;#39;ve studied that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the Astral Travel sorcerers.  Screwed big time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Won&amp;#39;t get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too incompatible, and those paths go nowhere on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t mean other things can&amp;#39;t get you to the green line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some even the red line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But never to the end of the line, as we seek

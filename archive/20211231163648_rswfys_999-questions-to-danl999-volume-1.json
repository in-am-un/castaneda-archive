So that is what I  consequently did over the last weeks.\n\nI believe that these are questions most of us beginners do struggle with in one way or another.\n\nIn order to not take too much of your time, I tried to structure the questions according to main categories / topics.\n\nIt  would be awesome if you (and others) could answer these (of course, feel free to skip questions  if you find them inappropriate etc.). Also, please be aware that there  is obviously no time pressure neither. Further, I tried to write the questions in a  way which sometimes allows for shorter answers (sometimes even \"yes\" / \"no\").  \n \n\nMaybe this attempt will enable us beginners to be on the \"same page\".\n\nPlease  forgive me if some of the questions are a bit provocative, the idea is  to overcome hurdles and I guess sometimes that requires to ask potentially  uncomfortable questions, you are welcome to shoot me down in response (as stated, I am still learning).  \n \n\n**Special Note 1:**  \nPlease understand that I am a  beginner, also remember that when you read CC asking DJ questions, he  often appears (I guess purposefully) as the \"dummy\", well, it is not  much different here when beginners ask questions to more experienced practitioners. So please be patient with us.  \n \n\n**Special Note 2:**\n\nSince I collected these questions over time, it may sometimes feel  as if they contradict one another (since I developed a bit in the  meantime), however, I decided to leave some \"older\" questions in the  list, considering what I had written above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Special Note 3:**\n\nThis is the first volume of other questions collections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Special Note 4:**\n\nPlease note that I am not a native speaker.  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. Techniques**\n\n**Dark Room practice (technique)**  \n\n\n**1.** It seems that if I am in the dark room and do not move much, less  is 'happening' as compared to doing some tensegrity moves. Would it make  sense to do a whole sequence of tensegrity moves in the dark room at the beginning of a session?\n\n**2.** Do you sometimes invite IOBs by 'saying out loud' certain phrases? If yes, which ones? Would it be like an explicit invitation?  \n \n\n**3.** Even if the room is completely dark, I often noticed \"traces\" of  my hands. So if I move them, they seem to have \"light\" traces. However, I  am not sure what to do with that. Any suggestions? \n\n**4.** I often see \"faces\" or even complete beings, however, sometimes,  if I try to scoop these, they do not allow for that. Any suggestions?\n\n**5.** Could equivalent experiences be achieved by starring into a  crystal ball or equivalent objects, so that the mind is \"diverted\" by  focusing on a particular object? Or is that not as powerful as the dark room approach?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tensegrity (technique)**  \n  **6.** I practice the moves every morning. Is it essential to do all  of the moves or am I free to select the ones I like only? Is there some  degree of discretion or is it a strict practice?  \n   \n  **7.** Can I do the moves in my own order? Or should one rather stick to the sequence as it is taught?   \n   \n **8.**\u00a0 If I do some of the moves in a rather \"sloppy\" fashion, would they be less effective as a consequence? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**J-curve &amp; AP (technique)**\n\n**9.** I apply a technique which was mentioned somewhere in the  books, where I \"massage\" that energy point in front of the belly (to the  right) every day, I had quite good results with that. However, since the  AP during the day is in the blue zone and not there, does it actually  make sense? Isn't that rather the \"desired\" location of the AP as opposed to the current location (in the upper left blue zone)?  \n \n\n**10.** The other day when I did DRP, I suddenly super-focused and 'visualized' how I would  move the AP down, from the blue to the green zone and even further down.  To my surprise, that actually worked (albeit it was definitely anything but easy), however, the AP would literally  \"snap back\" hard to the higher positions as soon as I stopped \"forcing\" it  (or losing focus) and the lower it came the harder it was to push it any further. That said, it  actually worked, up to the point that when I approached the orange zone,  the environment would literally change, even if it was just for a few  seconds, up to the point where it was REALLY creepy and the surroundings  looked a little, well let's say \"hellish\".   \nHowever, I have never heard  of that method, should I pursue it if it works for me or should I rather  focus on the \"proven\" techniques?  \n \n\n**Stalking (technique)** \n\n**11.** I applied a number of stalking techniques (i.e. completely breaking old  routines and patterns of behavior), this helped me to  dissolve my ego quite a bit. However, is the objective to absolutely  change ALL \"common\" types of behaviors we follow?  \n \n\n**12.** Are these changes meant to be completely permanent? Why is it  not the explicit objective to replace \"bad\" patterns of behaviour with  \"better\" ones? For example, from \"unhealthy\" to \"healthy\" eating etc.?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dreaming (technique)**  \n  **13.** Since I practice the techniques etc. I experience very intense  dreams, more intense than I ever experienced in my life. They go far  above what people would call \"lucid dreaming\" or \"astral projection\".  For example, I tend to visit places which I can only describe as being  from another universe, however, the same places may appear in several  dreams. However, I have to admit, sometimes, similar when trying to do  DRP, the \"thinking mind\" and \"internal dialog\" kick in and mess it all  up, for example suddenly creating \"to do lists\" within the dream and  other stupid things, bringing over bad habits from the material world  over into the beautiful dream. Any ideas how this can be stopped from  happening? Should I try the \"crystals between fingers\" method?  \n   \n \n\n**2. Content:**\n\n**IOBs**\n\n**14.** From your posts it seems that you would not be very selective with regards to inviting IOBs, however is it desirable to  befriend only specific IOBs / to stay away from others? Do they expect  anything in return (other than attention / energy)?\n\n**15.**\u00a0 In CC's books it is mentioned several times that IOBs \"cannot  lie\" as such, well, is that really true? What about the blue scout incident, for  example?\n\n**16.** Can every IOB take on absolutely any form it likes? Or is that an ability of specific IOBs only?  \n \n\n**River of Filth (\"River of Sh\\*t\" vs. \"River of Love\")**\n\n**17.** This  topic will keep me busy for some years I think. Because it boils down  to some of the most fundamental aspects of \"existence\". \n\nLet me try to describe what I mean.  \n Yes,  if you want to look for it, you will find it ALL in this human life;  greed, jealousy, hate, egotism, violence, betrayal, ignorance, materialism,  lust for power etc. It is part of our world today. For  example, we still have nasty wars, we have poverty (in a world of  abundance), we treat nature and animals as prisoners, the capitalist  system thrives on competition and exploitation, people see 'money' as  their God etc.   \n However, at the very same time, we do see all the beautiful things as well.  \n Yes,  we can also see, unconditional love, compassion, gratitude, hope,  improvement, progress etc. This can manifest in people helping other  people with no benefit, countries making peace over war, new  technologies allowing for less pollution, more collective awareness  regarding the treatment of animals, charities financing research trying  to end diseases, poverty etc.  \n One has to admit, what  humans see as \"reality\" contains BOTH these things, not just one of  them. There IS the black and the white.   \n   \n Also, certain people focus on  the dark stuff, while others focus on the light stuff. To see this  dimension just as either the \"River of Shit\" or the \"River of Love\"  would BOTH be ignorant and a 'limiting belief', since you can clearly find the two in this  dimension.  \n From CC's books, I get the feeling  that the \"River of Filth\" phrase was rather used with 'tongue in cheek'.  It did not imply a complete and utter rejection of the outside world as  it is. After all, CC was known for enjoying many things within the RoS  (i.e. drinks, women, food). Or would you disagree wih that statement and say that this  \"reality\" is the RoS ONLY? But again, would that not be a 'dogmatic belief system' then?  \n \n\n**Sobreity**  \n  **18.** Would you be so kind to elaborate on which approaches / habits / routines have worked best for you?  \n   \n **Inventory**\n\n**19.** Is recapitulation / stalking the best way to reduce one's inventory? Or are there other techniques?  \n \n\n**Energy Body / Energy Double**\n\n**20.** As an experienced sorcerer, are you able to actively move  your energy double at will? Or do you need to be within the 'second  attention' always? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Second Attention**\n\n**21.** Does certain breath work help to reach the second attention?   \n \n\n*Other:*\n\n**Interlude: Personal questions**   \n   **22.** As an experienced practicioner, do you sometimes feel that you get \"too far out\"?  \n  **23.** Did you ever try to practice sorcery together with other experienced  sorcerers? Is it possible to simultaneously see the same IOBs?  \n  **24.** Do other sorcerers here have experiences with the same IOBs you encountered before?  \n   \n  **25.** What is your overall motive / intent regarding your work here? To ultimately start a new lineage?  \n  **26.** Do you intend to become an IOB yourself before dying?  \n  **27.** Did you pick the \"999\" as a reversed \"666\" to provoke people who believe in the existence of Lucifer?\u00a0\u00a0 ;-)  \n \n\n**The \"Witches\"**\n\n**28.** Is it likely that three of them actually disappeared? I mean  not only energetically, but even physically? Could it be that they are  IOBs now?  \n \n\n**The Ancient Sorcerers** \n\n**29.** At several places it is stated that the Ancient Sorcerers  used  magic for \"power\" and even to \"harm others\". So that would definitely be  \"black magic\" then, isn't it? If that is the case, would a \"white  magic\" lineage be possible? One that tries to help this world to  progress? I know that you do not like such ideas, but is it a  possibility?  \n \n\n**CC's books**\n\n**30.** You mentioned before that \"80% of the books are trickery\",  however, it seems that each book contains quite a few nuggets with  concise practical use. However, one apparently needs to have reached  certain levels before 'seeing' those. Did CC intend to publish another  book before his death? Or did he fully limit himself to the work shops  only?  \n \n\n**Human blockages towards sorcery**  \n \u00a0**31.** We live in a \"thought-driven\", cognitive, materialistic  society. \"Head people\" are the ones everyone listens to. We lost a lot  of mysticism.   \n Because  the subject here is sorcery and mysticism, there are no straight answers  to the  \"logical, rational mind\" asking \"fundamental\" questions like; 'why  should I do this', 'what is it', 'how does it benefit me' etc. However,  isn't that\u00a0 also a 'self-selecting system' per se? So it keeps anyone  away who currently has too much inventory?   \n   \n \n\n**General**\n\n**32.** Is it not dangerous to make all that secret knowledge here  available to anyone out there including groups / people who potentially  have harmful intentions towards humanity? \n\n**33.** Are we not way too judgemental towards some ancient traditions?  For example, if a monk spends 5 to 10 years in a cold cave in the  Himalayas and meditates 10h per day (with a minimum of nutrition and water), would he not most certainly engage in \"dark room  practice on steroids\"?  \n \n\n**34.** Do secret societies (freemasons, illuminati etc.) practice that kind of magic? Do they enagage with dark IOBs?\n\n**35.** It is apparent that ancient cultures have encountered IOBs,  in fact, once one has a bit of exposure to real sorcery, many wall  paintings suddenly make a lot of sense (I could post several interesting  examples across all cultures). Is the nagual lineage really the only  one that applies sorcery as shown? Or could there be lineages from other  cultures which are entirely unknown to us? Would there not be an  incentive for lineages to stay secret?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA big THANK YOU\n\nand Happy New Year to everyone!!!!!!!!", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "'999 Questions' to danl999 (Volume 1)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_rswfys", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_as3sfzaz", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1640965008.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Danl999,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently saw your post with regard to the possibility that overall, we are &amp;#39;failing&amp;#39;; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt bad that this could be the case indeed, so I was sitting down several weeks ago  and thought hard about what I as a beginner can do in order to bring new momentum into this  project (from our perspective, the group of beginners).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at  the fact that many beginners seem to ask similar questions / struggle  with similar problems, I realized that I should put together an  exhaustive list of  questions (also with the idea that you and others do not need to repeat  the same / similar answers over and over again).

Or are there other techniques?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Body / Energy Double&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.&lt;/strong&gt; As an experienced sorcerer, are you able to actively move  your energy double at will? Or do you need to be within the &amp;#39;second  attention&amp;#39; always? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21.&lt;/strong&gt; Does certain breath work help to reach the second attention?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interlude: Personal questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n   &lt;strong&gt;22.&lt;/strong&gt; As an experienced practicioner, do you sometimes feel that you get &amp;quot;too far out&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;strong&gt;23.&lt;/strong&gt; Did you ever try to practice sorcery together with other experienced  sorcerers? Is it possible to simultaneously see the same IOBs?&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;strong&gt;24.&lt;/strong&gt; Do other sorcerers here have experiences with the same IOBs you encountered before?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25.&lt;/strong&gt; What is your overall motive / intent regarding your work here? To ultimately start a new lineage?&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;strong&gt;26.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you intend to become an IOB yourself before dying?&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;strong&gt;27.&lt;/strong&gt; Did you pick the &amp;quot;999&amp;quot; as a reversed &amp;quot;666&amp;quot; to provoke people who believe in the existence of Lucifer?\u00a0\u00a0 ;-)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;Witches&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28.&lt;/strong&gt; Is it likely that three of them actually disappeared? I mean  not only energetically, but even physically? Could it be that they are  IOBs now?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ancient Sorcerers&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29.&lt;/strong&gt; At several places it is stated that the Ancient Sorcerers  used  magic for &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; and even to &amp;quot;harm others&amp;quot;. So that would definitely be  &amp;quot;black magic&amp;quot; then, isn&amp;#39;t it? If that is the case, would a &amp;quot;white  magic&amp;quot; lineage be possible? One that tries to help this world to  progress? I know that you do not like such ideas, but is it a  possibility?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CC&amp;#39;s books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30.&lt;/strong&gt; You mentioned before that &amp;quot;80% of the books are trickery&amp;quot;,  however, it seems that each book contains quite a few nuggets with  concise practical use. However, one apparently needs to have reached  certain levels before &amp;#39;seeing&amp;#39; those. Did CC intend to publish another  book before his death? Or did he fully limit himself to the work shops  only?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human blockages towards sorcery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n \u00a0&lt;strong&gt;31.&lt;/strong&gt; We live in a &amp;quot;thought-driven&amp;quot;, cognitive, materialistic  society. &amp;quot;Head people&amp;quot; are the ones everyone listens to. We lost a lot  of mysticism.&lt;br/&gt;\n Because  the subject here is sorcery and mysticism, there are no straight answers  to the  &amp;quot;logical, rational mind&amp;quot; asking &amp;quot;fundamental&amp;quot; questions like; &amp;#39;why  should I do this&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;what is it&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;how does it benefit me&amp;#39; etc. However,  isn&amp;#39;t that\u00a0 also a &amp;#39;self-selecting system&amp;#39; per se? So it keeps anyone  away who currently has too much inventory?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32.&lt;/strong&gt; Is it not dangerous to make all that secret knowledge here  available to anyone out there including groups / people who potentially  have harmful intentions towards humanity? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33.&lt;/strong&gt; Are we not way too judgemental towards some ancient traditions?  For example, if a monk spends 5 to 10 years in a cold cave in the  Himalayas and meditates 10h per day (with a minimum of nutrition and water), would he not most certainly engage in &amp;quot;dark room  practice on steroids&amp;quot;?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34.&lt;/strong&gt; Do secret societies (freemasons, illuminati etc.) practice that kind of magic? Do they enagage with dark IOBs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35.&lt;/strong&gt; It is apparent that ancient cultures have encountered IOBs,  in fact, once one has a bit of exposure to real sorcery, many wall  paintings suddenly make a lot of sense (I could post several interesting  examples across all cultures). Is the nagual lineage really the only  one that applies sorcery as shown? Or could there be lineages from other  cultures which are entirely unknown to us? Would there not be an  incentive for lineages to stay secret?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big THANK YOU&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and Happy New Year to everyone!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "rswfys", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FractalFreak21", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 31, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rswfys/999_questions_to_danl999_volume_1/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rswfys/999_questions_to_danl999_volume_1/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1640965008.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hqpbeak", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "shortroundsuicide", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1640971363.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hqp7srv", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_d1s73", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thank you for being kind and for taking OP\u2019s comments seriously.

Would it be like an explicit invitation?\n\n**If you want to shout, shout; if intent is telling you to shout, follow it.  Don't overcomplicate all this.  Silence leads to intent, intent runs the show.**\n\n3. Even if the room is completely dark, I often noticed \"traces\" of my hands. So if I move them, they seem to have \"light\" traces. However, I am not sure what to do with that. Any suggestions?\n\n**If you get somewhere following them, follow them.  If you don't, don't. Experiment.**\n\n4. I often see \"faces\" or even complete beings, however, sometimes, if I try to scoop these, they do not allow for that. Any suggestions?\n\n**The answer to all of these early questions is the same: experiment.**\n\n5. Could equivalent experiences be achieved by starring into a crystal ball or equivalent objects, so that the mind is \"diverted\" by focusing on a particular object? Or is that not as powerful as the dark room approach?\n\n**Yes, definitely can use objects, patterns, etc.  But darkroom is ultimately best, because you closely related to 'closing your eyes', which you can carry with you always.  You don't want to become reliant on objects.  But you have nothing to lose by trying new techniques.  If you become proficient at gazing, you can also do that anywhere. Again, experiment.**\n\nTensegrity (technique)6. I practice the moves every morning. Is it essential to do all of the moves or am I free to select the ones I like only? Is there some degree of discretion or is it a strict practice?\n\n**It's whatever gets you to silence, whatever helps you move the AP.  Try the sequences as instructed and if it helps, use it.  If not, go try a la carte, making up your own progression.**\n\n7. Can I do the moves in my own order? Or should one rather stick to the sequence as it is taught?\n\n**Seems like the same question as 6.**\n\n8.  If I do some of the moves in a rather \"sloppy\" fashion, would they be less effective as a consequence?**What's your experience been?  You should also realize you don't need the moves at all. It's whatever helps you loosen the AP.**\n\n9. I apply a technique which was mentioned somewhere in the books, where I \"massage\" that energy point in front of the belly (to the right) every day, I had quite good results with that. However, since the AP during the day is in the blue zone and not there, does it actually make sense?\n\n**If you have good results with it, why would you stop?**\n\n10. The other day when I did DRP.... However, I have never heard of that method, should I pursue it if it works for me or should I rather focus on the \"proven\" techniques?\n\n**You don't have a Nagual.  We are teaching ourselves, most of us.  Why would you do a U-turn on something that's working?**\n\nStalking (technique)11. I applied a number of stalking techniques (i.e. completely breaking old routines and patterns of behavior), this helped me to dissolve my ego quite a bit.\n\n**I'm sorry but that made me laugh when taking the massive size of your post into consideration.**\n\nHowever, is the objective to absolutely change ALL \"common\" types of behaviors we follow?\n\n**The main objective of stalking is to hold the assemblage point in a new position.  The place of doing this is the place of inner silence.  Whatever stalking techniques you use to get there, that's up to you.  You may know the place I'm talking about, but the question is, can you hold it - without fear, lust, self, ego, etc... getting in the way. The objective of a great stalker is to hold the new position of the AP.**\n\n12. Are these changes meant to be completely permanent? Why is it not the explicit objective to replace \"bad\" patterns of behaviour with \"better\" ones? For example, from \"unhealthy\" to \"healthy\" eating etc.?\n\n**The changes are meant to conserve energy. Drop good and bad and better and just think in terms of how to preserve your energy, scrape for it.  Through food, exercise, sleep, meditation, whatever.   That is the goal.  Keep it simple.  Practice stalking, conserve energy, find silence, feel intent, let intent run the show after that, using your stalking and dreaming techniques.   I feel like you are getting too caught up in structure and forms.  They are useful, but over structuring will cloud your link to intent. The mood you want is light, clear.**Dreaming (technique)13. Since I practice the techniques etc. I experience very intense dreams, more intense than I ever experienced in my life. They go far above what people would call \"lucid dreaming\" or \"astral projection\"...... bringing over bad habits from the material world over into the beautiful dream. Any ideas how this can be stopped from happening? Should I try the \"crystals between fingers\" method?\n\n**I can tell you I've had those experiences and dreams for 20 years.  What's happening is your AP is moving on its own, your inner silence is working, and you are getting free samples without control.  Big debate on whether all of that is just mental masturbation, turning you into an insufferable prick, or whether these are valuable lessons and experiences.  I say, make the most of them, try to practice your techniques when you find yourself in a lucid dream or astral projections - and re: the other worlds you've spoken of, sometimes they honestly are just lucid dreams.  Other times, real worlds.  Best way to tell is \"how did you get there\".  Was a \"dream figure' involved in getting you there?  Then that's an IOB.  Take it seriously.  They give off totally different energy.  And by the way, those 'to do lists' that come into your head and ruin your practice - all of that is lack of stalking technique.  Remember stalking holds the AP in the new position, and we do this ultimately through silence.  Silence trumps all.  Don't think.  Follow intent.  Use all your inner silence techniques IN THE DREAM.   And remember also that energy is a huge key in your ability to hold the AP in the new position.  If you can't 'last long' consider more energy scraping techniques in waking world, energy conservation.  Re: crystals, I've been dreaming proficiently for 20 years and have never used them.  That being said, why not try it out if you are curious?**\n\n2. Content:IOBs14. From your posts it seems that you would not be very selective with regards to inviting IOBs, however is it desirable to befriend only specific IOBs / to stay away from others? Do they expect anything in return (other than attention / energy)?\n\n**They want fear or awe, in my experience.  Try to give awe, it's an overall more pleasant.  Wrestle them if they give you fear.**\n\n**The rest of your questions seemed directed towards Dan alone.**\n\n**Hope some of this helped.  You are coming to it with a lot of energy, which is great, but also a lot of ego.  If you're dreaming the way you say, your AP is loosening and moving all over the place.  It can be overwhelming.  The remedy is more stalking, more 'living in the world' by day, you should always be able to 'put on a suit and go into a bank', no matter how intense your sorcery is. If you are using drugs, that can cause a lot of wild AP shifts.  Again, stalking is the answer for someone who is overwhelmed by dreaming.

He is rather strategic of what he does; because that way, only students who are really serious about this will take those slaps, come back for more and keep on practicing, **something which DJM succeeded in making CC do**, too. I could even imagine that danl999 is actually  a really nice person (now I will get shot down for \"gossiping\"), but he knows that he has a specific role here and he fills it out to the best of his ability.

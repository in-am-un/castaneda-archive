Isn&amp;#39;t it better?\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4c&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I saw something, hooray! \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0e I took a deep breath and tried to focus on my womb and silence my cut inner dialogue. I almost gave up and the sun had risen while I couldn&amp;#39;t even \ud83d\udca4, so I grabbed a piece of cloth and covered my face like nuns do and lay down\ud83e\udd77\ud83e\uddd5. It was obviously dark, my eyes were closed\ud83e\udd37, and I thought it&amp;#39;s okay\ud83e\udd26, I&amp;#39;ll try to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;( Of course\ud83d\ude45, I slept a little\ud83e\udd74, but because I masturbated and I wanted to understand how not to waste my sexual energy\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd2b\ud83e\udd2a, I tried to bring the energy up by breathing from my womb, and according to the Egyptian guidance of one of my friends\ud83d\ude10\ud83e\udee3\ud83d\ude12, to rotate the energy according to the ankh of the pharaohs and not to waste it, its made a small change\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude17 and  I was happy \ud83e\udd17 but lost and failed\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udc7b.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energy that I had for the dream jumped\ud83e\udd7a.  I had a dream for a few seconds, but I was thrown out, I laughed\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude06 because I saw that the person who approached me wanted to say hello\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude35, but I lost my attention\ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude3f\ud83d\ude3e and got shot outside\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udca9\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd15... Sorry, my friend\ud83e\udd2a, I couldn&amp;#39;t even say hello\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, it was a good night, come tomorrow\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude18.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I couldn&amp;#39;t see anything . I was very consciously my body. The only way for me to fall asleep was silence, and I succeeded (it&amp;#39;s more effective than sleeping pills\ud83d\udca5). Suddenly\ud83e\udd13, I noticed some light red circles puff with irregular shapes. I watched them come and go and focused on two circles puff above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw something inside them, a picture! Yessss, it was a picture, black and white \ud83d\udc3b\u200d\u2744\ufe0f, shaking \ud83e\udee8. I was so excited \ud83e\udd2f that I didn&amp;#39;t continue watching\ud83d\ude29. I&amp;#39;ll try again\ud83e\udd25.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13b33tr/puffs_are_difficult_to_animate/jl4egof/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1684732939.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_13b33tr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jjbxjhc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1683550957.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jj9rsjm", "score": 12, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That term doesn't have a single meaning.

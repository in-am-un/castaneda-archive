How to enter and exit the IOB realm at will.](https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc5acbd35e46a2ee3c9abece13c7f73e9b59cbed)\n\nFor newbies, I made a comic book page so I could remind people of important topics they had either forgotten, or ignored.  My idea was that it would be a sort of fun story, but that each picture frame would teach you a point from the books which would make it easier for everyone to \"fix\" their sorcery, and actually make it work.\n\nRight now the understanding in the Castaneda community is so messed up that there's no magic at all.\n\nJust a lot of pretending and bullying. It's a very ugly situation, with the reputation of Carlos in the toilet.  And until it's obvious Olmec magic is more powerful than anything else on earth, we won't resolve this equitably.\n\nLily was one of the stars of my original comic.  She's my \"Imp of the Well\", because that's where I found her,  deep in the well of the second attention's assemblage point.\n\nAnd she's used the same visual appearance a few times.\n\nShe was a little imp sitting on a Lily pad, in a shallow pond.\n\nBut she also flies overhead on fire, as brilliant as the sun. It's breathtaking.\n\nAgain, newbies. Let me remind you.\n\nThere's no visualization in sorcery. No pretending. No imagining.\n\nIf a demon doesn't fly overhead completely burning with purple flames, so that you fear your hair will be burned off, you are not doing actual sorcery.\n\nLeave the pretending to the other subreddits.\n\nYou should worry about peeing your pants once in a while!\n\nWe're not playing Tulpa here.   We aren't trying to visualize \"the Golden Buddha\" sitting on our heads.\n\nThis is witchcraft.\n\nIt's eyes wide open!\n\nLily seems to be a dreaming instructor.\n\nFairy taught me darkroom gazing, and we have this subreddit as a result.\n\nBut Fairy didn't teach me how to move the assemblage point horizontally. Fairy was a very good entity, given to me by Carlos.  She's likely been around the lineage for hundreds of years.\n\nAs close to human, as inorganic beings can get.\n\nSo she seems to never do any harm.\n\nIt's true that Fairy and Devil's Weed tried to kidnap Carlos as he was dying.\n\nBut Fairy explained that to me.  They wanted to save him.  Not steal him.\n\nWhen Fairy left to help others, I found Fancy.  And I specifically wanted an untested inorganic being, to see just how dangerous they could be.\n\nThe Castaneda community is afraid of them, mostly because the bullies among them can't do any actual magic. So they try to convince others, magic is dangerous.  Just keep pretending.\n\nFancy is not very nice.  She's pulled a few tricks on me, mostly trying to trap me somewhere.\n\nBut she's a wonderful teacher of horizontal shifts of the assemblage point.\n\nEspecially the \"fancy\" costumes she likes to wear.  Holds my attention firmly, while she slides off into the second attention looking like grownup little red riding hood.\n\nI can't help but follow her into the \"woods\".\n\nLily is different.  She teaches how to EXIT the dark room, into dreams.\n\nThat's always tricky.  Translocation is easy. That's where you see the puffs of light, you play with them, they get brighter, jet black begins to swirl, and then eventually when you look at the walls of your room you see a whitish light.\n\nEventually the whitish light turns into another location.  It looks as if your bedroom is now located in the middle of a jungle. Or an alien planet. Or it's become a 1950s living room.\n\nOr like the cover of Wheel of Time!  Did you know that was actually a \"how to\" picture?\n\nI've been criticized a couple of times for making pictures, by bad players who didn't like others actually learning magic.\n\nBut the truth is, Carlos was making pictures all along.  On his books.\n\nLook carefully at those!  You'll see Little Smoke on many (the moth).\n\nAnd at the end, Carlos even made a poster and gave it out at a workshop, trying to motivate people to learn to get silent and *see*.\n\nCarlos just didn't draw much himself. See egg diagram.\n\nThat was his drawing.\n\nWhen you translocate in your darkroom, trees and bamboo from the new world can even grow right into the room, making you afraid to walk around barefoot.\n\nThere can be a small freeway under your feet, making you afraid you'll step on someone.\n\nI once reached down and pulled out a chunk of Mexico, trying to chase Cholita around 2 continents.\n\nBut you are still in your room the whole time.\n\nTo walk off into that other world seems to always require the help of an inorganic being.\n\nOr a witch.\n\nLily decided to teach me another method, which does not require their help.\n\nSort of.\n\nShe suggested this was what the Nagual Elias did, to travel bodiless around the universe.\n\nI'm still working on that one. It requires a perfect situation, and Lily just keeps teaching.\n\nI can't get where I need to go, without her trying to show me something else.\n\nThe position to make that technique work, is the same position to make most others work.\n\nWhat you *intend* is the only difference most of the time.\n\nIOBs do that. They show you something amazing, make it possible for you to do it, but not necessarily repeat it.\n\nAnd then the next day they teach you something else.\n\nAnd they don't stop.\n\nPossibly that's part of their \"sales pitch\".\n\nThey show you, they have infinite magic to teach.\n\nThis was Lily's second method to leave the dark room, and enter a waking dream world.\n\nA \"story which should never be told\".\n\nAt first, I thought maybe she had some plan to gain energy from a larger audience, using the comic books I was drawing.\n\nShe'd tell me a story that had advanced techniques in it, I'd print it, and more people would learn to interact with the inorganic beings.\n\nA happy arrangement, and perfectly ordinary.\n\nYes, sure. She's a demon.\n\nBut she tells a good story!  And the entire world seeks to be more \"inclusive\".\n\nSo, why not demons too?\n\nAnd she did that!   Told a good story.\n\nHer \"story\" had very advanced techniques in it, disguised as part of the story.\n\nI'm afraid, I lost 80% of the techniques.  That had me thinking, the remaining 20% wasn't enough to draw.\n\nIf Lily decides to finish the story, I'll draw it up.   If not, I won't.\n\nBut they do tend to keep moving on.\n\nHere's what I have so far:\n\nA powerful witch gave 3 magic pouches to 3 beings.\n\nBy the way, the witch was Lily in a hoodie. She tried to turn her  head so I would think it was some \"other witch\", but it was just Lily.\n\nThe magic bags contain the only money you can spend in a scary old amusement park, where all of the attractions teach magic.\n\nThe park is thousands of years old but hasn't been used much in many years.\n\nIf you run out of money, the park guards throw you out.\n\nRoughly.  Best is to  have a little left as you leave, to keep them polite.\n\nIf you make too big of a fuss, there are two \"detectives\" at the park who will take you in to the office for questioning.\n\nLily warned me, the detectives are real. Never look them in the eyes.  Only glance at them.\n\nLily also advised, spend wisely so you can stay longer.\n\nThis story is in fact a game, and you can learn to win at it.\n\nBut losing is not very fun.\n\nI'll add that from what I saw of the story so far, the 3 beings are just 3 people, but one is an old shapeshifter so you can't quite call him a \"person\".\n\nOne is an angry man of the type who has to be tossed out of here on a regular basis.  Those will always exist in the world of magic, unfortunately.\n\nOne is a young witch.  She does the best in the story, because she never pays for anything unless cornered and forced to do it.\n\nWhen I realized that one of them was a witch who never pays, while literally watching the story with Lily, I looked to see if I could recognize the witch.\n\nLily nodded. \"Yes, she's been in here before.\"\n\nShe gave me some tips using the witch. I got to see what she did, with Lily pointing out the important details.\n\nWhen you walk by a magic show, don't turn your head to look.\n\nWindow shop, like a cautious shop lifter suspect.\n\nJust glance briefly at the show on the stage, so that the owner of the exhibit doesn't see that you have looked hard.\n\nIf you look too hard, he decides you have to pay full fare  and watch the entire show.\n\nAnd maybe, you have to watch the ENTIRE show before you can leave.\n\nBut by sneaking a glance on the way by, you can gain some of the knowledge of that show for free.\n\nThe park is so huge, there's no reason to get obsessed with a single magic demonstration.\n\nThe magic bags refill with money each day after you go home,  based on some rules you must discover.\n\nIf you don't follow the rules there's barely any more energy (money) the next day.  If you discover what the rules are, your bag will have as much as you need every single day.\n\nShe confided, no one can do that.  Everyone has had a money shortage.  Even back in the old days.\n\nSome can drift through, barely looking, and they don't lose any money doing it.\n\nBut they see just a wisp of the realness there.\n\nI started to suspect this was a story about the old seers and the inorganic beings realm, and how they used it.\n\nLily discouraged me from repeating that \"unfounded\" rumor.\n\n\"It's just a story\", she told me.\n\nI ran out of energy, and had to go to sleep.\n\nLately, I don't push it.\n\nWell... I did push it two times that night.   So I could stay and watch more of the story with Lily. It was just so interesting.\n\nBut after 2 recharges using quick tensegrity moves, I just had to give up.\n\nI got up and posted what I'd seen on this subreddit in chat.  Because I knew it would all be bone in an hour or two.\n\nThen during the next day I got doubts on whether this whole \"Stories from Lily\" would be worth doing.\n\nI could see that her story contained the secrets of dreaming, but would anyone be able to translate from a silly story, to practical advice?\n\nBut last night I discovered, the magic in Lily's story doesn't require any translation.\n\nI'd gotten home early, and gone to bed so that I had more time with Lily.\n\nA few hours later Cholita was slamming drawers in the kitchen. I was already asleep, but got up to make sure she was all right.  I listened carefully from behind my locked door.  She was all the way in the kitchen, too far away to hear clearly.\n\nShe was chanting softly to herself.   I couldn't make out what she was saying.  Wasn't happy, wasn't sad.\n\nShe was simply chanting, while banging the same kitchen doors over and over again.\n\nOnce in a while it would be obvious she was having a conversation with someone.\n\nBut I heard no other person's voice, and no steps on the noisy wooden floors.\n\nI started practicing my silence as hard as I could.\n\nI got rid of my internal dialogue.  The puffs of color were brilliant in minutes.\n\nThen I got rid of the images in my mind. I vaguely remembered Lily saying, get rid of those and she can replace them for teaching.\n\nIn fact, she even made a little fun of me, for being slow  to  understand that.\n\n\"Of course we replace those images in the mind!  You *see* us floating in the air.  Your mind is silent.  That's an image!\n\nWhat did you think it was?\n\nDidn't you wonder why you can't make up your mind as to whether we can speak with an audible voice?\n\nThere's why. We're images in the mind.  We have more control over you than you can even suspect.\n\nBut we always need permission, so don't worry about it.  You can trust us.\n\nTrue, we can strand you in the desert in a shack, the way Carlos and Carol were almost stranded.\n\nBut you have to have told us it's ok to move you like that.\n\nIf we're an image floating in the air, or a thought inside your mind, what's the difference once the assemblage point moves very far?\n\nThere's no internal or external at that point.\n\nI had to admit, that all should have been obvious.\n\nOnce I got rid of the images in my mind an amber/peach colored light materialized, and an object fell off a shelf up near the ceiling, falling down to the middle of the room where it got stuck.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. I was not only silent, and free of images, but I was far into some sort of distorted space between realities.\n\n\"That's REAL!\" I commented.\n\nLily had arrived.\n\n\"I already told you it was a structure...\" Lily explained.\n\nIt's made of intent????, I asked her.\n\n\"It's the foundation of my story that should not be told\", she replied. \"You volunteered to hear it didn't you?\"\n\nI had to admit, I had been eager to hear it even if I didn't actually ask.\n\n\"We have a much stronger connection to intent than you do.  You could even say, we can build structures with it, and they don't go away for a very long time.\n\nAnd they can be located anywhere. Even inside you.\n\nAs I gazed at it, thinking the intent of the story was odd, another object spilled out.\n\nIt had its own energy.  It was literally shocking.  My head jerked a bit, but it wasn't unpleasant.\n\nI realized, the dark room, when viewed as intent structures, had cracks to other worlds.\n\nIf you could step back from a floating dream, turn it sideways a bit to inspect it for cracks, you can find an entrance to that dream.\n\nAnd so, to exit the dark room into a dream you only had to find the crack that leads into the dream you want to enter.\n\nWhen you get IOB help, they merely show it to you.  You may not realize you are walking through a crack, but they make sure you find the right spot, so you don't smash into the wall.\n\nI tried to gaze between the second object, which was at least 6 feet high and looked like a side view of a very thick CD, and the first object, something like a big flat suitcase, which had fallen and gotten stuck in the air.\n\nThe contents of another world spilled through the middle,   tumbling by like objects rolling down a hill, until I found myself standing in Lily's amusement park.\n\nI didn't move. The amusement park surrounded me on its own.\n\nI'd been sitting up on the bed, but now I was standing in the park.\n\nLily was nearby in a hoodie, ready to give me money and show me the way in.\n\nI realized, \"So THAT'S why the story should never be told!\"\n\nIt really shouldn't.  She was not exaggerating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stories That Should Never Be Told", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"rb3p1sr4gv271": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2361e2f620860a219634f5b658c3885134ab5c15"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a85ad6def8a8fd4b8e490977f970012a6525e81"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd34e2bced54c318cd4cfeba20a28189c3f7b1f6"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baaa0bfb955255dcba8149b29296eeccf181ac00"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93269977880fc408844a07086721adc5c50833bc"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803c12bdc5fd1ca52b5afa0bf26e8e8164c64841"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc5acbd35e46a2ee3c9abece13c7f73e9b59cbed"}, "id": "rb3p1sr4gv271"}}, "name": "t3_nqon1n", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uvk-0NDHiArC-FykuDA8zA6zTcU9SmBtR1zGzmMyI4o.jpg", "edited": 1622660543.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1622648200.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rb3p1sr4gv271.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cc5acbd35e46a2ee3c9abece13c7f73e9b59cbed\"&gt;Lily&amp;#39;s Story that Should Never Be Told.

She&amp;#39;s a demon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she tells a good story!  And the entire world seeks to be more &amp;quot;inclusive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, why not demons too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she did that!   Told a good story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; had very advanced techniques in it, disguised as part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, I lost 80% of the techniques.  That had me thinking, the remaining 20% wasn&amp;#39;t enough to draw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Lily decides to finish the story, I&amp;#39;ll draw it up.   If not, I won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do tend to keep moving on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A powerful witch gave 3 magic pouches to 3 beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, the witch was Lily in a hoodie. She tried to turn her  head so I would think it was some &amp;quot;other witch&amp;quot;, but it was just Lily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The magic bags contain the only money you can spend in a scary old amusement park, where all of the attractions teach magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The park is thousands of years old but hasn&amp;#39;t been used much in many years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you run out of money, the park guards throw you out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roughly.  Best is to  have a little left as you leave, to keep them polite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you make too big of a fuss, there are two &amp;quot;detectives&amp;quot; at the park who will take you in to the office for questioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily warned me, the detectives are real. Never look them in the eyes.  Only glance at them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily also advised, spend wisely so you can stay longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This story is in fact a game, and you can learn to win at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But losing is not very fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll add that from what I saw of the story so far, the 3 beings are just 3 people, but one is an old shapeshifter so you can&amp;#39;t quite call him a &amp;quot;person&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is an angry man of the type who has to be tossed out of here on a regular basis.  Those will always exist in the world of magic, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is a young witch.  She does the best in the story, because she never pays for anything unless cornered and forced to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I realized that one of them was a witch who never pays, while literally watching the story with Lily, I looked to see if I could recognize the witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily nodded. &amp;quot;Yes, she&amp;#39;s been in here before.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gave me some tips using the witch. I got to see what she did, with Lily pointing out the important details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you walk by a magic show, don&amp;#39;t turn your head to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Window shop, like a cautious shop lifter suspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just glance briefly at the show on the stage, so that the owner of the exhibit doesn&amp;#39;t see that you have looked hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look too hard, he decides you have to pay full fare  and watch the entire show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe, you have to watch the ENTIRE show before you can leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by sneaking a glance on the way by, you can gain some of the knowledge of that show for free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The park is so huge, there&amp;#39;s no reason to get obsessed with a single magic demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The magic bags refill with money each day after you go home,  based on some rules you must discover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t follow the rules there&amp;#39;s barely any more energy (money) the next day.  If you discover what the rules are, your bag will have as much as you need every single day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She confided, no one can do that.  Everyone has had a money shortage.  Even back in the old days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some can drift through, barely looking, and they don&amp;#39;t lose any money doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they see just a wisp of the realness there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to suspect this was a story about the old seers and the inorganic beings realm, and how they used it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily discouraged me from repeating that &amp;quot;unfounded&amp;quot; rumor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just a story&amp;quot;, she told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran out of energy, and had to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately, I don&amp;#39;t push it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well... I did push it two times that night.   So I could stay and watch more of the story with Lily. It was just so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after 2 recharges using quick tensegrity moves, I just had to give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up and posted what I&amp;#39;d seen on this subreddit in chat.  Because I knew it would all be bone in an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then during the next day I got doubts on whether this whole &amp;quot;Stories from Lily&amp;quot; would be worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see that her story contained the secrets of dreaming, but would anyone be able to translate from a silly story, to practical advice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But last night I discovered, the magic in Lily&amp;#39;s story doesn&amp;#39;t require any translation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d gotten home early, and gone to bed so that I had more time with Lily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few hours later Cholita was slamming drawers in the kitchen. I was already asleep, but got up to make sure she was all right.  I listened carefully from behind my locked door.  She was all the way in the kitchen, too far away to hear clearly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was chanting softly to herself.   I couldn&amp;#39;t make out what she was saying.  Wasn&amp;#39;t happy, wasn&amp;#39;t sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was simply chanting, while banging the same kitchen doors over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once in a while it would be obvious she was having a conversation with someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I heard no other person&amp;#39;s voice, and no steps on the noisy wooden floors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started practicing my silence as hard as I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got rid of my internal dialogue.  The puffs of color were brilliant in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got rid of the images in my mind. I vaguely remembered Lily saying, get rid of those and she can replace them for teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, she even made a little fun of me, for being slow  to  understand that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course we replace those images in the mind!  You &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; us floating in the air.  Your mind is silent.  That&amp;#39;s an image!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did you think it was?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t you wonder why you can&amp;#39;t make up your mind as to whether we can speak with an audible voice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s why. We&amp;#39;re images in the mind.  We have more control over you than you can even suspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we always need permission, so don&amp;#39;t worry about it.  You can trust us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True, we can strand you in the desert in a shack, the way Carlos and Carol were almost stranded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to have told us it&amp;#39;s ok to move you like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;#39;re an image floating in the air, or a thought inside your mind, what&amp;#39;s the difference once the assemblage point moves very far?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no internal or external at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to admit, that all should have been obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I got rid of the images in my mind an amber/peach colored light materialized, and an object fell off a shelf up near the ceiling, falling down to the middle of the room where it got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat. I was not only silent, and free of images, but I was far into some sort of distorted space between realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s REAL!&amp;quot; I commented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I already told you it was a structure...&amp;quot; Lily explained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s made of intent????, I asked her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the foundation of my story that should not be told&amp;quot;, she replied. &amp;quot;You volunteered to hear it didn&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to admit, I had been eager to hear it even if I didn&amp;#39;t actually ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have a much stronger connection to intent than you do.  You could even say, we can build structures with it, and they don&amp;#39;t go away for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they can be located anywhere. Even inside you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I gazed at it, thinking the intent of the story was odd, another object spilled out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had its own energy.  It was literally shocking.  My head jerked a bit, but it wasn&amp;#39;t unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, the dark room, when viewed as intent structures, had cracks to other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you could step back from a floating dream, turn it sideways a bit to inspect it for cracks, you can find an entrance to that dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, to exit the dark room into a dream you only had to find the crack that leads into the dream you want to enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get IOB help, they merely show it to you.  You may not realize you are walking through a crack, but they make sure you find the right spot, so you don&amp;#39;t smash into the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to gaze between the second object, which was at least 6 feet high and looked like a side view of a very thick CD, and the first object, something like a big flat suitcase, which had fallen and gotten stuck in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The contents of another world spilled through the middle,   tumbling by like objects rolling down a hill, until I found myself standing in Lily&amp;#39;s amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t move. The amusement park surrounded me on its own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been sitting up on the bed, but now I was standing in the park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily was nearby in a hoodie, ready to give me money and show me the way in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, &amp;quot;So THAT&amp;#39;S why the story should never be told!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really shouldn&amp;#39;t.  She was not exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived":

It's all over the books, but easy to overlook.\n\nFor example, Clara's village, which I've been told, the death defier actually made.\n\nThe old seers were masters of dreams that should never be told.\n\nBut here's the puzzling thing.  It isn't quite the story that should not be told, but the details of dreams themselves.\n\nThe story sure.  But inside the story is when you find out what part should not be told.\n\nLily was going to make one for teaching, but I misunderstood a bit what she actually was offering.\n\nIt's a navigation method, for moving around better.  To detach yourself from the dream, in whatever percentage you needed so you didn't get dragged too deeply into the activity, but could still benefit from observing it.\n\nLet's take Lily.  I was trying out the one dreaming technique I retained from her last \"class\", and she materialized.  She liked the type of energy that was generating.\n\nYou could say, I just \"told\" that part of the story by naming what was really just a disturbance of light in the air, \"Lily\".\n\nNot to say she's just imaginary. When the story gets told, she plays her part perfectly, and the ideas she has definitely come from an inorganic being.  There's a whole technical level to that which could be looked into and would be beneficial to understand.\n\nSee my sock puppet post. That's a practical example of how you can tell a story in dreaming, and the inorganic beings are often willing to play their part since it's a form of interaction, which is what they're after.\n\nIn that case, you materialize a little dream floating in the air, put the IOB ln your hand like a sock puppet, and if they agree, you can send them in to that dream, and they follow your narration.\n\nAccording to Lily, even a complete dream with you inside, is composed of tiny pieces like that sock puppet dream. And you can break any pieces down further if you like.\n\nWhen you stare at a phantom in lucid dreaming, to dissolve it so you can see if it contains a scout, you are \"untelling\" that phantom's dream.  It dissolves into a pile of trash just because you emphasized the pieces over the whole.'\n\nSo in waking dreaming (darkroom),  if you glance to Lily's left instead of looking  at her face, you realize she's composed of little clouds of light that just happen to look like her when seen front on, but from the side they're just shapes in the air.\n\nThat event at the rocks with the old seers (from the books) was far more educational than most would notice.  Carlos is afraid for his life while he is viewing the allies of the old seers head on. He's making the mistake of telling himself that story.\n\nBut at one point his assemblage point moves, and he realizes there's no men coming up from the ground to bite him. It's just shapes, projected by the old seers.\n\nI was examining Lily from that point of view, and decided I didn't like that. I'd rather view her as beautiful and fun (scary?).  Once I thought that, she became more real, and smiled at me.\n\nThere's an \"intent delay\" on responses from the IOBs in waking dreaming.  Maybe that's not entirely them, and is also connected to having to retell that part of the dream, which includes a little dream zone around them, a smaller part of the entire view.\n\nPerhaps they insist on a stage change to go with the new scene  (a joke).\n\nIt's just a matter of which angle you view an IOB from.  If you face her straight on, the pieces look perfect.  If you change angle even slightly, the image falls apart. It's still there, but as clouds or pieces, not a whole.\n\nIt sort of stops the dream.

To the sides on peripheral vision, the dream is still largely intact.\n\nBy the way, beginners with a potential IOB stuck on your peripheral vision, unwilling to come out face to face, should see if you can retell that story.   Just start narrating a tiny bit, when you believe you perceive it.   And don't get frustrated if the results are not immediate.

You're just finding an excuse for why you can't follow the steps.  No steps, no actual 4 gates dreaming.\n\nOr to be more blunt, if you can't manage to find your hands, don't tell people you did lucid dreaming.  It was just a dream about wishing you could really do 4 gates dreaming.  But you didn't.\n\nThis story that shouldn't be told  point of view requires stone cold clarity, which you only have when awake.\n\nIt's mostly only good for a dreaming awake view.  Any attempt to use it in sleeping dreaming will simply be a different technique, which will mostly be just part of the dream instead of actually useful over and over.\n\nThere are fine details to this technique. You can see wavy lines of amber floating in the air, supporting the deconstructed dream details.\n\nAre they emanations?\n\nI suspect that's getting close. They're like a \"story being told\" version of the emanations.\n\nWe're big mouths.  Like the IOBs, we want to interact with everyone.  We always want to tell the stories.

If you deconstruct everything, there's nothing to do.  And that's not fun.\n\nMight be why Silvio sat around watching TV when he could have been out pushing mountains around in the air with his hands, drunk with power.\n\nWhile looking at Lily partially deconstructed I noticed the whitish light on the west wall, gazed there, and Lily's spooky amusement park began to form.\n\nI was happy because I'd been thinking I'd never get to see that again.\n\nLily said, \"You forgot to start from the whitish light.

I even saw the right graffiti.\n\nThen I realized.  That was the picture I made, the one in this post. I got it on google.

It&amp;#39;s all over the books, but easy to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, Clara&amp;#39;s village, which I&amp;#39;ve been told, the death defier actually made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers were masters of dreams that should never be told.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the puzzling thing.  It isn&amp;#39;t quite the story that should not be told, but the details of dreams themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story sure.  But inside the story is when you find out what part should not be told.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily was going to make one for teaching, but I misunderstood a bit what she actually was offering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a navigation method, for moving around better.  To detach yourself from the dream, in whatever percentage you needed so you didn&amp;#39;t get dragged too deeply into the activity, but could still benefit from observing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take Lily.  I was trying out the one dreaming technique I retained from her last &amp;quot;class&amp;quot;, and she materialized.  She liked the type of energy that was generating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could say, I just &amp;quot;told&amp;quot; that part of the story by naming what was really just a disturbance of light in the air, &amp;quot;Lily&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to say she&amp;#39;s just imaginary. When the story gets told, she plays her part perfectly, and the ideas she has definitely come from an inorganic being.  There&amp;#39;s a whole technical level to that which could be looked into and would be beneficial to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See my sock puppet post. That&amp;#39;s a practical example of how you can tell a story in dreaming, and the inorganic beings are often willing to play their part since it&amp;#39;s a form of interaction, which is what they&amp;#39;re after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, you materialize a little dream floating in the air, put the IOB ln your hand like a sock puppet, and if they agree, you can send them in to that dream, and they follow your narration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Lily, even a complete dream with you inside, is composed of tiny pieces like that sock puppet dream. And you can break any pieces down further if you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you stare at a phantom in lucid dreaming, to dissolve it so you can see if it contains a scout, you are &amp;quot;untelling&amp;quot; that phantom&amp;#39;s dream.  It dissolves into a pile of trash just because you emphasized the pieces over the whole.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in waking dreaming (darkroom),  if you glance to Lily&amp;#39;s left instead of looking  at her face, you realize she&amp;#39;s composed of little clouds of light that just happen to look like her when seen front on, but from the side they&amp;#39;re just shapes in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That event at the rocks with the old seers (from the books) was far more educational than most would notice.  Carlos is afraid for his life while he is viewing the allies of the old seers head on. He&amp;#39;s making the mistake of telling himself that story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at one point his assemblage point moves, and he realizes there&amp;#39;s no men coming up from the ground to bite him. It&amp;#39;s just shapes, projected by the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was examining Lily from that point of view, and decided I didn&amp;#39;t like that. I&amp;#39;d rather view her as beautiful and fun (scary?).  Once I thought that, she became more real, and smiled at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an &amp;quot;intent delay&amp;quot; on responses from the IOBs in waking dreaming.  Maybe that&amp;#39;s not entirely them, and is also connected to having to retell that part of the dream, which includes a little dream zone around them, a smaller part of the entire view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they insist on a stage change to go with the new scene  (a joke).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a matter of which angle you view an IOB from.  If you face her straight on, the pieces look perfect.  If you change angle even slightly, the image falls apart. It&amp;#39;s still there, but as clouds or pieces, not a whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sort of stops the dream.   Which is a little troublesome because you&amp;#39;d like to keep both views, but the deconstructed view dominates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a localized area that is.  To the sides on peripheral vision, the dream is still largely intact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, beginners with a potential IOB stuck on your peripheral vision, unwilling to come out face to face, should see if you can retell that story.

That won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those come from don  Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, just so you don&amp;#39;t feel bummed out, I know for a fact Lily would simply try to adjust what you are doing with more instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs aren&amp;#39;t as snobby as don Juan was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they help all sorts of &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Jesus freaks get IOB help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re the &amp;quot;holy spirit&amp;quot; flying above them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But try telling one that church allows them to &amp;quot;commune with demons&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They probably won&amp;#39;t like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_nqon1n", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nqon1n/stories_that_should_never_be_told/h0get98/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1622737071.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h0fn3pz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tabdrops", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1622725178.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_nqon1n", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_b9puh3b5", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's because I see it here again that in silence you still have to forget who you are.

I had to remember who I was to realize that I needed to open my eyes again because I wanted to follow the instructions given in here. Same thing with sitting, it's pretty hard to forget yourself in that position because your body needs the attention to not fall over. Lying down is definitely easier. But in order not to fall asleep, I pull my knees close so that they stick up and lean my thighs against each other, while my feet are slightly apart for stabilization. For some reason, this prevents from falling asleep while lying down, even though being totally relaxed.\n\nHowever, I only really managed to dive into the second attention when I wanted to sleep.

It's that out-of-body stuff which you don't like. Then I made the room walls of this phantom copy permeable by putting my hands on them.

Only that instead of the bar and the number, many different words were displayed very quickly one after the other, and only sometimes they stayed a bit longer to be read. Like when a gaming slot machine in the style of a one-armed bandit stops for a moment. I've read things in here about the fog wall, and that seems to be what's going on in my case. I've probably spent too much time programming computers for hobby.\n\nTwo of the words shown I can still remember: \"enjoy\" and \"laugh\". I had probably taken it as a literal instruction.

Not such a boring one, where only a few tombstones are standing around, but instead one with mausoleums and underground passages. In fact, I wanted to meet some sexy gothic vampire girls and knew where to find them. At an excavation site I found a tunnel going down. I have a preference for mysterious hiding corners and detours.

You have to keep your eyes open in a dark room, to \"prove\" you are still in Silent Knowledge.\n\nTrust me.  It's really obvious if you just look out into the darkness.  Can't fake that! Here's a tiny bit of what it looks like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xsgsm5o05lm81.png?width=907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4245396c2db0122b5e5f115097c9b61b282d633\n\nYou just watch, while you wait to fall asleep.  But typically you plunge through the solid bed and land in a dream world.  You never actually fall asleep.  Good luck remembering any of that, however.\n\nEssentially this technique was given to us by don Juan when he said, any dream  you enter from silence, is \"real\".\n\nWhen a beginner hears that they think, \"Shit, I can't even go silent for 10 seconds.  Lot of good that advice from don Juan is going to do me!\"\n\nBut actually, you have the means already. It's darkroom practices.\n\nThe assemblage point moves along the J curve by trying your best to be silent, while looking for \"stuff that isn't there\".  Darkness makes it FAR easier.  Add in some Tensegrity, and you can lure your double out, to help.\n\nI won't repeat the entire process, but the more silent you become, the further the assemblage point moves.  And you prevent yourself from pretending, by finding \"impossible sights\".\n\nNow understand, sorcery is AUTOMATIC.\n\nI can't emphasize this point enough, because all other \"magical systems\" and religions out there, are clueless on this topic.   And on purpose. They want to sell you stuff.\n\nIf they told you the following, in honesty, they'd have nothing to sell you.\n\nYOU CANNOT LEARN MAGIC.\n\nYou either wave your hand across the air and a portal to another real world opens, or you wave your hand and feel like an idiot because nothing happens.\n\nThe key is, how to get it to work.\n\nIt works by itself! Not because you're a genius.\n\nAnd if you aren't at the right position on the J curve for the type of magic  you seek, you get none.\n\nBut what you CAN learn, is to be silent.\n\nThe very thing NO ONE learned.  In the entire community.  It's really sad.\n\nIt was the one thing don Juan told us you must learn. That everything is based on it.\n\nBut no one learned.\n\n\"It hurts my little head\", they all complained.\n\nAnd then they ran off to study with a fake Nagual, or some random Putz who wrote his own \"sorcery book\", soon to be replaced by his son who is also a \"sorcerer\".  His grandma was magic!\n\nPeople fall for that, \"Four agreements mental masturbation magic\",  even when  if you just follow don Juan's advice you can learn to move your assemblage point and see the real thing.\n\nFor a beginner, a story might be easier to understand.\n\nIt's sort of like, you want to get to the famous magical wishing well on top of the hill.  Your wish is ALWAYS granted.  But it's quite a hike.\n\nEveryone else wants to get there too.  But every single one of them is too lazy to walk that steep climb.\n\nSome are selling tickets at the bottom of the hill, for the \"Wishing Well Express\". To be leaving soon.\n\nOf course, it never comes.\n\nAnd there's a \"Wishing Well Book Store\" where you get a free fancy coffee with each book purchase.\n\nAll the pretend wishing well experts hang out there, to sign your copy of their book right after you buy it.\n\nThey even have those little enamel \"pins\" like they sell at Disneyland. One for each fake hill climber.\n\nYou can collect them like boy scout badges and show them off to your friends, as a substitute for having actually visited the well.\n\nOne says, \"I met Armando and Juan!\"\n\nOf course it makes no sense, because neither Armando nor Juan has seen the wishing well. But Armando went to a lecture once by a man who had, and Juan had a printing press, so now they're celebrities.\n\nAnother says, \"Ken Eagle Scout wishes me well!\".  On the enamel pin for Ken, he's wearing a hat that makes him look like an Australian Bushranger.  Unknown to Ken, the women only buy those because it's funny to explain, \"Ken explores bushes.\"\n\nThere's one of a man who looks like the Buddha, telling you that wishing wells are beneath Buddhism, and you should give up that long climb to go rest with him.  He owns \"The Buddha Motel\" down the road.\n\nHourly rentals are available.\n\nSome made their own wishing well in the little park below the hill. They're convincing people that their wishing well is the *real* thing.  And the one on the hill, is a decoy.  They feel safe, because in fact no one has ever actually climbed the hill, and seen the well.\n\nThey have some poor wanna be actor homeless guy named Kachora, who pretends his wish got granted at that very well they can see \"right there\",  no climb needed.\n\nIt actually fools some passers by.  And if anyone questions the homeless guy, they have thugs waiting to beat him up.\n\nBut, no one will climb the hill.\n\nLet's assume you're the hero of this story, and you decide to climb the hill.\n\nSeveral people nearby, eating at the local \"wishing well snack and gossip bar\" tell you, they'll join you!  They insist they know all the \"climbing steps\", and will be a great asset.\n\nBut you've heard that before. They're just a huge burden.  If you let them pretend to come along, they'll be riding on your back in no time.\n\nSo you ditch everyone and go up the hill.\n\nThe question at this point is, can you focus on the goal?\n\nIt turns out, all along the wishing well path are little alcoves designed to lure you away from reaching the top.\n\nThere's the \"Green Gazebo\" with 100 monitors all playing different movies. All your favorites, some  you haven't seen.  An intoxicating opium gas is released there, to keep you as high as a kite.\n\nAnd you get headphones with the sound of your choice.\n\nYou notice, a bunch of Tibetan Monks have gotten themselves trapped there by inhaling too much gas, and are chanting away on the side. You ask, and they'll tell you they've been there 40 years, but don't worry. It can take several lifetimes to finish climbing the hill.  \n\nThey suggest you watch the movie \"The Golden Child\" as motivation to finish climbing.\n\nBut if you linger to watch a movie, the sun will go down and you'll never make it to the wishing well.\n\nNext is the \"Red Light District\".  Don't ask me how that got there, but I'd blame Tijuana if I had to guess.  They actually have donkey sex shows there.  One guy told you, in a whisper, they used to have crow sex too!\n\nAfter that is the \"Museum of Knowledge\", and it's big orange \"Dome of Magic and  Spirits\".\n\nVery worthy!  Anything \"intellectual\" you could think of, is available there.  You can spend a lifetime in that area, and not even learn a fraction of what it contains.\n\nBut you must shun it.   This is the part of the story that's real.  If you want to make it to the top, you can't play too much along the way!  It's really just a choice however, as it's fine to enjoy the sights if you prefer.\n\nI would be nice if you could linger at each point along the way, but \"Wishing Well Hill\" is located where daylight is only 4 hours long,  climbing the hill itself takes 3 hours, and so you can't afford to waste a second.\n\nYou have to forge ahead and not get distracted.\n\nAnd finally, when you get to the wishing well, you learn that it takes 1 full hour of watching it before you are allowed to make a wish.\n\nThere's some lame \"presentation\", with \"brought to you by Monsanto\" advertisements.\n\nRules are rules.\n\nWhat you don't know yet is, during that 1 hour the well gives you a visual presentation of everything in the universe.  A full on show, with multiple movie screens, famous people narrating, guest stars from exotic places you only dream of.  Spirits put on impossible dance shows, and amuse you with endless stories of how much power you can have, if you listen to them.\n\nIt's the most spectacular show you can imagine!\n\nBut it's all designed to make you realize your wish is silly, so that you go back down the hill in peace.\n\nThat's sort of like \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nI've been messing with that thing for a week or so, and finally got good at it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is, we've been mislead.\n\nThere are not 2 types of energy.\n\nNormal, and \"dark energy\".\n\nIn fact, I counted 4-6 kinds in just 2 hours, while waiting to fall asleep.  Can't tell about 2 of them, because they defy categorization.\n\nAnd one of them can be \"gathered\" just by swimming through it.\n\nAnd organic versus inorganic?\n\nIrrelevant to some beings who came to visit.  Organic, inorganic, is a side effect of bundling emanations.\n\nThey don't have to do that.  Something else holds them together.\n\nThere were so many secrets, my book deal mind was going nuts.\n\nI kept wondering how many I could remember, and pass on.\n\nBut then I realized, that would harm the community.\n\nIt's mostly a bunch of mentally depressed pretenders who have nothing good in life, and are usually willing to lie and steal to get attention.\n\nNormal people in other words.\n\nAnd their favorite thing is, \"new sorcery facts\".\n\nThey'd all choke to death on new information.\n\nI started to wonder, did the lineages hide all this, as unnecessary?\n\nDon Juan said the old seers created an amazingly complicated system, and yet only a small amount of it remains.\n\nIs that on purpose?\n\nThere was one book out there that I could think of, which might have the answers.\n\nTo what exactly is \"Silent Knowledge\"?  And especially, how come it's not emphasized above all else?\n\nCarlos wrote it at the end of his life, as a parting gift.\n\nI never read it because he told us to stop reading the books.  The idea was, now what we had the real thing, don't bother with those anymore.\n\nHere's the first part, which didn't disappoint me.   It was as I had discovered on my own.  Which is perhaps why he told us to stop reading them.\n\nSo we could discover something, before we read about it.  It's very convincing to do that.\n\nAnd as it turns out, silent Knowledge is a HUGE thing in sorcery.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFrom the introduction to Silent Knowledge, Copyright 1996 by Carlos Castaneda:\n\nSilent knowledge was an entire facet of the lives and activities of the shamans or sorcerers who lived in Mexico in ancient times. According to don Juan Matus, the sorcerer-teacher who introduced me in the cognitive world of those sorcerers, silent knowledge was the most coveted end result they sought through every one of their actions and thoughts.\n\nDon Juan defined silent knowledge as a state of human awareness in which everything pertinent to man is instantly revealed, not to the mind or the intellect, but to the entire being. He explained that there was a band of energy in the universe which sorcerers call the band of man, and that such a band was present in man. He assured me that for sorcerer-seers, who see energy directly as it flows in the universe, and who can see a human being as a conglomerate of energy fields in the form of a luminous sphere, the band of man is a fringe of compact luminosity that cuts across the luminous sphere at an angle from its left side to its right. The total luminous sphere is the width and the height of the extended arm, and in that luminous sphere, the band of man is perhaps around a foot wide. Silent knowledge, don Juan explained, is the interplay of energy within that band, an interplay which is instantly revealed to the shaman who has attained inner silence. Don Juan said that the average man had inklings of this energetic interplay. Man intuits it, and gets busy deducing its workings, figuring out its permutations. A sorcerer, on the other hand, gets a blast of the totality of this interplay at any time that the rendition of this interplay is solicited.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stuff which Can't be Spoken!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 129, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"sy297ozo1lm81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 99, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sy297ozo1lm81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a5abd7fb54c96907b02b3c3188ba0a00254fe9f"}, {"y": 199, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sy297ozo1lm81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3bd5d5d8f2324a1542ad89ee5597a7d87d854b4"}, {"y": 295, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sy297ozo1lm81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b96bc86e5fa7bd69755affdc90b8f1017f119459"}, {"y": 590, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sy297ozo1lm81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2600dbc81e24042b5fd9bfb97daee683c12c0edf"}], "s": {"y": 614, "x": 666, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sy297ozo1lm81.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=107267e36ed1bfb84f67a42ba3e373760af12736"}, "id": "sy297ozo1lm81"}, "xsgsm5o05lm81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 56, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsgsm5o05lm81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbbd74c86d97a72316d4fd60506319b732c2dfe9"}, {"y": 113, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsgsm5o05lm81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b048b68edcb6b47069cf39408209cb00c3a8974f"}, {"y": 167, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsgsm5o05lm81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f8af2384de25a22a4660bde577135c9dab6ac33"}, {"y": 335, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsgsm5o05lm81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f30df4e796280671392ab5786f58e29d4f6e663"}], "s": {"y": 475, "x": 907, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xsgsm5o05lm81.png?width=907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4245396c2db0122b5e5f115097c9b61b282d633"}, "id": "xsgsm5o05lm81"}}, "name": "t3_tb4hmf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/A8A4SdouHO8omKqVFSTXaa_Lic5wZYqPsJuD2NxWjbQ.jpg", "edited": 1646939720.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1646935033.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sy297ozo1lm81.png?width=666&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=107267e36ed1bfb84f67a42ba3e373760af12736\"&gt;Yep, there&amp;#39;s stuff like that too!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered recently that you can deliberately enter shared dreaming with other sorcerers,  daily, if you can reach &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; and maintain it while you lay down, waiting to fall asleep.

Don&amp;#39;t ask me how that got there, but I&amp;#39;d blame Tijuana if I had to guess.  They actually have donkey sex shows there.  One guy told you, in a whisper, they used to have crow sex too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that is the &amp;quot;Museum of Knowledge&amp;quot;, and it&amp;#39;s big orange &amp;quot;Dome of Magic and  Spirits&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very worthy!  Anything &amp;quot;intellectual&amp;quot; you could think of, is available there.  You can spend a lifetime in that area, and not even learn a fraction of what it contains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you must shun it.   This is the part of the story that&amp;#39;s real.  If you want to make it to the top, you can&amp;#39;t play too much along the way!  It&amp;#39;s really just a choice however, as it&amp;#39;s fine to enjoy the sights if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would be nice if you could linger at each point along the way, but &amp;quot;Wishing Well Hill&amp;quot; is located where daylight is only 4 hours long,  climbing the hill itself takes 3 hours, and so you can&amp;#39;t afford to waste a second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to forge ahead and not get distracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, when you get to the wishing well, you learn that it takes 1 full hour of watching it before you are allowed to make a wish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some lame &amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;brought to you by Monsanto&amp;quot; advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rules are rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you don&amp;#39;t know yet is, during that 1 hour the well gives you a visual presentation of everything in the universe.  A full on show, with multiple movie screens, famous people narrating, guest stars from exotic places you only dream of.  Spirits put on impossible dance shows, and amuse you with endless stories of how much power you can have, if you listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the most spectacular show you can imagine!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s all designed to make you realize your wish is silly, so that you go back down the hill in peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s sort of like &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been messing with that thing for a week or so, and finally got good at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed is, we&amp;#39;ve been mislead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are not 2 types of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normal, and &amp;quot;dark energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I counted 4-6 kinds in just 2 hours, while waiting to fall asleep.  Can&amp;#39;t tell about 2 of them, because they defy categorization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one of them can be &amp;quot;gathered&amp;quot; just by swimming through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And organic versus inorganic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Irrelevant to some beings who came to visit.  Organic, inorganic, is a side effect of bundling emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t have to do that.  Something else holds them together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were so many secrets, my book deal mind was going nuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept wondering how many I could remember, and pass on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I realized, that would harm the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s mostly a bunch of mentally depressed pretenders who have nothing good in life, and are usually willing to lie and steal to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normal people in other words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And their favorite thing is, &amp;quot;new sorcery facts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d all choke to death on new information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to wonder, did the lineages hide all this, as unnecessary?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said the old seers created an amazingly complicated system, and yet only a small amount of it remains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is that on purpose?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was one book out there that I could think of, which might have the answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To what exactly is &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;?  And especially, how come it&amp;#39;s not emphasized above all else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wrote it at the end of his life, as a parting gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never read it because he told us to stop reading the books.  The idea was, now what we had the real thing, don&amp;#39;t bother with those anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the first part, which didn&amp;#39;t disappoint me.   It was as I had discovered on my own.  Which is perhaps why he told us to stop reading them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we could discover something, before we read about it.  It&amp;#39;s very convincing to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as it turns out, silent Knowledge is a HUGE thing in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the introduction to Silent Knowledge, Copyright 1996 by Carlos Castaneda:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent knowledge was an entire facet of the lives and activities of the shamans or sorcerers who lived in Mexico in ancient times. According to don Juan Matus, the sorcerer-teacher who introduced me in the cognitive world of those sorcerers, silent knowledge was the most coveted end result they sought through every one of their actions and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan defined silent knowledge as a state of human awareness in which everything pertinent to man is instantly revealed, not to the mind or the intellect, but to the entire being. He explained that there was a band of energy in the universe which sorcerers call the band of man, and that such a band was present in man. He assured me that for sorcerer-seers, who see energy directly as it flows in the universe, and who can see a human being as a conglomerate of energy fields in the form of a luminous sphere, the band of man is a fringe of compact luminosity that cuts across the luminous sphere at an angle from its left side to its right. The total luminous sphere is the width and the height of the extended arm, and in that luminous sphere, the band of man is perhaps around a foot wide. Silent knowledge, don Juan explained, is the interplay of energy within that band, an interplay which is instantly revealed to the shaman who has attained inner silence. Don Juan said that the average man had inklings of this energetic interplay. Man intuits it, and gets busy deducing its workings, figuring out its permutations. A sorcerer, on the other hand, gets a blast of the totality of this interplay at any time that the rendition of this interplay is solicited.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "tb4hmf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 32, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tb4hmf/stuff_which_cant_be_spoken/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/tb4hmf/stuff_which_cant_be_spoken/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1646935033.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i04wrb8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1646936138.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_tb4hmf", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt;

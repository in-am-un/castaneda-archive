And that includes the mind. On the one hand, you may think, reason and reflect on herself to create and draw conclusions.\n\nThe other quality of the mind is to be silent, inactive and without thinking. We all know how to reason and reflect on ourselves, but achieving silence is more difficult.\n\n\"The mind is like this flame.\" It jumps with the slightest disturbance it churns the moment a breeze touches it, \u201dshe said. Thoughts and desires are like gusts of air; they activate the mind and make it flutter.\n\nIn a light tone, she explained that there are **two approaches to achieving the following:**\n\n**\u2022**\u2014One approach to silence and stillness is to *protect the mind from external disturbances that may disturb it*. You do that by moving away from disruptive or damaging forces that threaten your well-being. In other words, you withdraw and hide in your depths.\n\n**\u2022**The second method, Zuleica said, was more difficult to achieve because it involved a delicate maneuver to *protect the mind, not the external fluence but of its own influence*. In this case, since the disturbing stimulus come from within, there is no way to run or withdraw to the self, since the mind itself is agitated and running. Therefore, one has to stop the agitation by *fixing the mind on some point, such as an image, idea or sound*, and in this way making it immobile.\n\n\\- Stillness is the product of discipline and training, -Zuleica said. That means stopping the internal dialogue by focusing on a single point, or expanding consciousness to merge with the great silence that exists beyond the limits of thought.\n\n\u2014Not being disturbed means that nothing can divert your attentionnfrom its center, \u201dshe said, sensing my mood. One of the best methods to achieve this is to *observe an object lit or bright*.\n\n\u2014It is better to *use a combination of both methods*; withdrawal and fixation, \u201dshe said. That is why you are here in this quiet house where nobody bothers you. As you learn these observation techniques, you must withdraw from the outside world. But you must also withdraw from the world that you carry within you by fixing your mind through observation practices.\n\n\u2014If your mind is not fixed, and your thoughts jump through all sides, whatever you see will attract you and affect your consciousness. Then you will have to fight to free yourself before you are free to move on to something else. And in no time you'll have so many ties that you won't be able to move at all.\n\n\"What will happen then?\"\n\n\"You will have to *recap your actions to release your energy*,\" he said.\n\nThis is why we recommend that one always *recap the events of the day* so that one is free from their influence, and one does not build energetic ties.\n\n**EXERCISE 1.**\n\nZuleica ordered me to observe the candle for a moment and then place the palms of my hands over my eyes and visualize the flame. For a moment I looked at the flame, then closed my eyes and covered them with my palms.\n\nI could see a yellowish-green circle, then a golden flame appeared that turned into a bright red-orange glow. Soon the flame was replaced by a small black opening that formed in front of my eyes.\n\nZuleica told me to repeat the exercise of *observing the flame and then cover my eyes with my  palms*. This time, the reddish light seemed to move to my right, and it was difficult to keep it centered at my level of inner vision. She said that I should try to move the flame image closer and further away from me, while keeping my eyes covered with my palms. After a while I was able to hold the image of the flame and move it closer or further away using the force of my mind.\n\n\u2014This observation practice will help you develop your capacity of concentration, \u201dZuleica said when I opened my eyes again. In the same way that sorcery passes strengthen your energetic body, your mind control can be sharpened by observation techniques.\n\nShe added that visualizing a light not only calms thoughts, but also activates a fundamental energy center in the back inside the head, invigorating the whole body. She remarked that with continued practice, I would no longer need to look at a candle, but could see the flame by simply closing my eyes. The light, once fixed, would help me focus on a single point, excluding all other influences.\n\n**EXERCISE 2.**\n\nSit quietly, breathe naturally and without thinking, look at the pen. She said that I should f*ocus my attention on the pen until I merged with it*. She said that it was possible to merge with whatever object one was observing so that it was no longer a separate entity, but something alive and part of one's energetic being.\n\nObjects are only separate when we think about them. When we observe them, they merge into a single energy field that also includes our energy bodies.\n\n\u2014It is a fusion of both feelings, from the observer and the object, resulting in a common combination of consciousness and a feeling of mutual trust and affection, \u201dZuleica said.\n\nIn addition, she explained that this feeling of openness and empathy is the result of stopping the internal dialogue and allowing the sensitivity one's internal spill over and merge with whatever it is that one is observing.\n\n\"Pick whatever object you like,\" Zuleica said.

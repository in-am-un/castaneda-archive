Men wanting to cash in as an expert on how horrible Carlos was.\n\nIt's a common obsession.   \n\nI don't know how that NSFW got there, but reading how it could be added by dishonest reddit users I found the setting and clicked it off.\n\nI guess reddit lets you fight back a bit.\n\nThat makes 3 attacks in a week, one to my Facebook.\n\nThat's too bad. I was thinking Reddit had an automatic \"naked butt\" detector software algorithm.\n\nI guess not.\n\nBut as for this picture, Carlos gave us the J curve map and the Tensegrity with the moves showing us how to build our energy body and move our assemblage point using physical movements.\n\nBut we didn't understand, sorcerers use everything they have.  Nothing was left unused by the ancient Olmecs, who had THOUSANDS of years to explore their magic.  By comparison, modern magical systems have mere decades of exploration by their founders, followed by decades of trying to steal money using what their founder copied from older stuff, managing to get some weak green line experiences to brag about.\n\nMoney corrupts magic!\n\nBut there was no money in the time of the Olmecs.  No media, no writing system universally readable.   No way to easily extract wealth from naive people, using your \"magic techniques\".\n\nThey did what they did,  just for them.  For magic. And they didn't do much sharing.\n\nThey had no reason to lie and make up stuff.\n\nThey also were not stuck with our modern \"scientific\" understanding of things, and \"irrational\" was even more interesting to them than \"logic and reason\".\n\nMe too!  Logic and Reason are boringly predictable.  We've seen far too much of that in our lives.\n\nAs you practice darkroom you slowly accept the irrational, the impossible, and the meaningless.\n\nAll the stuff discarded from the Island of the Tonal, where all of mankind now resides.\n\nWe seek to look OUTSIDE that Island, into the dark sea of awareness which surrounds us.  A place completely unknown to anyone but sorcerers of our tradition.  All discarded by the rest of humanity, for the last 10,000 years since some unknown force removed magic from our world.\n\nPockets of real sorcerers have survived all this time by remaining secret and avoiding outsiders.In that protective \"bubble\" they keep teaching what they had inherited from the Olmecs.\n\nEach brilliantly \"guided\" by powerful teachers.\n\nBut we've gone down a different road.\n\nNormally sorcery is taught to someone, by people with advanced knowledge.\n\nWe have none of those.\n\nBut we do have an amazing gift from \"The Spirit\".\n\nSilent Knowledge.\n\nTo which Carlos sent us, to make up for the loss of his presence.\n\nIn Silent Knowledge every \"fun cool thing\" you see getting there through darkroom practices or by any other serious sorcery practice from the books of Carlos and the witches, comes back to repeat itself over and over again.\n\nAll those impossible to duplicate \"previews\" become a megaplex theater, with hundreds of movies to watch at your leisure.\n\nThey'll all be there in your darkroom.\n\nYou'd like to get EXCITED!!!\n\nBut you can't.  That only applies to the imaginary being you were taught to be.  To your \"self\".\n\nThe baby trying to keep up with everyone around it, and gain its \"fair share\",  while avoiding being tortured by other humans.\n\nIt's so obsessed with protecting something imaginary, its \"status\" among humans,  that it blocks out all else in reality.  There's no benefit to that \"discarded\" stuff outside the Island of the Tonal.\n\nOur bad players are merely angry babies, trying to defend their \"self\".\n\nNormally a real sorcerer will teach their apprentices by example, battling with their idea of self all along the way, and making it clear what the rewards are, for giving up that obsession.\n\nThey design a \"big show\" to have the most emotional impact, so that the lesson goes deep into the apprentice. They punctuate special moments, inform the apprentice when they do well, or do badly, and generally create a sense of \"coziness and companionship\" on the path to learning to travel outside the Island of the Tonal. Where normally, it is not \"cozy\" at all.   It's alien out there.\n\nWe need that training also, but we have to get it by ourselves.\n\nAt first, just a \"color\" in the darkness.  To get you started on the J curve path.\n\nMost fail there.  They never really wanted to work that hard, when they could simply pretend their magical abilities.  That way they get what they really wanted.   Human status and attention.\n\nThe \"broken ones\" are perhaps at an advantage, in that they've already figured out how pointless protecting that \"self\" has become.\n\nThey seek magic.  For real.  And won't accept cheap pretending.\n\nAnd eventually a dazzling realm of endless magic will surround them by their own efforts, not guided by any other person.\n\nWith rapidly changing magical displays.  Instead of one mind boggling magic demonstration by don Genaro, they have dozens each night.  With no one \"punctuating\" or \"explaining\" the importance of that lesson.\n\nIt's just an endless flow of the unknown.\n\nIt's not really what happened in the past!   Sorcery has never been learned this way.\n\nAs best I can recall, there's an account of that in Eagle's Gift where Nestor cycles between realities rapidly after jumping off the cliff, and ends up with Porfirio.    An entity that doesn't actually exist, who has come to take over the task of \"Teacher\".  A being of Silent Knowledge.\n\nHe bounces around viewing endless magical wonders, until he \"lands\" in a safe place, with a \"new teacher\".\n\nOne might think that's a good fate for us, except we never stop cycling between realities.\n\nThe jump off the cliff of Nestor and the resulting chaos is closer to our normal situation, than how Nestor was taught before that. Or even after that with Porfirio.\n\nWe're like 7 year old kids who got lost in the huge amusement park,  and decided to ditch the parents.  And so we look everywhere. Not just where we are \"supposed to look\".\n\nWe're crawling behind the amusement park rides, to see the drunken clown guy taking a nap behind the haunted house.\n\nOr to see the Jungle Cruise man making out with the Ferris Wheel operator in the fake amusement park jungle.\n\nAnd no one to put it into context for us.\n\nNow here's the interesting part.\n\n\"The Abstract\" is \"found\", between the \"here\", and the \"there\" created when the double becomes visible.  Carlos told us about this in his final publications, knowing he would not be around later.\n\nBut what exactly is that \"double\"?\n\nHe's merely a projection from your energy body.   He's composed of the portion of your awareness which did not join up with the \"Islanders of the Tonal\".\n\nHe didn't want it!\n\nAnd having no organic body to be stuck in, any piece of his energy can reveal a dream world.\n\nA puff can become a \"dream bubble\".\n\nIf you are gazing at one dream bubble, trying to figure out where you are looking, then decide to look for more, a new puff will fly over there and manifest a second choice.\n\nBut in fact, you were watching the double, and then decided to watch the double elsewhere.\n\nIt's still part of him.\n\nThe process is difficult to perceive directly, but at some point your \"gaze\" becomes so powerful you can extract dream bubbles all around you.  \"Paint with reality\" like it was a green screen used in a movie to add special effects to a man all alone in an empty room.\n\nThe \"topic\" of the dream bubbles is difficult to control for a beginner.   Difficult to \"*intend\"* what you want.\n\nYou might end up with Princess Leia  just because someone made a joke about something you saw, looking like that.\n\nThe \"hint\" to infinity is remembered.\n\nBut by what?\n\nIt's in the traces of \"by what?\" that we likely exist as sorcerers.  In between.\n\nWe don't dwell as much in the \"by who?\"  We're in the lost forest of \"by what?\"\n\nAnd when we gaze from dream bubble to dream bubble, we move from \"here\" to \"there\".\n\nAs it turns out, this is so similar to having your double present to reveal the abstract to you, that we begin to sense it all around us.\n\nNot just between us and the double.\n\nIn everything!\n\nEven in good poetry.\n\nYesterday I was speculating the possibility of a \"being\" immersed in \"the abstract\".   Living in there.\n\nA creature of that realm.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nAnd so one came to visit last night, after I was beginning to be able to focus on the Abstract directly.\n\nFancy commented, \"Like the blue scout.  But was she real, or abstract?\"\n\nHow should I know?\n\nI'm stuck in \"by who?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Unknown Potential of Darkroom", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"fab3qla35o191": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fab3qla35o191.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=487d86606050600259b7917db3036e9f214d3ced"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fab3qla35o191.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ab2e6fd86f7c8981b72ddbd066128bf74d552a0"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fab3qla35o191.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa9a510d06efd01c63f8dc2fe87c372243385abf"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fab3qla35o191.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a10ccf0195c37cc1a4a10b9d393f7b90f749bb44"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fab3qla35o191.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc68e9e6b639c134a8a1eb983cda8efae52872fb"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fab3qla35o191.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c15cee0d55668ab0ab6a0a90cb675f6276ceabd"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fab3qla35o191.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8530febd61b1299025696387c506a192da231b07"}, "id": "fab3qla35o191"}}, "name": "t3_uxljha", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/C7gIcrWmbapHmkeASLh9QiVATlh18l5RHaQ45JRAMcc.jpg", "edited": 1653506592.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1653497185.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fab3qla35o191.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8530febd61b1299025696387c506a192da231b07\"&gt;In case you&amp;#39;re finding darkroom boring, don&amp;#39;t fret.

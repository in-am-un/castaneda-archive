It just felt like the outline of a for example wooden alter with items on top of it, I feel like a vaguely remember that I could make out a skull on top of this, but that is hazy.

I am almost certain that I saw a puff with a very distinct face in it just like a lot of you guys have seen which I haven\u2019t before, and I\u2019m sure I remember being like \u201cOH MY GOD! I ACTUALLY SEEN ONE, A FACE COME OUT THE PUFF!\u201d it is very hard for me for some reason to recall if I had interaction or what happened with this, but I don\u2019t remember it being quick or fleeting, I remember it being very clear and getting the shocked feeling at how clear it was, it\u2019s just that the whole memory is blurry. This was before the big dreaming visions came in, but my lucidity was there, that was all I was focusing on.\n\nI remember, as usual, big dreaming visions swooping in as the time went on and wanting to just lull me away To dream land but I\u2019m getting better at returning to a silent focused centre and just letting them pass by and remain lucid. I wish I could remember for details too about what I seen here but I remember them being vivid. \n\nI remember it was around this time I was being able to move my dream body!!!!! While lucid and still being conscious that I was laying in my bed!!!! I was moving my dream body, I think easily! Moving my arms around and maybe even my upper torso! \n\nAnd, once again, I think for my second successful time during these practice sessions, I was able to stay entirely lucid STRAIGHT into the beginning of the dream.\n\nThis time it was very different than my last one (the town with the church service and the man) and this time I did NOT forget to practice switching between looking at my hands and looking at something else to remain lucid.\n\nInfact I was almost manic and panicking about that, maybe too much! \n\nThe dream world was very different this time too, it just felt like the level of some indie PlayStation one game.\n\nI don\u2019t remember there being much landscape. The main thing was the floor/long floating platform, which was like, if you can imagine an old roman mosaic, but all the little squares are completely black, and more silicone than ceramic, and they were all loose, I was scooping them up and they\u2019d spill out my hand not particularly adhering to the laws of gravity. Remember the ps1 game qube? It was kinda like that.\n\n[qube](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/Intelligent_Qube.jpg)\n\nThis was all great but I just kept panicking in my head \u201clook between your hands and look at another object back and fourth or you\u2019ll stop being lucid,\u201d \n\nSo I was almost not caring about what was actually in the dreaming and worrying more about this back and fourth.\n\nMy hand I remember didn\u2019t seem deformed like last time, last time this happened I had an extra finger that was bent back sort of arthritic. This was not the case, and the only object I could find to switch between looking at after my hand were these pesky black mosaic squares I could pick up from the floor.\n\nThe back and fourth obviously didn\u2019t help too much, as I don\u2019t remember really much about after this. There might have been but I\u2019m struggling to remember it.\n\n\nTLDR:\nLast night, the purple puffs were rife, I seen a face in the puff! For the first time! A clear face! Like possibly an actual iob! I ACTUALLY MOVED MY DREAM BODY WHILST NOT YET IN A DREAM! (just in second attention mode with eyes closed) and I remained entirely lucid stepping into my dream and remembered to atleast try to do the remaining lucid trick. \n\n\n\nAny insights or feedback would be great. Why did I find it last night in particular so hard to remember even when not yet asleep? Why didn\u2019t the back and fourth between hands and objects not work to atleast help me remember more lucidity? \nHas anyone else has this where as soon as you turn off the lights or shut your eyes you already see it all jumping out like straight away?

It happens what way in dreaming, with scouts.  They take over whatever is available.\n\nAnd in darkroom gazing you find a hypnogogic head, but if you keep playing with it, eventually it starts to teach you more.  And can physically move things.\n\nFancy did that again recently for someone outside this subreddit.\n\nSo the \"body\" you might have created yourself, gets taken over.\n\nThat concept can be used in darkroom gazing to summon an inorganic being you already know.  Make it a body any way you can, although that's a bit too advanced for most at this stage.\n\nIf you can focus your attention on that imaginary structure without making it go away, it could pull you all the way to heightened awareness.\n\n\\&gt; I remember, as usual, big dreaming visions swooping in as the time went o\n\nI'm glad you're doing it with eyes closed next to the girlfriend, because this helps others who have to do it that way, and aren't sure it's going to work.\n\nSeems, it does work!\n\nBut this is precisely why I normally recommend people not to close their eyes.\n\nIt goes inward, not outward.\n\nThis is ALL about where your attention is focused.

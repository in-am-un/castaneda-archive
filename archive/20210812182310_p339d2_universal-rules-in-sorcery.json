If you\u2019ve read about the J curve and seen the pictures posted here, especially the one about how to shift horizontally in waking dream using your hands, you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s possible to exist fully awake, eyes open, walking around, in extremely vivid dreaming environments. Normally when practicing \u201cJ Curving\u201d, meaning, moving the assemblage point along the outside of Man\u2019s band of awareness, we want to avoid stopping to shift sideways. But it\u2019s just so darned fun! The Nagual Julian got trapped doing too much of that, and almost took La Catalina with him. Where he went when he had to die, we don\u2019t know. Hopefully he joined the old seers in their \u201cbrujo\u201d phantom realm. Because if he did, we can go in there and find him! That hand movement for shifting horizontally would do the trick, if you could \u201clocate\u201d the old seer\u2019s shared entrance to the inorganic being realm. My inorganic being \"Lily\" has shown it to me, so I nearly know where to find it. But I want to talk not just about the perils of horizontal shifts of the assemblage point, at the \u201cplace below\u201d (red line on the J curve), but also about how you can turn those into the purple zone, at the very end of the J curve. So that you don\u2019t entirely miss out.\n\nFirst universal rule:\n\nIf you consciously look at dreaming elements, it creates the kind of energy that \u201ccompels\u201d the inorganic beings to send a scout. I suppose we all assumed this applied only to lucid dreaming, but in fact, it\u2019s just a rule. The inorganic beings don\u2019t really care if you are dreaming or awake. When you are dreaming, you\u2019re using horizontal shifts of the assemblage point to interact with your dream. Which means the scouts can be 100% realistic. But the same is true in waking dreaming. If you are fully awake, but perhaps in the dark, and you see a puff of color in the air, you are consciously looking at a dreaming element. That also will create the kind of energy which \u201ccompels\u201d the inorganic being to send a scout. It doesn\u2019t seem to work as well as it ought to in lucid dreaming, when you are doing it awake, however, if you have actually practiced 4 gates dreaming you\u2019ll be aware that don Juan\u2019s promise isn\u2019t as clear when you are doing it yourself. For one thing, you can\u2019t really be sure your dreaming characters are scouts. So even if a man walks up to you the instant you find your hands, and look from dream element to dream element, you won\u2019t really know if he\u2019s a phantom (your own dreaming character), or an actual scout. There are techniques you can use to determine that, but I loathe to encourage people to do 4 gates dreaming. It nearly destroyed the Castaneda community. That and the \"impeccable warrior\" nonsense, kept everyone from actually doing any real work. Best to put those aside, until you learn to get silent for real. And THEN, those make sense. But you can still make use of this universal rule, even if you put off 4 gates dreaming. So in waking dreaming, the same thing applies. If you play with the puffs of color, the inorganics are \u201ccompelled\u201d to send a scout. But you\u2019ll have the same trouble locating it as you would in a lucid dream. The main point here is, that principle is universal. It always applies. What about in recapitulation? Yes, it surely applies there. Once you activate your second attention during recapitulation (by doing 3 hours a day for a couple of months), you will notice light, tunnels of light, colors and other things in front of your eyes, which \u201caren\u2019t really there\u2019. Or an actual visual memory. They are dreaming images. Once you notice them you \u201ccompel\u201d the inorganic beings to send a scout. Since you\u2019re sitting there like an old man in a rocking chair, remembering the past, the inorganic beings are at a loss for how to interact with you. It's like you are on drugs, or have gone senile. The lights are on, but no one is home. But they\u2019ll figure it out. And you\u2019ll encounter the \u201cfalse memory\u201d in recapitulation. The scout will implant itself into the false memory. Making that a universal rule: Consciously watching things that \u201caren\u2019t really there\u201d brings inorganic beings. It did as a child too, if you\u2019ll think back to how the \u201cmonster in the closet\u201d used to come around. You were watching dream elements as you went to sleep, being a dumb kid who doesn\u2019t know that\u2019s impossible. So you got a scary visitor. He's still waiting to play with you, even after all these years!\n\nHere\u2019s another \u201cUniversal Rule\u201d:\n\nIf you want to locate \u201cthe abstract\u201d, you gaze at the \u201chere\u201d (your tonal) and the \u201cthere\u201d (your double).The abstract becomes visible as you experience \u2018traveling\u201d from you, to a memory of your double. Doing that you have to \u201cmove in space\u201d in some weird way, and it\u2019s not the normal kind of space .It\u2019s the abstract! It turns out, this rule is universal on the J curve. Traditionally the double only becomes visible when you get deep into the orange zone on the J curve. He might show up and sit on the edge of the bed, but turned so you can\u2019t look him directly in the eyes. That\u2019s supposed to be a bad thing, but don\u2019t worry about it. He\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. So the rule seems to apply to being shifted very deeply along the J curve, and is not much use in the green and red portions of the assemblage point movement. But an experienced dark room gazer has encountered \u201canomalies\u201d where, they were trying to play with something at the red line, perhaps a puff of brilliant purple that was compressing into a ball very nicely, only to notice they had some extra arms and hands !I\u2019ve only seen one, but another dark room gazer saw 2 extra arms. Those are the double, \u201chelping out\u201d. In Taisha\u2019s latest book, she climbs up into a tree house after being pushed deep into heightened awareness, and uses \u201cShadow Beings\u201d who live in the trees to hold her assemblage point there. Those are \u201ctree spirits\u201d. We can perceive them, but they don\u2019t interact with us. So you get a \u201cpeaceful\u201d way to anchor your assemblage point at a deep point along the J curve. Zuleica then instructed her to imagine doing her KungFu on the ground below the tree house, and said that would lure her double to come \u201chelp\u201d. She could do her KungFu on the ground, while her body was up in the tree house. That sort of explains those 1970s Hong Kong Kungfu movies! Yes, you really can do those crazy flying KungFu moves! You just have to be in your double. So the double is in fact visible at the red line. I suspect he\u2019s also visible at the green line, but I couldn\u2019t tell you what to look for. So can we apply this second universal rule?  The rule that says if you look from the here, to the there (your double), the abstract becomes visible? Yes, but probably not by watching to see if you have 3 arms. A better way is to use that hand movement to produce crazy levels of horizontal shifting in the dark room, down at the red line. And then, if you get \u201clucky\u201d and your alternate dream world is not all that predictable, as it is in that last post:\n\n[**https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1960513314107779&amp;set=a.1585701564922291**](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1960513314107779&amp;set=a.1585701564922291&amp;__cft__[0]=AZXGg6sd9rBpo9YaxHBVeOxB7n6fVAQjOxMNmCb1lIDLB0PMJGN9XTI8SF9u1k66qGr5KR-w8rqjkzq8IYEW1INo-_L8B8Pf0tiWlAe1gG0csg4Qpob44VgvtccPdYq9itA&amp;__tn__=R]-R)\n\nYour double may show up to \u201chelp you out\u201d. \n\nI suppose this implies a 3rd universal rule: That the double gets curious when you try to do something impossible, and will show up to help at times. Carlos even pointed out two people at a workshop, whose doubles were standing near by them. Possibly curious about the workshop and Carlos. So to help you visualize this, take the picture of that last post, of the 3 orderly dream world fragments attached to the bed, and scramble everything. Only a small piece of each at a given location, and then next to it, the wrong piece. Then pretend 1000 spiders spun webs of golden fibers between all the fragments of the dreaming scenes. That\u2019s a horizontal shift which has not completely solidified. It\u2019s a \u201cphantom skimming of the emanations\u201d, which is in flux. And your dreaming double will come to help! But you aren\u2019t trying to do a specific thing, like play with one particular puff of light. You\u2019re trying to understand what you are seeing. You\u2019re hoping it turns into another friendly fishing beach in France so you can visit, without tumbling down the sand cliff. The double goes to work using his ability to view the emanations and bundles of emanations. He\u2019s walking around in France, while you\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. And now, you have the basics of that \u201crule\u201d. You are \u201chere\u201d. He is \u201cthere\u201d. The problem is, did you notice him? That requires energy. Everything we do requires energy, thus the recommendation not to waste it. To be impeccable. But you can't be impeccable, until you understand what the results are. And arguing on your Facebook page about which \"warrior\" is more impeccable, is not impeccability. But once you do notice your double, mixed in there with your waking dreaming world, perhaps as a faint feeling something else just happened, try to remember as much as you can. Where was his dream version of your room? What was he doing? How long did it last? You are now going back and forth between \u201chere\u201d, and \u201cthere\u201d. And the abstract will become visible. The abstract is \u201cpeaceful\u201d. Meaning, if you are agitated looking from yourself, to your double\u2019s memories, you won\u2019t notice it except when you stop for an instant, to ponder if all this is even possible. But once you do, and you realize there\u2019s something else happening, you can easily find yourself gazing into the abstract, into \u201csilent knowledge\u201d on a continuous basis. You have just experienced the purple zone on the J curve, while in the red zone.\n\nBut don\u2019t let it go to your head. You still need to remember, don\u2019t play too much on the \u201cbad\u201d side of town.

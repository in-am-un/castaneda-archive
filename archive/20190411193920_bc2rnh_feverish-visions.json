Someone else here recently wrote about an experience they had with it, but I'm sure it's very common to learn new things when ill.  The illness pushes the assemblage point all out of alignment, and from there it's possible to move it to places you haven't seen before.  You can likely remember some experiences like that from when you were a child with a less oppressive internal dialogue, and were ill.\n\nIt's clear that I have a virus of some kind. I've been sweating in rooms with excellent air conditioning, and I've completely lost my appetite.  But the worst part is an intense headache, somehow associated with my throat.\n\nI was laying on my bed, trying to assemble another world where I wasn't in so much pain, through silence.  But I was stuck from the illness and didn't succeed.  I wasn't going anywhere feeling like that.\n\nIt reminded me of Carlos' plight in his last weeks.\n\nBut I did reach a new level of silence, even with the pain.  And I couldn't believe what I saw.\n\nI'm reporting it because I know how silence feels from when you first decide to attain it,  going to where I am now.    It's not always convincing along the way.  You still have the feeling that maybe you've been duped by a new age hustler, and all the work can't possibly lead anywhere.\n\nYes duped.  I mean that.  Don\u2019t pretend you aren\u2019t worried about that.  If you really believe you aren\u2019t, chances are you\u2019re working on the surface of social considerations, and not actually trying to achieve the goal. For example, maybe you want to copy the master and get a book deal of your own, so you can make lots of money and be famous.  If you look around on the web at writings aimed at explaining Castaneda, there\u2019s almost always a prominent \u201cdonate here\u201d button.  Even Howard\u2019s followers seems to have donate buttons.\n\nThere was plenty of that going around in Carlos\u2019 classes.  I almost have a hard time faulting it, since they were just wanting to be like Carlos, in every way.\n\nBut this level of silence was far deeper than anything I'd seen.  It would convince anyone to give up fame, and try to go deeper.\n\nIt even seemed to be outside the second attention.  If you learn to merge the second attention with the first attention, you quickly become familiar with the sensation.  It\u2019s like having magic inside you, and you only have to close your eyes to view it.\n\nBut this level of silence was outside both the first, and second attention. It's a level you probably only need to see once, to realize how confused we are about our perception.\n\nI was submersed in some kind of yellow haze, watching a single thought.  There was nothing pleasant about the yellow haze, at least not in the way the second attention comes with bliss of some kind.  Someone commented on how confusing the term \"Samadhi\" is.  Samadhi is merely the bliss of attaining entry way to the second attention.  If you want verification, go look at web pages written by european praticioners, who aren't tied to asian social rules.\n\nThis feverish state was not blissful.  It wasn't filled with magic the way the second attention is. It was just nothingness, watching a single idea.  It was too abstract to explain, but a general description is that there was a reddish object shaped like a box, about which I was concerned. It was something from the real world reduced to mental images, and the concern about the object, and the effects it could have on everything else, was laid out as a string of perceived outcomes.\n\nI was looking at the entire thought, absent any other considerations. It was a short line in space, which was attached to an entire world.  My world.\n\nBut it was basically all concern.  The concern itself assembled that world, like a beacon.  The entire world was produced by focusing my attention on that somewhat unpleasant thought, the consequences of which were an entire world's context.  Or syntaxt perhaps.\n\nSo for those of you trying to reach silence, keep in mind there's steps along the way. The early steps are not very convincing.   Just like a feverish headache, they can be nothing but pain.\n\nBut that will change. It gets more obvious as things go on, that Carlos was really on to something important.  And nowhere else have I found anything fully similiar.\n\nI suspect recapitulation is mandatory to achieve silence.  I\u2019ve seen that in people who write to me, and are unable to take on the task of getting silent.  It's not that they can't try to be silent, everyone can do that. They just won't.\n\nInstead, they gravitate towards recapitulation, and comment how that, in and of itself, is making it easier to get silent.\n\nThat's because, there are hundreds of miniature concepts in the mind of someone who hasn't learned to be silent.  Those who suffered abuse in childhood are even worse off, because many of the concepts floating around involve suffering. Our minds are absolutely cluttered with ideas like that, until it feels \"real\" and inescapable.  And you can't concentrate enough to get silent. Escaping pain of any kind, especially childhood abuse, is very difficult.\n\nBut it isn't inescapable. It's just more work than the average person is willing to do.\n\nIt's unfortunate that recapitulation is likely mandatory, because it's a lot of work.  But fortunate also, because recapitulation (done well) leads to all kinds of unusual dreaming. It also teaches how to move the assemblage point, in a roundabout fashion.  And recapitulating is not difficult at all, the way forced silence can be.  It's just a tedious amount of effort, which eventually becomes rewarding. But still seems tedious.\n\nAny technique (including chi-gung) which does not emphasize silence above all else, is just a side street to our normal reality.\n\nEdited: once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Feverish visions", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_bc2rnh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1555091631.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1555004360.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you practice sorcery, being ill is an (unwelcome) opportunity.

He created tensions between them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, he forbade someone to take private classes, and secretly invited his friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or he would made someone in particular feel &amp;#39;special&amp;#39;, and then ignored him as if he didn&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like calling someone and talk for 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is very clear how everyone was more obsessed with seeing and being with Carlos than with learning itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another interesting story is an example that Carlos gave of an anthill, which remains disorganized until &amp;quot;ant number 52&amp;quot; arrives. Then everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was waiting for such an extraordinary event to happen, once he found enough practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, Florinda apparently stated in an interview that they (Carlos and the witches) were still seeing the little sisters and the Genaros, although they &amp;quot;pursued other goals&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda died because she had an ego burst while her assemblage point was in the pelvic area. Carlos claimed that if she had been a little higher (higher than the head, as &amp;#39;done sorcerers&amp;#39; have) it would not have happened, because the ego vanishes (I conclude that she died in the red zone).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something that caught my attention is the &amp;quot;promise of freedom&amp;quot; that Carlos made at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, his endless insistence on recapping and doing magical passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This guy tells how Carol pushed him into the IOB tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as she arrived, she hugged him and said &amp;quot;Hello Ezzzeeeqquuieel&amp;quot; and immediately appeared in a tunnel with thousands of simultaneous thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he had a 40 degree fever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/TechnoMagical_Intent\"&gt;u/TechnoMagical_Intent&lt;/a&gt; might be interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might add more details later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_pgp13t", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pgp13t/playing_dirty_with_fairy/hbi1ype/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1630707757.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1630707757.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hbgnkof", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hbgfv4n", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I suspected as much about people who like horror movies.

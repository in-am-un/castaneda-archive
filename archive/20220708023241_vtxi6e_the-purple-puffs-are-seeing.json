You just \"know\".\n\nLike the mushroom shapes little Smoke blew at Carlos on his request.\n\nEach was a person.  Don Juan warned him it took a very skilled sorcerer to interpret them, but every aspect of the person is there.  And all Carlos could do at his level was decide the overall health.\n\nHe wasn't silent enough to bring the mushroom shape into \"focus\" relative to \"knowing\".\n\nThe same can happen if you try to master remote viewing.\n\nIn SK, you can \"know\" you are looking at the target.\n\nBut if you want the kind of details that let you \"zip\" into that dream, so you can actually relocate there, it needs to have good enough focus for at least one object to feel \"inviting\".\n\nThen you can gaze at that, and get sucked in.  Same as in 4 gates dreaming when you learn to travel.\n\nLet me try to describe the focus issue.\n\nYou might be gazing at a road you know, which has trees all along it.\n\nSo that in remote viewing, you're looking at a stretch of trees all aligned into a row.\n\nBut you can't see any leaves or branches.\n\nInstead you see broken rocks,  solid \"shapes\", and not enough color to know if there's any at all. And the \"contrast\" is poor.  Or perhaps the scene is \"too dark\".\n\nIt's sort of like looking at Benjamin, the rock guy in \"Fantastic Four\".    Just to use an analogy.\n\nIn real life, he's kind of handsome.   But in his superhero form, the only girlfriend he can manage is blind.\n\nHe got turned into a stack of boulders with a face on it.\n\nThe \"real\" him isn't in focus.\n\nSame for those remotely viewed trees.  And no focus, no pull from that dream scene.\n\nWhat causes it?\n\nPartly, it's unrecapitulated \"muscle memory\".\n\nLet's say you had a horrible incident as a child, and someone was repeatedly hurting you physically.\n\nYou can recapitulate that over and over, but naturally you'll still remember it.\n\nRecap doesn't erase memories.  It just removes the excessive energy you had tied up in them.\n\nYou get \"tired of that topic\".\n\nBut can still remember it.\n\nYou get enough of that energy back so that if you do that for everything in your life, you can move your assemblage point far enough to reach Silent Knowledge.\n\nBecause your internal thoughts aren't \"stuck\" on those memories, pulling you back to the blue line.\n\nAnd yet, even if you completely get rid of the conscious thoughts, there's still another part of you.\n\nWe aren't a single sentient being, even in our tonal form.\n\nIf the inorganic beings kidnapped your double so it was nowhere to be found, your tonal still has 2 \"sentiences\".\n\nThe one you know, and the muscle memory.\n\nSo you've recapitulated past memories out of your tonal body's thought process, so it isn't stuck up at the blue line reality.\n\nBut your muscle memory also had to respond to those situations.\n\nIn the case of someone harming you as a child, you learned to tense up muscles, grimace your face, and generally do anything to try to reduce the harm.\n\nYour \"muscle memory\" also knows that situation, and recap DOES NOT remove that.\n\nIt isn't at that level of thought!  It's somewhere else.  And if it's \"triggered\", you get the physical fussiness.\n\nKeep in mind, muscle memory can't be too specific.  You learn how to throw a ball.\n\nBut not the precise situations.   You just generally know, \"this is like throwing a ball\", and then the muscle memory loads that app.\n\nMight even get loaded in error, in response to something that has nothing to do with sports.\n\nAn example.\n\nYou can recapitulate your fear of fire and getting burned, but your muscle memory is still going to pull your hand off a fire faster than you can become aware of the situation.\n\nOr perhaps,  think of the worst entertainer you can.  One you loathe.\n\nEven though you have no respect for him, if you meet him in person and have to speak you'll notice your neck is tense, you can barely move, and you stutter trying to get a sentence out.\n\nHe's \"FAMOUS\".  And you can feel it.  People say he has a \"presence\".\n\nFrankly, I think it's just the professional grooming, but what do I know?\n\nYou may think you have the situation under control, but your muscle memory doesn't.\n\nIt senses potential danger and is all ready to strike out or run.\n\nYou might even find your hand trying to change the channel on a TV that isn't there.  To make him go away.\n\nMuscle memory stores up the correct responses for a given situation, and recap does not resolve that.\n\nSo when you get out into the far reaches of the J curve, don't expect to be \"at ease\".\n\nYou'll still have the fog of fussiness.\n\nIt's a dark fog, thick, and virtually like ugly smoke mixed with filthy dirt.\n\nIt makes you think all this darkroom effort is a waste of time.  Doesn't matter if you are standing in the entryway to heaven, looking at all the dead people walking around on tiptoe feet in Togas.\n\nCarlos used to teach us, asking if we really wanted to go to heaven for eternity where nothing changes.\n\nBut on visiting there using sorcery, perhaps you feel less than satisfied.\n\nOught to be super cool!\n\nBut one night, it's not.\n\nThat's the unrecapped muscle memory.\n\nIt's a problem!    You'll find out.\n\nSo how to solve it?\n\nYou have to \"retrain\" the muscle memory as the fussiness comes up.\n\nNo one can \"explain\" what each worry or piece of grief, causing your body to believe it might need to \"fight or flight\" soon, really means.\n\nIf you did a good job of recap your muscle memory will be running on so many \"clues\" for what subroutine it might need to activate, that it will be hopeless to find them.\n\nBest you can do is retrain it.\n\nVisual retraining is possible.\n\nTurn the dirty \"fussy fog\" into swirling purple masses by invoking the puffs to \"go rogue\".\n\nRunning man passes can do that for any problems in the lower body.  For the muscle memory that controls from the waist down.\n\nYou just \"tensegrity pass\" the fussiness into entertaining pleasure.\n\nBut any tensegrity pass which engages the muscle memory can teach it not to be fussy about that vague topic, and to feel something else.\n\nTo \"flow\" perhaps.\n\nThis advice won't do anyone any good.\n\nBut it might cause you to notice it.  So you don't confuse it with boredom, or lack of pleasing results.\n\nBecause those prevent things from coming into focus.\n\nThose still \"pull\" you back to the blue line.  They just drag the second tonal sentience, more than the primary one.\n\nYour fussy command, is still the eagle's command.\n\nOur blue life obsessions \"become  the eagle's command\",  in order to let us live our lives in whatever assemblage point position we were born into.\n\nSo we don't have to constantly worry our reality won't last.\n\nBut sorcerers we want to change to other realities.  To visit!\n\nAnd there's 2 forms of strings tied to us, pulling back to the blue line.\n\nAn analogy:\n\nDon't confuse the topic at dinner, with the dinner.\n\nThe food can taste really bad if someone is going on and on about that horrible entertainer you hate so much.\n\nEven if it's excellent food.\n\nIt's just \"hard to swallow\".", "edited": 1657297633.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ifcfuyx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good timing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do with this.

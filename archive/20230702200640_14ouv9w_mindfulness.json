She suggested this mask (the Mindfold) is a better deal, and she uses it.\n\nI suppose the name is a play on \"blind fold\" **rather than \"mindful\", the ludicrous Zen technique that causes you to be even worse off than before.  Focusing on \"what you are doing\", mindfully.**\n\n**The absolute opposite direction you want to go.**\n\nLeave it to the Japanese to borrow something made up by the Chinese (Buddhism), and use it to **force everyone to conform to society** in a cheerful way....\"\n\n\\------------\n\nSo, mindfulness is the opposite of sorcery?!?  Time for some more info. First from [The Wikipedia Entry on Mindfullness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness):\n\n\"Mindfulness is the practice of purposely bringing one's attention to the present-moment experience without evaluation, a skill one develops through meditation or other training. Mindfulness derives from sati, a significant element of Hindu and Buddhist traditions, and is based on Zen, Vipassan\u0101, and Tibetan meditation techniques. Though definitions and techniques of mindfulness are wide-ranging, Buddhist traditions explain what constitutes mindfulness such as how past, present and future moments arise and cease as momentary sense impressions and mental phenomena....\n\n...The practice of mindfulness appears to provide therapeutic benefits to people with psychiatric disorders, including moderate benefits to those with psychosis. Studies also indicate that rumination and worry contribute to a variety of mental disorders, and that mindfulness-based interventions can enhance trait mindfulness and reduce both rumination and worry. Further, the practice of mindfulness may be a preventive strategy to halt the development of mental-health problems. However, according to one opinion article, too much mindfulness may produce negative effects.\n\nEvidence suggests that engaging in mindfulness meditation may influence physical health. For example, the psychological habit of repeatedly dwelling on stressful thoughts appears to intensify the physiological effects of the stressor (as a result of the continual activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis) with the potential to lead to physical health related clinical manifestations. Studies indicate that mindfulness meditation, which brings about reductions in rumination, may alter these biological clinical pathways...Additionally, mindfulness appears to bring about lowered activity of the default mode network of the brain, and thereby contribute towards a lowered risk of developing conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n*Methods and Practices*\n\nMindfulness practice involves the process of developing the skill of bringing one's attention to whatever is happening in the present moment.\n\nThere are several exercises designed to develop mindfulness meditation, which may be aided by guided meditations \"to get the hang of it\". As forms of self-observation and interoception, these methods increase awareness of the body, so they are usually beneficial to people with low self-awareness or low awareness of their bodies or emotional state, and can provoke anxiety, distress, flashbacks, pain, and even trigger substance abuse in people who are very focused on themselves, their bodies, and their emotions.\n\nOne method is to sit in a straight-backed chair or sit cross-legged on the floor or a cushion, close one's eyes and bring attention to either the sensations of breathing in the proximity of one's nostrils or to the movements of the abdomen when breathing in and out. In this meditation practice, one does not try to control one's breathing, but attempts to simply be aware of one's natural breathing process/rhythm. When engaged in this practice, the mind will often run off to other thoughts and associations, and if this happens, one passively notices that the mind has wandered, and in an accepting, non-judgmental way, returns to focusing on breathing.\n\nIn body-scan meditation the attention is directed at various areas of the body and noting body sensations that happen in the present moment.\n\nOne could also focus on sounds, sensations, thoughts, feelings and actions that happen in the present. In this regard, a famous exercise, introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his MBSR program, is the mindful tasting of a raisin, in which a raisin is being tasted and eaten mindfully. By enabling reconnection with internal hunger and satiety cues, mindful eating has been suggested to be a means of maintaining healthy and conscious eating patterns.\n\nOther approaches include practicing yoga asanas while attending to movements and body sensations, and walking meditation.\"\n\n(*the article then diverges into a historical overview of Buddhism*)\n\nAnd [from the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/mindfulness-exercises/art-20046356):\n\n\"Spending too much time planning, problem-solving, daydreaming, or thinking negative or random thoughts can be draining. It can also make you more likely to experience stress, anxiety and symptoms of depression. Practicing mindfulness exercises can help you direct your attention away from this kind of thinking and engage with the world around you.\n\nThere are many simple ways to practice mindfulness. Some examples include:\n\n**Pay attention**. It's hard to slow down and notice things in a busy world. Try to take the time to experience your environment with all of your senses \u2014 touch, sound, sight, smell and taste. For example, when you eat a favorite food, take the time to smell, taste and truly enjoy it.\n\n**Live in the moment.** Try to intentionally bring an open, accepting and discerning attention to everything you do. Find joy in simple pleasures.\n\n**Accept yourself.** Treat yourself the way you would treat a good friend.\n\n**Focus on your breathing.** When you have negative thoughts, try to sit down, take a deep breath and close your eyes. Focus on your breath as it moves in and out of your body. Sitting and breathing for even just a minute can help...Research indicates that engaging your senses outdoors is especially beneficial.\n\nFor more structured mindfulness exercises, such as body scan meditation or sitting meditation, you'll need to set aside time when you can be in a quiet place without distractions or interruptions.\n\nAim to practice mindfulness every day for about six months. Over time, you might find that mindfulness becomes effortless. Think of it as a commitment to reconnecting with and nurturing yourself.\"\n\n(**That last sentence should clearly differentiate the Mayo clinic's interpretation from the sorcerer's explanation, at least when referencing the social self** \ud83d\ude04)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nAs I am not very good at writing about such things, I feel it would be useful for someone more knowledgeable, WINK WINK, to **point out the key differences (in intent for one thing!) between inner silence in sorcery, and being mindful in Buddhism/Western Secularism....because I believe this could be rather confusing to people** (given the surface similarities with some sorcery practices), especially when their own doctor is highly likely to offer mindfulness as a therapy.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Mindfulness??", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xxodavcodl9b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 153, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afbe693338a4ebbf92408076721c5f94af254cec"}, {"y": 306, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00d65703ee684bd84840fc8b670688de6482220e"}, {"y": 453, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9af149ba747c1e76dd154e5c88d0334ef9180c1d"}, {"y": 907, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8faa70135437e811f40eb91a5ce6aa5fdd3fe33b"}, {"y": 1361, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1371882eb8f9473c5e8ff03f99364b781baf1f1a"}, {"y": 1531, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab03a5ce75a0d04bad7bdd31124f7a40337e9bef"}], "s": {"y": 4255, "x": 3000, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fb138ee34299c739f82aafe57e691d73b35b368"}, "id": "xxodavcodl9b1"}}, "name": "t3_14ouv9w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 25, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Yxwuv7mjysemiRrZ8DsjIsa86STFtNsNCCy3aLU8Jgk.jpg", "edited": 1688322549.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1688321200.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=3000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1fb138ee34299c739f82aafe57e691d73b35b368\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xxodavcodl9b1.png?width=3000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1fb138ee34299c739f82aafe57e691d73b35b368&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This recent comment from &lt;a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0Wjc73UEkRbMZRoM5odb5qVcoxcCbAeKnP1hBodE2prgmTDPobT1MhQfcCyNnYTsgl&amp;amp;id=100004473870769&amp;amp;mibextid=ZbWKwL\"&gt;the Facebook Post&lt;/a&gt; on that silk sleepmask, mentions one of the most familiar buzzwords in both Western secular Buddhism as well as generalist &amp;quot;spiritual&amp;quot; press:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A witch from the subreddit said that&amp;#39;s (silk eye mask with eyes spaces) very pricey, and be sure you don&amp;#39;t put it into the washing machine.

Maybe further if your an master at internal silence, but that probably is an indicator that you know how to shift your eyes to the second attention with your \"will\" so to speak. \n\nIf you want \"mindfulness\" to bring you sorcery you have to slowly turn it into internal silence.\n\nAny practicioner of mindfulness will quickly figure out (especially in daylight) that they are seeing literally no change. Yes they might \"distract\" their mind to feel like there is litle to no internal dialog. But you quickly learn that is just a thing where your mind tricks you to think its silent. A good giveaway is when your mind is litteraly making the notion \"oh i am silent now\". \n\nLike: NO YOUR NOT. Othervise why would you be thinking this. \n\nMindfulness is kinda like listening to music for silence. It might take you deeper down the blue zone, but i doubt you will even see colors. Reason is you need intent for that. And it comes from your eyes. \n\nThere is a good reason why the books emphasized the eyes. You need to \"look\" at things differently to shift the AP. \n\nThere was a trick i learned for shifting my AP in my hallway. I will take a stick and i will pretend to be a drunk, sleepwalking old man, snoring and walking around with half closed eyes. \n\nI can actually reach the green zone way.

It's automatic with darkroom.\n\nSo that's the next logical step. To be able to fully enter the dreams you created or located, every night.\n\nNewbies: Sorcery experiences should not be once every year, or a cool thing every 10 years! The whole Castaneda community is drowning in that kind of experience.  Some dream gets misrepresented, and they do nothing but talk about that forever.\n\nYou need to do dazzling sorcery for hours each day, not just often enough to put a cool story or two on your Facebook page. Otherwise your knowledge doesn't grow.  Anything new you learn is lost in a few days, if you don't keep learning. The assemblage point moves back to zero.  You have to keep pushing, like anything else.\n\nYou wouldn't make one free throw shot in basketball, and then post it on your Facebook and keep pretending for years that makes you a basketball player!\n\nLily had disappeared for a few days at the end of last week,  presumably so I could see how hard it was to do her techniques before the assemblage point was in heightened awareness.  That's the drawback of her techniques.\n\nFairy's techniques were just scooping and using Tensegrity as Carlos had intended, so you get to do them immediately.\n\nLily's take 2+ hours to move the assemblage point where you need it to be, so by the time you get to try it you're almost out of energy.\n\n\\#1 technique was entry to the IOB realm via a shared dream.  She implied that's how the old seers visited there and why the stories about it are so personified.  Remember the stuff about how they have to wander in further and further until they never return? Presumably that's what she was showing me.\n\n\\#2 technique was how to catapult across the universe and land on a distant planet.  She implied it was what Elias did.\n\nBut the main thing about both of those is, you leave the darkroom and enter dreaming, directly from awake.\n\nWhat's that like?  Just what it sounds like.  You can't explain how you managed to leave the room, but there's nothing about it which seems imaginary.  Later, you simply find yourself back in bed, the way Carlos did at UCLA when he stopped the world outside the cafeteria.\n\nLily teaches too fast.  My guess is, all IOBs do that.\n\nCarlos complained about the Emissary doing it.\n\nI'll see what comes next and maybe draw it up more accurately, but  here's the basics for the \"flat path\" in the dark room.\n\nUnderstand that everything you see in darkroom exists at all levels.\n\nWhich is darned good for us, or no one would be able to find colors in the darkness. Then they'd have nothing to pull their assemblage point along.\n\nThink of the colors and puffs of color as dolphins on the ocean, and you have a magic lasso you can toss at them, which always hooks on to them.  Once stuck to the dolphin, you get pulled that way in your little boat.\n\nIf you only hook to one dolphin, you go where he's going.\n\nBut if you hook to the entire \"pod\" (herd), you get pulled out to sea.\n\nSo in the darkroom, if you're using the puffs you want to look overall. Anything new, notice it, play with it a bit using your hands, but move on to the next thing.\n\nOtherwise you'll move sideways and get stuck.  You won't gain in depth.\n\nIn Lily's technique, you don't do any of that.\n\nYou find the \"flatness\" in front of you, at finger reach, face level.\n\nPretend there's a white surface there.\n\nUse your fingers to wiggle it, or massage it.  If you see anything, stick your hand into that.\n\nYou're trying to stimulate the idea that there's a flat surface there, so you can gaze through it.\n\nIt's an automatic \"down the middle\" on the J curve, because of the peripheral vision used to focus on it.\n\nCan you do this if you've never seen the whitish light before?\n\nI don't know. But once you have seen it on a regular basis, you should be able to pull this off.  And skip 2 hours of hard work!\n\nThe flatness won't manifest the same way at the top of the J curve. You're likely to see only a few \"flat\" details, around 3 inches in diameter.  Moving with your gaze.  At the top (blue line) you start with  a \"portable flatness\".  As you move down, it expands.\n\nThe absolutely pitch black dark room will no longer be dark, once you activate the flatness.  That's the oddest thing.  Instant Phantom room.  Way before that should be showing up.\n\nYou'll be looking at an actual room or place, with shapes all over, but everything just a dull whitish color, and nothing easy to recognize.  Plus there's a weird quality to it. Wherever that sight exists, is a place we've been trained to ignore.  So you won't **want** to look at it but you should often, mostly using your peripheral vision.  Don't become obsessed with any one piece.\n\nIf you took a picture of a flat pile of garbage, and then made it black and white only, and then turned it down in brightness until only the highlights remained, that's what you see.\n\nIt's not going to match your room, but it will be so bright you'll be temped to try to use your \"seeing in the dark\" vision on the actual room.\n\nProbably won't work.\n\nNow that you have it activated, you keep playing with the \"surface\" that's in front of it,  and keep looking for more things behind it.  Those will be between the walls of the phantom room, and the flat surface you've materialized.\n\nAt each level of the J curve, there are different things to see.\n\nYellow flashes at the top.  I believe those can even be seen at the blue line.\n\nWhen you get to the green line, the whitish light takes on a reddish hue, and you feel vast space in front of you.  The red is not on the white. It's behind it.  And the whitish surface will have increased in diameter.\n\nIf you keep playing until you can actually see a full flat surface on all walls and on the bedspread, but especially in front of the phantom view of some random room, you'll eventually pass the red zone.\n\nOn the J curve.\n\nA giant purple smear will drift by, as brilliant as a low wattage light bulb.  You'll get \"purple smoke\" drifting by.  A puff or two might try to lure you to play.\n\nIgnore it.\n\nBut it does indicate you made it to the red line.\n\nNow you need to really concentrate on looking for \"stuff\" behind that flat surface.\n\nDistant \"stuff\" is not very useful. Look slightly above eye level on the left, and find a blob.\n\nIf you see one, stick your left hand in there and move it gently to stimulate it.\n\nNow glance to the right, without dropping the left hand.  Do the same.\n\nWhen you have both hands inside a \"blob\" of some kind, which will have strong details but nothing you can recognize, use them to illuminate the middle.  This will result in a dream on one side or the other, or both sides if you play with it.\n\nThe reason they tend to form on the sides is, that's more horizontally shifted on the J curve.\n\nYes, it works that way. It's simply \"in that direction\". Nothing complicated required to shift the assemblage point horizontally.\n\nAnd, it responds to \"perspective\", so that the further right you look, the more you tend to see, coming from that position of the assemblage point.\n\nStretch arms out further, then bring closer together, to try to \"coax\" the right hand dream into the left hand dream.   Like mixing 2 clouds of smoke.\n\nIf the right hand had an inorganic being, you can simply insert it. They go playfully into floating dreams.\n\nBut in this case we're trying to get the right dream to merge with the left dream.\n\nLily claims, the force of 2 dreams makes the final one easier to enter. Twice the intent I suppose.\n\nIf you get a good angle (usually with the arms slightly more than shoulder distance apart), you'll begin to see  a full (new?) dream forming in the middle.\n\nYou're stimulating the space in the middle using the dreaming energy of both hands and arms.  Especially the fleshy part of the arm on the bottom.\n\nWhen something is formed, but not enough to walk into, likely not much you can even recognize, you need to use your gaze in the middle area to bring out details.\n\nBy then, you'll be at the border of full HA.\n\nWant some dark energy?\n\nGlance high up to the left, and see if you have a visitor.\n\nTry the right too.\n\nDon't be picky about their appearance.  Anything at all is good enough.  A vague face is likely.\n\nTalk to it.  Use the outstretched hand, with a blob of dreaming energy on it, to make the IOB move closer to you.\n\nSometimes you can't find one, but you still sense a creepy feeling over there.\n\nPull that closer and deposit on your torso.\n\nBy now, if you found faces you'll detect the breath change. Or if you detected the creepiness of dark energy.\n\nThe whitish light ought to be very clear as a flat surface around 2 feet away, but through which you can look at the room.\n\nAnd you'll still have a phantom copy of the room back there.\n\nAt this point, you can \"externalize\" your fantasies.\n\nThe internal dialogue consists of multiple parts.  Getting rid of the talking is the most important thing, because it lets the assemblage point move.\n\nBut you can still remember things while you have no internal dialogue.  Your attention simply focuses on something as an image without words.\n\nThat directs the movement of the assemblage point.  Towards this position.\n\nTo get to this flat surface stage, you had to get rid of that.\n\nBut it's a struggle.\n\nSo, let it happen behind the whitish light.  Behind the flat surface you produced, which is made of whitish light with some repeating texture.\n\nIt matters if you gaze left or right of center, for what form your fantasy will take.\n\nYou're going to cause a full dream to play like a video, on one side or the other.\n\nCarefully cause the dream to form on the right, check out the central details, and then glance to the left to see the same copy over there, and compare any differences.\n\nThat's where Lily stopped teaching me.  She taunted me with the idea my internal dialogue would be removed for inspection.\n\nThen the sun came up.\n\nI'd lost 4 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Same technique...](https://preview.redd.it/vocwv0empg571.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdaebca37ac2aa888e2786d69e2dea6210e855a5)\n\nNotice where it says, \"Ancient Mexico\" above?\n\nAncient:\n\nSo perhaps on, around or  before the year 500 A.D. As most definitions of the Middle Ages in  Europe date its beginnings to the 6th century, something would have to  be at least 1400-1500 years **old** to be **considered** \"**ancient**\" in a

Then they&amp;#39;d have nothing to pull their assemblage point along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of the colors and puffs of color as dolphins on the ocean, and you have a magic lasso you can toss at them, which always hooks on to them.  Once stuck to the dolphin, you get pulled that way in your little boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you only hook to one dolphin, you go where he&amp;#39;s going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you hook to the entire &amp;quot;pod&amp;quot; (herd), you get pulled out to sea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the darkroom, if you&amp;#39;re using the puffs you want to look overall. Anything new, notice it, play with it a bit using your hands, but move on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you&amp;#39;ll move sideways and get stuck.  You won&amp;#39;t gain in depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Lily&amp;#39;s technique, you don&amp;#39;t do any of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find the &amp;quot;flatness&amp;quot; in front of you, at finger reach, face level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretend there&amp;#39;s a white surface there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use your fingers to wiggle it, or massage it.  If you see anything, stick your hand into that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re trying to stimulate the idea that there&amp;#39;s a flat surface there, so you can gaze through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an automatic &amp;quot;down the middle&amp;quot; on the J curve, because of the peripheral vision used to focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you do this if you&amp;#39;ve never seen the whitish light before?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know. But once you have seen it on a regular basis, you should be able to pull this off.  And skip 2 hours of hard work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flatness won&amp;#39;t manifest the same way at the top of the J curve. You&amp;#39;re likely to see only a few &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; details, around 3 inches in diameter.  Moving with your gaze.  At the top (blue line) you start with  a &amp;quot;portable flatness&amp;quot;.  As you move down, it expands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The absolutely pitch black dark room will no longer be dark, once you activate the flatness.  That&amp;#39;s the oddest thing.  Instant Phantom room.  Way before that should be showing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be looking at an actual room or place, with shapes all over, but everything just a dull whitish color, and nothing easy to recognize.  Plus there&amp;#39;s a weird quality to it. Wherever that sight exists, is a place we&amp;#39;ve been trained to ignore.  So you won&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to look at it but you should often, mostly using your peripheral vision.  Don&amp;#39;t become obsessed with any one piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you took a picture of a flat pile of garbage, and then made it black and white only, and then turned it down in brightness until only the highlights remained, that&amp;#39;s what you see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not going to match your room, but it will be so bright you&amp;#39;ll be temped to try to use your &amp;quot;seeing in the dark&amp;quot; vision on the actual room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you have it activated, you keep playing with the &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s in front of it,  and keep looking for more things behind it.  Those will be between the walls of the phantom room, and the flat surface you&amp;#39;ve materialized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At each level of the J curve, there are different things to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yellow flashes at the top.  I believe those can even be seen at the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get to the green line, the whitish light takes on a reddish hue, and you feel vast space in front of you.  The red is not on the white. It&amp;#39;s behind it.  And the whitish surface will have increased in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep playing until you can actually see a full flat surface on all walls and on the bedspread, but especially in front of the phantom view of some random room, you&amp;#39;ll eventually pass the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A giant purple smear will drift by, as brilliant as a low wattage light bulb.  You&amp;#39;ll get &amp;quot;purple smoke&amp;quot; drifting by.  A puff or two might try to lure you to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it does indicate you made it to the red line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you need to really concentrate on looking for &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; behind that flat surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Distant &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; is not very useful. Look slightly above eye level on the left, and find a blob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see one, stick your left hand in there and move it gently to stimulate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now glance to the right, without dropping the left hand.  Do the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you have both hands inside a &amp;quot;blob&amp;quot; of some kind, which will have strong details but nothing you can recognize, use them to illuminate the middle.  This will result in a dream on one side or the other, or both sides if you play with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason they tend to form on the sides is, that&amp;#39;s more horizontally shifted on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it works that way. It&amp;#39;s simply &amp;quot;in that direction&amp;quot;. Nothing complicated required to shift the assemblage point horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, it responds to &amp;quot;perspective&amp;quot;, so that the further right you look, the more you tend to see, coming from that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stretch arms out further, then bring closer together, to try to &amp;quot;coax&amp;quot; the right hand dream into the left hand dream.   Like mixing 2 clouds of smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the right hand had an inorganic being, you can simply insert it. They go playfully into floating dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in this case we&amp;#39;re trying to get the right dream to merge with the left dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily claims, the force of 2 dreams makes the final one easier to enter. Twice the intent I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get a good angle (usually with the arms slightly more than shoulder distance apart), you&amp;#39;ll begin to see  a full (new?) dream forming in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re stimulating the space in the middle using the dreaming energy of both hands and arms.  Especially the fleshy part of the arm on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When something is formed, but not enough to walk into, likely not much you can even recognize, you need to use your gaze in the middle area to bring out details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By then, you&amp;#39;ll be at the border of full HA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Want some dark energy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glance high up to the left, and see if you have a visitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try the right too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be picky about their appearance.  Anything at all is good enough.  A vague face is likely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talk to it.  Use the outstretched hand, with a blob of dreaming energy on it, to make the IOB move closer to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can&amp;#39;t find one, but you still sense a creepy feeling over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pull that closer and deposit on your torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now, if you found faces you&amp;#39;ll detect the breath change. Or if you detected the creepiness of dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whitish light ought to be very clear as a flat surface around 2 feet away, but through which you can look at the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll still have a phantom copy of the room back there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can &amp;quot;externalize&amp;quot; your fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internal dialogue consists of multiple parts.  Getting rid of the talking is the most important thing, because it lets the assemblage point move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can still remember things while you have no internal dialogue.  Your attention simply focuses on something as an image without words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That directs the movement of the assemblage point.  Towards this position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get to this flat surface stage, you had to get rid of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, let it happen behind the whitish light.  Behind the flat surface you produced, which is made of whitish light with some repeating texture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It matters if you gaze left or right of center, for what form your fantasy will take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re going to cause a full dream to play like a video, on one side or the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carefully cause the dream to form on the right, check out the central details, and then glance to the left to see the same copy over there, and compare any differences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where Lily stopped teaching me.  She taunted me with the idea my internal dialogue would be removed for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the sun came up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d lost 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vocwv0empg571.png?width=576&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fdaebca37ac2aa888e2786d69e2dea6210e855a5\"&gt;Same technique...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice where it says, &amp;quot;Ancient Mexico&amp;quot; above?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ancient:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So perhaps on, around or  before the year 500 A.D.

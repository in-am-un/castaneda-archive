But it\u2019s also a \u201cmyth\u201d which induces the intent of other people who practiced before.   It makes sense once you realize how intent influences dreaming imagery.\n\nFor that reason, I\u2019ll ignore the physical explanation part. Although, I kind of lean that way myself.\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to *see* a luminous cocoon in its entirety, so I can only repeat what Carlos said about the 2 sides. I suspect there\u2019s an issue with trying to \u201csee\u201d yourself, as opposed to other beings.  But then if you try to *see* another person, you\u2019re stuck in their social mess and it\u2019s really hard to shift the assemblage point enough to *see*.\n\nSo far, I haven\u2019t found a balance. Closest I got was sitting by a conveyor belt in airports, to watch people go by.   But airports tend to have the most powerful people going through from time to time, so that\u2019s a little risky.  You can get caught while trying to *see* someone go by.\n\nI\u2019ll just have to use what Carlos wrote and said about it. According to him, our total being is divided into 2 halves, the left and right side.  It\u2019s like there\u2019s a line right down the middle from head to feet, which sometimes comes out in the storyline, as a \u201cmembrane\u201d.\n\nBesides being divided down the middle, some people also have a division across the stomach area, making 4 compartments instead of 2.    All of the me-to naguals out there seem to have decided that\u2019s their situation, despite not actually having ever *seen* such things.\n\nThe left side is associated with the second attention, which can be thought of as your dreaming ability, activated in a useful way. The right side is associated with the physical body we all see.\n\nThe 2 sides can also manifest in the environment, when someone has learned to merge their second attention with their first, perhaps though heightened awareness. The \u201cwall of fog\u201d is an example.  That\u2019s externalized, but still part of the same idea of left and right awareness.\n\nZuleica\u2019s dreaming technique is a way to mix the 2 bodies.   You cause one to curl up inside the other, and you actually perceive it that way.  You end up rolled into a single unit, and then you learn to travel by noticing some fibers that stretch from just below your belly button.  You\u2019ve created a new combined body, and now you have to visualize a way to make it move.\n\nI suspect other ways of visualizing and making it real, are possible. But this is what we have.\n\nTensegrity is also a way to mix the 2 bodies, and maybe a safer way for people who don\u2019t do the rest of the techniques, such as recapitulating.  I could easily see someone with latent problems going mad the first time the second attention came to visit with them for a spell.\n\nSo the left half of the total energy body is associated with the second attention, and the right side is associated with the first attention (our normal body everyone knows about).  And you can learn to mix them, to make a combination that\u2019s not completely confused and daffy like the left is, but which also isn\u2019t as powerless or fragile as the right side.\n\nThe left side is dimwitted.  Keep that in mind. It loves anything, similar to how a 2 year old often likes the gift box better than the gift itself.  It really needs the first attention, if it\u2019s going to accomplish anything  useful.\n\nThose 2 forms of attention each have their own \u201cbody\u201d, and can act separately.  Even at great distances.  Carlos used to comment on people he ran into who had their second attention body \u201cright there!\u201d.  He meant, he could *see* it at times.  It came to visit, when things got interesting to it.\n\nI\u2019ve *seen* that too.  It\u2019s in a separate realm.  Like another copy of the world, running alongside it at the same time.  But you can\u2019t put the 2 together until later.  At the time, you're dazzled by the first attention, and the second attention isn\u2019t as obvious.\n\nFor most people, their second attention is lost in irrational pursuits anywhere in the worlds available to us.  And nowhere too.  It can exist in its own intent because it isn\u2019t rational.\n\nIt tends to be a little angry when you first learn to activate it, so be prepared for yourself cussing you out.  If you don\u2019t directly experience that with dreaming techniques, you\u2019ll feel it if you try to learn to get silent.  It\u2019ll intrude and mix with the leftover thoughts, which can get quite unpleasant.\n\nFrom the storyline, I conclude that the ancient sorcerers didn\u2019t care that it was angry and daffy.  They merely directed that anger at objects and other people.  They were described as having become \u201cghouls\u201d, going after men and material objects.  They came up with more and more elaborate ways to manipulate it, not completely realizing the actual methods and techniques had no actual value.  It just worked for them, because they willed it.\n\nThe real goal according to don Juan, is simply to learn to move the assemblage point, and not get obsessed with the techniques that do it (which includes tensegrity).   Getting obsessed with any technique causes you to lose valuable time, in sinkholes that can last decades.  You really need to try it all.\n\nIf you regularly experience the second attention, its anger subsides.  It becomes a friend.", "edited": 1556229492.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_elrhxcs", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree there&amp;#39;s likely a good physical explanation for most of it.

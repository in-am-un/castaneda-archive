Maybe it's because your drunk. Alcohol can enhance confidence. I'm not sure. If you believe humans were only ment to suffer and that this form of freedom I speak of us make believe I can't help you. This conversation reminds me of talking to a devout Christian. I do need to make one obvious correction. You said put any Buddhist in a torture chamber and he will cry to his mommy...lol clearly you haven't done much research. Ever heard of Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c? This fellow sat in a cross legged position calmly, while his compadre dumped gasoline over his head, then he lit himself on fire. Sounds pretty unreal eh? Get this...he never moved a muscle, twitched, screamed or anything let alone crying to mama. You wanna talk about an extreme shift of the ap....have you done that? Can you muster the balls to do that? Shit.  That man was protesting the corrupt government which was implying very demanding and unfair laws on monks. He did this in a  public setting so his intent was voiced clearly to the world. Anyhow your explanation is a very shallow one of them. Also, who cares about magic. That's a skill, that's it. Yes freedom is tangible actually right now. Every moment you have an opportunity to reach freedom. The past is the past and the future is undetermined, what isn't is now. Each passing moment is all that is real. \n\nAsk yourself this....What am I?  Not the logical typical explanation. Really ask what.... am ...I. Intent is a small product not the whole product. Directing intent is great to do stuf and necessary although if you wanna get passed more doings and general skills your acquiring(you kinda make it sound like a video game) dropping the illusoryness of everything is a start. \n\nThere are many sects and ways Buddhists operate. Also if you look at old texts the Buddha himself never declared a religion or even said, I have all the answers. \n\nWith suffering it isn't about getting rid of it. Yes, not having the pressure of the world on us constantly is nice but you cannot approach it as somthing YOU are forcing out. That creates another brick in the wall. \n\nIf you wanna chat more about other misconceptions I'm up for it, but I gotta get some sleep. Have fun!\n\nEdit....Made a mistake. I mixed people up. This guy was protesting unfair treatment to Buddhists not Vietnam War.", "edited": 1649252224.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i3mfkxd", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where to start with how confused you sound. Maybe it&amp;#39;s because your drunk. Alcohol can enhance confidence. I&amp;#39;m not sure. If you believe humans were only ment to suffer and that this form of freedom I speak of us make believe I can&amp;#39;t help you. This conversation reminds me of talking to a devout Christian. I do need to make one obvious correction. You said put any Buddhist in a torture chamber and he will cry to his mommy...lol clearly you haven&amp;#39;t done much research. Ever heard of Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c? This fellow sat in a cross legged position calmly, while his compadre dumped gasoline over his head, then he lit himself on fire. Sounds pretty unreal eh? Get this...he never moved a muscle, twitched, screamed or anything let alone crying to mama. You wanna talk about an extreme shift of the ap....have you done that? Can you muster the balls to do that? Shit.  That man was protesting the corrupt government which was implying very demanding and unfair laws on monks. He did this in a  public setting so his intent was voiced clearly to the world. Anyhow your explanation is a very shallow one of them. Also, who cares about magic. That&amp;#39;s a skill, that&amp;#39;s it. Yes freedom is tangible actually right now. Every moment you have an opportunity to reach freedom. The past is the past and the future is undetermined, what isn&amp;#39;t is now. Each passing moment is all that is real. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself this....What am I?  Not the logical typical explanation. Really ask what.... am ...I. Intent is a small product not the whole product. Directing intent is great to do stuf and necessary although if you wanna get passed more doings and general skills your acquiring(you kinda make it sound like a video game) dropping the illusoryness of everything is a start. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many sects and ways Buddhists operate. Also if you look at old texts the Buddha himself never declared a religion or even said, I have all the answers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With suffering it isn&amp;#39;t about getting rid of it. Yes, not having the pressure of the world on us constantly is nice but you cannot approach it as somthing YOU are forcing out. That creates another brick in the wall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you wanna chat more about other misconceptions I&amp;#39;m up for it, but I gotta get some sleep. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit....Made a mistake. I mixed people up.

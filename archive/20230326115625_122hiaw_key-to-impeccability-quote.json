Men just trying to wrestle themselves above other men, with no actual discussion of how to make magic work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That also, the words of Carlos.  People trying to wrestle themselves above the heads of others.  Instead of learning to change themselves through inner silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we get a lot of angry men visiting here trying to bully others to try to set up some fake sorcery side business, virtually always obsessed with &amp;quot;impeccability&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;the rules of warriors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is, until you actually learn real sorcery and can witness amazing magic, you have no way to be impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You use the daily increase or decrease of your visible and amazing magic, to judge whether an action energized you or drained you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To measure how far up from your toes, your energy has risen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S how you learn to be impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the same for Carlos in the books. He was forcing himself silent using &amp;quot;the right way of walking&amp;quot; and gazing all along.  People just skip that little detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most only read the first 4 books, and aren&amp;#39;t aware he was being taught in secret  using the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow all that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that whatever don Juan told him, was really just to entertain him and keep him around so the real teaching could be done in heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was impossible for him to remember when those first books were written.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/122hiaw/key_to_impeccability_quote/jdqbhet/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1679827072.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_122hiaw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jdvd50s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jdv3qos", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Can I get away with them eventually making their own \"Impeccable ISO 8000 Warrior\" caps?\n\nAnd the head guy sticks an eagle feather in his cap?\n\nI'm trying to think of how the story goes.\n\n\"Westerly Witch Gets A Factory Job\".\n\nWhich only lasts 2 months, because that plague of impeccability spreads through the place like a wild fire.

But unfortunately it seems the you are right that nobody succeeded at this actually. I&amp;#39;m curious whether Carlos mentioned anything related to it in the private classes?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From  &amp;quot;Tails Of Power&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;The strategy of a sorcerer&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Together with the right way of walking,&amp;quot; don Juan went on, &amp;quot;a teacher must teach his apprentice another possibility which is even more subtle; the possibility of acting without believing; without expecting rewards; acting just for the hell of it. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be exaggerating if I told you that the success of a teacher&amp;#39;s enterprise depends on how well and how harmoniously he guides his apprentice in this specific respect.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He explained that in order to help erase personal history, three other techniques were taught. They were: losing self-importance, assuming responsibility, and using death as an adviser. The idea was that without the beneficial effect of those three techniques, erasing personal history would involve the apprentice in being shifty, evasive and unnecessarily dubious about himself and his actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What would have happened if I had taken your recommendations seriously?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You would have gotten to the nagual&amp;quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But would I have gotten to the nagual without a benefactor?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Power provides according to your impeccability,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;If you had seriously used those four techniques, you would&amp;#39;ve stored enough personal power to find a benefactor. You would&amp;#39;ve been impeccable and power would have opened all the necessary avenues.

Despite studying shamanism professionally, and having read the books of Carlos up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita is a good example of how &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; can have different meanings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She puts together bizarre spells that make no sense, but then if she has &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; they work anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some with horrible results for enemies she has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Animals who bothered her get ripped in half, but not at her hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other women consider &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; to be gaining lovers who are much younger than you are by appearing irresistibly beautiful to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; when analyzed from the point of view of being lost in self-identification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to be &amp;quot;powerful&amp;quot; up at the blue line on our J curve. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In ordinary reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s better to try to understand &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; far off at the other end, when you&amp;#39;re trying to align the assemblage point of your physical body to that of you energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over there, &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; is when you can do it on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not having power is when you have to struggle so hard, it&amp;#39;s really awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But either way you can still do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you learn the most, when it&amp;#39;s such hard work that it&amp;#39;s totally awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/171saon/is_personal_power_related_to_the_life_situation/k3ud8g0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1696680788.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_171saon", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "l2ms8br", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "soraygoular", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1714874688.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k3uw8ns", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_5ycfgl0d", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Here after some time, as like everything else knowledge isn't free either and we pay the price with the time, I now realize I actually had a big ego, although it wasn't as bad as other I see daily but it actually was not no eto either, since i did self pity quite significantly.

You are such a rock now, i said you shouldn't even pity yourself, and she was confused she said then who should we pity if not others nor even ourselves?

You need to learn more about it every day and night.\nLike here I was complaining about doing certain things and not receiving, i was doing not for the sake of doing but because i was caring about myself otherwise i wouldn't be sad about what i did, a sorcerer never regrets. A sorcerer chooses their actions precisely and strategically. A sorcerer doesn't nag, doesn't pity, doesn't live like an average man.\n\nI had said many things in the initial writings and it seemed no one actually had a good answer whilst the answers were simple.\nLike why do people with bigger egos have better lives? The thing is that it's correct that ego is like a spectrom but as long as there is ego/self importance you would bot be able to free it's encapsulated energy. The mistake i made was i thought having less ego releases energy, but this is a matter of absolute, you either have ego or not, and if you have you lose your energy to maintain the ego.\n\nI wanted to know why people with high amounts of sex live a better life, the thing is that sex doesn't have to do much with that, it is more about not being able to get into second attention as explained by Don Juan.\n\nAlthough i have to admit here that living better or worse lives is just a matter of having an egoistic view of the world labeling everything as either being good or bad in regards to our own beliefs or I'd better say description/inventory.\n\nYou might have experienced some real mind blowing events, usually emotionally negative which makes you question all things? Can you remember that moment? All of a sudden you feel careless. That's where our self reflection is shattered. If all you seek is tonal related you better never consider sorcery, for sure there are ways in which you could leverage sorcery for tonal goals, but I'd suggest going for a tonal alternative way since you probably never get enough energy to use it this way\n\nThe other thing is thag having more personal power doesn't necessarily always have to do with utilizing it. There are many people who have an extraordinary amount of talent but not utilizing it, either not knowing how or not being aware of their own talent. Same is for personal power, it helps to loosen up the assemblage point for sure but as long as you don't have a clear connection with the sprit/intent your power is useless weather it's a lot or nothing.

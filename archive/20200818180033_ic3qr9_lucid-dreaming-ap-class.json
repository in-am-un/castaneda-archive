I felt in my core that it\u2019s intention was against me, and that I had done something I shouldn\u2019t have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next part is kinda foggy, but I think I directed my intent to stopping it, and come characters from the dream went to get him.. but I don\u2019t remember :/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry for kinda rambling, but it was interesting to dip my toes more into it, as the other times the lucid dreams had been more superficial... this one kinda, but it feels like laying the foundation for what\u2019s to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think my issue as of now is to enter a lucid dream (although today I kinda did bc of a weird dream character whose vibes were totally off, and I confronted it as an IOB in disguise. It felt like the both of us knew, and I remembered the pinky techniche to see energy... but my attention was fading, probably bc I got too excited, and I didn\u2019t get to stablishing the dream either \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Which brings me to my second point-&amp;gt;), and stabilizing my dreams.. as I end up going with the currents, but I\u2019ll get there anyway&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it\u2019s a great idea ...How would you go about the class?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ic3qr9/lucid_dreaming_ap_class/g239xp7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1597836759.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ic3qr9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ic3qr9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g251s0t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "monkeyguy999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1597868386.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g234ia4", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_14w1ssx0", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "This is the problem.\nHe uses opposite words than others and different meanings.\nTo me a lucid dream is just that.

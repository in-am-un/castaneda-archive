[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "A little background about my experience with Castaneda: I read the first book a while back, subscribed to this sub, then recently I read the Art of Dreaming and Taisha Abelar's book, the Sorcerer's Crossing. I've done half a dozen dark room gazings with not much success. It's fun, though. And I started doing recapitulation breathing and head movements during daily meditation about a month ago after reading Taisha's book. I haven't gotten to writing recapitulation lists yet, but the basic head movements have brought back a lot of intense moments I hadn't thought about in years, so it was encouraging. I felt like I had regained some lost energy and felt more creative when practicing music.\nAbout ten days ago I had a lucid dream. I found myself walking in my childhood neighborhood outside my old house. The setting clued me into the fact that I was dreaming. I made an attempt to explore the dream to see  if I could detect a scout or inorganic being energy. I walked up to three men who I believed were brothers. They were wearing matching sweaters and bowties. One was blue, one was green, and one was red. They had a bowtie symbol on the chest of their sweaters, so I figured it was important. The red one also had black and white checkered trim so I felt he was the leader. I greeted them and remarked how neat it was that we were all dreaming. They agreed, and then I saw another trio that looked like them approaching so I kept walking on my way because they were having a meeting. I pointed at some lamp posts and mailboxes to see their energy and they would morph or change, so that was cool. I continued walking and then a woman with brown hair was walking beside me. She kind of looked like the actress Illeana Douglas from the movie Stir of Echoes (the psychic sister), but also she maybe got chubbier or her hair became curly at different times when I looked at her. I said something about how cool is was to be conscious in a dream and she agreed, but I don't remember if we spoke about anything else. \nThen I saw a big clock like the one from the Marshall Field's logo. It was very out of place so I pointed at it to see the energy and it transformed into all sorts of different shapes and clocks. Then I woke up in my childhood bedroom and frantically wrote down my dream with pencil and paper, trying to get all the details down. A moment later my dead father walked into the room to tell me he signed me up for karate lessons and to tell me not to worry about the cost, because it was a deal. I told him that was cool because I wanted to learn. Then he left to take my younger sister back to school. At this time I realized I was in another dream due to a false awakening, because my dad is dead in real life and my sister graduated years ago. I haven't lived in that house in over a decade or seen it in more than five years.\nUpon waking for real I wrote it down on my phone, and I wondered what it all meant. I was so stoked. The changing clock made me thing it was a scout or some kind. I remembered Taisha did karate from her book, so I tried to Google a photo of her to see if she was the woman from the neighborhood. Unfortunately there were barely any photos of her, but I did find an article from Salon from 2007 about Carlos' \"dark legacy.\" I had read a critique of his anthropological methods before, but didn't pay it any mind, because the ideas are about more than academic methods. The Salon article troubled me, though, because it felt like I went from my first meaningful lucid dream with inorganic beings that was totally exciting to a slap of reality calling the validity of all of this into question. Was Carlos the real deal or just another California cult dude looking to bone 20 year olds? Was Don Juan even real? But the dream was so intense! \nThen I started doubting my earlier excitement. Maybe the three sweater guys were just like idk Alvin and the Chipmunks with bowties, and maybe the karate was because I watched that Cobra Kai show on netflix the day before. It was disheartening.\nSo now my questions:\n1. Has anyone else encountered these three brothers or a bowtie symbol in dreaming? I know Don Juan said talking about your dream content could be silly, but maybe someone has had a similar experience?\n2. Did Taisha ever do dreaming techniques or was she only a stalker sorcerer? Could she or one of the other witches have appeared in my dream? \n3. Was that clock energy possibly a scout? Did it turn into my dead dad to send me a message?\n4. Is it common to have a breakthrough followed by something that challenges your belief in this path? I'm trying to regain my excitement for recapitulation and darkroom practices. Self-pity is a waste, I know.\n5. Any other thoughts? I'm sorry if this isn't the right approach to things, but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since it happened. I even tried other symbolism ideas like maybe the brothers were the three planets in conjunction or something, idk. Any help or guidance would be appreciated.

Could be they were already obligated to Lowell Bean, but I was too young to pay attention to stuff like that.\n\nAnthropologists got to study them one at a time, although they weren't \"faithful\" in the long run.\n\nI ran into Taisha twice over the years, once going to the same tournament she writes about, in Japan.\n\nI was also in Carlos' private classes, and knew all of the players.\n\nHe was in fact the real thing.\n\nAnd Carol Tiggs too. She pushed me into a tunnel under the floor!\n\nI still go back there, to this day.\n\nCholita's not a big fan of Carol, but one thing is for sure.  She had the energy, and Carlos was able to make  use of it.\n\nCholita (a witch Carlos gave to me for protecton) likes Florinda most.  But she also likes Taisha, and she was given a copy of that book we now have, way back in 97 or 96.\n\nAs for Carol's sorcery knowledge, it might be the normal situation for a double woman to be more about the energy a male nagual needs.\n\nNot all are super active, but all have the energy.\n\nThat dream you had is a classic IOB dream.\n\nI wish you'd find your hands though.\n\nUnless you find your hands, you can be fooling yourself by turning ordinary dreams into lucid ones.\n\nIf you get used to pretending, like everyone else, you won't conquer dark room gazing.\n\nAnd, you want to generate a certain kind of energy that the IOBs like, in order to assure they'll show up.\n\nLooking at the hands, and then deliberately at an object, is what they need.\n\nHowever, you did so much in that dream, it doesn't seem like a problem.\n\nYou probably picked up enough dark energy to move your assemblage point at least enough to find colors.\n\nAs for your explanations about what you saw, yes!\n\nThat's how sorcery works.\n\nYou're looking at something which is only \"partially\" there.\n\nNaturally it's influenced by everything you thought or heard lately.\n\nYou have to give up the normal view of reality.\n\nEVERYTHING is real in sorcery.\n\nEverything you actually perceive.  But not stuff you make up to get attention.\n\n\\&gt; Has anyone else encountered these three brothers or a bowtie symbol in dreaming?\n\nThose have only your own energy behind them.\n\nAnd it's likely only a single IOB projecting all 3.  Maybe from elsewhere too.\n\nIf you got 2 more people to try to see them,  they'd have the energy of 3 behind them.\n\nOthers might see them.\n\nIf you got 1 billion people to try to see them, they'd become easy to see.\n\nIt's how it all works.\n\nDon't classify things as real or  unreal, if you want to make progress.\n\nClassify things as \"I saw it!\", and \"I didn't see anything.\"\n\n\"I saw it\" is always \"real\".\n\nMy witch friend Cholita and her demon Minx even made a copy of our house, to play in.\n\nI posted about that somewhere. It was spectacular!\n\nI go in there at least once a week these days.\n\nIt has just the energy of us 3, and yet I spent 2 or 3 hours in there last night.\n\nIt's a dream world which  retains lucidity the whole time you are there, and from which  there is no threat of waking up, as there is in lucid dreaming.\n\nCholita's been troubled the last week, and she was more friendly in there than I've seen in a long while.\n\nCarlos' compound in LA has a similar copy of their house, and Taisha writes about it in her latest book.\n\nOf course Taisha is  a skilled dreamer!  You have her new book.\n\nI've even run into her in waking dreaming.  Can't say for sure it's her, but it sure seemed like it at the time.  I even went back and forth to where she was located, to make sure.\n\nFlo and Taisha were there.\n\nThe division between stalkers and dreamers is over rated.\n\nThe best stalking is done to hold the position of the assemblage point, after it moves by using waking dreaming.\n\nPeople get confused and think stalking is tricking other people.\n\nThat's because there's no one out there working to actually learn. They just like to pretend.\n\nSo we get this distorted idea of what sorcery should be.\n\nBest to refer back to all of the books, and ignore what's popular among people who are too lazy to learn to get silent.\n\n\\&gt; Was that clock energy possibly a scout? Did it turn into my dead dad to send me a message?\n\nProbably.  But forget about the message. They don't interact that way.\n\nThey aren't \"ghouls\", even if they look human.\n\n\\&gt; Is it common to have a breakthrough followed by something that challenges your belief in this path?\n\nYes.  You get attacked for magic.\n\nI don't know how it works.\n\nBut the nights I have the most amazing experiences, the next day one of the angry invaders to this subreddit, starts acting up.\n\nOr two...\n\nConsider yourself lucky!\n\nIt's petty tyrant practice.\n\nThe rule is, if you do your best, you get a reward later.\n\nIf you get dragged into the mud with them, it harms your progress.\n\nThe reaction is immediate, if you practice dark room gazing.\n\nYou get to see how you handled them, that very night!\n\nMinus over eating, fussing with your wife,  getting in trouble at work, exceeding 4 drinks that day, or consuming more than 50mg of THC.\n\nIf you keep it clean, you get feedback in the dark room.\n\nI hope you continue. You clearly have an IOB interested.\n\nWe could use more.\n\nSharing is no fun.\n\nOnce you can find an IOB (on a puff of color),  you can rapidly accelerate your learning.\n\nThey will teach you by example.  Appearing her and there at the right moment.\n\nGazing at them rapidly moves the assemblage point.\n\nI have a heck of a time on nights my IOB doesn't show up.\n\nShe's stubborn.  \n\nWants me to do specific movements she taught me, or she plays hard to get.\n\nBut Cholita recently gave me another one.  A strange creature it is. I use it to go \"fishing\" on my bedroom floor. \n\nThere's a technique in the posts to put 5 inches of water on your floor, so you can move your fingers around and catch a fish (iob).\n\nOnce you find colors, give it a try. It's reliable!\n\nWe know, you can have as many as 3 IOBs.  \n\nMore than that, we don't yet know.", "edited": 1611187363.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gk0523c", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Was Carlos the real deal or just another California cult dude looking to bone 20 year olds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mikhail D did an excellent job debunking the debunkers.

But she also likes Taisha, and she was given a copy of that book we now have, way back in 97 or 96.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for Carol&amp;#39;s sorcery knowledge, it might be the normal situation for a double woman to be more about the energy a male nagual needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all are super active, but all have the energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That dream you had is a classic IOB dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish you&amp;#39;d find your hands though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you find your hands, you can be fooling yourself by turning ordinary dreams into lucid ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get used to pretending, like everyone else, you won&amp;#39;t conquer dark room gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, you want to generate a certain kind of energy that the IOBs like, in order to assure they&amp;#39;ll show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at the hands, and then deliberately at an object, is what they need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, you did so much in that dream, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You probably picked up enough dark energy to move your assemblage point at least enough to find colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your explanations about what you saw, yes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how sorcery works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re looking at something which is only &amp;quot;partially&amp;quot; there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally it&amp;#39;s influenced by everything you thought or heard lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to give up the normal view of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING is real in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything you actually perceive.  But not stuff you make up to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Has anyone else encountered these three brothers or a bowtie symbol in dreaming?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those have only your own energy behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s likely only a single IOB projecting all 3.  Maybe from elsewhere too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you got 2 more people to try to see them,  they&amp;#39;d have the energy of 3 behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others might see them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you got 1 billion people to try to see them, they&amp;#39;d become easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how it all works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t classify things as real or  unreal, if you want to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Classify things as &amp;quot;I saw it!&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t see anything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I saw it&amp;quot; is always &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My witch friend Cholita and her demon Minx even made a copy of our house, to play in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted about that somewhere. It was spectacular!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go in there at least once a week these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has just the energy of us 3, and yet I spent 2 or 3 hours in there last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dream world which  retains lucidity the whole time you are there, and from which  there is no threat of waking up, as there is in lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s been troubled the last week, and she was more friendly in there than I&amp;#39;ve seen in a long while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos&amp;#39; compound in LA has a similar copy of their house, and Taisha writes about it in her latest book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course Taisha is  a skilled dreamer!  You have her new book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve even run into her in waking dreaming.  Can&amp;#39;t say for sure it&amp;#39;s her, but it sure seemed like it at the time.  I even went back and forth to where she was located, to make sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flo and Taisha were there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The division between stalkers and dreamers is over rated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best stalking is done to hold the position of the assemblage point, after it moves by using waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People get confused and think stalking is tricking other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because there&amp;#39;s no one out there working to actually learn. They just like to pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we get this distorted idea of what sorcery should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best to refer back to all of the books, and ignore what&amp;#39;s popular among people who are too lazy to learn to get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Was that clock energy possibly a scout? Did it turn into my dead dad to send me a message?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably.  But forget about the message. They don&amp;#39;t interact that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;ghouls&amp;quot;, even if they look human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Is it common to have a breakthrough followed by something that challenges your belief in this path?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes.  You get attacked for magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the nights I have the most amazing experiences, the next day one of the angry invaders to this subreddit, starts acting up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or two...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider yourself lucky!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s petty tyrant practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rule is, if you do your best, you get a reward later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get dragged into the mud with them, it harms your progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reaction is immediate, if you practice dark room gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get to see how you handled them, that very night!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minus over eating, fussing with your wife,  getting in trouble at work, exceeding 4 drinks that day, or consuming more than 50mg of THC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep it clean, you get feedback in the dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you continue. You clearly have an IOB interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could use more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sharing is no fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can find an IOB (on a puff of color),  you can rapidly accelerate your learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They will teach you by example.  Appearing her and there at the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing at them rapidly moves the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a heck of a time on nights my IOB doesn&amp;#39;t show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s stubborn.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wants me to do specific movements she taught me, or she plays hard to get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita recently gave me another one.  A strange creature it is. I use it to go &amp;quot;fishing&amp;quot; on my bedroom floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a technique in the posts to put 5 inches of water on your floor, so you can move your fingers around and catch a fish (iob).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you find colors, give it a try. It&amp;#39;s reliable!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know, you can have as many as 3 IOBs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than that, we don&amp;#39;t yet know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l1jz2g/can_anyone_help_interpret_a_lucid_dream_i_had/gk0523c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1611186502.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_l1jz2g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}]

Juan and Techno have concluded, Castaneda fans are too much trouble, being filled with angry inventory and delusions of specialness.  Best to go after the virgins.\n\nAs for this picture, it's all Fancy's doing. It's that pass she designed.\n\nThere's really nothing special about it, except that it selects Tensegrity moves which make body parts glow.\n\nAnd it even sucks in glow from above, to distribute it along the arms.\n\nMakes the torso glow, the arms, the fingers extend to have fibers,  and visible energy moves from the back to the front, in a river of sorts.\n\nWhen it's done, you look down and see your energy body, fibers, tentacles and all.\n\nAt which point, you start losing time.\n\nThat's how I ended up in this situation.\n\nI was trying to stop the world, after doing quite a few of Fancy's pass.  That particular night, each pass was taking 15 minutes.  I couldn't explain why.  A pass should only last 60 seconds or less.\n\nIt's only 11 or so moves.\n\nI'd find myself returning from somewhere I couldn't remember, on move #4.  Or #8.  But I knew enough to know I didn't finish the pass.\n\nThis happens in recapitulation, if you do it 3 hours at a time.\n\nI decided it was not a \"good night\", and went to gain more silence.\n\nSitting up on pillows, trying to stop the world, I glanced up at the ceiling and saw 5 faces.\n\nThey were quite alien looking.  Best I could do in that picture, was get old faces. But these were more like Hollywood Martians.  Entirely white, but completely stable. Boney heads. Or maybe weird hats.\n\nI hadn't seen 5 at once before, at least not who were perfectly stable. I could examine them left to right, and count them.\n\nBehind them was a cave.  Could have been Fancy's world, except I've never seen anyone there but her and Bob.\n\nI didn't know what to do about the 5 beings. They remained so long, it got a bit awkward.\n\nSo I told them, \"Welcome!  I love to have you here!  You can come to our home anytime you like!\"\n\nThen I got the impression, I was indeed inside Fancy's cave, and they were the \"officials\".  Fancy had mentioned me, and they came to check it out.\n\nI reached up to pull one out from the group of 5, thinking I could push and pull on them to gain poltergeist activity.   It somehow gives Fancy the ability to push solid objects.\n\nI had just barely gotten my hand behind the middle being, and started to pull.  But they evaporated like a cloud of smoke.\n\nI heard Cholita talking to me, from inside the room.  She hadn't walked through the door as she usually does. The door was gone.  It seemed like she'd been standing there a while.\n\nThe room had been cut in half, at a diagonal.\n\nI got off the bed and walked into the now open area, to find I was in the \"blue room\".\n\nCholita hasn't found a use for that room yet, so it's empty. But she leaves the window open, in case she has to flee the house and sneak back in weeks later,  when I'm not aware of it.  She's gone up to 3 weeks at a time.  \n\nIn the yard, I saw 5 people standing at a picnic table, arguing. Or looking at something. I couldn't tell.  I said something to them, but they ignored me.  I believe they were waiting for a host.\n\nI heard Cholita call out.  \"I'll be down in an hour or two!\"\n\nI looked up to find, our home now had a second story.  Cholita turned from leaning out the window, back into the house, and I got the impression Minx was just behind her.  They hadn't agreed on what she should wear.\n\nI don't remember any more of that, except that I never went to sleep, and never woke up.\n\nI just got out of bed when it was time to go to work.\n\nI have a vague memory of swishing back to my physical body.\n\nOr maybe, rotating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Random Nightly Activities", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qvtl8sn048161": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qvtl8sn048161.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3d2d3094a5cad9d8428b7296382d4eb45e3a4dc"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qvtl8sn048161.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ed396f8d39a4bc750710661506fc9197251d1e3"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qvtl8sn048161.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3c3144c579f4e8a03ccbac224d6f1e9ecbc9c91"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qvtl8sn048161.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=308a28190ad98da65927f924c4a2315a7e27ca54"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qvtl8sn048161.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ba512e7c4b7db811a7474ee53dca180e63d540"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qvtl8sn048161.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6c7d9360553f30de9c909bb1bd112bec7ae7ba4"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qvtl8sn048161.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5187bc9b212012ff8939d78e7603e093f99ed179"}, "id": "qvtl8sn048161"}}, "name": "t3_k09jrh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ifbjrsH9zkbNJn98rpIEB_kLBg-BHq7FmO4bXheeamE.jpg", "edited": 1606244392.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606239199.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qvtl8sn048161.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5187bc9b212012ff8939d78e7603e093f99ed179\"&gt;A random night when living with Cholita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually made this for Instagram, targeting specific users.

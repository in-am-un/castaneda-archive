We haven't identified any tensegrity moves which look anything at all like Howard's \"Choi Lai Fut\".  The most common style in some vast regions of China, and very sparse in techniques.\n\nAs far as I've been able to tell, Carlos taught us 10 times as many different movements as are contained in all of Choi Lai Fut, and not a one is the same as Howard's.\n\nIn fact, the movements Carlos gave us seem to have several \"themes\" going on in them.\n\nOne theme is simply to get you to use all of your muscles, and all of your joints, daily.  To keep you in \"tip-top\" shape, as sorcerers need to do.  Pain is a very bad thing if you are trying to reach silent knowledge.  Our goal.  And so Tensegrity uses the power of daily repetition, to transform yourself over time.  People have mostly forgotten you can do that.  They tend to exercise for reasons other than \"personal transformation\".\n\nSo a good example of just trying to keep you in tip-top shape is the leg one where you toss it up as high as you can in the front, like a kungfu dancer trying to kick a hat off their head. And then you toss the other leg behind you as far up as it can go.  And then switch sides.\n\nThat does in fact \"uncrust\" energy from the inside of the luminous shell and if you reach silent knowledge and have the advantage of dim light, you'll see purple sparks fly out as the leg sweeps.\n\nBut mostly it just keeps your leg flexible in those directions.\n\nAnd look at \"running man\". It seems to be designed precisely to move all joints of the legs, in all practical combinations which don't harm you.\n\nAnother goal of the tensegrity is to teach you about the puffs.\n\nI like those movements the most, because they come in very hand later on when you can summon silent knowledge.\n\nI really should explain those last.\n\nMeanwhile, what was stated to be the main goal of Tensegrity, to restore your energy body, was probably the most mysterious to workshop goers back then.  And again, they had the disadvantage of having heard of fake systems which deal with \"energy\" using movements, such as Chi Gung, causing it to be utterly impossible for them to understand what our \"restoring the energy body\" meant.\n\nThey visualized something about as powerful as multi vitamin supplements.\n\nOr some \"flow of chi\".\n\nIt's not anything like that.\n\nYour energy body is your double!  It's sentient, a second version of you which can be in the same room with you and fully visible, and it can even take up a second job for you, thousands of miles away.\n\nAs Elias did.  Living near Mexico City, while working up near the border to Arizona, as a healer.\n\nI'm a little curious as to whether normal people will perceive \"the double\".  But just a tiny shift into the green zone, perhaps half as strong as meditation \"bliss\", is enough to make it fully visible and real.\n\nAnd if you can make it down to the red zone on the J curve a few times, I'd bet you permanently gained the ability to see people's doubles.   Because it's mostly about whether your assemblage point can escape the blue line at all. Once it can, you'll be drawn to move it if someone's double comes around.  A trick don Juan and Genaro used on Carlos, seeing as how Genaro was nearly always in his double.\n\nThose alone will cause it to move if they interact with you.  Cholita used to move mine so far that I was literally ripping up pieces of small Mexican villages while remote viewing her from the sky, trying to catch her in a game of cross continental hide and seek. \n\nStarted when she walked through my solid darkroom wall and poked me with her finger, then took off running down a forest path which materialized in place of the wall.\n\nWe get amazing \"godlike\" powers.  The pity of which is, we have to fight hard in here to help people learn them!\n\nMostly people want to figure out how to steal attention and money, using the magic Carlos brought us. And don't give a damn about who they harm in here, the only place which still has real magic.\n\nRarely does anyone actually want to learn what they claim they want to learn.\n\nBut our \"godlike powers\" are all \"reality manipulation\", so in the end no Mexican Villagers were actually harmed.  And Cholita somehow slipped from my clutched hand.\n\nThus, \"restoring the energy body\" is literally that.  You restore it, and then there's two of you.\n\nOne with INFINITE power, who's totally confused most of the time.  A drunken smart aleck.\n\nAnd one with ultra rationality and purpose.\n\nUsing my powerful double, and my Tonal's rationality, I was able to chase Cholita across 2 continents and finally grab her red handed.  Even if I had to tear up a few adobe buildings.\n\nMy double can do that!\n\nYou get to mix energy between the two of you, and the physical version of you can even \"shrink\" away and travel in the double.\n\nOne has to wonder if \"the Eagle\" didn't deliberately design us with 2 copies, one burdened with painful flesh, in order to create a combination with all the powers the bodiless energy body has.\n\nPlus some purpose.   A \"super probe\".\n\nHow you shrink away the physical matter, we don't know.  But I've done it more times than I can recall.\n\nTensegrity also teaches about deforming our luminous shell, including stretching it into an infinite line or turning yourself into a tree by lowering it 15 feet (\"Two Stories\").\n\nAnd it teaches about the old seers, and how they used and understood awareness.\n\nIt teaches shapeshifting, but you wouldn't notice that until the red zone.\n\nAnd that's probably enough.  Surely there's more.  Carlos used tensegrity like a notepad, to jot down things he remembered from the lineage, which he didn't want to be lost.\n\nEach is a sorcery \"topic\" of importance, which Carlos hid in Tensegrity.\n\nBut how did he \"saturate\" us?\n\nWhat he did, was train our muscles to move in silence.\n\nIn various ways which are extremely useful once you can reach Silent Knowledge.\n\nI realized it just now, before I stopped to write this post. While I was gazing at darkness.\n\nA giant pile of black bubbling smoke puffs swirled up on the right side of the room.\n\nIt was \"proto forms\".\n\nI had triggered a flow of \"knowledge\" from the emanations on the nature of solid matter and \"forms\".\n\nShowing how those were actually illusions.\n\nBut that you could still enjoy them as \"real\".\n\nNo way to get ChatGPT to draw that.  Myself, I'd have to animate it.\n\nIt was puffs of jet black smoke with dark reddish brown edges.\n\nAnd it was easy to see this giant bubbling mass, perhaps 10 feet in diameter and 5 feet tall, try to form into things.  Individual black puffs moved around into position, and a large metal and black stone looking object would begin to look \"real\", as if the smoke had flattened and  solidified into it where needed.\n\nMy hand could alter what it was leaning towards.  So I didn't wait for any to finish, before I swiped it back into bubbling smoke.\n\nBut so could leaning in my shoulder with my elbow raised control it, something I got comfortable doing from a tensegrity move.\n\nThe thing is, any attempt to wave your hands like a movie wizard will fail horribly unless you can maintain astonishing levels of silence.\n\nLevels which could only be stored into physical movements, which had been practiced over and over, thereby training our cerebellum, or \"muscle memory\", but with the silence as a factor in the training.\n\nYour muscle memory has access to everything we are aware of, otherwise we'd be unable to catch a glass falling off a table before we are consciously aware of it.\n\nAnd fighters train their blocks to be automatic.  Until then, they're awkward.\n\nTensegrity teaches the specific movements that you practice, to also be \"silent\".\n\nAnd you can only use those movements which succeeded in learning that, to manipulate silent knowledge. Otherwise it'll weaken from too much mental \"noise\".\n\nFor a silly example, let's say you try to wiggle your nose like the TV witch from the 60s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wd7y9nqrlnrc1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d27d4cb82e0ba1bb80ebd520999634d1c1915a\n\nIt's too much showbiz!  Won't work.\n\nBut if Carlos had included it in a tensegrity form so that you \"got over it\" through repetition, it might indeed work to alter an entire reality right before your eyes.  Because you could do it \"silently\".\n\nAnd not think about Samantha in a bikini from her debut a few years before the TV series.  The first time she wiggled her nose on the silver screen.\n\nYou must retain SILENCE, or the flow of KNOWLEDGE stops.\n\nIt's a very odd situation.\n\nYou silence your mind, remove all attempts to want anything, and the dark sea of awareness reaches out and asks, \"Are you bored or something?  Here, let me show you this wonder!  How about traveling 4000 years back in time in an instant, to land on this beautiful spot in Veracruz?!\"\n\nThat's what Silent Knowledge does from time to time.\n\nWhoever discovered \"seeing\" was likely the greatest inventor in the last 10,000  years.\n\nAnd \"seeing\", or Silent Knowledge, is where you can finally understand why Carlos claimed he had \"saturated\" us.\n\nBecause he did.\n\nHe taught 216 movements of which I learned all but the women's magical passes.\n\nAnd so when I want to physically manipulate some amazing magic manifesting near me, I don't have a shortage of movements to try out.\n\nIn fact I have so many, I can sit there for 30 minutes by accident, playing with the amazing sights.\n\nOnly to completely forget about something as wonderful as Bubbling Proto Forms, a minute after I stopped playing with it using tensegrity arm movements.\n\nIt was literally gone from my memory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How Carlos \"Saturated\" Us", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"wd7y9nqrlnrc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 62, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wd7y9nqrlnrc1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5167b1611fa04da0131a3718dc3f277289e9f4"}, {"y": 125, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wd7y9nqrlnrc1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f1eaccdac02d9088ab412a42a19eae313e86859"}], "s": {"y": 128, "x": 220, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wd7y9nqrlnrc1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d27d4cb82e0ba1bb80ebd520999634d1c1915a"}, "id": "wd7y9nqrlnrc1"}, "abpvz6hbunrc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abpvz6hbunrc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12093e67b4595c53c6345a00bf23394fb74fdc8"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abpvz6hbunrc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=632793b64382cc6f6df43fb2fcc31e4fc8091536"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abpvz6hbunrc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ef29eba6b14d5dece0686c499f2a5348af74d1"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abpvz6hbunrc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16102fd2802cc22e1add177209794ac0799555b6"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abpvz6hbunrc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0b80e00c64e09365e6e741fd3a690c0802ec90b"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abpvz6hbunrc1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78411ae576e8573bf67fd0f5322f5e32981a6ae5"}, "id": "abpvz6hbunrc1"}}, "name": "t3_1brx601", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Q8nBBDldFprWSFoCHg2JF0WZ_j7sXF5YgK1eXtE4h_E.jpg", "edited": 1711888528.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1711845355.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/abpvz6hbunrc1.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=78411ae576e8573bf67fd0f5322f5e32981a6ae5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/abpvz6hbunrc1.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=78411ae576e8573bf67fd0f5322f5e32981a6ae5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen this several times, and always forget to post about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During private classes, Carlos said something odd about all of the Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People hadn&amp;#39;t a clue what it was yet, and some speculated it was just Howard Lee&amp;#39;s Kung Fu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes no sense at all.

Won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if Carlos had included it in a tensegrity form so that you &amp;quot;got over it&amp;quot; through repetition, it might indeed work to alter an entire reality right before your eyes.  Because you could do it &amp;quot;silently&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not think about Samantha in a bikini from her debut a few years before the TV series.  The first time she wiggled her nose on the silver screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must retain SILENCE, or the flow of KNOWLEDGE stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very odd situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You silence your mind, remove all attempts to want anything, and the dark sea of awareness reaches out and asks, &amp;quot;Are you bored or something?  Here, let me show you this wonder!  How about traveling 4000 years back in time in an instant, to land on this beautiful spot in Veracruz?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what Silent Knowledge does from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whoever discovered &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; was likely the greatest inventor in the last 10,000  years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, or Silent Knowledge, is where you can finally understand why Carlos claimed he had &amp;quot;saturated&amp;quot; us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He taught 216 movements of which I learned all but the women&amp;#39;s magical passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so when I want to physically manipulate some amazing magic manifesting near me, I don&amp;#39;t have a shortage of movements to try out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact I have so many, I can sit there for 30 minutes by accident, playing with the amazing sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only to completely forget about something as wonderful as Bubbling Proto Forms, a minute after I stopped playing with it using tensegrity arm movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was literally gone from my memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c812fe20-6005-11ea-a726-0e9c39b3b989", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "1brx601", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1brx601/how_carlos_saturated_us/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1brx601/how_carlos_saturated_us/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1711845355.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kxfxbav", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1711914666.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1brx601", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I was a bit confused in that post.  We were just barely trying to come to grips with how many different copies of us there are.\n\nAnd it was years before any of us had seen those sights ourselves, enough times to be clear on what's what.\n\nI posted that, to encourage people to stop pretending and start doing.  So they could see for themselves.\n\nI'd already encountered people's doubles, \"in the flesh\". Cholita regularly visited me in her double. And I'd run into 2 or 3 out in the real world, over the last 20 years.\n\nI believe Techno tried to warn me that post wasn't accurate,  in some of the comments. But it was years ago.\n\nHowever, the situation is a lot more complicated than \"energy body = double\", or the opposite.\n\nNow,  this is me making a feeble excuse for screwing up in that post.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure it'll be convincing. Or at least, show why the whole topic is complicated.\n\nWe have 2 blobs of awareness, given to us by the Eagle.\n\nIt's actually a single blob, but some of it \"collided with the intent of this world\", and took up residence in a flesh body.\n\nStuck in three groups of internal organ pairs which we call the \"pouches\".\n\nBut either those internal organs could only hold half of our total awareness, or half refused to participate in being stuck in the flesh, and decided to roam around infinity freely. That's your dreamer.\n\nIt's a good thing we got subdivided like that, because now we have \"reason\" and \"purpose\" in our tonal half, beaten into us by the hellish pains of being in a very needy flesh body.\n\nIf we'd never been in one, we wouldn't make a very good \"specialized form of inorganic being\" when we die.  It wouldn't have any purpose or reason!\n\nSo we ended up with 2 \"portions\", which the books loosely call, \"the tonal, and the Nagual\".\n\nThat \"nagual\" is tricky because it's like the word \"love\".\n\n\"Love\" is actually 10 different concepts (parental love, mating love, loyalty love, etc.) all mashed together for social brainwashing purposes.\n\n\"The Nagual\" is just as bad.  For years I had to keep telling Cholita not to refer to Carlos as \"The Nagual\", because it was very confusing and I had no idea who or what she was talking about.  The women in private classes were told to only refer to Carlos as \"The Nagual\", by Florinda and Taisha.\n\nThe men, not so much. Only the \"butt kisser men\" like Felix, called Carlos \"The Nagual\". Felix was hoping to cash in some day.\n\nSo I guess it might seem clear that there are just 2 of \"us\".\n\nHalf is your \"tonal awareness\", often equated with the physical body (except that there's a dreaming attention view of it which has tentacles as in the picture).\n\nAnd half is your double. Your Nagual.  \n\nAs don Juan explained, your double travels further and further from you as you grow older, with the connection only being a faint line, just before it severs and you die.\n\nAlso a big contradiction over what we know, because in fact,  there is no space. No physical matter.  And no time.\n\nThose are side effects of the emanations being reliable, for a given \"assemblage point position\".\n\nThat creates the illusion of physical space.\n\nIn truth, none of your awareness can ever leave the sealed luminous shell it was place into, when you were created.\n\nThe furthest your \"double\" can get away from you, is less than 8 feet. And that has it smashed up against the inside of the luminous shell.  \"Crusted\" there as Carlos described it.\n\nSo if all of the energy of the \"double\" is stuck inside, where is it?\n\nIt becomes visible during darkroom, and you can see with your own eyes where it is.\n\nLike in this Tensegrity pass (I hope the link is active):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\nAt 5 min 22 sec they spot a puff of their energy body up in the air, leap up, pull it down, and stuff it on a pouch.\n\nWhich FORCES your energy body to \"mix\" with your tonal awareness.\n\nTo get it used to the idea of trusting you, and \"merging\" somewhere.\n\nThe problem is,  if it gets too close to those \"pouches\" on the torso, it absorbs the memories of the tonal energy stuck in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust as, your dreamer can return to you and get too close, and suddenly you know where it's been and what it was doing.\n\nDon Juan and Genaro discussed that in the books.\n\nAnd it's a common occurrence at advanced stages of darkroom.\n\nYou suddenly believe you just got back from somewhere important, but you've been in the same dark room for an hour. So it's impossible.\n\nBut it's not. That's just the memories of your double, being available to your tonal because some of its energy mixed with that of the physical body.\n\nThe same happens in reverse. We send some tonal energy into sleeping dreams, in order to practice 4 gates dreaming.\n\nBut without it, it's just an ordinary dream. And thus, the #1 instruction of 4 gates dreaming:  Find your hands.\n\nIf you don't, then there's not enough tonal energy to count it as \"dreaming\" and it won't work.  4 gates dreaming is a very precise process needing us to follow the instructions.\n\nI don't recommend it, because it's better to lure your double out into the real world, then to go into a dream and guide it out.\n\nNow here's where things get complicated.\n\nWhen you send tonal awareness into a dream, you only send a very small portion.\n\nPerhaps a puff the size of a baseball.\n\nLikewise, when you scoop up a purple puff, a visible piece of your energy body, it's still just part of the whole.\n\nI estimate we have 8 soccer ball sized \"puffs\" of both.\n\nMaking our total awareness around 16 soccer ball's worth of pure awareness.\n\nAnd it only takes a SINGLE puff, to be sentient.\n\nSo that your \"double\" might just be one puff, with the rest of his bulk \"crusted\" inside your luminous shell.\n\nEngaged in other dreams, at the same time.\n\nOr your double could be composed of 4 puffs at times. That's possibly when you have infinite power in dreams.\n\nWe \"form the energy body\" by getting the uncrusted stuff to enjoy clinging to our torso, because we also eliminate the internal dialogue, and he doesn't pick up as much negativity from us.\n\nNormally we're so self-pity filled, our double can't stand to get too close to us.\n\nSo it's perfectly possible to \"restore your energy body\", and visibly perceive a \"blue all of energy\" clinging to your torso, and yet some portion of your energy body is running around elsewhere, having fun.\n\nWorse, you can scoop up a purple puff, and using the \"Pandora's Box\" pass, which Carlos played up as \"practical magic\" before he showed it to us in private classes, and you can form it into a living being.\n\nLike the rabbit with Japanese teeth who looked like WW2 \"Tojo\" to Carlos.\n\nWhich don Juan manufactured to show Carlos what \"creativity\" is.\n\nCarlos was equating manipulation of first attention physical elements, with being \"creative\".\n\nSo don Juan pulled a rabbit out of thin air,  as a joke, showing him sorcerers actually do \"create\" things.\n\nAnd experimenting with that magical pass (which is in here if you want it), I manufactured a Zombie assistant.\n\nWhich hung around for 2 full days!\n\nNot at all surprising, except for it not going away in just a few hours.\n\nYou can in fact, even summon or \"form\" 3 of your \"doubles\".\n\nI posted about it in here long ago.\n\nYou can have 3 copies of yourself, standing right there, fully visible during darkroom.\n\nIt's because it only takes a portion, perhaps at least 1/8th, of your energy body to make a sentient being.\n\nSo that you can \"restore your energy body, but still have your double running around somewhere else.\n\nOr you can \"restore it\", and your double is right there, lending you an extra arm if you need it.\n\nThe way Pablito tried to trick Carlos with his \"3rd hand attack\".\n\nAnd if all this isn't confusing enough, your tonal can completely shrink away, meaning the physical body becomes irrelevant, and you can travel off in your energy body.\n\nAs your double.\n\nNot vaguely.\n\nYou literally leap through a solid wall, or jump into outer space at billions of light years per second, to land on another world.\n\nShirt, boots, and all.\n\nThere is a mistake in the original post, but it would take a lot more than what I just wrote now, to explain all the details.\n\nAnd won't do anyone any good in the long run.\n\nYou need to see all this with your own eyes.\n\nThen maybe you can be the one explaining it to us.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kxfxbav", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a bit confused in that post.

3 of your &amp;quot;doubles&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted about it in here long ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can have 3 copies of yourself, standing right there, fully visible during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s because it only takes a portion, perhaps at least 1/8th, of your energy body to make a sentient being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you can &amp;quot;restore your energy body, but still have your double running around somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can &amp;quot;restore it&amp;quot;, and your double is right there, lending you an extra arm if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way Pablito tried to trick Carlos with his &amp;quot;3rd hand attack&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if all this isn&amp;#39;t confusing enough, your tonal can completely shrink away, meaning the physical body becomes irrelevant, and you can travel off in your energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not vaguely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You literally leap through a solid wall, or jump into outer space at billions of light years per second, to land on another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shirt, boots, and all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a mistake in the original post, but it would take a lot more than what I just wrote now, to explain all the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And won&amp;#39;t do anyone any good in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to see all this with your own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then maybe you can be the one explaining it to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1brx601/how_carlos_saturated_us/kxfxbav/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1711914666.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1brx601", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kxe3r0b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kxdfjz7", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I do that.\n\nAlthough I blow the magic dust.\n\nCarol Tiggs is right!\n\n\"Tube blowing\" does in fact have effects on the double, and can manipulate the emanations.\n\nBut all Carol got at Sochi was criticism.\n\nNo wonder she never attended a workshop again.

And it was obvious in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;College level hazing sex seems to almost be mandatory in that teaching situation (the lineages).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we get to ditch those!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1brx601", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1brx601/how_carlos_saturated_us/kxenr2y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1711898261.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1711898261.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kxefsle", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TotallyNormalChips", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kxe2184", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_280ic4ot", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I don't care about Buddhists!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kxefsle", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care about Buddhists!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1brx601", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1brx601/how_carlos_saturated_us/kxefsle/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1711895244.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1711895244.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kxe2184", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kxdcouz", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Magic is the strongest pull away from the blue line of the J curve.

But you get used to it.](https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5246c2cf8272418ca74fa4e59110881ebc49cbbc)\n\nOne of my inorganic being friends was teaching me how to \"sneak through the cracks\" visible in the second attention, when it becomes filled with dreaming.\n\nI wish I could remember which!  I've had so many visitors over the years.\n\nCould have been Fancy.  But could also have been Lily, the entity belonging to someone else who calls it \"Ren\".\n\nWhich means Lily in Japanese.  Quite a coincidence!  Neither of us know about the other's name when we came up with one.\n\nI just called her \"Lily\" because she materialized sitting on a Lily pad in a calm pond.  She smiled at me and I said, \"I suppose there's nothing else to do but call you Lily!\"\n\nAt any rate, she taught me \"how to leave the dark room\".\n\nMeaning, through the wall.  Breaking all the laws of physics as you go.\n\nShe finished what she promised, and I haven't seen her since.\n\nBut it could have been Fancy!  It's just that, Fancy doesn't really like me to leave the darkroom. She wants to play in the \"Shift Below\". The DEEP red zone that happens when your assemblage point is at the very bottom, but hasn't yet begun to go under, so it can come up the front.\n\nThat's shapeshifting territory supreme!\n\nShe gives me the power to manufacture perfectly real dream scenes from the pieces of my energy body, which Tensegrity \"redeploys\".\n\nWe all forget that Tensegrity scoops and grabs those puffs of visible energy all around you, and places them on the \"energetic pouches\" of our torso.\n\nOur community never bothered to learn to be silent, so no one realized all tensegrity moves are fully visible.\n\nAnd that energy you scoop using something like unbending intent long form, is not only visible, but it has \"details\" inside the puffs you scoop up.\n\nSo a \"calming\" Tensegrity move will place those on the energy pouches, of which there are 3, and leave it there.\n\nIt builds up to form that \"blue ball of energy\" that the new seers prefer for the form of their energy body.\n\nThey call it, \"impersonal\".\n\nMan, what a bunch of snobs...\n\nI say, \"Let's get personal!\"\n\nThe old seers didn't go for that kind of snobbery.  They wanted to shapeshift into a Werejaguar, and go chase someone.\n\nOr something.  Your ally will be happy to become \"prey\" for you, if you want to exercise your Jaguar form.\n\nAs Cholita's ally \"Minx\" told me, \"I'm too fast.  Don't worry, you can never catch me.\"\n\nA challenge!\n\nSo Fancy prefers that sort of activity, and using the \"Pandoras Box\" pass Carlos showed in private classes, with promises he was finally going to demonstrate real magic right in our faces.  But it never got into workshops. It was largely considered a \"dud\". No one saw anything.\n\nAt least, not at this level of \"vibration\".\n\nI never liked that term, but Carol uses it in the inspirational quote that follows.  Workshop lecture notes.\n\nSo Fancy taught me to shapeshift by first teaching me to build freeways above my dark room.\n\nThey were absolutely realistic, gigantic freeway over passes streatching over the beautiful mountains north of Tokyo.  Or maybe north east is more accurate.\n\nFancy is a little rough, so I didn't feel bad asking  her to find one of those blue diesel trucks all small businesses use for transportation there, drive it up the top of the overpass, and pretend the breaks went out.\n\nI wanted her to more all the way from the top of the overpass down into the forest, at a cleaning where I would be standing so I could watch the whole thing.\n\nI added, \"And die horribly in a fiery crash.\"\n\nFancy said, \"Ok.\"\n\nAnd she did.\n\nSeveral times in fact.\n\nBut IOBs get even.  You'll find out about that.  Later when I asked her to show  me how to summon the moth dust so I could \"see\" humans as mushrooms, a trick my other entity Fairy had made famous in the books as \"Little Smoke\", she agreed.\n\nI watched the darkness for the dust from the wing of the moth to materialize, and all I got was a dense blast of diesel smoke.\n\nAt any rate, Fancy likes to play \"down there\" in the deep red zone, so I'm assuming Lily taught me the running trick.\n\nBut I posted it, it's in the subreddit somewhere.\n\nThe trick of running faster than is humanly possibly is well documented among native americans.\n\nThey had something called a \"scout\", or \"runner\", who was used to deliver important messages for the tribe.\n\nThere's a book by a well known anthropologist from back in the late 1800s (as I recall).  He describes how he ran into one of those indian \"runners\" whom both he and his wife knew well.\n\nBut he was leaving on a stagecoach, galloping at high speed to the next small city in the route.\n\nThe horses ran as fast as they could for many hours.\n\nWhen he arrived, he found out the indian runner had already been here, and left.\n\nSo it is possible to do that technique.\n\nIn the case of Lily's version, you \"ran between the cracks\".\n\nSo you didn't actually step on every spot along the way.  It was sort of like \"skipping\" through the second attention fog.\n\nI'm bringing this up, because I was trying to figure out why I usually end up with my feet in water, when doing the running man series.\n\nI'm sure it got mentioned, but I certainly forgot about it.\n\nCarlos was dying at the time.  Everyone knew it.\n\nAt night, he was kidnapped by Little Smoke and Devil's Weed, who brought him to part of their world where the floor was covered in water.\n\nI've seen that many times.  In my case, it's not really deep enough to drown in. And I don't mind wading around.\n\nBut Carlos seemed not to want his feet to get wet.  People from the inner circle said he had even taken to wearing socks all night.\n\nAt night in bed he saw a little blue dot land on his big toe, as if it were a tiny butterfly.  He \"knew\" that if it didn't stop \"burning\" on his toe, he'd burn with the fire from within and be forced to leave.\n\nThe witches were very worried.  It wasn't a pretend worry.  I spoke to Taisha.\n\nNaturally at my level, it all seemed like fantastic pretending. I hoped it was all true, but no one who hasn't moved their assemblage point far can really believe any of it.  And you have to move it far over and over again, before you realize it's all 100% true.\n\nI said to Taisha, \"But why is everyone worried?  Isn't that a good thing, if Carlos burns with the fire from within?\"\n\nAll Taisha said, with a horrified look on her face was, \"Oohhh Noooooo!!!!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Carlos was jumping from rock to rock in the inorganic being's world at night, trying to avoid falling into the water.\n\nThe inorganic beings were pulling on his illness like a thread, trying to \"unravel\" Carlos, so he would have to stay with them.\n\nLittle Smoke later told me, \"We tried to save him!\"\n\nBut Carlos didn't want to be saved, so he became a \"Running Man\" each night, trying to avoid having his feet splash into the water below at the bottom of the inorganic being's realm.\n\nI learned the running man series directly from Carlos and the energy trackers, in private classes.\n\nThere was criticism of it by the gossip faction of private classes, saying Carlos was too weak for Tensegrity, so he came up with some you could do laying down.\n\nMaybe that's true.\n\nBut remember that each Tensegrity movement contains a \"feeling\" the old seers liked to have, deep in dreaming.\n\nAnd not sleeping dreaming.  Those guys could do waking dreaming too, the same way we do with our \"darkroom practice\".  Tensegrity in the dark.\n\nSo if you are absolutely silent, and do the tensegrity forms so perfectly and so smoothly that they \"flow\", your \"muscle memory\" will learn to incorporate the assemblage point movement into how it executes the form.\n\nYour muscle memory is your \"second sentience\".  It can't speak, but it's faster than our tonal consciousness. When a glass begins to fall from the dinner table, it's the muscle memory who saves the day and catches it.\n\nNot our slow tonal awareness.\n\nAnd so if you can \"tap into it\" during Tensegrity, your muscle memory can \"find the feeling of the old seers\", and you'll feel it too.  While doing the form.\n\nIt's the \"Magic\" part of \"Magical Passes\".\n\nAnd it works!  But you MUST be silent.\n\nWhen I do the \"running man series\", I nearly always end up with my feet in several inches of liquid, and I can visibly see it splashing around.\n\nIt's stunning!\n\nExcept, at that level of silence you don't care. It seems normal.\n\nWhen I dangle my feet off the bed, gazing off into the whitish light you can see on surfaces in Heightened Awareness, and do my running man passes, a little river materializes below my feet, flowing through my darkroom.\n\nThe movements splash the water.\n\nKeep all that in mind when you read these quotes from a lecture by Carol Tiggs.\n\nBut the question I want answered is, \"Why is the man running?\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* workshop notes from the all in one collection in the subreddit wiki \\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the lunch break, Carol strolled back in wearing a black dress with what looked like white\n\npictographs of some sort on it. She mounted the platform and walked around the podium\n\nsmiling as she greeted participants and stated her name. Back behind the podium, she took out\n\nher notes, opened her water bottles, and launched off into her lecture.\n\nShe began with a few words about her identity and the 'identity crisis' her and her cohorts were\n\nexperiencing. The issue was one that they had all brought up at the beginning of each lecture.\n\nThey were becoming unknown to themselves.\n\nCarol went on to talk about our being members of western civilization. She said that because we\n\nhave been brought up and socialized as members of western civilization we always place the\n\nblame for things on somebody else. We do not take responsibility for our actions. She said that\n\nthis is the price tag of being at the mercy of energy and awareness other than our own. All of\n\nour social molds have been taken from Bobby, and as a result we have become just like him;\n\npetty, sluggish, lazy and unwilling to take responsibility.\n\nShe talked again about Carlos' recent breakthrough to a new vibratory level and what it meant\n\nfor them. She said the implications were staggering and that they may not be able to formulate\n\nwhat exactly it means for some time, if ever. She said again that vibration is key to everything,\n\nand that they were learning new things about it and its relationship to everything they knew\n\nabout energy and awareness.\n\nCarol then related something that Carlos said to her recently that was the most exquisite thing\n\nshe had ever heard. He had grabbed her by the arm and said very movingly, \"I never thought\n\nI'd live forever . . . let's do it!\"\n\nIt has since become an axiom which guides them.\n\nAfter a short hush and light applause, Carol returned to the subject of the Not-Doing passes.\n\n\"The Running man must be known perfectly,\" she said. \"The energetic fact of the Running Man\n\nis that one is dipping into the fringe, or into the stream, of awareness. The old nagual said that\n\nthe fringe of awareness is attached to the bottom of the luminous cocoon.\"\n\nIt is an ankle-high area around the feet, like a skirt, through which we can dip into the Dark Sea\n\nof Awareness.\n\n\"We have no inventory for energy fields,\" she went on to say. \"They are not part of our\n\nsocialized cognitive system.\"\n\nYou cannot say that you know what it's like to see energy because the possibility does not exist\n\nwithin our cognition. It is outside the uninterrupted flow of our cognitive experience.\n\nCarol said that scientists and physicists were creating all these very complex mathematical\n\nequations to represent something that could not, under any circumstances, be understood\n\nthrough socialized cognitive effort. She said that what they were trying to understand existed\n\nbeneath and behind, between the 'fractions' of, their equations.\n\nWhen, through the practice of not-doing, one experiences a 'lull', the whole works stop. There is\n\nan energetic halt. Carol explained that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico were experts at making\n\npractical use of this 'lull'. She said that it made them move faster. They were able to bring about\n\nthe halt . . . and then run . . . halt . . . run . . . in a place that existed only between the 'fractions'.\n\nPage 1228\n\nThe ancient shamans understood the impetus of people's actions. They knew the Not-Doing of\n\nthings, how to be calm and listen to whatever is said. To take ordinary daily life situations and\n\nturn them around, transforming them into something extraordinary.\n\nReturning to the subject of the Running Man series, Carol said the old nagual maintained that\n\none had to be able to perform it to perfection. He said that in teaching them to perform the\n\npasses for Not-Doing he was showing them how to begin stirring the shallow stream of\n\nawareness in order to start a new generation of the glow of awareness.\n\nThe passes for Not-Doing actually stir the shallow stream of awareness, our only avenue to the\n\nDark Sea. She explained, like a medical professor, that in performing the Running Man and On\n\nthe Run series we were bringing energy and awareness up, splashing it onto our legs and\n\nintentionally bringing it even further up the body to our vital centers (the liver, gallbladder,\n\nspleen, pancreas, V-spot, and womb for women). She stressed that this progressive movement\n\nof energy and awareness upward had to be accompanied by a sense of increased discipline and\n\nbehavioral change.\n\nCarol went on to discuss...", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How To Run 500 MPH (Running Man Series)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"yt4j9bi7wy991": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4920a43e8a115901144ef5e819ee5c5480778963"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd30a0282b9f3de009bdae9a029eb9c424a156de"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64423fc168342d7670d6d97c4ae44cdc5e0f5586"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ede047e293a9c4e85122870641deeb4a73afa37a"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebe81740a7e1d11c0d6d1e73effdca689fa1d3a8"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063e50f30ba34eb175dd9a0bf04a93b9afec084b"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5246c2cf8272418ca74fa4e59110881ebc49cbbc"}, "id": "yt4j9bi7wy991"}}, "name": "t3_vsrb5q", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VXi-dXIrTRKP5dl3-npAzQyG4Pkw5gXqnS2laXbcwr8.jpg", "edited": 1657125190.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657117685.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yt4j9bi7wy991.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5246c2cf8272418ca74fa4e59110881ebc49cbbc\"&gt;Yes, it really does get that crazy during darkroom practice!

Isn&amp;#39;t that a good thing, if Carlos burns with the fire from within?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All Taisha said, with a horrified look on her face was, &amp;quot;Oohhh Noooooo!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Carlos was jumping from rock to rock in the inorganic being&amp;#39;s world at night, trying to avoid falling into the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic beings were pulling on his illness like a thread, trying to &amp;quot;unravel&amp;quot; Carlos, so he would have to stay with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke later told me, &amp;quot;We tried to save him!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos didn&amp;#39;t want to be saved, so he became a &amp;quot;Running Man&amp;quot; each night, trying to avoid having his feet splash into the water below at the bottom of the inorganic being&amp;#39;s realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned the running man series directly from Carlos and the energy trackers, in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was criticism of it by the gossip faction of private classes, saying Carlos was too weak for Tensegrity, so he came up with some you could do laying down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&amp;#39;s true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But remember that each Tensegrity movement contains a &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; the old seers liked to have, deep in dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not sleeping dreaming.  Those guys could do waking dreaming too, the same way we do with our &amp;quot;darkroom practice&amp;quot;.  Tensegrity in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you are absolutely silent, and do the tensegrity forms so perfectly and so smoothly that they &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot;, your &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot; will learn to incorporate the assemblage point movement into how it executes the form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your muscle memory is your &amp;quot;second sentience&amp;quot;.  It can&amp;#39;t speak, but it&amp;#39;s faster than our tonal consciousness. When a glass begins to fall from the dinner table, it&amp;#39;s the muscle memory who saves the day and catches it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not our slow tonal awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so if you can &amp;quot;tap into it&amp;quot; during Tensegrity, your muscle memory can &amp;quot;find the feeling of the old seers&amp;quot;, and you&amp;#39;ll feel it too.  While doing the form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot; part of &amp;quot;Magical Passes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it works!  But you MUST be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I do the &amp;quot;running man series&amp;quot;, I nearly always end up with my feet in several inches of liquid, and I can visibly see it splashing around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s stunning!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, at that level of silence you don&amp;#39;t care. It seems normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I dangle my feet off the bed, gazing off into the whitish light you can see on surfaces in Heightened Awareness, and do my running man passes, a little river materializes below my feet, flowing through my darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movements splash the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep all that in mind when you read these quotes from a lecture by Carol Tiggs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the question I want answered is, &amp;quot;Why is the man running?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**** workshop notes from the all in one collection in the subreddit wiki ****&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the lunch break, Carol strolled back in wearing a black dress with what looked like white&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;pictographs of some sort on it. She mounted the platform and walked around the podium&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;smiling as she greeted participants and stated her name. Back behind the podium, she took out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;her notes, opened her water bottles, and launched off into her lecture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She began with a few words about her identity and the &amp;#39;identity crisis&amp;#39; her and her cohorts were&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;experiencing. The issue was one that they had all brought up at the beginning of each lecture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were becoming unknown to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol went on to talk about our being members of western civilization. She said that because we&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;have been brought up and socialized as members of western civilization we always place the&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;blame for things on somebody else. We do not take responsibility for our actions. She said that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this is the price tag of being at the mercy of energy and awareness other than our own. All of&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;our social molds have been taken from Bobby, and as a result we have become just like him;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;petty, sluggish, lazy and unwilling to take responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She talked again about Carlos&amp;#39; recent breakthrough to a new vibratory level and what it meant&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;for them. She said the implications were staggering and that they may not be able to formulate&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;what exactly it means for some time, if ever. She said again that vibration is key to everything,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and that they were learning new things about it and its relationship to everything they knew&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;about energy and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol then related something that Carlos said to her recently that was the most exquisite thing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;she had ever heard. He had grabbed her by the arm and said very movingly, &amp;quot;I never thought&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d live forever . . . let&amp;#39;s do it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has since become an axiom which guides them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a short hush and light applause, Carol returned to the subject of the Not-Doing passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Running man must be known perfectly,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;The energetic fact of the Running Man&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;is that one is dipping into the fringe, or into the stream, of awareness. The old nagual said that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the fringe of awareness is attached to the bottom of the luminous cocoon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is an ankle-high area around the feet, like a skirt, through which we can dip into the Dark Sea&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;of Awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have no inventory for energy fields,&amp;quot; she went on to say. &amp;quot;They are not part of our&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;socialized cognitive system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot say that you know what it&amp;#39;s like to see energy because the possibility does not exist&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;within our cognition. It is outside the uninterrupted flow of our cognitive experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol said that scientists and physicists were creating all these very complex mathematical&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;equations to represent something that could not, under any circumstances, be understood&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;through socialized cognitive effort. She said that what they were trying to understand existed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;beneath and behind, between the &amp;#39;fractions&amp;#39; of, their equations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When, through the practice of not-doing, one experiences a &amp;#39;lull&amp;#39;, the whole works stop. There is&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;an energetic halt. Carol explained that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico were experts at making&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;practical use of this &amp;#39;lull&amp;#39;. She said that it made them move faster. They were able to bring about&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the halt . . . and then run . . . halt . . . run . . . in a place that existed only between the &amp;#39;fractions&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Page 1228&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ancient shamans understood the impetus of people&amp;#39;s actions. They knew the Not-Doing of&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;things, how to be calm and listen to whatever is said. To take ordinary daily life situations and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;turn them around, transforming them into something extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Returning to the subject of the Running Man series, Carol said the old nagual maintained that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;one had to be able to perform it to perfection. He said that in teaching them to perform the&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;passes for Not-Doing he was showing them how to begin stirring the shallow stream of&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;awareness in order to start a new generation of the glow of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The passes for Not-Doing actually stir the shallow stream of awareness, our only avenue to the&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dark Sea. She explained, like a medical professor, that in performing the Running Man and On&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the Run series we were bringing energy and awareness up, splashing it onto our legs and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;intentionally bringing it even further up the body to our vital centers (the liver, gallbladder,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;spleen, pancreas, V-spot, and womb for women). She stressed that this progressive movement&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;of energy and awareness upward had to be accompanied by a sense of increased discipline and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;behavioral change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol went on to discuss...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived":

It can't help but do that.\n\nThey \"resolve\" that by having an authority at the top, to endorse the \"winners\".\n\nThose who's pretending is certified to be the real thing, so now they can take to their little throne, and lord it over whatever franchise they can put together.\n\nAnd they're endorsed for life, if they just keep sending headquarters a cut.\n\nI studied Zen under a man like that. Famous for running one of the first Zen franchises in the USA.\n\nThe temple in Los Angeles.\n\nHis \"wise words\" to monks, who went so far as to shave their heads in order to seek as much attention as possible, were \"Don't expect to fly to the sun!\"\n\nWell, shit. \n\nI just got back from there.\n\nIt's lovely this time of year.\n\nHis prep for new students was to tell them it's wise to lower your expectations.\n\nBut didn't the Buddha reach fame because of his amazing powers?  Otherwise, who would listen to a guy who sits around all day with his eyes closed, doing nothing?\n\nCertainly not sorcerers. They're famous for running around all over the mountains, keeping their bodies in strong shape.\n\nAs you get older you realize that if you sit around all the time, pretty soon you have \"old man legs\".\n\nIt is NOT wise to be inactive!\n\nIt's also not wise to relax all the time. I mean, to hold up as the ideal that our body is 100% relaxed, like a Tai Chi master.\n\nThat's just more show biz.\n\nBad advice.\n\nYou find that out, as you do more and more tensegrity, and the results are not only visible but turn out to contain \"principles\".\n\nGestures you learn you can make, which produce a visible ripple in space.\n\nThey disturb the alignment of the emanations and then a flux is created.  To resolve that disturbance.\n\nPurple and pink will ripple out from the location of the disturbance, and that \"intent changing\" vapor can be used to open doorways to other worlds.\n\nOr to heal I presume.\n\nTo do just about anything, that sorcerers discovered that movement could do.\n\nA very good example is Zuleica's pass.\n\nIt's filled with gestures that produce ripples of visible magic.\n\nNow, I had my allies taken away.  \n\nBy who or what, I have no idea.\n\nI just know, Cholita had an old woman with her, and while in the second attention, fully awake but having \"switched over\" to that realm, the old woman told me I was overusing them and \"they\" were taking them away.\n\nCholita had been complaining about it for months, so it wasn't surprising.  That and, I'm too fat.\n\nBut them being gone gave me a chance to see what was \"under\" what I had been looking at.\n\nAn analogy.  You have an annoying little pet.\n\nI feel bad for pets.  We essentially pulled them out of their natural environment, bred them to be pleasing to humans, unable to survive alone, and then we kept them prisoner for our amusement.\n\nBut we don't have to feel entirely at fault for that.\n\nIt was done to us.  Living in rooms all day,  never exploring the unknown.\n\nWe went mad.\n\nSo the pets and us are in the same boat.\n\nBut for the sake of this analogy, assume the pet is like an inorganic being.  \n\nOf course, the opposite is likely true. We're pets to the inorganic beings.\n\nBut your cat thinks the same. He's got you feeding him for free!\n\nYou work for him.\n\nI've been told dogs are the same.  They don't really subjugate themselves to the family.\n\nThey believe they're at the top of the pecking order.\n\nAnd everything goes fine, until you have 3 or more dogs in which case you become somewhat irrelevant, as they fight it out among themselves for top dog.\n\nBut for an analogy, the inorganic beings are like a \"yoga cat\", who can't resist when you are doing your bending exercises and runs over to get itself into the bendy mix.\n\nOr to sit on your keyboard as you try to use your computer at home.\n\nIt just \"shows up\" because you're doing something interesting.\n\nOr, it looks like you've gone out to lunch staring at that weird box we call a monitor.\n\nAnd when you successfully create a ripple of colored light in space,  an IOB is likely to run over like a cat and superimpose itself on the action.\n\nThey block your view of the monitor, and make it impossible to use the keyboard.\n\nThey're great for helping to move the assemblage point, because instead of a vague pink cloud being generated by the tensegrity movement gesture, you can make out a face.\n\nIt's a pattern with higher familiar information content.\n\nI've been sent datasheets on the latest AI chips, with people in China interested in whether I can duplicate the power of those, in a form the US government will allow for export.\n\nThe most powerful chips I saw are made by NVidia, at TMSC in Taiwan.  Next in line is AMD, and somewhere down at the bottom is a microcontroller maker, who has $50 microcomputer chips for \"edge AI\".  For little monitor devices, or even toys, that run about in the real world doing small tasks.\n\nI've been trying to understand what they do.\n\nThe approach they take is not at all what I would have done. I would simply have simulated real neural networks, created software to design \"blobs\" out of them and let people design blobs which do things.  And share the \"things\" people created. Connect the \"eyes\" someone made, to the \"ears\". Maybe even make a famous star wars \"motivator\".\n\nThe problem there is the massive amount of memory needed, and massive processor power to actually duplicate what the human neural net does.\n\nAnd when I heard it takes thousands of super fast small CPUS a full year to process ChatGPT's database, to make \"it\", I realized someone had figured out that your neural net is mostly not creating useful output.\n\nIt's just a gigantic collection of tiny bits of information sucked out of space and stored into a matrix, where \"emergent properties\" can be used at the outputs because all of the infomation is designed to ripple downstream, combined with nearly random bits of other information being sucked up at the same time.\n\nSo that if you have the database of all text man has ever produced, you can train an AI with it.\n\nBut what that really seems to mean is, you run vector oriented algorithms on it  until you extract the useful neural path ways.  And toss out the rest.\n\nThe cream of the crop from all the chaos of that huge database.\n\nSo that at the end, it's possible to sort through only the \"useful\" part of a virtual neural network of much larger size.\n\nYou reduce all that data to the key pathways.\n\nI might be wrong, but it seems to be what those modern chips work on.\n\nOr to put it more simply, \"Chocolate\" in your hands sends information into your eyes, nose, and  temperature sensors. That feeds into the neural net, and if it leads to an output that requires enough sights and smells and feelings to be verified as chocolate, you get the chocolate signal output.\n\nBut what's the relationship to sorcery?\n\nIt's those emanations.\n\nYou send awareness (information) into them, and they light up like a neural net.  Causing other pathways to light up.\n\nThe result is that a final conclusion comes into focus.\n\nIt's chocolate!\n\nOr it's a hot car.\n\nOr too spooky to enter that mansion.\n\nIt's a piece of \"reality\".\n\nWe're so lost in those that we aren't even aware this is going on. That we're being presented with a constant flow of conclusions and live inside that, trying to influence what conclusions are drawn next.\n\nSorcerers realized you can step out of that, and there's 20,000 alternate conclusions for any given depth of the assemblage point.\n\nThe problem is, that's ludicrous.\n\nTo think that the place you are currently struggling in could go away in an instant and you could be somewhere else.\n\nBut it's a fact!  And that's what we're trying to witness.\n\nThere's the annoying problem that we've associated ourselves with some elements of this fixed reality.\n\nPhysical matter and an organic body.\n\nAnd most of \"us\", the parts we know, is created in that mess of conclusions.\n\nThat mess actually exists, at this precise position of the assemblage point.\n\nIt's what this \"skimming\" looks like.\n\nYour awareness doesn't have to be stuck here.\n\nBut you can't say, \"I love this huge boulder.  I think I'll take it with me when I rematerialize in another reality.\"\n\nThe boulder belongs to here.  Here is what makes it.\n\nYou can't insist it has to come with you to \"there\".\n\nSo sorcerers are always stuck with that nagging ultimate problem of, being tied to their organic bodies.\n\nThere's various ways they get around that such as burying themselves, \"shrinking\" the tonal, and so on.\n\nStuff it's not good to think about at all, because it's just a lame story until you do it.\n\nAnd when you do it, you won't be able to \"prove it\" to anyone.\n\nYou just do it.  Then later it makes no sense that it even happened.\n\nDarkroom will lead to that, once you get the \"gestures\" down.\n\nSo we just need to concentrate on \"real effects\" instead of all the thinking and pretending and believing you need to relax all the time, or be saintly all the time, or seek the endorsement of the head guy so he can distinguish your pretending from all the new people who are pretending just as well as you.\n\nWe try to fight off that flood of pretending in here, and concentrate on real effects.\n\nAnd Zuleica's pass is loaded with little gestures or movements, which cause ripples in the skimmed emanations.\n\nOnce you master  it, you can extract them.\n\nThe circular flip of the wrist creates a ball of color light, spinning through space.\n\nIf it hits anything, it expands.\n\nBut if you gaze and follow it in the air, it tunnels into space creating a hole.\n\nThrough which you can go, if you have learned how to do that.\n\nDon Juan was filled with such gestures.  And someone brainwashed with fake magic will be surprised.\n\nHe doesn't relax to use them.\n\nHe uses muscles as much as his gaze. Or his hand.\n\nHe might have learned it's easier to produce that ripple in the emanations, if you squint your eyes and turn up your nose.  Gesticulate.\n\nBut since it's real magic and you aren't trying to impress the groupies, there's no reason to feel bad about using your body in whatever manner makes the gesture effect more vivid.\n\nWhen Carlos designed the tensegrity, he wanted us to notice the effects.\n\nBut it didn't do any good. We didn't.\n\nHe started to \"streamline\" them so they had just the principles. The minimal gestures.\n\n\"Gift to Maui\" used to unscrew the hatch 6 times. He was hoping we'd visibly see what that does.\n\nIt was reduced to 2, for the video version which is stellar hatch.\n\nTwo is more than enough, if you can visibly see what it does.  You created that ripple in reality.\n\nSix is for beginners, hoping they'll notice.\n\nIt's the essence of what the pass is trying to teach.\n\nKind of like the huge database, processed for a full year by thousands of super fast computers, to save up just the \"good stuff\".\n\nMost likely Tensegrity moves, many of which came from the death defier, were really just the gesture part.\n\nThe movement that creates a useful ripple in space, which can be applied for specific purposes.\n\nBut when put together as a \"system\", another property emerges from the giant database of tensegrity moves.\n\nSeeing.\n\nYou realize what it takes to get each tensegrity gesture to make visible ripples of energy.\n\nAnd then, you don't need moves at all.\n\nWe saw that result in Carlos, in person.\n\nHe'd be gazing off into space, blankly, very much like that last post of mine with a woman staring off into space, looking for dreams to form in the colors she found swirling in the air.\n\nSlowly swirling I ought to add for beginners. \n\nIt's very vague most of the time.\n\nBut by shutting off the internal dialogue so that you aren't forcing yourself back to your normal reality you can pick up little dreams in the air, and even enter them.\n\nOr get answers.\n\nCarlos tried to teach us by watching those in the air, and then either repeating them to us, or altering his teaching path based on what he just \"saw\".\n\nThe witches did that too.\n\nI confused their searching for \"seeing answers\" for not being willing to speak when Carlos tossed the ball to them.\n\nI got distracted by the cat on the keyboard.

Causing other pathways to light up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result is that a final conclusion comes into focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s chocolate!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it&amp;#39;s a hot car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or too spooky to enter that mansion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a piece of &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re so lost in those that we aren&amp;#39;t even aware this is going on. That we&amp;#39;re being presented with a constant flow of conclusions and live inside that, trying to influence what conclusions are drawn next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers realized you can step out of that, and there&amp;#39;s 20,000 alternate conclusions for any given depth of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, that&amp;#39;s ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To think that the place you are currently struggling in could go away in an instant and you could be somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a fact!  And that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re trying to witness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the annoying problem that we&amp;#39;ve associated ourselves with some elements of this fixed reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Physical matter and an organic body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And most of &amp;quot;us&amp;quot;, the parts we know, is created in that mess of conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That mess actually exists, at this precise position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what this &amp;quot;skimming&amp;quot; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your awareness doesn&amp;#39;t have to be stuck here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t say, &amp;quot;I love this huge boulder.  I think I&amp;#39;ll take it with me when I rematerialize in another reality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boulder belongs to here.  Here is what makes it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t insist it has to come with you to &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So sorcerers are always stuck with that nagging ultimate problem of, being tied to their organic bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s various ways they get around that such as burying themselves, &amp;quot;shrinking&amp;quot; the tonal, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuff it&amp;#39;s not good to think about at all, because it&amp;#39;s just a lame story until you do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you do it, you won&amp;#39;t be able to &amp;quot;prove it&amp;quot; to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just do it.  Then later it makes no sense that it even happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom will lead to that, once you get the &amp;quot;gestures&amp;quot; down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we just need to concentrate on &amp;quot;real effects&amp;quot; instead of all the thinking and pretending and believing you need to relax all the time, or be saintly all the time, or seek the endorsement of the head guy so he can distinguish your pretending from all the new people who are pretending just as well as you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We try to fight off that flood of pretending in here, and concentrate on real effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass is loaded with little gestures or movements, which cause ripples in the skimmed emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you master  it, you can extract them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The circular flip of the wrist creates a ball of color light, spinning through space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it hits anything, it expands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you gaze and follow it in the air, it tunnels into space creating a hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through which you can go, if you have learned how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan was filled with such gestures.  And someone brainwashed with fake magic will be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t relax to use them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He uses muscles as much as his gaze. Or his hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He might have learned it&amp;#39;s easier to produce that ripple in the emanations, if you squint your eyes and turn up your nose.  Gesticulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since it&amp;#39;s real magic and you aren&amp;#39;t trying to impress the groupies, there&amp;#39;s no reason to feel bad about using your body in whatever manner makes the gesture effect more vivid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Carlos designed the tensegrity, he wanted us to notice the effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it didn&amp;#39;t do any good. We didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started to &amp;quot;streamline&amp;quot; them so they had just the principles. The minimal gestures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gift to Maui&amp;quot; used to unscrew the hatch 6 times. He was hoping we&amp;#39;d visibly see what that does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was reduced to 2, for the video version which is stellar hatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two is more than enough, if you can visibly see what it does.  You created that ripple in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Six is for beginners, hoping they&amp;#39;ll notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the essence of what the pass is trying to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of like the huge database, processed for a full year by thousands of super fast computers, to save up just the &amp;quot;good stuff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most likely Tensegrity moves, many of which came from the death defier, were really just the gesture part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movement that creates a useful ripple in space, which can be applied for specific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when put together as a &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, another property emerges from the giant database of tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You realize what it takes to get each tensegrity gesture to make visible ripples of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, you don&amp;#39;t need moves at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We saw that result in Carlos, in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d be gazing off into space, blankly, very much like that last post of mine with a woman staring off into space, looking for dreams to form in the colors she found swirling in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly swirling I ought to add for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very vague most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by shutting off the internal dialogue so that you aren&amp;#39;t forcing yourself back to your normal reality you can pick up little dreams in the air, and even enter them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or get answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried to teach us by watching those in the air, and then either repeating them to us, or altering his teaching path based on what he just &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches did that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I confused their searching for &amp;quot;seeing answers&amp;quot; for not being willing to speak when Carlos tossed the ball to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got distracted by the cat on the keyboard.  Blocking my view of what was really going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "14ass9d", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/14ass9d/gesture_tensegrity/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/14ass9d/gesture_tensegrity/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1686909714.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jocejwz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1686919431.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_14ass9d", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I'm not even going to try to edit this.

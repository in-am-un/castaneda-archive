Throughout the day I was see a smaller patch, but I never figured out what it meant or what I was supposed to &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More recently when I fall asleep I see a purple patch in the dark, like maybe you describe, but I try to focus on it and it disappears. I also try to &amp;quot;communicate&amp;quot; with it by admiring its beauty and just being awed. I just kinda let it be and notice it when I notice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did wonder if the colors had anything to do with &amp;quot;favorable&amp;quot; colors, like Carlos&amp;#39; resting spot or if the color or the appearance of the cloud means anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit for typos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/b5ih6k/rallying_the_second_attention/ejjsk8d/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_ejjsk8d", "created": 1553745056.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ejfe5pj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1553617656.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ejeiq3v", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I don't know.

I did indeed get into trouble with Carlos a few times.  \u201cThat\u2019s too far\u201d, he\u2019d say quietly. He turned his head when he did it, so that likely I was the only one who overheard.\n\nBut that day I wasn\u2019t in trouble.

By playing with it, any way you can, you\u2019re deploying the second attention.  That\u2019ll stick to you a bit each time.  Your assemblage point will get used to new positions.\n\nBut that discussion with Zuleica has another important point. She says that unmitigated darkness is useless to a dreamer in the initial onslaught.  So we know, if you try this, you\u2019re involved in an ongoing onslaught.    Not just a few times. You need to do it to \u201conslaught\u201d your current crummy position of the assemblage point.\n\nAlso, seeing no colors (unmitigated darkness) isn\u2019t useful at first.  You need to look for them.  Those give entry to the second attention.\n\nI tried to understand why she chose orange red last night by looking for that specific color. Also, I wanted to enter into the color, the way Carlos did in that quote.   Just as a warning, this took 3 hours.\n\nI don\u2019t know about \u201cdiving\u201d into it as you suggested, but I\u2019ve done that with a dreaming portal. It\u2019s certainly possible to find yourself in your dreaming body while doing something, and intuitively know you can pull that kind of thing off.   \n\nBut I suspect that the way to enter that color is to have it move back onto you, and surround you.   I don\u2019t know how to do that yet.  And I can only get silent on demand.  I can't enter into heightened awareness.  If you remember that story, Carlos was in heightened awareness, and had only recovered the memory of that event, recently. \n\nAs a substitute for heightened awareness, I reverted to mantric meditation. I use the mantra from Chopra, and combined with silence, it produces fast results. Gets you to \u201cbliss\u201d, which is about the closest I can come to heightened awareness, on demand.\n\nFrom that vantage point, I did see the colors,  and instead of keeping them at a distance, as you do with the \"wall\" technique, and instead of trying to manipulate them, as the \"gift to Maui\" pass does, I tried to enter.\n\nProblem is, if you enter, you\u2019re in the second attention.  Dreaming perhaps.  Every time I tried to enter, I found I had blanked out, and returned with a memory of a conversation between Carlos, and a woman.  I didn\u2019t know the woman.  She was explaining the technique to him.\n\nNow before anyone jumps to a conclusion, I could NOT participate in the dream, I could only remember it, after I returned.  I couldn\u2019t even watch it as it happened. It was vague memory only.  Also, 3 hours went by in what seemed like a half hour.\n\nEven so, apparently the \u201ccolors in the dark technique\u201d is a vast array of techniques, not just the one I\u2019ve fixated on.  \n\nEdited: because I just can't keep my hands off stuff.\n", "edited": 1553620118.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ejfe5pj", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know.

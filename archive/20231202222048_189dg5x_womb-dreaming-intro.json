You can't see her lips moving in the intro, but they will later on.\n\nUnfortunately it turns out my synthetic voice site has a serious lack of Greek or even Spanish accents. Unless I'm not seeing everything it has, and the search isn't working.  It's \"Elevenlabs\" in case anyone wants to look themselves.  A spanish accent was requested in chat, and I couldn't figure out why we didn't have those for choices before.\n\nNow I think, it's because all of their accents are from english speaking countries.  Brits, Australians, Americans, Irish.\n\nBut they do have African and Indian in their choices.\n\nHow about the music?  Is it too \"Native American\"?\n\nDon't you just hate when people try to invoke spirituality by association to popular music from that genre?\n\nHow about the old \"Asian music rift\" when a Chinese servant in a 1960s TV show does something funny.\n\nOr a Tuba when a very heavy man walks onto the scene.\n\nPeople do the same with fake spirituality.  Try to use music to cover up the ineffectiveness of foreign magical systems.\n\nIt's really ugly when you have to pretend by using brainwashing icons.\n\nWe don't need to do that at all. Since we have the real thing.\n\nWhat you see there is the most accurate portrayal I've made so far,  of how the Allies look to beginners. Like a 2 frames per second 1990s web camera.\n\nAnd it's also an accurate portrayal of how the yellow Tonal energy comes out, when swarmed by the purple puffs. \n\nExcept that if you see this yourself, you'll be looking down at it.\n\nIt's part of why the purple puffs push themselves away from our body, to spread thin on the luminous shell inside.\n\nBecause if they mix with that yellow stuff in the middle they pick up our crummy moods.\n\nIt's like walking to the other side of the street because there's a ranting homeless guy up ahead on the sidewalk, talking to people who aren't there.\n\nWhen you start to practice removing the internal dialogue, you are eventually not completely odious to your energy body. \n\nSo it starts to swarm and you can even see it mixing with the tonal energy.\n\nBut that's probably not visible until the red zone (assemblage point below mid back).\n\nIn the green zone, where the assemblage point has only moved as far as it does with meditation, I'd be surprised if anyone could perceive that yellow tonal energy blob.\n\nThis is also an accurate portrayal of why Carlos reluctantly agreed there might be 20,000 permutations of reality at any given depth of the assemblage point.\n\n10,000 in either 4 inch direction the assemblage point can move, sideways from the center of Man's band of emanations.\n\nBut what does that actually mean???!!\n\nFear not, you get to find out.\n\nExcept that you perhaps already did.\n\nIf you were half asleep as a child and noticed pictures on the wall had moved, or the TV set which is off started playing a program anyway, you ran into a \"small reality permutation\".\n\nBut is it a \"separate reality\" just because a broken TV that can't work anymore is suddenly playing a 1950s re-run?\n\nBeats me.  But it's very common.  I've watched entire TV shows in the second attention.\n\nYou can be sure there are bizarre plot twists out there in infinity.\n\nPeople just ignore all the evidence that sorcery is real.\n\nAnd when children tell their parents the pictures on the wall move at night, or the clothes on the floor got closer to the bed and frightened them, the parents assure them it's not real.\n\nWorse, their siblings will make fun of them if they hear of it.\n\nAnd so we convince ourselves that the obvious signs all around us, demonstrating clearly that reality is more flexible than we have been led to believe, have been explained.\n\nYou dream at night?\n\nPeople explain it away by saying \"Just a dream. Has nothing to do with reality.\"\n\nDrugs cause hallucinations?\n\n\"It's just the drugs!\"\n\nTired can do the same and cause hallucinations?\n\n\"Well, you're confused from lack of sleep.\"\n\nOn and on it goes explaining away the magic around us, until even saying what I'm saying here seems ludicrous.\n\nAnd thus we get trapped in the river of shit.\n\nWhich I'll animate some day. It's one of the more disturbing stories don Juan told, which was pretty much not spoken of until the very end because of the trouble it would cause to outright say:\n\nWe all live in a River of Shit!  Pissing and pooping on each other all day long.\n\nThe story has a happy ending though, so it won't be as bad as it sounds on the surface.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oad3lemt7y3c1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=677ef398fba52836fa85dacaf47c58a7980b2d70", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Womb Dreaming Intro", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Womb Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"jrocdp3y7y3c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/189dg5x/asset/jrocdp3y7y3c1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718050321%2CYjliYTYxOTA2MmRkZTE5NjM4MWMxZDYyYWQ1ZmQwNDZiNmI2ZmU5ODgzZWViNWU1M2ZhNDgwZGVjZmNlMGFkNA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/189dg5x/asset/jrocdp3y7y3c1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718050321%2CNWY2YTlhMWQ1NjFjNjFhNDQ2N2E4MzMzMzQ0YmM3Nzk2ODY0M2YxNWFmMTdmNWFmMjcxYTViODRlNGVjNzM0OQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "jrocdp3y7y3c1", "isGif": false}, "oad3lemt7y3c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oad3lemt7y3c1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85f4d272efa51349ea333c9927e264f4bdd5da00"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oad3lemt7y3c1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63739cbb1a7b1c38b99aceee6e7be6c7dc0a7266"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oad3lemt7y3c1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6229ed39c15b042aa5a67817844e68bf223e0f3b"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oad3lemt7y3c1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dac4de03203f6ad9fb8140dcfca9f8e3368f154"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oad3lemt7y3c1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e644227762a9867c0fcaf8e5eebbb92bfa15f69"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oad3lemt7y3c1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=138a40b1192f3dabf2b41d065eb97b67ff39a0e1"}], "s": {"y": 2160, "x": 3840, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oad3lemt7y3c1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=677ef398fba52836fa85dacaf47c58a7980b2d70"}, "id": "oad3lemt7y3c1"}}, "name": "t3_189dg5x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Womb Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mlgPwmyexJSt4RGjhGaIuWqkkA2PFvyJcEwhDS1Q1AM.jpg", "edited": 1701553721.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1701552048.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/189dg5x/video/jrocdp3y7y3c1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/189dg5x/video/jrocdp3y7y3c1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comments wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the voice for Ruby, the Ally of a greek woman, ok?

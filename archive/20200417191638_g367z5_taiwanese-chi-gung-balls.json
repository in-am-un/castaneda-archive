We're all using the same physical body.\n\nAnd the weird things other systems make claims for, likely were true at one point.\n\nOver time, the inevitable book deals and me-too copycats destroyed the real experience.\n\nReal knowledge seems to always get buried by a flood of egotism and greed.\n\nWith all the fake stuff piled on to increase book sales, eventually you only hear an echo of what was originally known.\n\nBut the echos are all remarkably similar, from religion to religion.\n\nWhat's the same between them, that's what always interests me.\n\nDemons are always the same.\n\nManipulating chi is almost always present, except in religions which specifically forbid sorcery.\n\nYou'd think that includes the bible, and for the most part it does.  But then, the witch of Endor used it to manifest a ghostly figure.\n\nIn this case, the guy is explaining how to scoop the energy, and compress it on the other hand.\n\nHe does a near perfect copy of the movement I use to solidify low energy inorganic beings. Or perhaps, to turn a hypnogogic image into something attractive to an inorganic being.\n\nYou scoop the hypnogogic image onto your hand, and use the other to scoop more energy into it.\n\nI once formed a little fairy, and when I was finished she stood up on my hand!\n\nHe warns that you should always scoop it closer to yourself.  Never use a motion that pushes it away.\n\nThat reminds me of when I saw Cholita doing her exercise program, and it contained a very disturbing scattering motion.  I was horrified.\n\nBut then I tried her motion months later, and it does scatter energy.  But the energy forms a tunnel in front of  you, and none is actually lost, since it flows back around the sides.  And the tunnel directs our awareness to locations much further away than you ought to be able to perceive.\n\nWatching Cholita do the movement, it was as if she were trying to clear out an opening in a heavy fog, so she could see which direction to go.  She gazes fiercely through the tunnel as she does the movement.\n\nPerhaps the descriptions in Carlos' books saying we're essentially sealed, explain why scattering energy, instead of bringing it closer, isn't as bad as you'd expect.\n\nI'm a big believer that Tensegrity only redeploys energy from inside your own luminous shell.  You aren't scooping any from outside, even when it appears to be too far away to be part of your shell.\n\nThe Chinese bosses' son translated a little of this video for me.  Wasn't as funny as the last one I posted.  And I got the impression, he believed this sort of knowledge was connected to Daoists.\n\nDaoists do similar movements, but he says it's almost surely only for show, and they've also lost the knowledge of why they do those movements.\n\nBut essentially, this Taiwanese Chi Gung master is trying to redeploy energy closer to his middle.\n\nThat's Zuleica's technique!\n\nI'm afraid to say, this guy can't visually see the energy.  He probably doesn't even know that's possible.\n\nWorse, there's no way to tell him about it.  Chinese culture prevents anyone teaching him anything new.\n\nI've tried several times in different places!\n\nThe only time I didn't get booted out, was with Daniel Ingram.  He's already forming visible chi balls with his fellow practitioners.\n\nI gave him a heads up on how to use the chi balls to change worlds, intercept dreams, and maybe a few other things I shouldn't have mentioned, since they hadn't gotten there yet.\n\nI'd be curious how he took that.\n\nEdit three\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Taiwanese Chi Gung Balls", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"i15wvsaztet41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i15wvsaztet41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a176fdb22fcee8a9f723584ae3559367c56025c"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i15wvsaztet41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f92e9776825c1fa01d91ffd358ef33049144151c"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i15wvsaztet41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80686fb78aeb387a22e4052ac99929dd7a84c61e"}, {"y": 358, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i15wvsaztet41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f008927e97d30b57465880af5a84c72fc49770f"}], "s": {"y": 397, "x": 708, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i15wvsaztet41.jpg?width=708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59f1e5d08e9545e161442eeca0dbbd3d9e3c0414"}, "id": "i15wvsaztet41"}}, "name": "t3_g367z5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 7, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yRKt9SBJ3m8?start=744&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

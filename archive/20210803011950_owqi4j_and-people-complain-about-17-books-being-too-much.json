So it's going to hold out on you, in a sort of asian way, where you're expected to realize there are multiple levels of understanding.\n\nAnd I'm not convinced they even tell you the original idea for the writing in the first place.\n\nFor example, I was private chatting a new guy from the shamanism subreddit, and trying to interest him in getting his own IOB quickly.\n\nI mentioned you could choose it's appearance.   A cat, a fairy, even a woman in a miniskirt if you like.\n\nI suppose it was a young guy, because that caught his interest.\n\nI tried to remember justifications for that sort of thing in the books, so no would feel \"unholy\" doing what comes naturally to men in  the dark room.\n\nThe IOBs are all female, so they certainly don't mind if they have your undivided attention.\n\nDon Juan even warned us.  You might see the inorganic beings as naked women in 4 gates dreaming, implying men had that weakness at first.\n\nAnd it's fine, but if you mess with them physically, it will be so creepy you'll soon decide to be \"just friends\".\n\nThen I remembered the Buddha's 4 dancing women in blue dresses, and realized, the buddha also created \"frisky\" inorganic beings for himself, and that's ALWAYS from you.  Not them.\n\nBut he turned away.\n\nTranslation: The buddha was also a perv to some extent, and he got a bit of a rush seeing that, and lost the vision.\n\nThe IOBs never stay around giving you a choice to be a superior being and turn away, as the story implies.\n\nThe account was \"sanitized\" for your asian reading pleasure.\n\nThe writings are more closed than open, because  their scribes didn't understand intent at all.\n\nYou don't mess with intent by changing accounts, to serve self-reflection.\n\nFor starters, not only will that break your link to intent and give you less \"intent gifts\", but you'll miss out on something I only noticed tonight.\n\n\"Intent assists\".  It seems if your link to intent is cleaner, it helps you out in tiny ways constantly.

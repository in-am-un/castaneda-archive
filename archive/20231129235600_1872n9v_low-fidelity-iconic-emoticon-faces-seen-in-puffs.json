It's not perfect, probably 70&amp;#37; accurate.](https://preview.redd.it/23eulv9x8d3c1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9472b5c989397460dc5cc17734fd2aee0267481c)\n\nMy only successes so far (defined as: seeing something that I don't think is my imagination) with darkroom gazing are when I start gazing sessions in the middle of the night.\n\nMy first success was inadvertently achieved when camping in my travel trailer. It was freezing outside and I was camped where there was no electricity. To heat the trailer at night I had to use the propane furnace which has a loud blower motor. It would cycle on/off every 30 minutes or so. \n\nThe sound kept waking me up through the night and sometime around 2-3am I decided to try some dark gazing. Being far away from any city it was pitch black in the camper (aside from the led light of the furnace thermostat) Being in a half-asleep state (I assume my AP was already moved off baseline) I started gazing, and within a short time was able to see purple puffs. Which surprised me because my mind was not very silent. I intended more silence and the puffs became brighter, merging into one.  I started to feel sudden vibrations moving through my body. Strangely enough, I could control the vibrations (where they were located in my body). I moved them from my feet to my hands, to my chest. The tingling was quite pleasant and at times very strong.  While I was doing this I kept my focus on the puff and noticed that there were low fidelity/iconic/emoticon faces cycling in it. One was 8bit looking (like Minecraft) then an emoticon, then some kind of graphic design face.  I watched for a while and had the sudden thought of IOBs/allies which started to freak me out and I lost the little silence I had, the whole thing collapsed.\n\nSince then I have replicated this at home by using an alarm to wake up sometime between 2-4am and start gazing with a blindfold on (for complete darkness).\n\nI have seen the faces only one other time but have not built the courage to interact with them more. I tried to watch them for a while.  I am just trying to get comfortable with the idea of interacting with them. I think soon I will have the courage to do so. Fortunately, they have not tried to scare me yet. \n\nThe idea of interacting with them does scare me and I am trying to not have fear when doing this. I read some threads in this group that mention you should not have any fear when interacting with IOB\u2019s so I am trying to deal with my issues on this.\n\nWhen I don\u2019t see the puffs sometimes I have other strange effects like being able to \u2018feel\u2019 and sometimes \u2018see\u2019 my room (I am assuming a copy of my room) with my blindfold on. The light is strange (bluish) and comes from all directions so no shadows are cast).  My field of view is also significantly wider than 'normal' but that is a discussion for a different thread.\n\nDumb Questions:\n\n\u00b7 What is a good way to interact with IOB\u2019s. Is there such a thing as a polite first interaction? Do IOB\u2019s have a general social contract that they follow (like most humans do)?\n\n\u00b7 How do you gain an IOB as an ally? Is it something that happens naturally the more you interact with it? Or do you literally ask it to help you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Low fidelity/iconic/emoticon faces seen in puffs", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"23eulv9x8d3c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/23eulv9x8d3c1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d39a72167fa9c2f63f82de4fa7713adba4450a6a"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/23eulv9x8d3c1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=690fc6195df771a4225765ff1aefde76fec6752f"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/23eulv9x8d3c1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c6244a6360a6234cb1c61b1bc9c5ceb2fe6a9da"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/23eulv9x8d3c1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2b6317bf7ed600f016d9a874c2f5e7cfaf81824"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/23eulv9x8d3c1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57aa93e9c49fde85ad6516bcbfc278f88a6bb12d"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/23eulv9x8d3c1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9472b5c989397460dc5cc17734fd2aee0267481c"}, "id": "23eulv9x8d3c1"}}, "name": "t3_1872n9v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_7ipyfg", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5sZcYy1vq559H6q5tKrRyNWdL75ZZEMDgm1sxbTLxzI.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1701298560.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/23eulv9x8d3c1.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9472b5c989397460dc5cc17734fd2aee0267481c\"&gt;AI generated image of what I saw.

Then you have to &amp;quot;wrestle them&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, get over the default fright methods of interaction, and find ones based on a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not being afraid, but instead being curious is one way.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or actually being happy to see them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or attracted if they&amp;#39;re showing up as sexy partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;How do you gain an IOB as an ally? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By learning to get it to return nightly, and help to teach you sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, it takes you to an alternate version of reality and begins to teach you as the dreaming emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wide awake, eyes open, standing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not meditating.  That&amp;#39;s just going to be a bad dream you had, which you misrepresented to self-flatter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how many other magical systems work, such as &amp;quot;Astral Travel&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By encouraging men to misrepresent dozing off and having a little dream, so as to get attention in a group which will endorse that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally you should be fully awake, and moving around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sober.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Ally once took me to the top of a mountain range, right in my darkroom.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And taught me there so fast, I couldn&amp;#39;t keep up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Or do you literally ask it to help you? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s really there, sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s not, don&amp;#39;t.  You&amp;#39;ll just end up pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the big danger for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We even get some who can&amp;#39;t tell the difference between pretending or visualizing, and the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s perplexing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost as bad as if you run into a starving man laying on a bench in the park, and you offer him your bag of Del Taco burritos and tacos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fresh and untouched!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he just keeps dreaming that he&amp;#39;s eating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see him chewing, and pretending to be holding a hamburger, but there&amp;#39;s nothing there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You even wake him up and he looks you in the eyes, and you say &amp;quot;Here!  Real food.  Look with your own eyes.  Smell it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he just turns his head and goes back to pretending to be eating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve literally seen people behave like that in here, more times than we can count.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So keep it real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s really a spirit right there in front of you, then of course you can speak to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big trick is getting them to answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That requires the assemblage point to shift horizontally a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s going straight down the middle of that cheese slice shown in the last video,  it&amp;#39;s unlikely they can speak with audible sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1872n9v/low_fidelityiconicemoticon_faces_seen_in_puffs/kbc4sxr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1701303246.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1872n9v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kbcbhb5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SignificantResult3", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1701306088.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1872n9v", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_7ipyfg", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Looks like I can't edit a reddit post with an image in it.

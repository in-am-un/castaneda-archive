I was walking around, observing, and I noticed a woman curled up seeping on the ground. I started to sweet the ground and noticed there was all these small colorful objects all over the place, but there were dusty and hardened. I realized they were some sort of fruit or candy. The lady started to scrape them on the concrete floor, to clean off the hardened shell. I started doing the same to help her. She looks at me, and we started to communicate. Her energy was very kind, very inviting. She was speaking in a language I couldn't understand, and I told her I didnt speak her language, but I still felt the desire to try to understand her. Then, I saw what I thought was a flame on her forehead. It was pink/orangeish and seemed like a cartoon overlay, clearly separate from the realism of the environment or the woman. When I saw it she said \"ohhh Chi?\" \"Yes!\" I said \"Its chi\" \"You see Chi?\" \"yea, that's what Im seeing, chi\"   \n\n\nThen she asked me my name, and instead of giving her my physical name that I was given at birth, I gave her my soul name which I received a few months ago. When I received this name, I knew I wasn't meant to share it with anyone. But in this dream, I told her. As I was waking back into the physical world, I was confused about why I shared it with her and got slightly nervous about it, idk why, it was just my initial feelings upon waking.   \n\n\nThese sort of things has been happening for a while now, ever since I started reading CC's books. My assumption was that maybe my subconscious is using the material from the books to open my imagination and give a new medium to my dreams, but there's many things within the books that are the only things I've ever come across that explain things Ive experienced since I was a child, in dreams and in waking life.   \n\n\nI was also dead asleep the other night, and I heard a voice ask me to sit upright and meditate. I responded with \"Im trying to sleep\" Then I saw a vision of my crystals on necklaces pulling towards my window. The voice said \"Come on! Sit upright!\" \"Oh I see if it past 3am?\" \"Yes!\" it said, so I sat up, looked at the clock at it was 4am. I got in a lotus position in my bed and meditated for a few minutes before I went back to sleep.   \n\n\nIt was really strange.

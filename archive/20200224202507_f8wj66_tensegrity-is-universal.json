This wasn\u2019t in the books!\n\n2). It\u2019s just Howard Lee\u2019s Kung Fu.\n\n3). That lame movement? Who does he think he\u2019s fooling?\n\n4). Virginia's kind of hot when she does that.  Mighty convenient way to get to touch the women.\n\n5). Sure, there\u2019s hundreds of techniques. More to sell at workshops.\n\n6). Kylie is too scary.\n\nI hope everyone who\u2019s been in here for at least a few months knows how silly all of those are.\n\nExcept the part about Kylie being scary.\n\nJust line up the Chacmools, and see how Kylie towers over them.\n\nIn that picture, Reni is sort of puckered up.  At worst, she might kiss you.\n\nNyei is out somewhere in outer space.  Or ready to be tickled.\n\nBut Kylie has your number!  And Reni and Nyei combined, couldn't defeat her.\n\nAs to the techniques being effective, I\u2019ve pointed out that fact that you can actually *see* energy while doing the tensegrity, and observe the redeployment claim.\n\nYes!   It does!\n\nWhen a little creature floating in the air flies over quickly to where you just redeployed energy, you can even ask him if it works.\n\nI'm sure he'll smile.\n\nAnd to get started gazing at darkness in silence, some tensegrity moves really speed up the process of finding colors and inorganic beings.\n\nEspecially the Westwood dreaming series.\n\nTensegrity can also assemble another world, when combined with extreme silence, and \u201cthe wall\u201d.\n\nAnd, you need it to manage entry to some worlds.\n\nBut when I read about how you could incorporate tensegrity into your daily life, \u201cinstinctively knowing\u201d which move to do in a given situation, I was pretty skeptical.\n\nI had visions of the tango expert Nagual giving his foot a little twist during the dancing, and claiming that actually did something.\n\nI was so wrong!\n\nIt does.\n\nTo discover that, you need to get into heightened awareness and lose it, over and over.\n\nYou get into heightened awareness with 3 hours of gazing in darkness.  It takes 3  hours to move the assemblage point that far on your own.\n\nYou lose it the next day at the office.\n\nHow long it lasts depends on the circumstances of the day.\n\nEXCEPT, you can add a little tensegrity to your walk, do a few passes when no one\u2019s looking, and keep it all day long.\n\nYou figure out what\u2019s effective by watching your breathing.\n\nIn heightened awareness, the breathing is automatic. Only the stomach moves, and it\u2019s as calm as a still clear lake.\n\nNot to mention, you feel bliss.\n\nDuring the day, the bliss starts to fade. You do tensegrity movements, and you notice that your breathing is fixed.\n\nYou\u2019d forgotten it should be automatic. The bliss covers that up.\n\nWhen the bliss fades enough that you feel like you need to go do some moves, the first thing you notice is that the natural breath is restored.\n\nIt's like a sigh of relief when it's restored to the perfect breath.\n\nThe bliss follows like an echo, around 10 seconds later.\n\n(The same thing happens when summoning objects using intent.)\n\nYou also get feedback on which Tensegrity moves work best in a given situation.\n\nMashing energy is one you can even do while walking. You can do it in such a subtle manner, people won\u2019t notice. Of if they do, they\u2019ll just think you\u2019ve got a sore heel.\n\nBut does the tensegrity really do something, or is it all about *intent*?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nBut even a little hand wave towards the second attention\u2019s assemblage point, has an effect.\n\nEdited", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tensegrity is Universal", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 90, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"sknihz1u7xi41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 69, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sknihz1u7xi41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4f4877fc20b9a52015239b1b4e68700ca26fe82"}, {"y": 138, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sknihz1u7xi41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e68f2411e9ba60811036a0f6a8495eef7d9e34af"}, {"y": 205, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sknihz1u7xi41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac7b33e47778aa37d55e4b0d8975e2fff164c73"}, {"y": 411, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sknihz1u7xi41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45ea91faab06084448134536b0981b1ef81b92e4"}], "s": {"y": 413, "x": 642, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sknihz1u7xi41.jpg?width=642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff1588c4ad98123ab71a1ccc835179582c1d4529"}, "id": "sknihz1u7xi41"}}, "name": "t3_f8wj66", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/R9xkyq1paAD-Sr8crqwuD7PpdbGHL8rpOd2xYaddDJI.jpg", "edited": 1582573072.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1582572307.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sknihz1u7xi41.jpg?width=642&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ff1588c4ad98123ab71a1ccc835179582c1d4529\"&gt;The Chacmools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was some whispered criticism of Tensegrity in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this is an almost complete list:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1).

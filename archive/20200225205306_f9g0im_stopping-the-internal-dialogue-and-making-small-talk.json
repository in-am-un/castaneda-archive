I learned of it in class.  Carlos emphasized it at the end, probably because he wanted a fast way for us to learn to control our second attention, without needing anything special.  Like going outdoors and such.\n\nI don't know where it would be in the books. Carlos banned me from reading them.  I cheat sometimes to answer a question, but searching for where that came from is a little too much reading.\n\nYes, that whiteness that begins to form is an ancestor of \"the wall\".  It can turn into many things, but the wall is certainly one of them.\n\nI however favor finding fine lines in darkness. Those not only can turn into the wall, but they emphasize world changes, instead of inorganic being shows and automatic writing on the wall.\n\nThe wall can answer questions, open portals, but most important of all, you can assemble another world using it.\n\nSo you have lots of visions going on while in bed?\n\nThe good news is, that means you're a dreamer, and can learn all that dreamers learn.\n\nThe bad news is,you'll fall asleep if you do it in bed.\n\nYou can learn that way. I have a student who did.  And now he's carrying his closed eye lid visions around during the day, checking in from time to time.\n\nBut in my opinion, you're far better off to get a dark room, get out of bed, and walk around.  So that you can't fall asleep.\n\nPlus how cool is it to dream while awake with eyes open!!!\n\nGo through the whiteness?  Go read my post on visiting heaven. You discovered that technique.\n\nDoes all that sound similar to \"the wall\"?\n\nOf course!  The wall is merely a manifestation of the second attention, in convenient and easy to use form.\n\nYou could learn to summon, \"the lake\" I supposed.    Or virtual furniture you could use for divining.\n\nCertainly a virtual cell phone!  Maybe I'll have to put some effort into that. How cool to have a  ghost cellphone in your hand, with \"second attention wifi\"???\n\nDeal people can be manifested too, I've seen Cholita do that.

I cheat sometimes to answer a question, but searching for where that came from is a little too much reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that whiteness that begins to form is an ancestor of &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;.  It can turn into many things, but the wall is certainly one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I however favor finding fine lines in darkness. Those not only can turn into the wall, but they emphasize world changes, instead of inorganic being shows and automatic writing on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wall can answer questions, open portals, but most important of all, you can assemble another world using it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have lots of visions going on while in bed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is, that means you&amp;#39;re a dreamer, and can learn all that dreamers learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bad news is,you&amp;#39;ll fall asleep if you do it in bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can learn that way. I have a student who did.  And now he&amp;#39;s carrying his closed eye lid visions around during the day, checking in from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in my opinion, you&amp;#39;re far better off to get a dark room, get out of bed, and walk around.

We shall avoid, and pass by, the metaphysical features of the case, and shall confine ourselves to the Yogi Psychology. We shall not touch upon theories, nor attempt to explain the cause, nature and purpose of the Mind\u2014the working tool of the Ego\u2014but instead shall attempt to point out a way whereby you may analyze the Mind and then determine which is the &amp;quot;not I&amp;quot; and which is the real &amp;quot;I.&amp;quot; It is useless to burden you with theories or metaphysical talk, when the way to prove the thing is right within your own grasp. By using the mind, you will be able to separate it into its parts, and force it to give you its own answer to the questions touching itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/ryo/index.htm\"&gt;https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/ryo/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/f9g0im/stopping_the_internal_dialogue_and_making_small/fisdiui/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1582682770.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_f9g0im", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fiw0bio", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dissysissy", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1582772131.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_f9g0im", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_d3hwno9", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "You can make it a part of your controlled folly.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fiw0bio", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can make it a part of your controlled folly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/f9g0im/stopping_the_internal_dialogue_and_making_small/fiw0bio/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1582772131.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_f9g0im", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fj0q535", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "exodusthree14", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1582905465.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_f9g0im", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4y6sh7ty", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I\u2019m just learning who castaneta is!\n\n\nBut I\u2019ve been on a strict diet for the past 10 months after having been introduced to Neville Goddard. \n\nI know I carry around a certain serenity now that radiates around me which naturally defends me from small talk/bullshitting banter. \n\n\nIn a situation like yours at the barber\u2019s ....

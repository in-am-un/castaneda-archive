I believe they are present.\n\nSo the rest \"kind of\" had no time sequence.\n\nI looked back into the room,  after spying at the door to hear Cholita, and I was translocated.\n\nIt was clearly not my room, it was not dark at all, and it was amazingly stable.\n\nI got onto the bed to watch it. It was the inside of a structure, could have been a bedroom, but it was alien.  The things on the walls and the furniture leaned 45 degrees down to the left.  You couldn't put anything on them. It would roll off.  \n\nBut otherwise, it looked like a white room with white furniture and shelves.  Like an alien Ikea supplied home.  \n\nI wiggled my fingers on the second attention spot while I watched it.  I try to do that whenever I remember, hoping to finish Zuleica's instructions to Carlos. It had nothing to do with the scene, but I figured if it was stable and I had to watch it to figure out how long it would be stable, might as well use the time well.  And see if I could feel that \"thick as water\" thing Zuleica mentioned, for when you wiggle your fingers there.  To make the dent in the energy body.\n\nLily showed up.  I wasn't clear headed enough to remember, that's how I found Lily in the first place. Doing finger wiggling. She was there in the middle of it all, swimming around in small circles.\n\nThe finger wiggling had \"summoned\" her.\n\nBut I didn't remember that could happen, and couldn't believe she had returned because it was too good to be true. I kind of like her.  She isn't scary at all, like Fancy.  She feels, \"safe\".  I might be able to give her to someone else without worrying.\n\nSo I had to ask her.  \n\nShe was vaguely the same, sitting on a lily pad, but she was an odd color I can't recall now.  \n\nEach time I asked if that was her she got a little closer to being clearly visible as a small woman sitting on a lily pad, smiling.\n\nI had to cut through course lines of whitish light, to find the color she was appearing on, like tuning static out on the radio, to find the perfect spot for a very weak signal.\n\nAt the end, it was clearly her.  She seemed to be sitting on a little cluster of lilly pads, but still on water in either a shallow stream, or at the end of a pond.\n\nI looked down at the floor.  I'd translocated into some flat jungle area in a swamp.  Green stalks were growing densely all along my floor, standing up around 6 feet each but as a flat scene, like someone had laid a poster of a swamp in vietnam, right out of a Rambo movie, down on the floor.\n\nBehind the plant stalks, each one around 2 inches in diameter like thick bamboo, but not bamboo by the looks of them, right in the midst of them, an army was marching. I had the thought that it was the civil war, and the poor men had to traverse the swamp.\n\nI looked again to see their uniforms, but I could only see slight glimpses of their bodies walking along. They were nearly hidden by the plant stalks.\n\nI strained to look again, worried my thought had altered the scene.\n\nIt was still sharp and stable, on my floor.  And still, not clearly civil war era.  in fact, might not even have been on the earth, because the bamboo like stalks were clearly not bamboo, and had no leaves at all. They were merely green, and growing from a marsh like area.\n\nI tried to sit up in the middle of the bed, to move the marching men onto the quilt.  Maybe I could zoom up from there, and see which world it was on.\n\nBut the scene had changed.  I looked around the room, and I'd translocated perfectly, to another place.\n\nI got the feeling of \"where on earth am I now?\"\n\nI didn't exactly panic, but I wanted to know quickl, so I glanced back to the left where I'd been looking on the floor.\n\nI had to turn my neck a bit further to the left, when I noticed  a white smoke pillar rising up.\n\nIt was a angel, with flowing robes.  She was life sized.  Mostly I saw the whitish smoke, glowing with pink light, and the top half of her.  She had cloth flowing all over her.  Essentially either an open hoodie, or a church style head covering made from lace.\n\nShe was half transparent, but had extremely clear features. \n\nI couldn't tell if she was a classical christian angel, or a ghost. The instant I thought she might be a dead spirit, and not an angel, her beautiful face got a bit scary.\n\nI had  surge of fear, and her face became even sharper.  I overcame my fear, and told her I was very happy to see her, but had no idea who she was.  She smiled in a grim sort of way, I felt more fear, and she became solid and stood up next to the bed.  It was goosebump worthy, although I've gotten too used to things like that to actually get any.\n\nShe was around 5 and a half feet tall, on the left of my bed, towards my feet, looking right at me.  At that point I realized, she was not an angel.  Just dressed like a ghost.\n\nI'm afraid that's all I can remember, except that playing around on the red line for the last 2 nights seems to create a tendency for the assemblage point to move back there.\n\nIt comes at a penalty, which is probably why don Juan called it a quagmire.  You get stuck there and when you try to move out, you sink back in.\n\nFancy seems to like that area, which makes sense since she started her dreaming emissary teaching saying, \"I'll teach you Sliding Dreaming\".\n\nCholita calmed down at some point towards the end, and I heard her steps walking calmly as she left the house.  \n\nFor a while I was worried she'd gone back to wanting to murder me.\n\nI don't know where that new tensegrity pass came from.  I learned more than 1000 so I don't remember all of them.  \n\nBut I'll probably take Cholita's advice and not do that anymore.\n\nEdited", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gxmc8k0", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued from Cholita warning me to stop...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her spanish accent became very strong and her voice rose very high as if she were genuinely worried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now is where the order of events will be impossible to recover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, when Carlos wrote that heightened awareness was not like the awareness of our daily world, and he had tried his best to give it the texture of that experience, presumably so that we could comprehend it, that&amp;#39;s very true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, I object a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could be that being pushed with the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow makes the non-linear nature of HA even more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And who am I to criticize how Carlos described it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I firmly believe, the events have a sequence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s only a faulty memory that prevents you from reconstructing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you take a memory, remove all the connections to other memories, and all hints of a time when it happened, it seems to float independant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you didn&amp;#39;t simply forget the connections.  I believe they are present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the rest &amp;quot;kind of&amp;quot; had no time sequence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back into the room,  after spying at the door to hear Cholita, and I was translocated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was clearly not my room, it was not dark at all, and it was amazingly stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got onto the bed to watch it. It was the inside of a structure, could have been a bedroom, but it was alien.  The things on the walls and the furniture leaned 45 degrees down to the left.  You couldn&amp;#39;t put anything on them. It would roll off.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, it looked like a white room with white furniture and shelves.  Like an alien Ikea supplied home.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wiggled my fingers on the second attention spot while I watched it.  I try to do that whenever I remember, hoping to finish Zuleica&amp;#39;s instructions to Carlos. It had nothing to do with the scene, but I figured if it was stable and I had to watch it to figure out how long it would be stable, might as well use the time well.  And see if I could feel that &amp;quot;thick as water&amp;quot; thing Zuleica mentioned, for when you wiggle your fingers there.  To make the dent in the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily showed up.  I wasn&amp;#39;t clear headed enough to remember, that&amp;#39;s how I found Lily in the first place. Doing finger wiggling. She was there in the middle of it all, swimming around in small circles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The finger wiggling had &amp;quot;summoned&amp;quot; her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t remember that could happen, and couldn&amp;#39;t believe she had returned because it was too good to be true.

It was very odd.\n\nI'd say, this pass does what it implies it does.  It seems to intend a cubic centimeter of chance to become available.\n\nIt has a female feel to it, making me wonder if it's not from Clara originally.\n\nI started testing it primarily to see if splashing the ball into your face like that could leave whatever color of light you were compressing \"stuck\" to your vision, so you could use it during recap to keep the attention focused on something that will move the assemblage point.\n\nBut for that I found it too temporary.  In order to get a super intense ball of light from that pass  you have to move your assemblage point too far to be useful to someone who primarily does recap.  If they could already move that far, you'd only have to suggest using a copy of the light while recapping, and they could figure out their own way to get some.\n\nFrom the blue line at the top of the J curve (normal consciousness), it produces colors too weak to be useful longer than a few seconds. It fades to less than background light.\n\nI also find it intriguing that the pass itself seems to imply a delayed reaction.  You break out a chunk of light, form it into a ball, and then instead of compressing it, to make it manifest an object the way Carlos did in Pandora's box pass, you splash your face and wiggle your fingers to maximize the effect. \n\nIt's like splashing water on your face to wake up so you'll be alert to something about to happen.\n\nAfter the first try I looked to see if purple light had stuck to my sight, but I was disappointed to find that the background second attention fog was too bright already, to judge that. My room was already glowing too brightly in purple, to see what might have been done to my sight.\n\nThe cure for that?  The jet black.  Move the assemblage point lower so that the purple second attention fog has some black, to allow you to judge the brightness of what gets stuck to your eyes.\n\nThat's when the weird coincidences began.  After the first time I tried it. But as the coincidences mounted, it took me too long to realize the pass had possibly produced them.  \n\nSo as weird stuff happened that would make a beginner run from the room, I kept doing the pass once in a while to try to \"make it work\".  Like an idiot, I had no idea what it ought to do, despite the name.\n\nI'm afraid remembering the exact order of weird \"coincidences\"  is impossible now, but I'll approximate it.  And I forgot more than I'm mentioning here.  The night was like, \"Oh,  that usually takes 3 hours.  And that too!  Look at that over there.  Is that my old friend...\"\n\nIt was endless.\n\nBut at first I did the pass a total of 6 times, over an hour. Four at the start while I moved my assemblage point far enough to get the balls of light it forms, to be intense enough to seem useful.\n\nBut it was right after the first time I did that pass, when the ball of light was hardly noticeable,  that the entire upper right of the room turned perfect sky blue.\n\nSo people using this pass: You don't have to be able to form bright balls to make it work. I'd suggest messing with it a few times if you've only seen some vague colors, and would like to see more.  We can hope, it's a gift from intent we could make use of along with everything else.\n\nLike Taisha's new book.  That was surely an intent gift!\n\nI've never seen that \"blue sky\" look in a dark room before.  The blue was so intense it could have been that someone ripped the roof off my dark room on a sunny day with no clouds in the sky.\n\nI thought of Taisha helping the women back in the 90s, the instant I saw that sight.\n\nA weird idea: If you want to try out Taisha's sky gazing for \"worms\", do it in the darkroom after forming the sky using that pass.\n\nThat would be **some** kind of sorcery!   But it's in our reach now.  Second attention sky gazing.\n\nIt was perfectly the color of a daytime clear sky, possibly on the lighter blue side of the range, and the only thing that didn't make it look like it was outside the house was that it was halfway transparent.\n\nI could see my phantom bedroom copy in vague white, behind the sky blue.\n\nThese days, I always practice in a phantom copy of my bedroom. Once I thought that up, and put some work into it, it became automatic.\n\nBut then, that's how we got stuck here, isn't it?   Intent is sticky or it wouldn't be so difficult to move the assemblage point.\n\nI started wondering how many possible \"surfaces\" I could discover for my recapitulation project.\n\nThis blue makes 11.  And I just remembered.  Later in that night, I saw a 12th surface.  But the nature of it is gone.  I believe, it was purely the inside of Fairy's Cave. Of her world.  I even remember her little head peeking out from that surface, with me asking her, \"Fairy, is that really you?\"\n\nBut I never investigated.  I was like a kid in a candy store at that point.\n\nFancy materialized just below the sky blue, which was then gone.  I never saw it leave, it was just not there, when I noticed Fancy.\n\nShe seemed to want to play, and did a couple of faces.  She did the weird spin around thing, where her head and part of her torso bump up into the air around 3 inches, and then she does 1 full spin as she falls back to where she started, now in a different face and hair style.\n\nBy the 3rd spin I was certain it was Fancy.  She's the only one who shows off the latest fashions and hair styles, one after the other.\n\nTo a newbie, it means she's hooked to my memories of things associated with fancy women, and pulls on them to get a new appearance on a continuous basis, to stimulate our interaction as \"wow, look at you!\".\n\nMy other IOBs have no interest in that. They get energy from different types of interactions.\n\nOf course, if a newbie really is reading this and hearing about them for the first time, expect a demon, zombie, or monster of some kind.  There's pretty much only one emotion for them to hook to, with a newbie.\n\nFear.  Enjoy it while it lasts! You can learn a lot from how they respond to fear.  At the very least, try to remember to see if they get even more real, after a burst of intense fright from you.\n\nAfter Fancy \"proved\" it was her, by doing the same spinning she'd done 2 nights ago,  that dirt road I drew yesterday materialized.\n\nBut it wasn't the original. It was the one I got off google images.\n\nThe original had grey colored hard dirt, more like colorless decomposing granite sand.\n\nThis was not only the one from my picture, but it had the same curve, and same plants growing along the sides.\n\nSo, remember this:  It's very good for newbies to draw up unusual experiences, because it helps others.\n\nHowever, as you draw it, you alter the experience.  You actually \"re-write\" it in some weird way.\n\nCarlos did that with his books.  He rewrote the whole thing.  How much, we probably won't know until we get some re-run experts.\n\nDon Juan probably rewrote some too.\n\nAt any rate, I had a dirt road/path stretched across my bed.  I was sitting up on pillows, and it was very clearly stretching  in the air across my room, fixed in the air over my legs.  \n\nI could have moved my legs around on the bed, under the path.\n\nIt was so stable I had time to look left and right to try to figure out how far past my bedroom walls it went.\n\nI didn't have time to figure that out, I only noted it was too far to see the end of it.\n\nCholita entered the house.  I don't know where she was before that.\n\nShe was pleading with someone, very loudly.  It was her special voice she uses when she's afraid for dire consequences, and someone hasn't been listening to her.  Her voice squeaked and cracked, as much as Cholita's can.  Her voice is very smooth, and possible slightly lower than average for a woman.\n\nIt was so loud, I wondered if she hadn't brought someone home with her.\n\nCholita is quite mad, but she still loves men.  I don't know if she'd bring one home or not, but it's always possible.\n\nI still had my blackout curtain over the wall closest to Cholita, and there were 4 total walls between me and her,  so I could not make out the conversation. \n\nBut I never heard another person walking next to her on the wooden floors, which echo quite loudly. And I didn't hear anyone else's voice.\n\nI thought, maybe she's on the cellphone, in speaker mode, and I just can't hear the other person.\n\nI also wondered if maybe it was Minx she was arguing with, but she never conflicts with him that long.  Usually if Minx is bothering her, she only complains a single sentence, telling him to stop.\n\nMinx is a little bastard of a demon... Never helps me out, always only does what Cholita wants.  When we get into an argument about something, he's only arguing to back Cholita up.\n\nHe's probably \"Devil's Weed\", whom Carlos released to his private classes.  \"Fairy's\" buddy.\n\nI got up, lifted the blackout curtain away from the door, and strained to hear what Cholita was saying.  \n\nShe had stopped a few seconds.\n\nThen she repeated, 4 times.   With 20 to 50 seconds between, so I couldn't guess if she'd continue.\n\n\"You have to **stop** this!  You **HAVE** to ***stop***!\"\n\nContinued...\n\n(And edited)", "edited": 1620661895.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gxl0rlv", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was testing this pass in the dark room for the last 2 hours, and just had to write down what I can remember.

It seems to intend a cubic centimeter of chance to become available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has a female feel to it, making me wonder if it&amp;#39;s not from Clara originally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started testing it primarily to see if splashing the ball into your face like that could leave whatever color of light you were compressing &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; to your vision, so you could use it during recap to keep the attention focused on something that will move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for that I found it too temporary.  In order to get a super intense ball of light from that pass  you have to move your assemblage point too far to be useful to someone who primarily does recap.  If they could already move that far, you&amp;#39;d only have to suggest using a copy of the light while recapping, and they could figure out their own way to get some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the blue line at the top of the J curve (normal consciousness), it produces colors too weak to be useful longer than a few seconds. It fades to less than background light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also find it intriguing that the pass itself seems to imply a delayed reaction.  You break out a chunk of light, form it into a ball, and then instead of compressing it, to make it manifest an object the way Carlos did in Pandora&amp;#39;s box pass, you splash your face and wiggle your fingers to maximize the effect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like splashing water on your face to wake up so you&amp;#39;ll be alert to something about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the first try I looked to see if purple light had stuck to my sight, but I was disappointed to find that the background second attention fog was too bright already, to judge that. My room was already glowing too brightly in purple, to see what might have been done to my sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cure for that?  The jet black.  Move the assemblage point lower so that the purple second attention fog has some black, to allow you to judge the brightness of what gets stuck to your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when the weird coincidences began.  After the first time I tried it. But as the coincidences mounted, it took me too long to realize the pass had possibly produced them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as weird stuff happened that would make a beginner run from the room, I kept doing the pass once in a while to try to &amp;quot;make it work&amp;quot;.  Like an idiot, I had no idea what it ought to do, despite the name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid remembering the exact order of weird &amp;quot;coincidences&amp;quot;  is impossible now, but I&amp;#39;ll approximate it.  And I forgot more than I&amp;#39;m mentioning here.  The night was like, &amp;quot;Oh,  that usually takes 3 hours.  And that too!  Look at that over there.  Is that my old friend...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was endless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at first I did the pass a total of 6 times, over an hour. Four at the start while I moved my assemblage point far enough to get the balls of light it forms, to be intense enough to seem useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was right after the first time I did that pass, when the ball of light was hardly noticeable,  that the entire upper right of the room turned perfect sky blue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So people using this pass: You don&amp;#39;t have to be able to form bright balls to make it work. I&amp;#39;d suggest messing with it a few times if you&amp;#39;ve only seen some vague colors, and would like to see more.  We can hope, it&amp;#39;s a gift from intent we could make use of along with everything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Taisha&amp;#39;s new book.  That was surely an intent gift!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen that &amp;quot;blue sky&amp;quot; look in a dark room before.  The blue was so intense it could have been that someone ripped the roof off my dark room on a sunny day with no clouds in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought of Taisha helping the women back in the 90s, the instant I saw that sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A weird idea: If you want to try out Taisha&amp;#39;s sky gazing for &amp;quot;worms&amp;quot;, do it in the darkroom after forming the sky using that pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would be &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; kind of sorcery!   But it&amp;#39;s in our reach now.  Second attention sky gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was perfectly the color of a daytime clear sky, possibly on the lighter blue side of the range, and the only thing that didn&amp;#39;t make it look like it was outside the house was that it was halfway transparent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see my phantom bedroom copy in vague white, behind the sky blue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days, I always practice in a phantom copy of my bedroom. Once I thought that up, and put some work into it, it became automatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, that&amp;#39;s how we got stuck here, isn&amp;#39;t it?   Intent is sticky or it wouldn&amp;#39;t be so difficult to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started wondering how many possible &amp;quot;surfaces&amp;quot; I could discover for my recapitulation project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This blue makes 11.  And I just remembered.  Later in that night, I saw a 12th surface.  But the nature of it is gone.  I believe, it was purely the inside of Fairy&amp;#39;s Cave. Of her world.  I even remember her little head peeking out from that surface, with me asking her, &amp;quot;Fairy, is that really you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I never investigated.  I was like a kid in a candy store at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy materialized just below the sky blue, which was then gone.  I never saw it leave, it was just not there, when I noticed Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She seemed to want to play, and did a couple of faces.  She did the weird spin around thing, where her head and part of her torso bump up into the air around 3 inches, and then she does 1 full spin as she falls back to where she started, now in a different face and hair style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the 3rd spin I was certain it was Fancy.  She&amp;#39;s the only one who shows off the latest fashions and hair styles, one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To a newbie, it means she&amp;#39;s hooked to my memories of things associated with fancy women, and pulls on them to get a new appearance on a continuous basis, to stimulate our interaction as &amp;quot;wow, look at you!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My other IOBs have no interest in that. They get energy from different types of interactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, if a newbie really is reading this and hearing about them for the first time, expect a demon, zombie, or monster of some kind.  There&amp;#39;s pretty much only one emotion for them to hook to, with a newbie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear.  Enjoy it while it lasts! You can learn a lot from how they respond to fear.  At the very least, try to remember to see if they get even more real, after a burst of intense fright from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Fancy &amp;quot;proved&amp;quot; it was her, by doing the same spinning she&amp;#39;d done 2 nights ago,  that dirt road I drew yesterday materialized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&amp;#39;t the original. It was the one I got off google images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original had grey colored hard dirt, more like colorless decomposing granite sand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was not only the one from my picture, but it had the same curve, and same plants growing along the sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, remember this:  It&amp;#39;s very good for newbies to draw up unusual experiences, because it helps others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as you draw it, you alter the experience.  You actually &amp;quot;re-write&amp;quot; it in some weird way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos did that with his books.  He rewrote the whole thing.  How much, we probably won&amp;#39;t know until we get some re-run experts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan probably rewrote some too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I had a dirt road/path stretched across my bed.  I was sitting up on pillows, and it was very clearly stretching  in the air across my room, fixed in the air over my legs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could have moved my legs around on the bed, under the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so stable I had time to look left and right to try to figure out how far past my bedroom walls it went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have time to figure that out, I only noted it was too far to see the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita entered the house.  I don&amp;#39;t know where she was before that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was pleading with someone, very loudly.  It was her special voice she uses when she&amp;#39;s afraid for dire consequences, and someone hasn&amp;#39;t been listening to her.  Her voice squeaked and cracked, as much as Cholita&amp;#39;s can.  Her voice is very smooth, and possible slightly lower than average for a woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so loud, I wondered if she hadn&amp;#39;t brought someone home with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is quite mad, but she still loves men.  I don&amp;#39;t know if she&amp;#39;d bring one home or not, but it&amp;#39;s always possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still had my blackout curtain over the wall closest to Cholita, and there were 4 total walls between me and her,  so I could not make out the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I never heard another person walking next to her on the wooden floors, which echo quite loudly. And I didn&amp;#39;t hear anyone else&amp;#39;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought, maybe she&amp;#39;s on the cellphone, in speaker mode, and I just can&amp;#39;t hear the other person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also wondered if maybe it was Minx she was arguing with, but she never conflicts with him that long.  Usually if Minx is bothering her, she only complains a single sentence, telling him to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx is a little bastard of a demon... Never helps me out, always only does what Cholita wants.  When we get into an argument about something, he&amp;#39;s only arguing to back Cholita up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s probably &amp;quot;Devil&amp;#39;s Weed&amp;quot;, whom Carlos released to his private classes.  &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; buddy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up, lifted the blackout curtain away from the door, and strained to hear what Cholita was saying.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had stopped a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she repeated, 4 times.   With 20 to 50 seconds between, so I couldn&amp;#39;t guess if she&amp;#39;d continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have to &lt;strong&gt;stop&lt;/strong&gt; this!  You &lt;strong&gt;HAVE&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(And

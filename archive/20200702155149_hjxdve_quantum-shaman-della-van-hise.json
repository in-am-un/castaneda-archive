He then wrote about that his Experience and helped others follow that Path.\n\nMy POV from my first memories is the opposite, the spiritual and paranormal was as much as part of my Life as anything else.

I just *do* the things I do, it's not something I had to really train myself to do (I'm thinking about how I might want to train, but that's a future decision).  I regularly find out that I've done things that people can't/don't/aren't supposed to do, but I just did them without any problem (it was years later I found out that is sorcery, lol).  As you realize, expecting to be able to do something is half the battle, and not being willing to accept the limitations other people do is key to that battle.  I skipped all that other people's limitation part, and for me to bind to anyone else's *intent* would be doing exactly that.\n\nI can't teach anyone else my Path, because I don't know how I do what I do.  But I can describe the things I do and the Experiences I have, discussing them with others who have similar Experiences regardless of their tradition or Lineage (\"Game knows Game\" as the saying goes).

My *intent* is to **AVOID** any book deal, followers, money, or any of that nonsense.  \n\nI get that my *intent* is near incomprehensible from a sorcerous POV, which I suspect contributes to the miscommunications between us.\n\nI 100% understand your position concerning Castaneda, and I would NEVER ask you to change that or say you are ANYTHING but perfectly legitimate in your position.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to agree with you.\n\nWhat position would you have me take on Castaneda?  I've already acknowledged his legitimacy and greatness as a sorceror, so that's not the issue.  I've pieced together my model of Castaneda from all my various sources, you included.  You have definitely mellowed my opinion of him, and opened avenues of possibility for him I had not considered before our discussions.  Are you actually saying I should just adopt YOUR position rather than respectfully stick to my own while allowing you input into my position?  \n\nIMO, that seems rather rude and presumptuous of you, YMMV.\n\nI've never claimed to be part of Castaneda's Lineage.  I'm grateful for his books allowing me very needed insights into my own experiences.  I'm an Egalitarian who does not do the whole Master/Apprentice thang which is so popular in the spiritual community.  The only significant Lineage I claim in this Life is one of Friendship, Love, and Intellectual Companionship, started by Church, and passed down through Turing to Hilton to me.  \n\nOne major fact which you possibly have not *seen* is that I am a natural sorceror who never traded their connection with the Nagual for their connection with the Consensus.  Where others broke thier connection to magick to join the Consensus, I never lost any more connection absolutely necessary. While Castaneda was a lifeline in starting to making intellectual sense of my natural sorcery, I find Chakras and the Indian traditions as a better match to my natural intuitions than Castaneda's system.  \n\nI'm currently trying to form my own syncretic Gnosis of the various traditions, hence my current revising of Castaneda.  I am taking the claims from the various traditions and attempting to reconcile them against each other and against my experiences using my natural sorcery and understanding. \n\nI have my model of Reality extracted from my experience, and I compare new claims to that model.  I don't spread any \"false\" information, because I'm sharing my personal POV and not claiming any \"truth\".\n\nMy post was motivated SOLELY out of concern for others who might be using this method without realizing the consequences.  If someone does this knowing, that's their informed choice, but I would prefer people to make sure about this using their own discernment.  I have my biases, and own them as much as possible.\n\nI do honestly see this as a potential existential threat to the unaware.  I would be betraying my *intent* not to mention to others my concerns.  They can decide for themselves that I'm Chicken Little.  I'd rather that than remain silent and let them hurt themselves ignorantly.

My &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is to &lt;strong&gt;AVOID&lt;/strong&gt; any book deal, followers, money, or any of that nonsense.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get that my &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is near incomprehensible from a sorcerous POV, which I suspect contributes to the miscommunications between us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I 100% understand your position concerning Castaneda, and I would NEVER ask you to change that or say you are ANYTHING but perfectly legitimate in your position.  But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;m going to agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What position would you have me take on Castaneda?  I&amp;#39;ve already acknowledged his legitimacy and greatness as a sorceror, so that&amp;#39;s not the issue.  I&amp;#39;ve pieced together my model of Castaneda from all my various sources, you included.  You have definitely mellowed my opinion of him, and opened avenues of possibility for him I had not considered before our discussions.  Are you actually saying I should just adopt YOUR position rather than respectfully stick to my own while allowing you input into my position?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO, that seems rather rude and presumptuous of you, YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never claimed to be part of Castaneda&amp;#39;s Lineage.  I&amp;#39;m grateful for his books allowing me very needed insights into my own experiences.  I&amp;#39;m an Egalitarian who does not do the whole Master/Apprentice thang which is so popular in the spiritual community.  The only significant Lineage I claim in this Life is one of Friendship, Love, and Intellectual Companionship, started by Church, and passed down through Turing to Hilton to me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One major fact which you possibly have not &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; is that I am a natural sorceror who never traded their connection with the Nagual for their connection with the Consensus.  Where others broke thier connection to magick to join the Consensus, I never lost any more connection absolutely necessary. While Castaneda was a lifeline in starting to making intellectual sense of my natural sorcery, I find Chakras and the Indian traditions as a better match to my natural intuitions than Castaneda&amp;#39;s system.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently trying to form my own syncretic Gnosis of the various traditions, hence my current revising of Castaneda.  I am taking the claims from the various traditions and attempting to reconcile them against each other and against my experiences using my natural sorcery and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have my model of Reality extracted from my experience, and I compare new claims to that model.  I don&amp;#39;t spread any &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; information, because I&amp;#39;m sharing my personal POV and not claiming any &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My post was motivated SOLELY out of concern for others who might be using this method without realizing the consequences.  If someone does this knowing, that&amp;#39;s their informed choice, but I would prefer people to make sure about this using their own discernment.  I have my biases, and own them as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do honestly see this as a potential existential threat to the unaware.  I would be betraying my &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; not to mention to others my concerns.  They can decide for themselves that I&amp;#39;m Chicken Little.  I&amp;#39;d rather that than remain silent and let them hurt themselves ignorantly.  YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;intend&lt;/em&gt; no one harm, and &lt;em&gt;intend&lt;/em&gt; to help all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Respect and Love, Good Luck on your Path&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_hjxdve", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hjxdve/quantum_shaman_della_van_hise/fwtrh8o/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1593799438.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1593799438.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fwtccyh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fwspqib", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The Taiwanese Bosses' son suspects you're an inventory collector.\n\nI've seen some hints of it, in the criticisms of Carlos you had, which essentially came from other sources and make no sense at all now, with me proving his sorcery works.\n\nBut you repeated them anyway, because they're part of your inventory.\n\nYou sure you didn't pick up bogus old sorcerer double information from a me-too source?\n\nMy seeing is pretty advanced, and there's nothing like that out there, as far as I can tell.\n\nSame as the fliers.

Turns out it was true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, it never occurred to me the monks surely used that as an excuse to visit prostitutes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to check into a hospital as a result of heightened awareness, but my guide said they&amp;#39;d never let me out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was seeing blue puffs instead of purple ones, in full sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And forming chi balls I could cast out into the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to get colors &amp;quot;started&amp;quot;, because I never had anyone telling me to try to do that.  I just got them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A gift from Little Smoke I suspect.  He pulled me into a tunnel while I was sitting on my hotel steps, watching an orange cat jump up apartment levels across the narrow lane. It seemed to be impossible. But that cat could jump that high with no effort.  He was the hotel&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;patrol cat&amp;quot;.  For rats.  The building was surrounded by thousands of rats, waiting for the cat to slack off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching the cat jump, I fell back into the tunnel Carol Tiggs had shown me, and got a lesson in our lineage, from the Emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little smoke in his teaching form.  Same Emissary Carlos spent so much time with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do in fact have a Chinese pirate in there!  But his boat was a little too &amp;quot;English&amp;quot; looking to me. I couldn&amp;#39;t figure that out.  Maybe he stole it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the Tensegrity, don&amp;#39;t go for something exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try, &amp;quot;Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass&amp;quot; from the Tensegrity section of the wiki, and &amp;quot;Pandora&amp;#39;s Box&amp;quot;.  And &amp;quot;mashing energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to see the colors in those.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_m6flqq", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/m6flqq/iob_stealing_my_energy/gr6nlrt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1615940380.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1615940380.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gr9e812", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "HasenPffefer", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1616003376.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gr868ew", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3ddw4gzc", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I'll get back to pracicing.

I&amp;#39;ve been wishing Cholita would become a cigar witch, instead of complaining about the smell in my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible we should recommend nicotine gum at first!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see a color, start chewing frantically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a puff in your hand, pop a second piece in your mouth with the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see it now. The imitation Carlos would do, making fun of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could even invent some new Tensegrity moves!  Same as the old ones, but you have pockets stuffed with &amp;quot;benign aids&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So at one point when the hand moves like Carlos designed, it pops a nicotine pill into your mouth, on the way to wherever it was supposed to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the form, you down an espresso double shot can as a reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d just keep the Frank Booth canister of gas from Blue Velvet out of there. It&amp;#39;s unseemly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/285415695108102065/\"&gt;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/285415695108102065/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But probably, Reni and Miles would not approve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect Cholita could convince Mexico to redesign for that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could make the props all be, &amp;quot;Cleargreen Mexico&amp;quot; approved products.

Wouldn&amp;#39;t such a thing become common knowledge, so that all news programs were trying to solve the mystery of people disappearing or dropping dead with no cause?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not happening!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The IOBs are as plentiful as other forms of life on this planet, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes no sense at all that they are much of a threat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, if you can get attacked by one, isn&amp;#39;t it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha used to warn the women not to do tensegrity barefoot, outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said a wormlike IOB can crawl up your leg and drain your energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I ask you!  Wouldn&amp;#39;t you like to see that???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than worry about it, I say we &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; them.  Figure out where they can be found (LA parks are one place), then get someone who can see energy to watch their behavior, and I&amp;#39;ll get Cholita to make a little cage for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She builds stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why hide from magic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because people are pretending. They hide, because they have none, and that makes a reasonable excuse for laziness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, &amp;quot;I would learn to do so and so (which requires a lot of hard work), but it&amp;#39;s actually rather dangerous to do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_m6flqq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/m6flqq/iob_stealing_my_energy/gr9aazp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1616001656.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1616001656.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gr75txi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Crikett", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1615950208.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gr5j298", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_965yy", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "What about the Predators Carlos mentioned?

At this stage, I would almost advise you to stop thinking about this so much, it's entirely irrelevant and holding you back. You are literally in the hole right now and need to forget stuff.  Just trying to poke in enough so you will start giving gazing a try - and then you can make your own conclusion.\n\nconstruction point yes... it is what constructs your view of reality. Change it's position - you will perceive different worlds or levels of this world. simple as that.   It's almost meaningless to be thinking at the level you are thinking at here, it will only obstruct your learning. Nice way to say what dan said. He;s been burned a lot by people that post like you. Very/most difficult type of persona to convince of magic. You are very deep into the muck.\n\nPrioritize a few hours of dark room gazing per day. I wouldn't read another word or try to make sense of anything until you can slog through for a bit. All of the work will be to force silence and get this dialogue/ongoing monologue of understanding of yours quiet so you can start seeing magical things.

I\u2019ll post a full report on it\u2026 well, maybe not.. it might be viewed as offensive or some such.. perhaps another Reddit category would be suitable for that. I have no desire to antagonize anyone\u2019s practices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I\u2019ve read on the forum, there is a very strict dogma in place and any deviation is frowned upon and the ridiculed as somehow inferior. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s a rigidity I cannot condone on my own path. It seems limiting to walk another\u2019s path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To share a path for a time is one thing, but to twist the self into knots and restrictions trying to take each step in the footsteps of another is perplexing to my philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that I will finish my reading of CC\u2019s works and the teaching of DJ. I\u2019ll let the words and concepts speak to me directly and anything useful, repeatable and reliable will be adapted. The rigidity and inflexibility to grow and take the practice beyond where I found it will be discarded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;like music, jazz.. improvisation and a dynamic flow of the energy. That\u2019s what feels more right- more right for me\u2026 \nEach must do what is right for them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do remember a great line from the first book. (Paraphrasing) - you dont have to talk yourself into being on the path of heart.. its only a path without heart that requires that kind of work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really good wisdom in that book, it would have been cool to meet DJ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it changed in later books, but CC seemed constantly terrified by the experiences.. hell lol- the end of that first book was some creepy shit for sure lol \ud83d\ude06- DJ but not DJ trying to lure him off his spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_po1d7l", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/po1d7l/is_the_description_of_the_assemblage_point/hcyddtd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1631716392.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1631716392.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hcy0fxz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hcuuuq0", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/po1d7l/is_the_description_of_the_assemblage_point/hcy0fxz/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hcy0fxz", "created": 1631710323.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1631710323.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hcuuuq0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Psitarron", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hcuojey", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_9bv1pkm6", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I don\u2019t have room for a dark room lol! \nBut I do have a great sleep mask- that thing is abyss levels of dark.

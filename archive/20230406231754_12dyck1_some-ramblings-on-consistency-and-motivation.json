Something weird happened and I ended up having to reinstall Windows on my PC. Before I figured out what was wrong, I entered fully into \"troubleshooting mode\" aka mental masturbation on overdrive.\n\nI skipped two days of practice because I was just too irked and mentally preoccupied to even consider doing darkroom. I was not in the right frame of mind, I rationalized to myself. \"Wednesday will be the day. I'll have a good practice session then!\" Well yesterday was a perfect ski day at my local mountain so I just had to take the day off to shred some powder. Surprisingly, I felt pretty energetic while driving back and I wanted to capitalize on that mood by practicing as soon as I got home. Instead of going straight to the darkroom, I got caught up with a bunch of other things and kept telling myself \"oh I'll practice after this\" or \"I'll practice after dinner\" or \"I'll practice after washing the dishes\". I looked at the clock and it was already 11:30 PM and I was dead tired with a fatigued body at that point. \n\nI spent the next 30 minutes in a mental quandary. The tonal mind was relentless: \"Oh you're just going to fall asleep instantly and waste your time! Your legs and body are fatigued, how can you even do any tensegrity in this state? And didn't you say that darkroom was useless without tensegrity? Plus, you skipped two days in a row, what makes you think you're gonna have a productive or badass session tonight? You don't even have the energy for that! Just go to sleep and try tomorrow!\" \n\nAfter all that, I realized that it was useless trying to employ the reasoning mind on this kind of affair. That's precious energy wasted on mental masturbation just to come up with a decision. Before my tonal mind could tell me otherwise, I ran into my darkroom aggressively, ball gagged Mr. Mental Masturbator, and got to work doing some low impact tensegrity forms. \n\nIt only took a few minutes of work to feel relieved. There was magic in the air! Even though this stuff was not particularly impressive and were sights I had already seen many times, I still received a minor intent gift. The doing of ruthlessly locking myself in my darkroom and of forcedly silencing the complaints of the rational mind pleased intent. I know this because there was no way I could have been seeing vibrant puffs and swirling energy in the state I was in; I was too fatigued, tired and sleep deprived to have had enough energy for that! \n\nAnd witnessing that magic last night carried forward to today and informs my commitment to consistent practice. \n\nWhich got me thinking, motivation and consistency act like a feedback loop; the more motivation you have, the more consistency in results you get. And conversely, the more consistent with practice, the more motivation for further practice accrues. Nothing new here. So it's no surprise that if consistency lapses and you skip a couple days, and you'll feel less and less motivated to practice. And no consistency = meager results; you need accrued momentum from consistent practice to build up to truly amazing experiences. \n\nBut motivation is probably one of the biggest obstacles beginners face on this path. We need all the motivation we can get because this is such a difficult path. In absence of in-person social groups, \"gurus\" telling you what to do and the organizational support structure common in other paths, we have to rely solely on our own personal motivation to get our butts into the darkroom. And motivation is then extremely difficult to sustain because most of us starting off don\u2019t see any real magic whatsoever for weeks/months on end. \n\nI certainly remember motivation being a big problem in the beginning. I often felt discouraged because I was barely getting any results while investing all this time to this practice, time which I could have spent playing video games or watching Netflix. And a lack of regular results is a big hit on motivation, which diminishes chances of building a consistent practice needed for more magic. \n\nSo how can motivation be sustained so we'll feel inclined to practice consistently? One method I like is to fully saturate myself with the right intent from this path all the time. Regular reading and rereading of the books, listening to the audiobooks (available free on YouTube), practicing new tensegrity forms, revisiting old posts right on this sub, practicing silence outside the darkroom, etc attack the tonal's reluctance to practice from multiple fronts. But the timing of that motivation is also very important. I particularly enjoy listening to the audiobooks, focusing on the spoken word right before practice time because that gets me into the right mindset and pumps my motivation. And more motivation = less bothersome and convincing internal dialogue trying to get you out of doing the hard work in the darkroom. \n\nBuilding motivation and consistency also implies restraining oneself from consuming material from other systems/religions. Content from other paths don't carry the right intent and can cause serious doubts to form. Doubts such as whether this system is \"right\" or the \"best one\". And it's difficult to sustain motivation needed for practice with all of those doubts in mind. Besides, these doubts are probably things that might just be answered by infinity later on so there's no use questioning and pondering things.

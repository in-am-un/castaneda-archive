One Carlos recommended.](https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b226043828d17d6fe94f7fc77cd14be8b549e3ac)\n\nCarlos wrote one of his last publications, \"Silent Knowledge\" because he couldn't remain with us.  He was dying of liver cancer.\n\nIn the past he could have escaped that fate, but it really drains energy from sorcerers to handle too many apprentices.\n\nAnd Carlos had thousands. I sure wish I knew how many, but it's the entire workshop crowd, worldwide. All of them. It's huge.\n\nAnd bastards they were, nearly all.  Still are!\n\nBut that's nothing new.  Anyone who hasn't realized how screwed up human beings are, won't do well in here. Or anywhere else that claims to help you learn this form of sorcery.\n\nIt's probably one reason don Juan told Carlos, all the people he knew who had succeeded in learning sorcery, came from those as downtrodden and miserable as the children licking dinner plates at an open air restaurant in Mexico City.  Customers would leave, and they'd run up to lick the plates. They were orphans.\n\nThose have the best chance to escape.\n\nThe kids who have wealthy and famous parents  have the least chance.  I won't go into why. It ought to be obvious.\n\nBut I will repeat something one of the senior witches said.  Probably Zuleica.\n\nIf you meet handsome or beautiful people, you are standing near some of the most miserable beings you will ever find.\n\nHere's one path to escape that \"River of Shit\" we all live in.\n\nIt's pretty much 100% the path Carlos gave us at the end.  If there's a deviation, it's only because my specialty is waking dreaming and inorganic beings.  And this path doesn't work well, unless you get rewarded along the way.  With undeniable magic, right in your face.\n\nIn fact, with no rewards,  so far not a single person has even made it to the \"Stuff Puffs\" level in this picture.  Don't let anyone out there fool you. They know nothing at all.\n\nBut if you follow instructions, you'll make it all the way to the end of this path.\n\nExcept, if you really do get an outfit like that gypsy, send me a picture.  I'll try to get Cholita to wear it too.  Gypsies are cool!\n\nEverything in this pic is just what I see.  Nightly.\n\nBut for the last picture, the Medium with the crystal ball, go back a couple of posts and see all the magic swimming in the air, one thing leading to another.\n\nThat's what Silent Knowledge is like.  I just couldn't fit that in the picture.\n\nSometimes it looks like that.   But as don  Juan told us in that Silent Knowledge publication, you have a choice on the appearance.\n\nHe recommended Carlos read text, to get his answers. And he did, we saw him do that in class.\n\nDon Juan explained, modern man reads.  They're readers.\n\nSo why not \"read\" silent knowledge.\n\nThe old seers were \"scene watchers\". They viewed videos in the sky, or on the walls of their homes.\n\nBut don Juan didn't live to see the cell phone.  It dominates how we learn these days.\n\nSo I say, choose multi-media presentations.  Being a \"reader\" is old hat. We're cell phoners!\n\nSuper computer in our hand.\n\nThe thing about Silent Knowledge is, it has to be the same Silent Knowledge for everyone.  So it's flexible.\n\nAnd our ancestors possibly lived in trees, over a swamp.  They'd scurry down to look for stuff to eat, then scurry back up to safety.\n\nIt has to work for them.\n\n1000 years from now, our ancestors will be cyborgs in space,  but it still has to work for them.\n\nSo the \"method of viewing\" is up to you.\n\nOr you can just \"know\" things.  But I don't recommend that.\n\nThe entire Castaneda community pretends they can \"just know things\", because it's self-flattering.\n\nFor a while, please, try to do it this way.  Where you see, smell, hear, and know things.  And if you get it wrong, your ally zips in to explain it for you.\n\nThis picture however is not really a map for you to follow.\n\nToo many details is not a good thing.  So make your own map.\n\nDo the tensegrity, in the dark room.  Keep your eyes open, and emphasize forcing that internal dialogue off above all else, the ENTIRE TIME.\n\nScoop the puffs.  Watch the room.  When you see the whitish light on surfaces, you have a shot at wearing the \"Seer Garb\".\n\nBut there is one thing I must warn you about.\n\nTHERE ARE NO SHORTCUTS.  At least, not at first.  Later of course, you will be able to switch to Silent Knowledge in seconds if needed.\n\nBut at first, I'd say 3 hours is a very good job.  And you might get stuck having to work hard for 6 hours to get there.\n\nThe mistake comes when you reach the whitish light, and start looking around the room for Silent Knowledge.\n\nThat's where the answers to all of the questions in the universe float around you, fully visible. Text just scrolls across the room, to tell you things you wanted to know but could not figure out.\n\nWhen you reach the whitish ligh, it's tempting to think you made it, and to try to enjoy the fruits of all that work.\n\nAnd then instead of 3  hours, it will take 6.  You NEED the phantom copy of your room.  You NEED little dreams to burn into the air in front of you, so realistic it looks like you could crawl in there on your hands and knees.\n\nAnd for Silent Knowledge, you NEED the weird alien objects to materialize, and stay there as long as you like.  They NEED to look 100% real and vividly colorful.\n\nEAch of those things, \"tests\" some human ability, which I can't explain to you at this point.\n\nAnd when you are capable of understanding, you won't need any explanations.\n\nIt's a bitch...\n\nThis is likely part of why Carlos and the Witches didn't like giving details.\n\nDetails interfere with the intent of what you are trying to do.\n\nWhen you don't know any, and follow this path, you \"discover\" what you need to discover, at the appropriate time.\n\nAll those pictures for example, will happen to you.\n\nBut the next time, you are no longer \"innocent\".\n\nSo you \"expect\" each thing.\n\nFrom my experience, you can get away with that just one night.  But you'll be punished for expecting things, and they'll be dim, and a bit crummy.\n\nFortunately, \"Silent Knowledge\" seems to be somewhat fixed, so as long as  you get there, it'll be spectacular.\n\nBut if you do too much \"expecting\" along the way, you have SERIOUSLY deviated  your \"*intent*\".\n\nLook at it this way.  Sorcery is the process of \"Cleaning your Link to Intent\".\n\nSo it must be contaminated at this point.\n\nAnd it turns out, it is.\n\nIf you \"expect\" one of these results, your expectations are **infected** with bad player thinking.\n\nIf you can get to the end of this path, you'll be beyond book deal thinking.\n\nBut still,  you'll have \"wait till I tell my buddy\" thinking.\n\nAnd, \"hope the alien machinery shows up for a long time\" thinking.\n\nAnd, \"Why didn't I look deeper into that phantom room, to see if it was possible to enter?\"\n\nThe possible \"bad intent\" along the way, when you know what's coming, is endless.\n\nWhen you can see that for yourself, and understand what I am saying, you'll be well on your way to \"cleaning your link to intent\".\n\nUntil then, just stick to the path.  You won't speed things up with cheating.\n\nNew people:\n\nNo drugs.\n\nEyes open.\n\nAbsolutely dark room best.  Some use sleeping masks.\n\nMust do some tensegrity.  Mashing energy for intent is highly recommended.\n\nNeed to be able to walk around at least a bit, to survive for the needed 3 hours minimum.\n\nAnd yes, it does look every bit that vivid!\n\nScrew the Buddha.  What a putz.\n\nSorcerers are the only ones around these days, with this much magic.\n\nIf you don't yet realize that, enjoy the river of shit.  But be warned, you can't argue or bully you way out of that.\n\nIt's simply how things are these days.\n\nif there were something else out there, I wouldn't be in here.\n\nNone of us get paid to put up with the bad players who attack here constantly.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sometimes There's No Shortcut", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "link_ids": ["t3_jkedo9", "t3_ixrw34", "t3_iubqq2", "t3_kea5zt", "t3_lwckni", "t3_lwcg6o", "t3_lqz7b6", "t3_lqr6zf", "t3_lnt8a6", "t3_lmp574", "t3_lm4zws", "t3_ll9z5w", "t3_lelqm7", "t3_leo7sy", "t3_ld3845", "t3_lc1ls0", "t3_lbsls8", "t3_l7cp8f", "t3_l6o7at", "t3_mz3kz7", "t3_mzx9gl", "t3_m0kyjq", "t3_lwwshw", "t3_m1oqf1", "t3_mx3d2u", "t3_mw8sve", "t3_mtfwhb", "t3_m2u0a0", "t3_mrkitp", "t3_mlhy6f", "t3_mauwly", "t3_cm1zxx", "t3_m30hb1", "t3_n17jdy", "t3_n1ljja", "t3_n7pwp8", "t3_n7zeae", "t3_naznr8", "t3_nc8q8m", "t3_ndsc7q", "t3_neslbo", "t3_nfw7xg", "t3_nir9g2", "t3_nk25ms", "t3_nkyszq", "t3_nogrjo", "t3_ns7tky", "t3_nvehdz", "t3_o0ifzx", "t3_o3inhw", "t3_o53rhe", "t3_o7qp2a", "t3_ogafdn", "t3_org1tv", "t3_owrd1h", "t3_ovqmgq", "t3_oyt4zt", "t3_oxczfa", "t3_ogzoth", "t3_pcyx4h", "t3_p9anre", "t3_p8asd8", "t3_p6ga7i", "t3_p5l6ye", "t3_p0fmbc", "t3_ozfrz4", "t3_pij28q", "t3_posqcc", "t3_pu14ic", "t3_pwrrc0", "t3_pxfw1a", "t3_q1fcee", "t3_q4x5cs", "t3_q57hxg", "t3_q7jpwq", "t3_q7snvr", "t3_q9epxq", "t3_qceavx", "t3_qctyq7", "t3_qdp6bb", "t3_q9idzp", "t3_qklney", "t3_qmbwgp", "t3_qn9y63", "t3_qo8gj1", "t3_qpoc9e", "t3_qr6cta", "t3_qqyzj8", "t3_rwu1f0", "t3_rw73iz", "t3_rb5o0q", "t3_sdgq2p", "t3_sf44pk", "t3_te7jnl", "t3_tu3w80", "t3_tzc628"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 2", "created_at_utc": 1611109587.162, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1676831407.209, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3wmtjqxwsen81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=902e950a9ab911658c2e0fbc381c3e43c8aeea88"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38f14ce26005b9eed0b18d97d5f256df90e57034"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eea4e1478633e0a85332ec560c9d8f874a478c4"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=568909b8be80695f58372f5c83d9148a93719ae5"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5a04a45505934014aee68da2f05381884c4f91"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6908f0d54ffdcbe9941afecb06d0af4566b2d4c"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b226043828d17d6fe94f7fc77cd14be8b549e3ac"}, "id": "3wmtjqxwsen81"}}, "name": "t3_te7jnl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EoQMxRMDWEDA4lSLExSAlILdDiTdHyEQrua_XpPdcBw.jpg", "edited": 1647298745.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1647291265.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3wmtjqxwsen81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b226043828d17d6fe94f7fc77cd14be8b549e3ac\"&gt;One path to Silent Knowledge.

Sorcery is the process of &amp;quot;Cleaning your Link to Intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it must be contaminated at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it turns out, it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; one of these results, your expectations are &lt;strong&gt;infected&lt;/strong&gt; with bad player thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can get to the end of this path, you&amp;#39;ll be beyond book deal thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still,  you&amp;#39;ll have &amp;quot;wait till I tell my buddy&amp;quot; thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, &amp;quot;hope the alien machinery shows up for a long time&amp;quot; thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, &amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#39;t I look deeper into that phantom room, to see if it was possible to enter?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The possible &amp;quot;bad intent&amp;quot; along the way, when you know what&amp;#39;s coming, is endless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can see that for yourself, and understand what I am saying, you&amp;#39;ll be well on your way to &amp;quot;cleaning your link to intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, just stick to the path.  You won&amp;#39;t speed things up with cheating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New people:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely dark room best.  Some use sleeping masks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must do some tensegrity.  Mashing energy for intent is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Need to be able to walk around at least a bit, to survive for the needed 3 hours minimum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, it does look every bit that vivid!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Screw the Buddha.  What a putz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers are the only ones around these days, with this much magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t yet realize that, enjoy the river of shit.  But be warned, you can&amp;#39;t argue or bully you way out of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simply how things are these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if there were something else out there, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of us get paid to put up with the bad players who attack here constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "te7jnl", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 35, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/te7jnl/sometimes_theres_no_shortcut/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/te7jnl/sometimes_theres_no_shortcut/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1647291265.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 7, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_te7jnl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i5zni55", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i0rfnar", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Since this is the most recent comment with mention of \"organs\" in it, I'll put this here:\n\n[https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/](https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/) \\-  from Miles Reid\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20191112102603/https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/](https://web.archive.org/web/20191112102603/https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/) \\- backup", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i5zni55", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since this is the most recent comment with mention of &amp;quot;organs&amp;quot;

(Fancy does that).\n\nReaching behind the wall to pull out a magical object, or because your inorganic being was teaching you something and wanted you to reach back there.  And you didn't realize the wall was there because the room is dark. But when you pull the object out, you notice that to reach so far, you had to lean against that very wall.\n\nCholita used to pass through the walls of my locked room at night.  On a regular basis.  Sometimes with \"Minx\" (likely Devil's Weed) following her like a puppy.  If I noticed her entrance, she might stop and put on a show for me, like she was an Angel who could float up into the air.  Or she'd go back out, and then just stick her head through the door, without her body, like she was a ghost who could just look into rooms.\n\nI keep my bedroom door locked because the Tonal Cholita wants to murder me.  I find daggers pointed at my heart under the bed,  and crumbled flowers, with Cholita hoping the bed frame collapses.  She poured an entire bottle of Sangria on my mattress, and then put the bedspread back over it, like nothing had happened.  Hoping I'd slide in there.\n\nShe once made it \"rain\" in my bedroom, destroying all the electronics.\n\nAll she had to say was, \"It's nothing.\"\n\nBut her double, which likes me,  walks through the walls to wake me up to play.  She touches me with her right index finger, and it's about as strong as an infant's touch.\n\nOddly, its around as strong as the Allies are in the \"real\" world.\n\nWhen she sees I'm awake and noticed her, she takes off running through the bed, and down the south wall.\n\nTrust me when I say, it's an AMAZING sight.  I prefer when she brings a zombie along,  but in those cases she doesn't take off running.\n\nThe south wall leads on the path she likes, for going to LA.  Through Long Beach.  She likes the Santa Monica pier, and that path leads to the beach going north directly to it.\n\nThe first time I chased her I went too far, passed through 3 walls in the house, and then panicked and ran back.  From my point of view, she ran down a forest trail, which just happened to materialize on my south wall.  But when I got 20 feet down it, I realized there was no forest trail in my house!\n\nBy the way, when I got back in the room, I turned on the lights to try to figure out what had happened.\n\nI have to say that, because bad players like to make up things, based on an ordinary dream they had. It was the \"currency\" in the attention seeking Castaneda community for decades.  Lying about your ordinary dreams, to make them sound magical.\n\nIt's one reason I advise people, DON'T DO THE CLOSED EYE METHOD!  You'll just keep making stuff up based on dozing off into a dream.\n\nI believe we had a post from a guy doing that, just yesterday.  He passed out from drugs, and then posted it like a sorcery experience.\n\nHere's some advice:  If you run through a wall in your home and realize it, just sit down and wait. Or move some stuff around.  Don't be an idiot and run back to your room!  If you can't pass through the walls anymore, and your door was locked, so much the better!\n\nIf you find yourself in  your house somewhere, with no memory of how you got there, look around and everything is normal, but then you notice the walls are vibrating in a very strange way, you have changed over to your double!  Do your best to move objects, and then leave the house and go for a walk.  DON'T GO BACK TO BED!\n\nDO NOT ASSUME that if you were in your double, and went back to bed, you'd see your physical body sleeping there.\n\nThe Double can make 10,000 copies of your bedroom, and only one of them will have you sleeping there.\n\nThe 10,000 number came from Carlos.  Reluctantly.\n\nAnd if you go outside and discover you can lift your car in your hand, go for a walk.  Don't go back to the house.  Walk as far as you can, until he sun comes up, then see what's going on.\n\nNever hide the evidence!  This principle comes from the 4th gate, so it's a sorcery tip.\n\nOn another occasion I was playing with shape shifting, and decided to call it quits for the night.  But Cholita had been dodging the rules again and was headed for trouble with the highway patrol.\n\nSo I left my darkroom, went outside into the yard (around 4AM), and found Cholita had watered.\n\nShe has a spot on the grass she waters obsessively. Some kind of spell.  In the past, she had a continuous stream of water flowing from the back yard to the front, until the neighbors complained.\n\nMy feet were cold from the wet grass at 4AM, so I tip toed to avoid getting my entire foot soaked. I reached the sidewalk, and found Cholita had scattered sharp pebbles right in the path.  On purpose for sure!  We don't have any sharp pebbles like t hat in our yard, and it was a nice tight circle of pebbles I was sure to step on.\n\nThat's the only path to get to the driveway. Cholita blocked the others by ordering the gardener never to cut certain bushes.  The Mexican gardener is afraid of  her. He knows what she is.\n\nI stepped right onto the sharp pebbles!   I was cursing and hoping up and down by the time I got to her car in the driveway.\n\nNot wanting to walk around it (I was in pain), I lifted the entire car in one hand, to see if she'd put the registration sticker in the right spot on the license plate, or just dropped it under the car as a \"kiss my ass\" gesture.\n\nOne time she pierced my front tire with a razor blade, and then left the razor blade under the wheel, so I'd know she had done it.\n\nBut the fact that she eggs my car from time to time, is also a good clue.\n\nAfter lifting the car with one hand, I realized I had shape shifted into some kind of Gargantua, from the Victorian era story.  I looked around worried, but the streets were empty of people. Which was odd.  Even at 4, the should be someone out.\n\nCarlos warned us about that particular transformation in class, but I had no idea what he was talking about.  In fact, it was the main one he gave us details for.  It's a far right shift anywhere from green line down to the bottom.  I had been at the very bottom.\n\nWhen he began to explain in more detail, one of the women wanted to know what was to the left.  She'd taken a fancy to the idea of turning into a dragon fly.\n\nNow, are you thinking book deal mind?\n\nAnyone thinking like that?\n\nYou mostly won't succeed in here if that's the first thing that comes to mind. I'd say, your \"ruined\" and should hang it up. It's an intense need to gain attention from other people. That's the problem.\n\n\"Hey, if I could PROVE I'm a \"magic man\", imagine how much admiration I could get!!!!\"\n\nDon't ever think like that.  It would never occur to me, so I worry a bit for anyone who has to suppress that feeling, even if they don't succumb.\n\nIt'll hold you back.  You will NEVER clean your link to intent with that floating around in your mind.\n\nCholita is capable of doing \"magic tricks\" for people, but won't.  The witches did a number on her in that regards.\n\n\"NEVER\".  Or something like that.  She won't tell me.\n\nOnce you go down that road of greed, forever will it dominate your destiny...\n\n(Had to get that Yoda advice in there).\n\nMay the force be with you!", "edited": 1647618372.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i15uc9w", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objects moving by themselves, water going at a 45 degree angle in the shower,   walking right through the wall of your bedroom to follow something you saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Objects spontaneously bursting when no one was around to cause that, but you later see a cloud of smoke running away from the scene.

"body": "&gt;How old were you when you started learning these things?\n\n9.  Back in 65.\n\n\\&gt;Is Lily a human spirit?\n\nLily was never human.  She's a more common form of life, than life forms like humans, plants, and animals.\n\nLittle Smoke, the gang leader of all of this, comes from 43 billion light years away, at the center of the galaxy.\n\nShe's said to be the closest to human, that this type of life form can get.\n\nI don't know anything about Lily. She just showed up one night, sitting on a lily pad in a shallow pond.\n\nA dreaming scene materialized in the air, and Lily was there, smiling at me.\n\nShe offered to teach me how, \"to leave your locked darkroom without opening the door\".\n\nor something similar.\n\nSo far, what they promise when you see them, turns out to be exactly what they do.\n\nWords have power for them, so they don't lie.\n\nBUT, I didn't realize what she meant.\n\nShe meant she was going to teach me to smoothly transition from solid physical body, to my dreaming double.\n\nThe being running around in dreams is a second copy of yourself.\n\nJust as real, and nearly independent.\n\nBut it's lost in an infinity of alternate copies of reality, and most people's double never makes it into this copy.\n\nSorcerers either go into dreams (through a form of lucid dreaming) and guide it into the real world, or they do what we're doing, and transform the real world into a dream world.\n\nEither way, the result is two of you.\n\nYou'll get to see that!  We don't make things up.  What's the point?\n\nSo Lily taught me to walk towards the wall in my physical body, looking at a dream scene that materialize there, like a movie.\n\nAnd to leap inside, to travel into that world.\n\nBut at no point do you feel the \"transition\".\n\nAnd when you return, you can't explain how it is possible your head didn't smash into the wall and leave a bump.\n\nSame happens with shapeshifting.  You turn into a weird creature, like a Gargantuan (a Victorian era story), go outside into the real world, it all looks real, and if the lawn is wet, it's even cold on your feet.\n\nBut you can pick up your car in one hand, just because you wanted to look under it.\n\nFirst time it was Cholita's car, and I wanted to make sure she put the DMV sticker on it.  Cholita has trouble following the rules.\n\nYou'd think it's not a good idea to lift your car with one hand, around the neighbors.\n\nBut no one was around!\n\nShapeshift is very real, but usually it's in a modified copy of the real world, for your own safety.\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't force it into the real one, but then you could get shot or something.  For example, if you turned into a werewolf, a farmer might shoot you.\n\nPeople don't like monsters.\n\n\\&gt;What does \"belong\" mean in this context?\n\nSpirits are like a big ball made out of fibers of light.\n\nWe are too.\n\nA tiny fraction of the fibers in the spirit, are the same ones in your ball.\n\nThey exist in the air, so her fibers extend into your ball.\n\nNormally we don't use their fibers of light, to perceive the world. There's too many to use them all!\n\nSo spirits are invisible to us.\n\nBut they love our energy.  They're slow.\n\nWe're fast.\n\nThey live 5 billion years.\n\nWe live 122 at the most (so far).\n\nIf they can swap energy with us, they get to \"speed up\".  And they become visible to us (barely at first).\n\nOur energy is like crystal meth to them I suppose.  \n\nWithout the hair and teeth falling out.\n\nIn exchange, they'll teach you magic.\n\nAll of magic is available to them.  But they tend to figure out what would work best at a given moment, and teach you that.\n\nSo they \"belong to you\", only voluntarily.  They consider themselves very lucky to have a \"pet human\".\n\nWe feel that we \"own them\", because they'll do ANYTHING we ask.\n\nJust for fun, I used to erect a freeway overpass in my bedroom, stretching perhaps 1 hundred of feet  above the ground.\n\nI saw one in Tokyo.  It went over the tall trees of their amazing forests.\n\nThen I asked my \"evil\" spirit \"Fancy\" (the  only one I actually own), to find one of those blue Japanese delivery trucks that runs on diesel, and drive it up there, pretend the brakes went out, and crash over the side, to fall in front of me at a clearing I also created.\n\nAnd die in a fiery car crash.\n\nShe said, \"Sure!\"\n\nAnd did it on more than one day for me.\n\nBut she got revenge.\n\nOne night I wanted to try a technique from the books of our teacher Carlos.\n\nYou sit and wait for the \"call of the moth\", and then \"dust from the wings of the moth\" floats to you, and the person you choose materializes in the dust.\n\nYou get to \"see\" the person the way only a seer can.\n\nLike in that picture I posted that brought  you here.\n\nI was all excited, because as soon as I was sitting on pillows on the bed, I could feel that it was going to work.\n\nBut all I got was diesel exhaust, blasted (slowly) in my face.\n\nShe got revenge.\n\nSo please keep in mind, sooner or later I'll get lynched in that post over in your subreddit.\n\nThere's no logical reason anyone who pretends to be interested in magic, would be angry with me.\n\nWe teach it for free in here!\n\nIt's because several of them have  phony sorcery teacher, who is dying, and they're fighting over who gets to take over and cheat people out of money.\n\nAnd this subreddit makes it obvious their teacher was a fake all along.  For the last 23 years.\n\nUp until this subreddit, no one could look to see what this magic is like when it works.\n\nBut now it's obvious their beloved leader, was a bad con artist. He pretended to be the \"real\" teacher, or our teacher.\n\nIf they could murder me they would.", "edited": 1647382408.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i0t2o16", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How old were you when you started learning these things?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Back in 65.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Is Lily a human spirit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily was never human.

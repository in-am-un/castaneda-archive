I&amp;#39;ve seen it 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;O: &amp;quot;Liar!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to start.  Repeat endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When someone sneezes we say, &amp;quot;Bless you!&amp;quot; to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How come?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plague! It&amp;#39;s left over from the plague in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;ve forgotten that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, maybe hatred of magic is left over from witch burning in the 1600s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It happened all over the world. Even the normally tolerant Dutch took part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sort of hatred doesn&amp;#39;t go away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just mutates and gets passed on in the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now you have people who believe they are &amp;quot;setting the record straight&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;defending science&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But oddly, if you keep insisting they threaten to pound you into the ground with their fists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a good friend with a very high IQ.  A large high-tech pays him a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s super smart and super successful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once saw him pick up a bowl of rice toss it at me violently, because he didn&amp;#39;t want to hear about magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had to get old and sick before he stopped getting so angry on hearing about magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have the same parasite in our own minds.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So forget about whether it&amp;#39;s real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a tool to move the assemblage point.

Right hand on right side, left on left, compress it like that.\n\nWhen it's visibly a ball of chi (like the fire kasina folks can now do), compress it to the size of a golf ball.\n\nJust once.   Keep hands like that for a second or two.  Carlos actually wiggled his fingers a tiny bit, like he was forming it.\n\nShift to your right side, right hand still on top, at shoulder level,  so  that the dead person won't rise up facing you.  You want it to rise up on the right side.\n\nLift the right hand, to reveal the ball.\n\nThe colors will drip down like thick blue liquid.\n\nI'm not sure why the color changes, but it always does.\n\nThe liquid on the floor will materialize a dead person.\n\nIt'll just rise up.\n\nIf it doesn't, repeat. \n\nIt's unlikely to get a full person the first time, but you'll get a show of some kind. It'll just peter out.  Burn out.\n\nBy the way, if you can't form a visible chi ball, it's pointless to try this.\n\nAnd if you can, you won't care about dead people.\n\nSo no one would do this, except to amuse themselves.\n\nCarlos tried to manifest a fun creature that way, for us in private class. \n\nMaybe the rabbit with big teeth, from his books.\n\nNo one saw it.\n\nAnd, rumors even went around that he'd lost it.\n\nCan you believe that?\n\nBut Carlos gave me a grin when no one saw it and said, \"No????\"\n\nIn Russia, witches summon dead people using chanting and visits to the cemetery.\n\nBut it's a lot easier to just make one out of light.\n\nWhy don't you specialize in this a little, and see if you can actually do real seances?\n\nThat would be so cool! \n\nAnd good for society.\n\nI've been hoping to teach Cholita to do this, so she can charge to have seances, where people actually get to see a spirit.\n\nShe needs some way to make money, besides her current business. It's not enough.\n\nBut, she won't do seances.  And besides, she's plagued with spirits.

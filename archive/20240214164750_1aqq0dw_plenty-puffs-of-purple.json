Lived before it became widespread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he only had the students he had, and was desperate to teach the real thing to even a single one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never succeeded.  He taught 0 people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Told me so, and a couple of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a different strategy in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re after SHEER NUMBERS of people, we show them how to do it, what it looks like, and then we don&amp;#39;t really care who succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t afford to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the truth is, people are too lazy to do any real work, for something as crazy as learning real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we only get 1 in 100 who seem to be interested, as you do, who actually ever put in any significant work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The amount of work is the same as if you decided you want to play trumpet in a Las Vegas lounge act next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much work you&amp;#39;d have to do daily, to learn to play well enough to be in a cheesy lounge band there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as much work as to become a competitive surfer, or golfer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the same amount of work someone who loved basketball, would put in playing with his buddies at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s very puzzling why people won&amp;#39;t actually follow the instructions in here, and work consistently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they rarely do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1aqq0dw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1aqq0dw/plenty_puffs_of_purple/kqfxi75/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1707945885.0, "media_metadata": {"xk89miaxamic1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xk89miaxamic1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d3b9400e558d173cfd22e12611a6893e218c699"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xk89miaxamic1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb0c9b5916c3571848a71c78c417842aeab347c"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xk89miaxamic1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6624d81ec2c31ec500c000d8bd659b21feab645c"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xk89miaxamic1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a38ba6cd4dcc22356e4f571ad891567f337c7be2"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xk89miaxamic1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fdbaf43cf684b1901fc52278efac38d2870eed1"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xk89miaxamic1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=644d32e967c8ac09567b887ee8d2d97e0f5f8d8d"}], "s": {"y": 3592, "x": 3592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xk89miaxamic1.jpeg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e23fbed0b9229307237495ab3ed8f36c7272f09"}, "id": "xk89miaxamic1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1707945885.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kqftukq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "albus_the_white", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1707944619.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kqeodbi", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_73fuu", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Hey i have a question\u2026 i did the e10 relaxation\u2026. just enjoying mind awake\u2026 body asleep.

Each story is about a different type of &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot;, when in fact they&amp;#39;re all the same general category, and the specific behavior was because of the person who encountered them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out the Krasue on wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasue\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even named a glowing mushroom after it, because their appearance at night is glowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like IOBs in the dark room!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AND, notice it&amp;#39;s really just a woman&amp;#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, we&amp;#39;re all using the same body, doing the same things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the only things we have available as far as magic goes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all systems are using the same equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real question is, how dishonest are they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much to they alter their stories, to get more attention?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dread of the Castaneda community too. Dishonest people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it serves to make such a confused &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, it helps keep magic hidden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I could go Krasue hunting and find one for sure, given 3 hours at night in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I know the right intent.  What to look for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the stories they tell each other in Thailand, an ordinary person could not go Krasue hunting, because they&amp;#39;d be focusing on false information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wrong &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, most Krasue encounters in Thailand take place when someone is very drunk, chewed some Kratom leaves, and popped one of the Xanax tablets they sell all along the streets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a warning here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t listen to Miguel, Armando, Ken, Victor, don&amp;#39;t read Juan&amp;#39;s books, and don&amp;#39;t go to web pages that are claim to help you learn sorcery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also be careful of who you chat with. People love to spread really wrong information, casually as if it didn&amp;#39;t matter at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It does matter.  Rumors are like poison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you encounter a person peddling such rumors, please notice how they strike out in anger, if you try to correct them.  Often their head nearly explodes, and they have to be banned from this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re all waiting for the next exploding head in here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every 3 weeks it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_jd445c", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jd445c/advanced_tensegrity_post_for_small_formats/g9cm4tw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1603130685.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1603130685.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g9ciw6i", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Anonomous87", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g9c3xfl", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_tbe777h", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That gives me a better understanding of how IOBs work.

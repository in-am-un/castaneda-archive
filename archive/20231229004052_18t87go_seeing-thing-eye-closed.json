verify yourself (if you work hard).\n\nThe first 3 books Carlos wrote were about the \"Men of KNowledge\" who NEEDED drugs to do anything cool.\n\nBecause Carlos needed an \"informant\" on the use of drugs, by native americans.  To get his PhD.  That was a \"thing\" in the early 60s.\n\nMy father was an anthropologist doing the same as Carlos, and at the first reservation Carlos visited looking for don Juan.

And the first time I saw Minx, he was a giant lizard running across my living room floor making horrible scratching noises with his claws.  \n\nCholita the witch, another of the private class students of Carlos, was playing with it.\n\nWe CANNOT do any of those Man of Knowledge things now, because the rituals and the Allies are gone.\n\nSo anyone playing around with drugs thinking they're duplicating the early books is so hopeless they ought to just give up right now.\n\nWe certainly don't want them commenting or posting in here, until they figure out they were pretending all along and decide to get real instead.\n\nBut their reading comprehension is likely too low to succeed.  Since the early books clearly said that the men of knowledge never learned to *see*.  And that don Juan was only teaching Carlos about the men of knowledge, to show him that there wasn't only one way to view the world.\n\nUnfortunately \"first 3 books\" drug users are often too lazy to read more of Carlos and the witch's books, so they don't self-correct.\n\nAs for the use of intoxicants, it depends on which ones.\n\nAlcohol is fine, and won't even hurt reaching our ultimate goal of Silent Knowledge.\n\nExcept that it makes you tired, harms the body, and if you use too much you are less likely to work hard.\n\nSo it's overall a negative effect.\n\nJust not one you have to give up, as long as you can go between drinks until you are sober for practice sessions.\n\nMarijuana pushes the assemblage point just below the shoulder blades, or perhaps even to halfway down.  \n\nBut it also PULLS it back up, if you should get good at your practices, and move the assemblage point all the way down the back.\n\nIt'll make the super amazing magic down there less vivid.\n\nBut can be overcome all the way to the other side of the body, where the assemblage point almost comes into alignment with that of our energy body.\n\nThere's where marijuana is very harmful, and will prevent reaching stable, sustained Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt's like someone took away your supernatural Netflix feed.\n\nYou won't like that, if you've gotten used to viewing infinity nightly.\n\nShrooms and such push your assemblage point all the way down the back, and likely to the far right most of the time.\n\nBut maybe to the far left in some situations.\n\nIt's fake magic of the kind that puts delusions of grandeur into the minds of drug users, and makes learning sorcery close to impossible.\n\nAnd it never gets the assemblage point to move to the front of the body. It's utterly impossible on drugs.\n\nSo they get you less than halfway to where we need to go, hold you there, and create permanent damage if you keep that up.\n\nI don't know about other drugs.\n\nIt's possible that Kratom is ok to use all the way long the J curve, except possibly if you want to sustain Silent Knowledge.\n\nWhich is called \"seeing\" in the earlier books.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kfgfpqh", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure I understand the question.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re asking about drugs then just know, everything in sorcery is practical, and based on actual observations you will make yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no moral judgements, or dictims handed down from &amp;quot;the men of old&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all real and easy for you to verify yourself (if you work hard).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first 3 books Carlos wrote were about the &amp;quot;Men of KNowledge&amp;quot; who NEEDED drugs to do anything cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because Carlos needed an &amp;quot;informant&amp;quot; on the use of drugs, by native americans.

And that don Juan was only teaching Carlos about the men of knowledge, to show him that there wasn&amp;#39;t only one way to view the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately &amp;quot;first 3 books&amp;quot; drug users are often too lazy to read more of Carlos and the witch&amp;#39;s books, so they don&amp;#39;t self-correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the use of intoxicants, it depends on which ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is fine, and won&amp;#39;t even hurt reaching our ultimate goal of Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that it makes you tired, harms the body, and if you use too much you are less likely to work hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s overall a negative effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just not one you have to give up, as long as you can go between drinks until you are sober for practice sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marijuana pushes the assemblage point just below the shoulder blades, or perhaps even to halfway down.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it also PULLS it back up, if you should get good at your practices, and move the assemblage point all the way down the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll make the super amazing magic down there less vivid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But can be overcome all the way to the other side of the body, where the assemblage point almost comes into alignment with that of our energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s where marijuana is very harmful, and will prevent reaching stable, sustained Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like someone took away your supernatural Netflix feed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t like that, if you&amp;#39;ve gotten used to viewing infinity nightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shrooms and such push your assemblage point all the way down the back, and likely to the far right most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe to the far left in some situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s fake magic of the kind that puts delusions of grandeur into the minds of drug users, and makes learning sorcery close to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it never gets the assemblage point to move to the front of the body. It&amp;#39;s utterly impossible on drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they get you less than halfway to where we need to go, hold you there, and create permanent damage if you keep that up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that Kratom is ok to use all the way long the J curve, except possibly if you want to sustain Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is called &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; in the earlier books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_18t87go", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/18t87go/seeing_thing_eye_closed/kfgfpqh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1703879812.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1703879812.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kffr3em", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Guymandudewhat", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kfflgw7", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_ks75f", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Out of curiosity why is the self giving up something with caffeine and sugar but not drugs?", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kffr3em", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity why is the self giving up something with caffeine and sugar but not drugs?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_18t87go", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/18t87go/seeing_thing_eye_closed/kffr3em/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1703870940.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1703870940.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kfflgw7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kfdqaq2", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Absolutely not!\n\nIf you start denying yourself things, you'll just turn into \"Annoying Yoga Man\" who washes his nose out with salt water 3 times a day and makes a big fuss doing pranayama, so his friends know he's an important Yogi man.\n\nIf a \"system\" advises you to give up things, it's a fraud.\n\nThey're handing out placebos so they can keep stealing from you.\n\nGet real magic first!\n\nLater on, when you're trying to do the absolute impossible on a daily basis, you can look at whether sugar or caffeine have negative effects.\n\nBut until you reach the purple zone on that J curve, they have absolutely none.\n\nOther than to let you practice longer each night.\n\nTry keeping a StarBucks double espresso, the full sugar one in a convenient little can, next to your nightstand.\n\nIf you just can't get up to practice, guzzle that down while you lay half asleep on the bed.

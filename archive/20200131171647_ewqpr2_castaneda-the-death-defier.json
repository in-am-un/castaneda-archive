The nagual could work in the church and was safe there.  He took \ncare of bells, and other property at the church. One day an old indian came to him and said, \"I need your energy, or else I will denounce you as a \npractitioner of the black arts...\" \n\nOf course with this, Sebastian was compelled to listen.\n\nThe indian wanted energy from only the nagual.  We all have an umbilical,\nthe belly button (\"the gap\"). We all die from here, it's a deadly place, a \nhole in the energy body from which life force escapes upon death. A nagual has twice the energy of a normal man, so the indian said that to give a minimal\namount would do him no harm.\n\nThis indian was actually a sorcerer from 7000 years ago, he lives today by\nplacing his assemblage point on different points, getting a \"mortgage\" on\nlife.  He moves his assemblage point to a key position, which gives him an\ninsect-like quality.  He then draws energy from the belly-button of the\nnagual, and has a \"sac\" into which he pulls this energy.  His assemblage\npoint then returns to the habitual position, then he's like everyone else.\n\nHe didn't need energy until 1725.  Then, he became fixed to the lineage.\nHe gave in exchange for the nagual's energy, gifts of positions of the\nassemblage point.  Knowledge about how to attain these new positions, and\nwhat to expect.  Sebastion was extraordinary.  He received 8 new positions\nfrom this \"death defier\".  Lujan got 52 positions!  But this was not for\ndon Juan, he was not interested in the death defier's gifts, nor was I.\nBut he tapped me, he couldn't help it.  Munched me to death, don Juan said.\n\nI was willing to half-believe what don Juan was saying about the existance\nof the death defier.  Corn was found in Mexico which was carbon-14 dated to\n34,000 years ago.  The first migration into Mexico suposedly happened only\n10,000 years ago, and were simple hunter/gatherers.  But don Juan said this\nwas not true.  He said, \"we both have ways of measuring time; you measure,\nwhile I...ask.\"\n\nOne day don Juan said he'd take me to see the death defier.  No problem,\nit's all horshshit, I thought.  So he took me.  Scared the living daylights\nout of me.  I met this Indian with the weirdest accent.  The accent was on\nall the wrong syllables.  If a word had the accent on the first syllable,\nhe'd put it on the second.  But he did it so consistently as to convince me\nit was genuine.\n\nThe man was thin, wiry.  He drove me nuts talking like that.  He told me,\n\"My eyes have feasted themselves on the helmets of the Spanish conquerors.\nI saw them, how they moved.  I felt their discomfort, and felt how they had\nto sleep with their helmets and armor on, I felt their pain.  I've seen\nincredible things.  What do you want?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\", I replied.\n\n\"But we have an agreement.  With you, it will be difficult, for you are the\nlast...\" Of course, he somehow knew I was to be the last nagual in this\nline, yet I myself didn't know it at the time.  We met in a town in Mexico,\nit was a Saturday.  I ate cheese with him, it seemed very normal.  We took a\nwalk.  The next thing I knew I was waiting for don Juan to pick me up, and\nI'd had no idea what had transpired.  I left with a sensation, tremendously\nold, musty, kind, foreign, unthreatening.  This weird nostalgia.  It's been\nas if I'd been involved in a fight that had no end.  This is the first time\nI truly realized that there were things with no end...\n\nI woke up in a peculiar town.  There was a paved road, which sloped high in\nthe middle, a \"1st gear\" road.  The first thing you see walking up this\nhill is the hats of the mexicans on the other side.  It was a peculiar\nsensation, a \"cinematic\" one for me.  So, I was watching that...  (By the\nway, don Juan found this town to be the epicenter of \"energetic\nconvolutions\".) I was waiting for don Juan with this sensation of\nnostalgia, but not for my life or past, it was foreign.  So old, sad, yet\ncharming, haunting.  It's never left me, I'm always playing with that\nsensation, the neverending fight, with no possibility of looking for a\nlull.  don Juan said it was poison that the death defier left me.  It was\nlike being prone, being ready, as if something is coming.  A foreign\nfeeling.\n\nThe next time I found the death defier, was at nearly the end of don Juan's\nlife.  A small church in Tula - met a gorgeous woman.  I had much fear at\nthe prospect, don Juan had to literally drag me to the church.  There were\ntwo women nearby, with 3 men coming out from the church.  The 3 men went\ndown the stairs, and the two women went inside.  \"Where is he\", I wondered\nto don Juan, \"the men left.\"\n\ndon Juan responded, \"Who told you that the death defier is a man?\" He\npointed to the woman in the last pew.  don Juan emplored me to \"cross\"\nmyself, to observe the customs, and not to make a spectacle.  The woman\nturned and smiled.  At this point I ran out of the church, falling prey to\na bout of asthma.  I'd had asthma when I was a child...\n\ndon Juan asked me, \"why this fear?\"\n\nMy family name is Carlos Arana (pronounced \"Arania\"), and in portugese,\nArana means \"spider\".  don Juan asked, \"What's wrong, Mr.  Spider?\" The\nmore I walked away, the more tachycardia (irregular heartbeat condition)\nacted up.  Then I got insane and simply said to don Juan, \"OK, lets go\",\nand went back to the church and sat next to the woman.\n\nShe had a raspy voice, as she greeted me and held my hand, \"I like your\nenergy...muy bien.\" She took me to dreams upon dreams - 9 days I was lost,\nalthough I thought it was one.  don Juan told me that I'd came to\nagreements that I'd not be aware of until I was \"fully grown\".\n\nThe death defier is as real as me or don Juan. A different, but bizarre\npossibility which is available to us all, not that we'll take it.  The\nhuman unknown is as far away as anything, but it's still within our realm\nof possibilities.  Wow!  Who are we?!\n\nAre we just some travellers caught in some disgusting trap? Maybe. For\nme, I saw the death defier and don Juan as navigators. I navigate,\ntherefore who are we?  Why accept what's been handed down--nagging, senility,\ndiscontentment, repetitiveness, with endless regrets--no desicions whatsoever.\n\n\"I decided to come to this seminar--if it's chicken-shit, then so be it.\"\nThat's the sorcerer's way.  \"Oh, I didn't get personal treatment...\" People\ncome, at the first twist, they tell us to go \"blow our barracks\".  We've\ngot to get rid of the ego, I say, but then it's, \"Fuck you\".  We've got to\nbe as sharp as a razor, go slowly at first, then you can jump.  Don't give\nme this, \"I volunteer for your group, take me, take me, I'll do whatever\nyou want...\" Stop being an egomaniac, I say.  \"Oh, I'm so disappointed,\nCarlos...no peyote in the desert?\"\n\nLast night I invited for you to read up on your \"heritage\" (writings of the\nBible, Jesus, Mohammed, etc), and look for the \"me, me me\". It's a man\ntalking for God. It can't be personalized. The minute it is, we inject\n\"me\" into it  What is heaven?  Humanness for eternity?  We don't want it!\nWhat is the Pace of heaven?  I'm in a toga, walking like this [walks\ntorturously slow for several steps]...\n\nThen comes the death defier. An outstanding male of his time. The inorganic \nbeings are also blasted by flyers. There's nothing they'd like to do more than \nto unite with us.  But the only ones brave enough are the sorcerers, as beings\nwanting to enhance their awareness. You profess to be who you are in their\nrealm, and they grab you! How else would they do it, as they have no way\nof making themselves known. We are being systematically separated [from\nthe inorganic beings] by the flyers.\n\ndon Juan said that the inorganic beings were dangerous. The death defier got \ngrabbed by the inorganic beings, but he accepted the bidding. He spent thousands \nof years in that world. One day this ultimate freedom fighter discovered the way \nto escape. Turn into a woman! This is simple for a sorcerer. A woman has her\nassemblage point with its \"shiny\" side facing inward, while a man's assemblage point \nhas its shiny side facing out.  All one needs to do is to turn the assemblage point \naround, and your whole body turns into something else.  It's not merely an illusion. \n\nAs a woman the inorganic beings didn't know he existed, and he simply slipped by \nwithout notice.  In making a deal with the inorganic beings, he lost his possibilities.  But now hes' caput. I'm the last of the line, so what will the death defier do?  He'll go with me, I'm his last chance.  It gives me the goose bumps.  \n\nInfinitely more exciting...\n\nSo, this death defier has escaped twice!  First death itself, then the inorganic being world.  I get emotional.  What beauty/elegance.  He chose not to be human,\nbut is still a being who's going to die.  He knows only fighting, it's a\nstory, but NOT a story.  He's everyone of us, but enhanced by his thirst\nfor freedom.  I don't think the death defier truly knows what freedom is,\nbut so what?  He goes to something not defined.\n\nThat's why I try to sneak out of it [talking about the death defier].  I\nwould weep like an imbucile.  Don't you dare believe that I wouldn't...\n\nEND\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Castaneda &amp; The Death Defier", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ewqpr2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1580507225.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1580487407.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARLOS CASTENADA AND THE DEATH DEFIER&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abridged From A Tensegrity Lecture (source unknown, no corrections)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As part of don Juan&amp;#39;s lore, the &amp;quot;Death Defier&amp;quot; was/is an entity who appeared \nin 1725, who went to see the nagual Sebastian, who was a sexton for a church \nin Tula.

Did you ever actually study that religion?\n\nWell, he told me to anyway. I did.  In the kind of obsessive detail only an autistic person can muster.\n\nFirst, it's obvious the \"prophets\" were sorcerers. Just study kabbalah if you don't believe it.  The book of Abramelin even tells you how to get yourself some inorganic beings, and how to put them to use.\n\nBut as for the Jewish/Christian heaven, it's not like that at all.\n\nThis will be a shock to you church goers.  Churches don't teach this. It's not good for donations.  It upsets the old people.\n\nHeaven is formed by draining the earth of all of the water, and putting it into orbit, like a giant blue pearl floating in the universe.  The water causes the entire planet to glow with a bright white light that would burn anyone's eyes.\n\nIt's essentially a Dyson sphere, made from water. The earth is thereby protected from solar flares, can probably deflect meteors and comets, and screens out harmful ultraviolet radiation, which believe it or not, erodes the rocks on the top of the highest mountains.\n\nYou might be thinking, God can just zap it, so why would he need a Dyson sphere?\n\nHe likes to use reality.  He doesn't like to zap things.  He's that good.  \n\nFact is, the entire place is  a high tech paradise!  I wouldn't be surprised if the Dyson sphere is indeed for collecting super amounts of energy to power the super high tech.\n\nAnd while the light is blinding, we become inorganic and can't be harmed.\n\nSexes are gone.  Doesn't bother me since I'm celibate, but if you're worried about it, keep in mind what happened to Job. Everything was taken away.  But it was replaced with something even better.\n\nThe main city is a 15 mile cube, where each person who's ever lived could have an apartment at least one square mile in size.\n\nYes, it extends up into space!\n\nPeople can choose where they live, which becomes anywhere on earth, including what's under the ocean right now.\n\nAnd they still grow stuff, make stuff, and generally get to go on like now.    There are animals there too, but they're all plant eaters.\n\nThere are no taxes.\n\nThere's a river flowing from the center of the giant city which carries water that can heal, and in case you get bored, there's some coca leaves growing on giant trees that have the water going down the middle, through an opening in their humongous trunks.\n\nThey don't specifically say coca leaves, but they prevent boredom. You tell me what kind of leaf prevents boredom?\n\nThere's also inter-dimensional space ships available.  Joy riding even!\n\nIf there's a nasty negative, you have to visit the temple in the big city once a month (week?).  And if you don't, you're banned for a while.\n\nSo there's still some shame.\n\nOn that visit, people surround God and stare into his \"shekinah glory\", which is a radiance God gives off, which pleases humans enormously.   Even the Angels can't get enough of it.\n\nI suspect they learn from it too, and grow in power.\n\nThe main goal of god throughout the bible was to give humans the power to control their fate, just by saying what they want. The ability to summon *intent*, every single time.\n\nJacob was given that ability without realizing it, and killed his favorite wife by accident.\n\nSo it's mostly reserved for angels.  We'll likely all get it.\n\nAll this is probably why, we should all keep out of the religion business.\n\nEven Carlos.\n\nWhen you die, just see what happens.  That's all.\n\nBe nice to people, and you'll fulfill the Judaeo Christian ethic.  And all the meditation needed to learn sorcery ought to please the Buddha, and the Taoist hierarchy of heaven.\n\nI can't imagine that if there really is a heaven, you won't get a chance after all the hard work to improve yourself.", "edited": 1580686238.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fgdp3tj", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; What is heaven?

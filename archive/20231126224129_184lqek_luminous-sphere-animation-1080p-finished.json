I can't afford the time to perfect it.\n\nBut as to your question, I can't even figure out **why** it can't be designed!\n\nI've spent what's likely 20 hours by now (never more than 10 minutes at a time) gazing at Silent Knowledge, trying to figure out if there's a way to describe most of it.\n\nPossibly because in order to describe it, you have to do that while viewing it.\n\nAnd that creates the words to remember it by.\n\nBut later, after you leave it, if you don't have those words there's no way to remember it.\n\nOur \"memory\" is a physical kind of structure that we've grown into, believing it's caused by our physical brain.\n\nBut in sorcery you quickly learn it's not that way at all.  We can't escape the physical hardware, but that's not because we ARE the physical hardware.  We simply got trapped in it.\n\nYou learn this by going \"dream hopping\" where you find that any dream you land in (starting fully awake and just zipping right into it), comes with its own history.\n\nStanding in there, you can remember back a whole lifetime.\n\nIncluding all of your friends, where you live, where you work.\n\nLikely this is what gave rise to the delusion of re-incarnation.  Which is actually a fairly recent belief.  It's in no way ancient.  Socrates might even have been discussing it's possibility, at the same time the Hindus were starting to formally think like that.\n\nUsing weak meditation techniques people got one or two glimpses of alternate realities, and no more.\n\nBut they hyped up their 1 or 2 accidental experiences with alternate realities,  to get attention in their group (for example Buddhists), until the folklore about re-incarnation was impossible to stop.\n\nPeople always take 1 or 2 cool experiences and try to cash in on them before they've done that enough to even know what it was.  But if you add up hundreds doing that, everyone who exaggerated becomes stubborn, believing everyone can't be exaggerating.\n\nWhen that's exactly what's going on.\n\nThey have the same problem darkroom people have.  Repeating stuff enough times to understand what it is.\n\nBut other systems never got below the beginning of the red zone, so 2 experiences is something they consider enough to make them an expert, if it seems like something their system has described and agreed upon.\n\nIt's the \"describing\" part that cements things into place.\n\nSo you might say, in other systems they don't care how wrong their descriptions are, because they just want to advertise something that others might stumble upon.  To convince them what they are practicing does in fact work.  And if it matches the promises made about what their system can do for you, that's good enough.  No one tries to evolve or change what they are doing, because that would upset management at the top.\n\nSame way we can't get through to Cleargreen!  They don't care about evolving and growing. Only about revenue.\n\nReal sorcerers don't care about convincing others of anything, since they aren't after profit.  If they help anyone learn, it's just to prevent this knowledge from being lost to mankind.\n\nNot to get any money.\n\nSo they want to understand.  Not merely describe. Because if you don't \"understand\" in some way, the knowledge is as good as already lost.\n\nAnd at first they have to describe if they hope to remember.\n\nI must do 20 super cool things each night lately,  and can only remember 1 of them the next day.\n\nThe one before I stopped for the night.\n\nThe descriptions are admittedly sloppy for beginners in SK, with lots of flaws.\n\nBut those memories can be found somewhat, if you have any descriptions.\n\nIt's not different than our internal dialogue creating our blue line reality!\n\nWe just need some descriptions which lead to memories of Silent Knowledge states, to make that same process function.  Where thinking can direct you to an assemblage point position.\n\nOnce you realize any dream world has its own history and you have a long time presence there, through some odd aspect of reality, you know that memory doesn't work as we believe.\n\nAnd can't be transferred from one reality, to another.\n\nAll you can do is leave yourself a \"trail\", even if it's only with words, and then your assemblage point can hopefully assemble that alternate reality enough to \"remember\" it.\n\nBut some things are too abstract to make words for. They don't follow the normal \"legal flow of perceptions\".\n\nWe're so lost in our single reality, we don't even notice the pieces of it anymore.\n\nDespite our using them constantly.\n\nSo in a \"legal\" flow of perceptions, your awareness focuses on one thing, then on another somewhat related, and a continuous flow of perceptions results from one thing being related to the other,  which we believe we live in and are causing.\n\nIt's not so in Silent Knowledge.\n\nAll flows of perceptions are legal.\n\nIn any order.\n\nEven effect before cause is allowed.\n\nPresent before past.\n\nYou can gaze somewhere concrete in Silent Knowledge, such as at 4 men standing outside an industrial garage, and realize you were just a while ago hanging out with them there for at least 10 minutes.\n\nExcept, you just saw them for the first time 2 seconds ago!\n\nI'm afraid I can't describe what an \"illegal flow\" of perceptions is, but you'll clearly see some out there in Silent knowledge.\n\nAnd until you can create words to move your assemblage point to glimpse those again, there's no possible way to remember any of it, once your assemblage point moves back.\n\nEven worse, becoming a sorcerer is NOT permanent.\n\nThat idea was made up by greedy gurus, who always obviously fall apart over time. And the fact that they're just ordinary men becomes obvious to their closest groupies.  Who hide it, to preserve the business model.\n\nSorcerers don't pretend anything is permanent.\n\nIf you stop gazing at infinity, you quickly get sucked back to the blue line on the J curve and virtually all memory of what sorcerers do is erased.

I can&amp;#39;t afford the time to perfect it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as to your question, I can&amp;#39;t even figure out &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; it can&amp;#39;t be designed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent what&amp;#39;s likely 20 hours by now (never more than 10 minutes at a time) gazing at Silent Knowledge, trying to figure out if there&amp;#39;s a way to describe most of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly because in order to describe it, you have to do that while viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that creates the words to remember it by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But later, after you leave it, if you don&amp;#39;t have those words there&amp;#39;s no way to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot; is a physical kind of structure that we&amp;#39;ve grown into, believing it&amp;#39;s caused by our physical brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in sorcery you quickly learn it&amp;#39;s not that way at all.  We can&amp;#39;t escape the physical hardware, but that&amp;#39;s not because we ARE the physical hardware.  We simply got trapped in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learn this by going &amp;quot;dream hopping&amp;quot; where you find that any dream you land in (starting fully awake and just zipping right into it), comes with its own history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standing in there, you can remember back a whole lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Including all of your friends, where you live, where you work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likely this is what gave rise to the delusion of re-incarnation.  Which is actually a fairly recent belief.  It&amp;#39;s in no way ancient.  Socrates might even have been discussing it&amp;#39;s possibility, at the same time the Hindus were starting to formally think like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using weak meditation techniques people got one or two glimpses of alternate realities, and no more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they hyped up their 1 or 2 accidental experiences with alternate realities,  to get attention in their group (for example Buddhists), until the folklore about re-incarnation was impossible to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People always take 1 or 2 cool experiences and try to cash in on them before they&amp;#39;ve done that enough to even know what it was.  But if you add up hundreds doing that, everyone who exaggerated becomes stubborn, believing everyone can&amp;#39;t be exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have the same problem darkroom people have.  Repeating stuff enough times to understand what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But other systems never got below the beginning of the red zone, so 2 experiences is something they consider enough to make them an expert, if it seems like something their system has described and agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;describing&amp;quot; part that cements things into place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you might say, in other systems they don&amp;#39;t care how wrong their descriptions are, because they just want to advertise something that others might stumble upon.  To convince them what they are practicing does in fact work.  And if it matches the promises made about what their system can do for you, that&amp;#39;s good enough.  No one tries to evolve or change what they are doing, because that would upset management at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same way we can&amp;#39;t get through to Cleargreen!  They don&amp;#39;t care about evolving and growing. Only about revenue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real sorcerers don&amp;#39;t care about convincing others of anything, since they aren&amp;#39;t after profit.  If they help anyone learn, it&amp;#39;s just to prevent this knowledge from being lost to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to get any money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they want to understand.

Don Juan suggested we learn to read text in the sky, rather than view scenes. Text is easier to interpret.\n\nIf you read all of the books, you'll remember that in one don Juan asked Carlos to try to \"see\", and he came up with some bizarre scene of a man looking out an apartment window, with a french poodle somewhere in there.  I'll go get it...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Don't be bashful,\" he said. \"Tell me exactly what you see.\"\n\nI had a sudden and strange thought very similar to thoughts that usually come to my mind just before falling asleep. It was more than a thought. 'A complete image' would be a better  description of it. I saw a tableau containing various personages. The one which was directly in  front of me was a man sitting behind a window frame. The area beyond the frame was diffuse,  but the frame and the man were crystal clear. He was looking at me. Hs head was turned  slightly to his left so he was actually looking askance at me. I could see his eyes moving to keep me within focus. He was leaning on the windowsill with his right elbow. His hand was  clenched into a fist and his muscles were contracted.\n\nTo the left of the man there was another image in the tableau. It was a flying lion. That is, the  head and the mane were those of a lion, but the lower part of it's body belonged to a curly  white French poodle. I was about to focus my attention on it, when the man made a smacking sound with his lips  and stuck his head and trunk out of the window. His whole body emerged as if something were pushing him. He hung for a moment, grabbing the windowsill with the tips of his fingers as he  swung like a pendulum. Then he let go.\n\nI experienced in my own body the sensation of falling. It was not a plummeting down, but a  soft descent, and then a cushioned floating. The man was weightless. He remained stationary  for a moment and then he went out of sight as if an uncontrollable force had sipped him away  through a crack in the tableau. An instant later he was back at the window looking askance at  me. His right forearm was resting on the windowsill, only this time his hand was waving good\u0002by to me.\n\nDon Juan's comment was that my 'seeing' was too elaborate.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nImpossible to interpret!\n\nBut that was \"seeing\" nonetheless.\n\nAnd last night I was \"seeing\" an object so astonishing, you might almost call it \"holy\".\n\nI got the impression it was real.  Actual real solid matter from an alien world, which didn't belong here.\n\nMade me realize what Elias was doing sneaking around the universe stealing objects when no one was around.\n\nThat's also part of \"seeing\".\n\nBut so is entering into portals which manifest in the air.\n\nIn Silent Knowledge (seeing) the air fills with magic, including little dream scenes you can enter.\n\nIn and back out in seconds. Then into another.\n\nOver and over until you feel sleepy and can't keep it up anymore.  Which means you ran out of energy.\n\nWhich by the way is significant. Some things you can do in sorcery result in your being absorbed by the emanations.  Gone, I presume.\n\nSo \"sleepy\" is a happy problem compared to what might happen in other situations.\n\nSilent Knowledge, unlike the green and red zones on the J curve, is easily repeatable.\n\nNot the specifics, but the super cool magical results.\n\nYou can locate, for example, an old seer.\n\nAnd follow him back to his world, thousands of years ago.\n\nBut you can't locate the SAME old seer each time.\n\nWhich is a huge step up from the red zone, where you can't even get the same thing to happen more than twice.

Don Juan suggested we learn to read text in the sky, rather than view scenes. Text is easier to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read all of the books, you&amp;#39;ll remember that in one don Juan asked Carlos to try to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, and he came up with some bizarre scene of a man looking out an apartment window, with a french poodle somewhere in there.  I&amp;#39;ll go get it...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be bashful,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Tell me exactly what you see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a sudden and strange thought very similar to thoughts that usually come to my mind just before falling asleep. It was more than a thought. &amp;#39;A complete image&amp;#39; would be a better  description of it. I saw a tableau containing various personages. The one which was directly in  front of me was a man sitting behind a window frame. The area beyond the frame was diffuse,  but the frame and the man were crystal clear. He was looking at me. Hs head was turned  slightly to his left so he was actually looking askance at me. I could see his eyes moving to keep me within focus. He was leaning on the windowsill with his right elbow. His hand was  clenched into a fist and his muscles were contracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the left of the man there was another image in the tableau. It was a flying lion. That is, the  head and the mane were those of a lion, but the lower part of it&amp;#39;s body belonged to a curly  white French poodle. I was about to focus my attention on it, when the man made a smacking sound with his lips  and stuck his head and trunk out of the window. His whole body emerged as if something were pushing him. He hung for a moment, grabbing the windowsill with the tips of his fingers as he  swung like a pendulum. Then he let go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I experienced in my own body the sensation of falling. It was not a plummeting down, but a  soft descent, and then a cushioned floating. The man was weightless. He remained stationary  for a moment and then he went out of sight as if an uncontrollable force had sipped him away  through a crack in the tableau. An instant later he was back at the window looking askance at  me. His right forearm was resting on the windowsill, only this time his hand was waving goodby to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan&amp;#39;s comment was that my &amp;#39;seeing&amp;#39; was too elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impossible to interpret!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that was &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And last night I was &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; an object so astonishing, you might almost call it &amp;quot;holy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the impression it was real.  Actual real solid matter from an alien world, which didn&amp;#39;t belong here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Made me realize what Elias was doing sneaking around the universe stealing objects when no one was around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also part of &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But so is entering into portals which manifest in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Silent Knowledge (seeing) the air fills with magic, including little dream scenes you can enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In and back out in seconds. Then into another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over and over until you feel sleepy and can&amp;#39;t keep it up anymore.  Which means you ran out of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which by the way is significant. Some things you can do in sorcery result in your being absorbed by the emanations.  Gone, I presume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;sleepy&amp;quot; is a happy problem compared to what might happen in other situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge, unlike the green and red zones on the J curve, is easily repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the specifics, but the super cool magical results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can locate, for example, an old seer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And follow him back to his world, thousands of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t locate the SAME old seer each time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is a huge step up from the red zone, where you can&amp;#39;t even get the same thing to happen more than twice. And you&amp;#39;re very lucky if you did in fact do it a second time.  Usually you try, and it fizzles out half way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos put that picture on the cover to show how super cool real magic is, and that there comes a point when you can use it, like a tool.

Once in a while he&amp;#39;d taunt us, by imitating what you ought to be looking like when you &amp;quot;redeploy energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that was the closest he came to simply telling us what it was all about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until he was dying that he actually just stood in front of us and did it without the kungfu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He set it up.  Had the women spread rumors, Carlos was finally going to show us real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 classes ahead too, so we anticipated the magic twice before he gave the demonstrations.  On the days he didn&amp;#39;t, you could see women running from the stairs as Carlos entered, and other women asking them from the back, &amp;quot;today???&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men were all excited.  I swear Felix was taking mental notes, so he could use it to write a book later on.  He was always short on cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Corey was probably just hoping &amp;quot;daddy&amp;quot; would finally love his family and do right by them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course we saw absolutely nothing but Carlos making a fool of himself, manipulating invisible balls of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could hear the grumbling after that class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So once in a while, when I&amp;#39;m trying to open a tunnel into infinity, I remember Carlos trying to show us how to compress a chi ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go back to it, and realize my chi balls suck these days.  They probably look like a beginner&amp;#39;s chi ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I play with them, until they don&amp;#39;t.  Until they become so solid you can wipe them on the back of your pants like bacon grease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time I do that I realize, why don&amp;#39;t I do more of that???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the part about using my pants for a napkin.  Cholita says I have to stop doing that.  Her clothes are always so clean, it only takes a few grains of soap to wash them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we see the &amp;quot;puffery snobs&amp;quot; in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone will succeed in seeing a big red dot.  Or a purple blob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then they ask, &amp;quot;What do I do next?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Translation: this is boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jh8142/learning_to_play_with_the_colors/g9xnvvh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1603563197.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_jh8142", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g9xbxrb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1603557120.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g9whob0", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "But you still have the \"choice\" to return to the dialogue.\n\nI guess you have to be \"full\" on heightened awareness for complete silence.

Ahhh\u201d then not specific mind appears, but feeling, that you have some kind of desire attached to not thinking.

Everyday I coul\u2019d catch any thought, and shut it down in seconds. So I coul\u2019d do that (effectively) in any extreme situatition, in any adventure. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t had \u201cmind information\u201d (yet) about all this happiness and this stuff.. I just had strong feelings about everything, because I felt everything, you know..(i will not start \u201cquetes for beginners\u201d:D)\n\nBefore my awakening I was Not practicing meditation.\nAll of this was a moment miracle.\n\nAt those very first days, weeks, first months.. Everyday I was fighting my mind. \nI knew one: that I was kinda starting to appreceate my Ego that I hated all the time before. I was running, and running. From my mind. And I had that strong feeling (about my mind, about my ego) that it could destroy me, those suicidal thoughts.. Until I had one of those special Lucid Drems.\nBut it was different.\n\nMy Ego\u2019s scary looking black face in fron on my eyes. Just staring at me, smelling me. And in those seconds, I felt in those seconds, that this is probably the \u201cworld-upside down\u201d situation. So, [how do I react]? In that moment, I was feeling love for my old \u201cbad side\u201d, I started crying. I was not afraid for such level. For the first time in my life. In the worst ever scenario, where it\u2019s just catastrofical.\n\nFrom that night, I was able to be friends with my ego. I was still watching my mind, but not that carefully, because I had so much more power. Ofc weeks passed and I gathered lots of information about it, but from my own intuition. \n\nHad those LSD experiences, nearly death moments. \n\nKnow the \u201cAngel\u2019s of death\u201d feeling\nOne night, when my all existence merged: I was feeling overpowered, had best so ever experiences in that moments. For this thing to happen it\u2019s all clear that I had to accept all the energy of absolutely everything. It just happend, all the existence throw me happened. And ofc there was an a pretty scary one (energy). My reactions for it (like a cat:D) started to work all different then ever before. Felt like I was not seeing the devil.. Not in other room or something. But like I was that devil it self. And those moments was the most happy and beautiful actually, pretty scary :D But I was able to defend myself, and accept those scary energies the way they are - in few seconds. That \u201cscary\u2019nes\u201d was like my body reflect\u2019s, first time impression. In that kind of moments it\u2019s very easy to separate your internal health and \u201cego\u201d. So for about 15 minutes I had this trip, my reactions was \u201cwoooouu\u201d like always :Dd Then I started to feel colours. Literally, all the energy.. I closed my eyes. Rainbow colours appeared one by one, slowly. First: red, 5 seconds later: yellow.. About 10 different colours in 4K hd, in those moments I felt overpowered once again. Then I had a feeling, why not PURPLE? Purple was starting to appear after 3 seconds, but until that I had a bunch of visions (that my nagual already know) - how the purple created? How all of that feeling created that I\u2019m able to feel. I always felt that colour purple is everything \ud83d\udc9c (green and red colours secret) plays a big role before those 3 seconds, until the Purple. 3 seconds passed. And I\u2019m fully - there. Everywhere. Home. I was able to feel and understand time, universe, my spirit. \n\nIt was the same end like in avatar\u2019s \u201cAn\u2019s\u201d meeting with himself, in other dimension, in everywhere, in nowhere.. At the same time. And not in time.. \nIt\u2019s that moment, when you completely let go all existence actually. Not some specific mind, specific feeling.. But everything. \nThere was all of this univere energy, absolutely everything. Talking was no needed. Nothing was no needed, there is no time actually. All of that always reminds me (Low-High) \u201cform\u201d. All that paradise has everything, the sound is gorgeous.. But at the same time? Guess what? That silent..... So I met me there, I didn\u2019t have (people\u2019s perspectice dialogue) with that energy, but I gave me energy, also received, that\u2019s what happened. I felt like in a universe\u2019s debate, where from like every point goes some kind of energy and does things, being aware, just exists. Felt like in magical place, because everything is me. \n\nSo, lets call this a few of my many \u201cwith bigger names\u201d experiences. I have lot\u2019s of other cool stuff to tell about, with all tiny details. About everything. Can talk about ego shit as well, it\u2019s not that hard, for real :D Can be ur guru, as you can see, im already pissed of me writing. But I want to develop my english a little bit more, also it\u2019s pretty fun to talk about this kind of stuff. What I\u2019m searching for is beyond limits, it\u2019s in \u201cmiracle\u201d in magical level. So if you\u2019re the same, please text me. (Don\u2019t know why, I just feel) throw a very little effort, because I mastered to \u201cnot to do, not to want, don\u2019t think, accept absolutely everything, and realise this in every moment.

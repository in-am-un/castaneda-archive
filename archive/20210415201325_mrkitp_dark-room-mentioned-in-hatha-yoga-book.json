Darkness and silence, and \u200blooking for the things that come from the darkness.\n\nI've modified the technique a little,  using the instructions of our teacher, from Maui back in 95.\n\nI gazed at a purple cloud floating a few feet away, and it hurried over to stick to my torso.  I looked into it for objects, and found a little house.\n\nI tried to get it to change to something else, while I waited for the \"reality echo\" that explained the new scene.  \n\nWe live in reality bubbles, which come with both sights, and a telepathic history.\n\nSo for instance, when you realize you are in a dream, you can remember all the details and history of the dream.\n\nThe dream comes with  a \"history\".\n\nI've been studying how those happen, using waking dreaming.\n\nIn fact, we got stuck in this one!  This dream (reality).\n\nThat's our predicament.\n\nMy bad girl spirit Fancy was swimming in the purple energy I'd lured around my torso, and I noticed she was again pushing on a spot we're all trying to make a dent in.\n\nShe was trying to show me that you don't need to succeed at finger wiggling, as good as that technique is.\n\nShe explained: That was just a spur of the moment change Zuleica made, when Carlos felt a tickle.  She changed over, but that doesn't mean that's the best way to do that.  To make a dent in that energy body shell.\n\nFancy favors making the entire second attention energy body visible, by piling all the light and dream images from the room onto the torso, and simply using your hand to dent it in.\n\nJust push it!  She was actually showing me, fully visible.\n\nI kept patting that area myself, but then I'd get some doubt, and use my fingers to feel along the surface.\n\nIn fact, I could literally feel the edge of my energy body, around 6 inches from my torso. It was a real thing, right there.\n\nMy other inorganic being, \"Mystery\", showed up as a tiny head, floating in front.\n\nI'm not making any of this up.  In fact, I'd forgotten most, since it's a normal thing for me.\n\n\"Mystery\" was brighter than he's been in a long time, and even modified his appearance a bit so I'd know for sure it was him, and not \"Fancy\".\n\nA third spirit showed up. He's been around 3 days now.  He tried to scare me with some demon looking faces, but he discovered I like fear (within reason).  So he backed off.\n\nOne of the tiny dreams I'd been watching inside puffs of intense purple light, opened up.\n\nFancy stood up, full height.  She was standing where the bed was, but it made no difference to her.  She could walk through the bed as if it weren't there.\n\nShe walked in to the dream scene, hoping I'd follow her.\n\nI don't remember past that, except for the surprise of seeing her as tall as a normal woman, walking along with her hand reaching for me.\n\nThe last thing I said to her, before I can't recall any more, was, \"Fancy, you know I like it best when you are absolutely real looking, and not transparent.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\nI do that sort of thing every night, but it took an astounding amount of work (meditation) to get there.\n\nI estimate more than 50,000 hours of meditation.\n\nCholita on the other hand, is a natural born witch.  I have no idea how she learned to do what she does.\n\nBut Carlos imported her from Mexico City, so he must have seen it coming.", "edited": 1618522167.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gunehn7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No it was great!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always like to see &amp;quot;hope&amp;quot; out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That technique you posted would work amazingly well, except that it&amp;#39;s hard to get people to put in the time, unless they can see with their own eyes what the rewards are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the Yoga groups discourage talking about experiences.

To make a dent in that energy body shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy favors making the entire second attention energy body visible, by piling all the light and dream images from the room onto the torso, and simply using your hand to dent it in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just push it!  She was actually showing me, fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept patting that area myself, but then I&amp;#39;d get some doubt, and use my fingers to feel along the surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I could literally feel the edge of my energy body, around 6 inches from my torso. It was a real thing, right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My other inorganic being, &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot;, showed up as a tiny head, floating in front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not making any of this up.  In fact, I&amp;#39;d forgotten most, since it&amp;#39;s a normal thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot; was brighter than he&amp;#39;s been in a long time, and even modified his appearance a bit so I&amp;#39;d know for sure it was him, and not &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A third spirit showed up. He&amp;#39;s been around 3 days now.  He tried to scare me with some demon looking faces, but he discovered I like fear (within reason).  So he backed off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the tiny dreams I&amp;#39;d been watching inside puffs of intense purple light, opened up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy stood up, full height.  She was standing where the bed was, but it made no difference to her.  She could walk through the bed as if it weren&amp;#39;t there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She walked in to the dream scene, hoping I&amp;#39;d follow her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember past that, except for the surprise of seeing her as tall as a normal woman, walking along with her hand reaching for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing I said to her, before I can&amp;#39;t recall any more, was, &amp;quot;Fancy, you know I like it best when you are absolutely real looking, and not transparent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do that sort of thing every night, but it took an astounding amount of work (meditation) to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I estimate more than 50,000 hours of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita on the other hand, is a natural born witch.  I have no idea how she learned to do what she does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos imported her from Mexico City, so he must have seen it coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mrkitp", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mrkitp/dark_room_mentioned_in_hatha_yoga_book/gunehn7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1618520392.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1618520392.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gun5jp1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dosomething1372", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gun3y9h", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_74dhxk4h", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "wow you studied so much! \n\ni'm a simple meditator who struggles to keep meditating every day lol . i don't even know yoga fully.\n\nif you think my post is misleading , feel free to remove it .\n\ni just posted it because of it's explanation about the dark room effect . i like explanations\ud83d\ude05 they are helpful for me so i shared it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gun5jp1", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;wow you studied so much! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m a simple meditator who struggles to keep meditating every day lol . i don&amp;#39;t even know yoga fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if you think my post is misleading , feel free to remove it .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i just posted it because of it&amp;#39;s explanation about the dark room effect . i like explanations\ud83d\ude05 they are helpful for me so i shared it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mrkitp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mrkitp/dark_room_mentioned_in_hatha_yoga_book/gun5jp1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1618516541.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1618516541.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gun3y9h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gun0uu8", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "There's no doubt it's from much older sorcery.\n\nIn fact, I believe it comes from the same period (originally) as the Jewish and Olmec magic.\n\nIf you assume the origin is with the \"Fish People\" cults of the Akkadians.\n\nWhich might sound a bit shaky, but we know that the early writings of the most famous yogis, or perhaps \"scholars\" would be a better name for those guys,  are astounding!  \n\nWhere are those from, 1200 years ago?\n\nOr less perhaps.\n\nSo let's postulate a 6500-8500 year old common point, where Hinduism, Daoism, Qabalah, and Olmec sorcery, were emerging on the earth.\n\nBut then later, from perhaps 800AD on, there were periods when scholars and metaphysical researchers took the old sorcery to amazing heights.

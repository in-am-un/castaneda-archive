I could just say, &amp;quot;Tell me a story Cholita&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she&amp;#39;d go on for hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, she won&amp;#39;t speak to me more than 2 seconds before she threatens to beat me up if I don&amp;#39;t leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comparing Cholita&amp;#39;s ears to the Olmec statues, and to the Asian belief that this shape of ears means good fortune with money,  it was obvious she was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just assumed that in Mexico, there&amp;#39;s a left over Olmec population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as there are several major Indian populations still around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when I looked it up, no one calls themselves Olmec in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Olmecs were only &amp;quot;discovered&amp;quot; recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to look up the ethnic groups in Mexico.  Several web pages list them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of you tries it, and sees Olmec on the list, please point me there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita was certain.  Not even a tiny bit of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now why would she be thinking that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tied her to the myth by pointing that out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Florinda.

Often it came to disputes and absurd speculation, but ... maybe there is something in this, though not where they usually look?\n\nIf we abstract from the formal and eventful part, many in my memory said that \u201cthe mood of the books has changed,\u201d etc. or that according to \"Carlos' interviews from the 70s and 90s seem to be given by two different people\", that \"Castaneda seemed to be ill 90s\" and much more. And it would seem that all these are our subjective sensations that emerge in us for one reason or another. But now the third book of Armando Torres \"The Universal Web\" has been published, and in it we find several interesting episodes, which the author reports about. One of them is that Castaneda conceived a dangerous maneuver to \"change himself.\" Here he is:\n\n\u201cHe confirmed that this is the last time we will see each other and that another Carlos will take his place, and that he did not know what the parameters of his behavior would be.\n\nI was shocked by his statement, although I did not understand very well what he was talking about. \u201cBut you'll still be yourself, right? Or will you be different?

If that doesn't work, I might die, \u201dhe concluded grimly.\n\nMy future meetings with Carlos were no longer the same; on the one hand, he was the same person, but in a sense he was no longer the same person. \"\n\nHow much to believe the messages of Armando Torres is, of course, a separate question. But we have similar testimonies from people who knew Castaneda personally, and who were participants in his seminars with the 80s and students of classes in the 90s. That is, those who watched all this live and had the opportunity to compare. Interesting? Here are a couple of examples.\n\nOne of the attendees of lectures and seminars in Mexico and having a private conversation with Carlos, Edgar Delgado said: \u201cThese events took place at the time when his ninth book, The Art of Dreaming, was just published. From that time on, I had the feeling that some part of him was gone. His body remained in this world, but he was no longer the same Nagual \u201dand that\u201c perhaps he changed his energy configuration \u201d. (The Nagual's Witnesses).\n\nAnother participant in seminars and Sunday classes, Felix Wolff, who also personally encountered Castaneda in the 80s and was a student in the US in the 90s, writes: \u201cWith the publication of The Art of Dreaming in 1993, the mood changed, and through my personal connection with As the nagual, that mood and intention began to prevail, which invariably felt much less abstract than before \"and\" this is really somehow different from all other books \"...\" well, I don't know how to explain it. The general mood is different, as if someone else had already written it. \" (The Art of Navigation).\n\nWhy is that? Coincidence? Or something more that everyone felt differently?\n\nIt will probably not be superfluous to recall the recent statements of Renata Murez that the last books were written jointly, and not by Castaneda himself like the previous ones.\n\nAlso a significant indicator in this context is the fact that in the \"Wheel of Time\" only the first 8 books are cited as the basis of the teaching.\n\nIt is worth thinking carefully about the question, isn't it? And perhaps with intent to penetrate those different time periods in order to see the picture more whole and purer?\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20210206093507/https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/iq48ql/the_last_public_stage_in_the_distribution_of/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210206093507/https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/iq48ql/the_last_public_stage_in_the_distribution_of/)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kgs1bit", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last public stage in the distribution of knowledge in the 90s - a new Castaneda?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, was the OP title of this post.

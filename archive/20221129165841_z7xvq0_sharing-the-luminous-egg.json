No sacred scrolls.  All just real stuff you can learn to do yourself.\n\nDarkroom is the fastest way to learn about the \"place of no pity\", just because you get to see it yourself.\n\nAs you noticed.\n\nAt first just because you return to doubts and complaints, and darkroom and recap seem like such a huge burden, and a waste of time compared to watching reruns of old TV shows while eating ice cream.\n\nAnd then, when you start to practice, and do a good job, at the end you might literally feel like you are in heaven.\n\nThe contrast is amazing!\n\nSo you learn that there really, truly, is a \"poor baby me\" thing going on with us. And it can vanish in minutes, by doing tensegrity in silence.\n\nI like to think it's just because we got \"hazed\" by our family, when we had no idea what reality was.\n\nWe gazed out as newborns do, not focusing on anything specific.\n\nAnd then our family members grabbed  us, and insisted we look them in the eyes.\n\nNo one wants a retarded baby.\n\nSo slowly we were taught to be very \"self-aware\", of an imaginary thing called, \"the baby\".\n\nTo make sure we were \"cute\", and did tricks for grandma.\n\nTo show her, we don't give birth to defective babies in this new branch of the family.\n\nBut then we stopped being the \"super star\" and had to compete for our share of cookies.\n\nAnd we ended up with this self-pity, strife filled view of the world.\n\nWe lost the wonder of the vastness of reality, and traded it for cookies.\n\nHowever, as \"love is the essence of the universe\"  type new agers tell me on my facebook, I'm just a bitter old man who needs to ditch Cholita and find a \"good woman\".\n\nMy \"true love\".\n\nSo sorcerers don't usually analyze that way, which leaves room for attack.\n\nThey just point out, there's a beam of awareness flowing from the assemblage point.\n\nEven at a given level!\n\nIt can choose where to shine, at a specific depth.\n\nI guess it sort of \"rotates\", even without moving down?\n\nAnd usually it's shining between the toes, where the \"me, me, me\" filled self-pity bundle of emanations is located.\n\nBy the way, the emanations for youth are located about 2 feet out from that, straight ahead.\n\nAt least, that's what my Ally Fancy claims.\n\nBut she's always making big promises to teach me something cool, and then doesn't.\n\nJust tells me it's possible to learn that.\n\nHer last \"big tip\" was that we aren't unable to manipulate solid matter at all.\n\nSorcerers have always been able to do that.\n\nWe just weren't told about it.  It's dangerous for sorcerers to admit how powerful they really are.\n\nAccording to Fancy that is.\n\n\\&gt;  What practice can I do to reliably see the energy flow? \n\nDarkroom leads to that automatically.\n\nThe whitish light on surfaces you can perceive in the orange zone is the start.\n\nLater the actual emanations are visible, in various forms.\n\nAnd a silent knowledge entity or voice will explain how to manipulate them for a specific purpose you had in your trace thoughts.\n\n\\&gt; do you meet other energy generating sorcerers in dream bubbles? \n\nYes.  Often enough not to be uncommon. Not often enough to become friends.\n\nBut reality is vast, and there's so many of those out there.\n\nAnd even if you are certain you did that, when you return to the blue line it will seem like nonsense.\n\nI suppose I'll say that I decided to revive my idea of making gold rings for 10 sorcerers, created by this subreddit.\n\nBecause someone asked Jadey if she was \"certified\" to teach TEnsegrity.\n\n$12,000 is what Cleargreen charges.\n\nTo Jadey????\n\nI guess they ditched Carlos after all.\n\nBut I'll make the rings as \"Reader of Infinity\" rings, the goal Carlos gave everyone,  with a test Cholita will devise which requires being able to see what the test was.  Remotely.\n\nThat's a tall order, so maybe there will be some \"shared dreamer\" rings too.\n\nThat's easier to pull off.\n\nHow to test that is pretty easy, but the details best left in the advanced subreddit, which women get into more easily than men.\n\n \\&gt;Don Juan and their entire lineage share the same luminous egg? \n\nNot the way you mean it.\n\nEach egg is a \"universe\" all to itself.\n\nWhich is one reason they say, Carol Tiggs won't lead us.\n\nUniverses don't lead universes...\n\nSo each egg is in fact, \"located\" on top of the other eggs.\n\nAll of them.\n\nBut like a universe, I suppose it can overlap with others and it's not an issue.\n\nPhysical space and time are just a shine of awareness on the emanations. Not the ones in Man's band, but the ones responsible for organizing and creating the places we exist in.\n\nBut the way you mean it, no.\n\nIn fact, the egg of don Juan \"dented\" the egg of apprentices, so they didn't have to work as hard as we do to move our assemblage point to the other side of the cocoon.\n\nJadey thinks women have a hard time in here, and we need to figure out shared dreaming.\n\nI'm all for it, but up to my ears in waking dreaming.\n\nI'm just hoping to find \"the back door\" into sleeping dreaming, so I can help with that effort.\n\nI got a glimpse of it this morning. It was \"right there\"!\n\nBut I have no memory of it now.\n\nThe women can work on it in the meantime. Their womb is the doorway.\n\nThe animations I'm making could supply a suitable meeting place, which people can saturate themselves with, just by watching them.\n\nThe place is real, it's on Santa Monica Blvd at 522, in Santa Monica (Los Angeles near the beach).\n\nYou can see it on google maps, and even go inside if you know how to click down to street view.\n\n[https://www.google.com/maps/place/522+Santa+Monica+Blvd,+Santa+Monica,+CA+90401/@34.0175897,-118.4935753,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2a4ce67b24be5:0x2117628d38bcf5bf!8m2!3d34.0175897!4d-118.4935753](https://www.google.com/maps/place/522+Santa+Monica+Blvd,+Santa+Monica,+CA+90401/@34.0175897,-118.4935753,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2a4ce67b24be5:0x2117628d38bcf5bf!8m2!3d34.0175897!4d-118.4935753)\n\nThe women use womb dreaming to go there.\n\nUnfortunately, to meet another woman there in dreaming is the same as \"waking up in the real copy of your bedroom\" at the 4th gate of dreaming.\n\nMeaning, you have to \"fine tune\" the copy of reality you are in, to align with the copy another person is using.\n\nAnd until you \"lock in\" to that, the place is going to be a phantom realm.\n\nDon't believe anyone you see in there.\n\nIt's likely the Allies of Carlos or the witches reliving past glories.\n\nAnd don't gaze at \"Yoga Butt\".\n\nIt's dangerous.\n\nThe place is still dominated by \"ify\" yoga cults.\n\nThey hate Carlos.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iy9ghib", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;place of no pity&amp;quot; versus the place of endless &amp;quot;poor baby me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assemblage point positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One in the blue, one in the orange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a new person in this subreddit, it&amp;#39;s all just a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for some strange reason it pisses many off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were all happy being &amp;quot;warriors&amp;quot; and don&amp;#39;t like any &amp;quot;tests&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess they&amp;#39;re soothing themselves up at the blue line, with pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll make it down to the green soon if you work hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where pretending gives way to &amp;quot;Wow, I feel great and I just came back from a cool mini vision!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you think, maybe that diagram is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;re CERTAIN of it, when you get to the bottom on the back.

If you read between the lines, that's super obvious.  For instance, the evil \"basket\" that threatened to bite Pablito.\n\nI believe Carlos had little smoke, because when he introduced his allies to us in private class (he was dying), two of them started following me around.  For decades!\n\nI had to run for my life at least a few times, even after I got  used to them.\n\nWhen Cholita came along, I told the one I believe to be little smoke, to protect her.\n\nWhen we went out shopping, it would follow her around, and was fully visible at times.\n\nA little puff of white smoke, with some super bright lines radiating out from the middle.\n\nI'd been practicing on her with the \"pushing and pulling\", and she was able at that time, to move anything that had water on or in it, and wasn't too heavy.\n\nHer best trick was with the bathtub/shower.\n\nShe could make a drop of water remain at the end of the faucet instead of dripping, and then when the next drop would have come, they all just kept adding up.  Eventually there would be a drop of water, almost as large as a golf ball.\n\nBut the instant I realized that was going on and turned my head to look directly at it, it would fall.\n\nOne time I was cursing the sight, insisting it was just my imagination.\n\nThe water coming out of the shower started going sideways!\n\nWhich means, it fell at a 45 degree angle.\n\nI pretty much had to admit, after around 15 such sights, that the allies can in fact move objects.\n\nBut the grand finale was Cholita, who seemed to have stolen the ability to move things merely by looking at them.\n\nWe were in the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant.  Just to scare the shit out of me, Cholita changed to her energy body.\n\nIt's like watching a woman turn into some kind of evil octopus, except it's nearly all transparent.\n\nThe sight splits you into two, probably because only the double can see such a thing.\n\nThen in the restaurant we got into an argument about reddit, with Cholita not liking the whole thing.  She accused my \"little friends on reddit\" of planning to drink her blood some day.\n\nI brought up moving objects with your eyes.  We'd been discussing that lately.\n\nShe said, \"Like this?\"\n\nAnd glanced down at a dim sum plate.  Cholita had ordered nearly everything on the menu that night, and one of the ones she ate first, was an egg roll on a little plate.\n\nShe had also spilled egg drop soup all over the table in front of her, and the plate was just ripe to hydroplane on top of the soup.  It as like an \"ideal setup\" to slide a plate.\n\nWhen she gazed down, Little smoke flew over to it, fully visible as a white golf ball of smoke headed our way. I could look inside her as she went by, and there was intense yellow energy mixed in with the white, but only as tiny strands.\n\nShe flew under the plate, which jumped up in the air at least on inch (maybe 2), and plopped back down.\n\nI got so excited I either stood up, or started to.\n\nBut Cholita glared at me.\n\nSo I started to tell her, that as EXACTLY what I was talking about on reddit, and how did she do that?\n\nIt's been a while, best to go find an earlier account for fine details.\n\nShe gazed down, and the plate slid very slowly, an inch to the right.\n\nIt was an absolutely smooth movement.  One only a machine could produce.\n\nCholita herself was sitting with her arms to the side, and there was no visible way for her to pull off a trick.\n\nNot to mention, earlier that week we had spent 6 hours trying to deposit a check she got.\n\nHer madness didn't allow her to trust the bank teller. If the teller got out a pink paper form, she got angry and wanted to know why her account was being \"pink slipped\".\n\nBottom line, it was impossible for Cholita to deposit a check at the bank, she was so crazy.\n\nWe tried in the ATM on the other side of town (Cholita no longer trusted that bank), and we had to wait for at least 2 hours, before Cholita decided no one was around to spy.\n\nThat was the Cholita sitting across from me.  No way was she capable of planning a trick like that, if such a trick was even possible.\n\nAfter the second time I got excited again, Cholita got annoyed, and she gazed down and moved the little dim sum plate so far to the right, that it was no longer below her gaze.  At least 4 inches.\n\nIt was obvious she was done with that trick.\n\nI saw likely a total of 20 things moved by the entity, including a Chapstick that rolled all by  itself across the bed spread, and a box of Kleenex tissues, which slid by itself on the grocery store conveyor belt.    In plain sight of someone else, who refused to see it moving and later got angry over it.\n\nLikely the Allies move stuff often trying to get attention, but people simply get angry and ignore it.\n\nThe entity also liked fancy paper, which Cholita loves too.  It followed her around looking at expensive paper from Thailand.\n\nMy guess is, it likes things it can move.  And those paper icons made by an Indian tribe in Mexico, can actually be made to come to life if you have a sorcerer around.\n\nIs it really little smoke?  Beats me.  Carlos never told us.\n\nIn private classes, it would make the water cooler burp.\n\nLike you saw at the end of that video.\n\nWhen such a thing happens, there's no way to be sure if it was her, or just a coincidence.\n\nIt happened all the time in private classes, and Carlos would point it out afterwards.\n\nAfter it burped.\n\nIt always  was in response to an important teaching topic, as if the entity was \"agreeing\". Or liked the way things were going.\n\nJust as don Juan said. \"Agreements from the world around us\".\n\nThat gurgling teapot was just little smoke.   As  you heard in the video, she made something gurgle again, just so you could connect the two.\n\nLittle Smoke likes the videos.  If I had her in dreaming, she'd probably say it's about time!\n\nShe created this place herself.\n\nEarly book believers get angry about that point.  Absent any sorcery knowledge, they've been pretending every weird sound they hear is an \"agreement from the world around them\".  The idea that was little smoke infuriates them.\n\nJust as bad players pretend every crow caw is an \"omen\".\n\nThere may be a phony Nagual out there teaching that sort of nonsense.\n\nBut even that nasty black dot of death, was likely just little smoke.\n\nThe talking coyote, was surely little smoke  helping Carlos stop the world.\n\nThe moth was little smoke.  The one on the book covers.\n\nA moth helped me stop the world for the first time. Flew right into my left shoulder blade, pushing me forward.\n\nCarlos wanted to make sure we knew the burping water cooler wasn't just a coincidence, so just before he released his allies to us, he pre-announced a burp.\n\nAnd it burped after he pointed it out.\n\nTo introduce an Ally to someone, it's good enough just to have it swoop across their path, as long as they are in a position to notice something.\n\nIt's the connection.  The shared energy which comes from \"noticing\" something odd just flew by.  The same sort of energy we recapitulate, to remove or get back.\n\nThat's the connection the Allies want.  If they have even a \"strand\" of our awareness in them, and one of theirs in us, they can build on it.\n\nAt the campfire in the books, the swooping moth was also little smoke.", "edited": 1646672142.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hzpyofy", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Little Smoke:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke (and presumably Devil&amp;#39;s Weed), if they were the two inorganic beings that went with Carlos in the account from the books (the other 2 went with La Gorda), has been hanging out since back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos would bring up his allies in class to let us know, but he never said that was Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I believe it was, is because all of  the teaching in the early books, is by them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Allies teach apprentices.

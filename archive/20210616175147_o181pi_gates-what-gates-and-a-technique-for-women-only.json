I asked him if he would tell me more about the double. The concept interested me enormously.\n\n\"Some persons are masters of the double,\" he began. \"They can not only focus their awareness on it but also spur it into action. \"The majority of us, however, are scarcely aware that our ethereal side exists.\"\n\n\"What does the double do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Anything we want it to do. It can jump over trees, or fly through the air, or become large or small, or take the shape of an animal; or it can become aware of people's thoughts, or become a thought and hurl itself in an instant over vast distances.\"\n\n\"It can even act like the self,\" Clara interjected, looking straight at me: \"If you know how to use it, you can appear in front of someone and talk to him as if you were really there.\"\n\nMr. Abelar nodded. \"In the cave, you were able to perceive my presence with your double. \n\n\"It was only when your reason woke up that you doubted that your experience had been real.\"\n\n\"I'm still doubting,\" I said. \"Were you really there?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he replied with a wink, \"as much as I'm really here.\"\n\nFor a moment I wondered if I was dreaming now, but my reason assured me I couldn't possibly be.\n\nJust to make certain, I touched the table. It felt solid.\n\n\"How did you do it?\" I asked, leaning back on the sofa.\n\nMr. Abelar was silent for a moment as if choosing his words. \"I let go of my physical body and allowed my double to take over,\" he said:\n\n\"If our awareness is tied to the double, we are not affected by the laws of the physical world; rather, we are governed by ethereal forces.\n\n\"But as long as awareness is tied to the physical body, our movements are limited by gravity and other constraints.\"\n\nI still didn't understand if that meant that he could be in two places at once. He seemed to sense my confusion.\n\n\"Clara tells me you are interested in martial arts,\" Mr. Abelar said. \"The difference between the average person and an expert in kung fu is that the latter has learned to control his soft body.\"\n\n\"My karate teachers used to tell me the same,\" I said. \"They insisted that martial arts trained the soft side of the body, but I could never understand what they meant.\"\n\n\"What they probably meant was that when an expert practitioner attacks, he strikes the vulnerable points of his enemy's soft body,\" he said:\n\n\"It's not the power of the physical body that is destructive, but the opening he makes in his enemy's ethereal body.\n\n\"He can hurl into that opening a force that rips through the ethereal net to cause major damage.\n\n\"A person may receive what seems at the time only a gentle hit, but hours or perhaps days later, the person may die from that blow.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Clara agreed. \"Don't be fooled by the outward movements or by what you see. It's what you don't see that counts.\"\n\nFrom my karate teachers, I had often heard similar tales.\n\nWhen I had asked them how those feats were performed, they couldn't give me a coherent explanation.\n\nI had thought at the time that it was because my teachers were Japanese and couldn't express such intricacies of thought in English.\n\nNow Mr. Abelar was explaining something similar, and although his command of English was perfect, I still couldn't understand what he meant by the soft body or the double, and how to tap its mysterious powers.\n\nI wondered if Mr. Abelar was a martial artist, but before I could ask him, he continued. \"True martial artists, as Clara has described them to me from her training in China, are interested in mastering the control of their soft body,\" he said:\n\n\"The double is controlled not by our intellect but by our intent. There is no way to think about it or to understand it rationally. It has to be felt, for it is linked to some luminous lines of energy crisscrossing the universe.\"\n\nHe touched his head and pointed upward. \"For instance, a line of energy that extends up from the top of the head gives the double its purpose and direction. That line suspends and pulls the double whichever way it wants to go.  If it wants to go up, all it has to do is to intend up. If it wants to sink into the ground, it just intends down. It's that simple.\"\n\nAt that point Clara asked me whether I remembered what she had told me in the garden the day we were doing the sun breathing exercises: how the crown of the head always needed to be protected. \n\nI told her I remembered very clearly- ever since then, I was afraid to leave the house without a hat.\n\nShe then asked me if I was able to follow what Mr. Abelar was saying.\n\nI assured her that I was having no trouble understanding him even though I didn't comprehend the concepts; and paradoxically, I found what he was saying incomprehensible, yet also familiar and believable.\n\nClara nodded and said that was so because he was directly addressing a part of me that was not quite rational and had the ability to grasp things directly, especially if a sorcerer spoke to it directly.\n\nWhat Clara said was true. There was something about Mr. Abelar that put me even more at ease than Clara did. It wasn't his polite and soft-spoken manner, but something in the intensity of his eyes that forced me to listen and follow his explanations, despite the fact that rationally they seemed nonsensical. I heard myself asking questions as if I knew what I was talking about.\n\n\"Would I be able to reach my soft body some day?\" I asked Mr. Abelar.\n\n\"The question is, Taisha, do you want to reach it?\"\n\nFor a moment I hesitated.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* (break)\n\nMr. Abelar resumed talking about the double as if nothing else had been said.\n\n\"As we let go of our ideas of the physical body, little by little or all at once,\" he said, \"awareness begins to shift to our soft side. In order to facilitate this shift, our physical side must remain absolutely still, suspended as if it were in deep sleep. The difficulty lies in convincing our physical body to cooperate, for it rarely wants to give up its control.\"\n\n\"How do I let go of my physical body, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"You fool it,\" he said. \"You let your body feel as if it were sound asleep. You deliberately quiet it by removing your awareness from it. When your body and mind are at rest, your double wakes up and takes over.\"\n\n\"I don't think I follow you,\" I said.\n\nClara snapped, \"Don't play the devil's advocate with us, Taisha.\n\n\"You must have done this in the cave. In order for you to have perceived the nagual, you must have used your double. You were asleep and yet aware at the same time.\"\n\nWhat caught my attention in Clara's statement was the way she had spoken of Mr. Abelar: She had called him 'the nagual.' I asked her what that word meant.\n\n\"John Michael Abelar is the nagual,\" she said proudly. \"He is my guide; the source of my life and well-being. He is not my man by any stretch of the imagination and yet he is the love of my life. When he is all that for you, he'll then be the nagual for you also. In the meantime, he's Mr. Abelar, or even John Michael.\"\n\nMr. Abelar laughed, as if Clara had said those things only in jest, but Clara held my gaze long enough to let me know that she had meant every word of it. The silence that followed was finally broken by Mr. Abelar.\n\n\"In order to activate the soft body, you have to first open certain body centers that function like gates,\" he continued: \"When all the gates are open, your double can emerge from its protective covering.\n\n\"Otherwise, it will forever remain encased within its outer shell.\"\n\nHe asked Clara to get a mat out of the closet.\n\nHe spread it on the floor and told me to lie face up with my arms at my sides.\n\n\"What are you going to do to me?\" I asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Not what you think,\" he snapped.\n\nClara giggled. \"Taisha is really wary of men,\" she explained to Mr. Abelar.\n\n\"It hasn't done her any good,\" he replied, making me feel utterly self-conscious.\n\nThen, facing me, he explained he was going to show me a simple method for shifting awareness from my physical body to the ethereal net that surrounds it.\n\n\"Lie down and close your eyes, but don't fall asleep,\" he ordered.\n\nEmbarrassed, I did as he asked, feeling strangely vulnerable lying down in front of them.\n\nHe knelt down beside me and spoke in a soft voice. \"Imagine lines extending out from the sides of your body, beginning at your feet,\" he said.\n\n\"What if I can't imagine them?\"\n\n\"If you want to, you certainly can,\" he said. \"Use all your strength to intend the lines into existence.\"\n\nHe elaborated that it was not really imagining those lines that was involved, but rather a mysterious act of pulling them out from the side of the body, beginning at the toes and continuing all the way up to the top of the head.\n\nHe said that I should also feel lines emanating from the soles of my feet going downward and wrapping around the length of my body to the back of my head; and also other lines that radiated from my forehead upward and downward, along the front of my body to my feet, thus forming a net or a cocoon of luminous energy.\n\n\"Practice this until you can let go of your physical body and can place your attention at will on your luminous net,\" he said. \"Eventually, you'll be able to cast and sustain that net with a single thought.\"\n\nI tried to relax. I found his voice soothing. It had a mesmerizing quality. At times it seemed to come from very close, and at other times from far away.\n\nHe cautioned me that if there was a place in my body where the net felt tight or where it was difficult to stretch the lines out or where the lines recoiled, that was the place where my body was weak or injured.\n\n\"You can heal those parts by allowing the double to spread out the ethereal net,\" he said.\n\n\"How do I do that?\"\n\nHe replied, \"By intending it, but not with your thoughts. Intend it with your intent, which is the layer beneath your thoughts.  Listen carefully: Look for it beneath the thoughts; away from them.\n\n\"Intent is so far away from thoughts that we can't talk about it: We can't even feel it, but we can certainly use it.\"\n\nI couldn't even conceive how to intend with my intent.\n\nMr. Abelar said that I shouldn't have too much difficulty casting my net because for the past few months, unknowingly, I had been projecting just such ethereal lines during my recapitulation.\n\nHe suggested that I begin by concentrating on my breathing.\n\nAfter what seemed to be hours, during which time I must have dozed off once or twice, I could eventually feel an intense tingling heat in my feet and head. The heat expanded to form a ring encircling my body lengthwise.\n\nIn a soft voice, Mr. Abelar reminded me that I should focus my attention on the heat outside my body and try to stretch it out, pushing it out from within and allowing it to expand.\n\nI focused on my breathing until all the tension in me vanished.\n\nAs I relaxed even more, I let the tingling heat find its own course.\n\nIt didn't move outward or expand; it contracted instead, until I felt I was lying on a gigantic balloon, floating in space.\n\nI experienced a moment of panic. My breathing stopped and for an instant I was suffocating.\n\nThen something outside of myself took over and began to breathe for me.\n\nWaves of lulling energy surrounded me, expanding and contracting until everything went black and I could no longer focus my awareness on anything.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Gates?

The silence that followed was finally broken by Mr. Abelar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In order to activate the soft body, you have to first open certain body centers that function like gates,&amp;quot; he continued: &amp;quot;When all the gates are open, your double can emerge from its protective covering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Otherwise, it will forever remain encased within its outer shell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He asked Clara to get a mat out of the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spread it on the floor and told me to lie face up with my arms at my sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you going to do to me?&amp;quot; I asked suspiciously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not what you think,&amp;quot; he snapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clara giggled. &amp;quot;Taisha is really wary of men,&amp;quot; she explained to Mr. Abelar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It hasn&amp;#39;t done her any good,&amp;quot; he replied, making me feel utterly self-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, facing me, he explained he was going to show me a simple method for shifting awareness from my physical body to the ethereal net that surrounds it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lie down and close your eyes, but don&amp;#39;t fall asleep,&amp;quot; he ordered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Embarrassed, I did as he asked, feeling strangely vulnerable lying down in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He knelt down beside me and spoke in a soft voice. &amp;quot;Imagine lines extending out from the sides of your body, beginning at your feet,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What if I can&amp;#39;t imagine them?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you want to, you certainly can,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Use all your strength to intend the lines into existence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He elaborated that it was not really imagining those lines that was involved, but rather a mysterious act of pulling them out from the side of the body, beginning at the toes and continuing all the way up to the top of the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that I should also feel lines emanating from the soles of my feet going downward and wrapping around the length of my body to the back of my head; and also other lines that radiated from my forehead upward and downward, along the front of my body to my feet, thus forming a net or a cocoon of luminous energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Practice this until you can let go of your physical body and can place your attention at will on your luminous net,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Eventually, you&amp;#39;ll be able to cast and sustain that net with a single thought.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to relax. I found his voice soothing. It had a mesmerizing quality. At times it seemed to come from very close, and at other times from far away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He cautioned me that if there was a place in my body where the net felt tight or where it was difficult to stretch the lines out or where the lines recoiled, that was the place where my body was weak or injured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can heal those parts by allowing the double to spread out the ethereal net,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do I do that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He replied, &amp;quot;By intending it, but not with your thoughts. Intend it with your intent, which is the layer beneath your thoughts.  Listen carefully: Look for it beneath the thoughts; away from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Intent is so far away from thoughts that we can&amp;#39;t talk about it: We can&amp;#39;t even feel it, but we can certainly use it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t even conceive how to intend with my intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Abelar said that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have too much difficulty casting my net because for the past few months, unknowingly, I had been projecting just such ethereal lines during my recapitulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He suggested that I begin by concentrating on my breathing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After what seemed to be hours, during which time I must have dozed off once or twice, I could eventually feel an intense tingling heat in my feet and head. The heat expanded to form a ring encircling my body lengthwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a soft voice, Mr. Abelar reminded me that I should focus my attention on the heat outside my body and try to stretch it out, pushing it out from within and allowing it to expand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I focused on my breathing until all the tension in me vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I relaxed even more, I let the tingling heat find its own course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t move outward or expand; it contracted instead, until I felt I was lying on a gigantic balloon, floating in space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I experienced a moment of panic. My breathing stopped and for an instant I was suffocating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then something outside of myself took over and began to breathe for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waves of lulling energy surrounded me, expanding and contracting until everything went black and I could no longer focus my awareness on anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

Cattle prod is appropriate for motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it seems that women can just lie on their back and float away into the void.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect the problem there might be, they&amp;#39;re alone in the void.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they don&amp;#39;t keep going back endlessly, to let it grow into real sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which, will not be &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s much easier for them, if they learn to do that a little, to go join a &amp;quot;community&amp;quot;, and let themselves stay ignorant forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s going to produce the very best sorceress, is a desire to be a &amp;quot;curiosa&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are witches who don&amp;#39;t care about people at all, and have made friends with beings who live outside our world, in infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan and Clara were also teasing Taisha about sex in that book. She was worried don Juan wanted to ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say, Clara didn&amp;#39;t exactly rule that out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed like I suspected. There&amp;#39;s stuff going on at the &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; that is useful for Carlos bashing, but perfectly normal for sorcery groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for women.  I have Cholita around, so I know what went on with the women in private classes.  I mean, their contribution to anything like that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose this passage implies why a Nagual finds 8 women first, before he finds the new male Nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the women, all 8 of them, can begin learning easily, just by being around some structure that&amp;#39;s pointing in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just need permission to believe the weird stuff they can do, leads to something good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve all be taught by our crummy religions that it leads to something bad!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id":

No name tags, no way to tell at our skill level.\n\nI ended up trying to build a snowman for it to inhabit.\n\nAt first it was just a cowboy head on the upper right of a piece of paper, with a list of \"secrets\" in the lower left of the paper.\n\nThe paper kept brushing up against my face, as I tried to sleep.  The cowboy drawn on the paper, wanted to \"share\" the secrets with me.\n\nThe cowboy guy could also have been a Mexican peasant type.  Wasn't all that Texas Cowboy looking.  Was more like a practical manner of dress, for outdoor laboring activity.\n\nSo, here's how far this \"build a bear\" thing can go.\n\n(Build a bear is a business in shopping malls, where kids pick up the parts and accessories for a toy stuffed bear, and then put it together.)\n\nTo form the body, flap the hands.  Pretend it's a giant stack of wet clay,  the same size as a grown person, but perhaps too diffuse, and you can slap it with your palm and fingers (mostly fingers), to tamp it into shape.\n\nStart at the head. Left hand slap inward, right hand slap inward.  If there's not enough material, scoop far to the left or right, gathering a puff of purple light, and apply to the stack of light, which might have changed to more pinkish.\n\nMove down just a few inches each round, and slap it all around to form the shape. The slapping is fast, like both hands hit each second.\n\nYou can slap hard if you like, but if you do, look at the effects on the outline.  Or just keep it casual, and don't do it hard. Go up and down.\n\nIf you want to understand the \"hard slap\", find something crusty floating in the air, in the dreaming fog.  A tiny collection of light and dark, that seems to have its own existence.\n\nSlap that, but only on it's side. Don't push it away.  Slap into the right side of the \"thing\" for example, drop the hand, and wait for the \"intent delay\". It will light up a little as a result.\n\nBut I don't recommend the hard slap for the snowman. You'll get tired.\n\nIf you eventually see a fairly well formed human shape, and it's bright enough to be surprising, you hit the jackpot!\n\nTurn to your right, form claws with your fingers, and pick the air apart, looking for any details you can.  Do this at your own eye level.  Pretend to be a monkey picking out lice from your buddies head.\n\nDon't eat the lice, and hopefully you won't actually find any.\n\nYou're \"teasing the web\", but on a strip, and in very fine detail.\n\nForm a \"strip\" around 4 feet long and 8 inches tall. You may have to side step to solidify it for that length.\n\nNow you have a surface made out of weird crystalized dreaming fog and fragments of visible cobwebs, in front of you.  Gaze into the details walking from left to right along that strip.\n\nLook for \"faces\" you can put onto your snowman.\n\nI had around 5 different choices last night.  Evenly spaced along the entire distance.\n\nThe faces on the strip may be making weird grimaces at you, but don't let that worry you.  When you find the face you like, just pull it out of the strip with your fingers, and insert it into the head of the snowman.\n\nSnowman done.  I's like putting 2 coals for eyes, and a carrot for a nose, and drawing a smile on it.\n\nIn fact, you can poke the energy snowman with 2 fingers to make eyes, and scrape a mouth on it, if you can't find the \"strip of faces\" floating in the air.\n\nIt's \"practical magic\".  Meaning, you start to actually use what you see in the darkroom, to accomplish a long term task.\n\nIt's a \"Golem\", for the Kabbalah minded.\n\nI didn't realize that when I first started doing this, under Fancy's instruction.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem)\n\nIn this case,  it's a pointless task.  Hard to see how this could be \"practical magic\".\n\nBut the second attention doesn't care if something makes sense or has a use outside the dark room.\n\nLet me put this more clearly.\n\nScoop the puffs, play with them casually, and it'll slowly move your assemblage point on the J curve.\n\nConcentrate more intensely and interact with them using more of your attention, not getting distracted, and it will move your assemblage point faster.  Very fast, if you get really vivid colors, and do spectacular things with them.\n\nBut, when you try to accomplish something using them, something seemingly unrelated, you've just focused your attention on that \"level\".  You can move left or right there, to make your task more possible, and change who \"you\" are to make it more compatible, but you won't move down the J curve as much as before.\n\nAnd if you actually produce something doing that, you've anchored it at that level, as long as you are playing with that new thing.\n\nThe snowman is a good example.\n\nBut it will halt your progress in doing the full J curve over and over.\n\nI suppose it's what went wrong with Julian and La Catalina.\n\nBecause they didn't move all the way on the J curve each day, they didn't develop the ability to reach the 3rd attention.\n\nThey had fun instead.", "edited": 1605727343.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gcqo7w4", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow up:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night an inorganic being woke me up to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First time that&amp;#39;s happened, as far as I can recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it Fancy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. It seemed like a new entity to me, but it also had no nametag.

You can move left or right there, to make your task more possible, and change who &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; are to make it more compatible, but you won&amp;#39;t move down the J curve as much as before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you actually produce something doing that, you&amp;#39;ve anchored it at that level, as long as you are playing with that new thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The snowman is a good example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it will halt your progress in doing the full J curve over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;#39;s what went wrong with Julian and La Catalina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they didn&amp;#39;t move all the way on the J curve each day, they didn&amp;#39;t develop the ability to reach the 3rd attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had fun instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jvzckj/building_snowmen_in_the_dark_room/gcqo7w4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1605722384.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_jvzckj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gcn99ep", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1605644081.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_jvzckj", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I should mention: It's not uncommon to find a little city on the floor in your darkroom.\n\nIt's in that picture, but a little vague.\n\nIt's because any flat surface can be used as a \"horizon\" for viewing energy.\n\nAnd for some reason, when you look down it invokes the idea of an aerial view.\n\nIntent takes form with that in mind.\n\nCarlos commented on it.

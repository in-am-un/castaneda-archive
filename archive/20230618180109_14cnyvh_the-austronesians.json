If you want their shamanism, you have to marry one.](https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a63e97bbce68a7dbfa7ca12318140638e4c1f2a)\n\nI was up on Mt. Ali in Taiwan, drinking tea with the owner of a high mountain tea farm.\n\nWhere I have a reputation as the alcoholic engineer from California, who brings small groups of obscenely young women along to play with.\n\nSame reputation Carlos would have gotten up there.\n\nThe Tea farmer guy is half owner in a spa resort hotel, which was created by my Taiwanese boss after a few well placed bribes to make the land he built it on \"the right zoning\".\n\nHad to make a deal with the aborigines to pipe him down some hot water from their springs, so that it could be a \"hot springs resort\".  That of course became part of the whole bribe thing, since it guaranteed some more income for the tribes up there.\n\nBut a bath in hot springs water in Taiwan is kind of like an orange juice from their convenience store \"Family Mart\".\n\n10% juice.  And don't ask which juice.\n\n90% god only knows. That changes as they get \"caught\" over the  years.\n\nThe last big \"food scandal\" being putting powdered plastics in sports drinks to make them slightly thicker, which turned out to sterilize the male population of Taiwan.\n\nThey were really pissed about that one once they figured out why their numbers were dwindling.\n\nYet the teas up on Mt. Ali are so good, practically none of it makes it to the west. It's nearly all sold in Asia, and mostly in Taiwan. At tea prices we'd refuse to pay here.\n\nBut it makes a good bribe!  You tape some cash to the bottom of the tin of tea, all sealed up from the tea farm factory, and humbly present the tea to the IRS agent, using both hands so that it's even polite in Japan.\n\nHe  can feel the bills under the tea.\n\nAnd you won't have to pay that 10% business tax after all.\n\nThe tea farm guy figured, since I must be looking for a young wife, he could top the woman I brought along.\n\nHe took me up to this tea farm on the top of the mountain, and his \"secretary\", now a grandmother, brought out her 19 year old daughter for me to meet.\n\nIt's a very old custom in Taiwan, going all the way back to the Dutch occupation, when the Island was called, \"Dutch Formosa\".\n\nThe offer of a wife comes with the bonus that you are part of the family. Until the brothers decide to murder you for not spoiling their sister enough.\n\nAnd as part of the family, you get to see their shamanism.\n\nI don't honestly believe any of it works anymore.  It probably fell to the same fate as Mesoamerican shamanism.\n\nIt worked in the time of the Olmecs.\n\nThey had both lame \"shamans\" (Men of Knowledge), and seers.\n\nDifferent animals.\n\nBut their shamans could actually use allies to produce Silent Knowledge.\n\nWe read about that in the books.  The talking lizards is a good example.\n\nWhereas, modern \"shamanism\" doesn't work.\n\nIt's just more make believe.\n\nOr as don Juan called them, \"assholes\".\n\nMen who follow the rituals of the old Men of Knowledge, but have no actual knowledge themselves.\n\nSo it doesn't work.\n\nI get all sorts of private mail, from \"genuine native Americans\" complaining about my feed.\n\nOne said he was a \"rock hauler\" in the genuine tradition of Southern California shamanism.\n\nMeaning he was such a pest some \"shaman\" leader  had him hauling rocks up mountains, and convinced him that was \"spiritual\".\n\nI'm very cynical of \"shamanism for sale\", and for very good reason.\n\nIt looks to me like Russians are remarketing crappy Siberian shamanism rituals, to sell to Castaneda fans.  Because I get friend requests from people who are featuring the latest \"Learn Siberian Shamanism\" workshop.\n\nGood luck with that...\n\nOur shamanism is in fact \"proto-Siberian\", but the \"proto\" keyword says it all.\n\nVery old...   Not what's left in Siberia now, after the invention of money and agriculture.\n\nAnd bad player Russians looking for unique franchises.\n\nThere is however some \"genuine magic\" out there, hidden.  Not for sale.\n\nAnd I was told by my Ally \"Mystery\", that there were originally 8 \"great\" strains of shamanism that actually worked.\n\nOne of them that might still be intact somewhere, is \"Islander shamanism\".\n\nNo doubt very different from our own.\n\nHere's what ChatGPT said about it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nTo ChatGPT:\n\nTheorize for me.  There is a form of shamanism on tropical Islands that is still functional. Still produces amazing effects that defy reason.  But it's found on distant islands.  What is the common source?\n\nChatGPT:\n\nIf we are theorizing about a form of shamanism on distant tropical islands that still produces amazing effects, it is essential to approach this topic with an open mind and recognize that this is purely speculative.\n\nOne possible explanation could be the shared cultural heritage of the Austronesian peoples. As mentioned earlier, the Austronesian migration was a significant movement of people from Taiwan across Southeast Asia and the Pacific, resulting in the settlement of various island groups. Although they dispersed and developed unique cultures in different regions, there may have been some shared cultural practices, including shamanistic beliefs and rituals.\n\nShamanism is a practice that involves connecting with the spiritual world, often through altered states of consciousness, in order to access healing, guidance, and supernatural powers. It is found in many indigenous cultures around the world. If there are similar shamanistic practices and beliefs among the Austronesian peoples of different islands, it may suggest a common source or cultural exchange in ancient times.\n\nAnother possibility is that these tropical islands have unique environments that foster a spiritual connection and heightened experiences. The lush landscapes, abundant biodiversity, and natural wonders found on distant islands could inspire a deep reverence for nature and a belief in the spiritual interconnectedness of all living beings. This could enhance the effectiveness and potency of shamanistic practices carried out in these environments.\n\nAdditionally, isolation and relative seclusion of these distant islands may have preserved traditional beliefs and practices over time. In some cases, these remote locations may have limited external influences and modernization, allowing ancient traditions to persist and thrive.\n\nIt's important to note that without specific information about which islands or cultures are being referred to, these are merely speculative theories. To gain a more accurate understanding, further research and investigation into the specific cultures and practices in question would be necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Austronesians", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3824k8mbqs6b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be716a72ffba0016dba71e7c27a68a7f7656e0f9"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d45c0ae2847e12334cf0a901d575bea3c092bfeb"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ea80e33f00117368ce62dafdeb2951e24a79055"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7788f869bd3667e7d4893c9e72e31fb3ada61b08"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3c83d6e30825a7d020ba87f5d7f375de650685d"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fc5e5db4bd4acf640cfe94219cd0f34357943a2"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a63e97bbce68a7dbfa7ca12318140638e4c1f2a"}, "id": "3824k8mbqs6b1"}}, "name": "t3_14cnyvh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bVWeP2piryecXdH24cD97F_G5RN735_0QW_3SXwAZc8.jpg", "edited": 1687104611.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1687104069.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3824k8mbqs6b1.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3a63e97bbce68a7dbfa7ca12318140638e4c1f2a\"&gt;Taiwanese Austronesians.

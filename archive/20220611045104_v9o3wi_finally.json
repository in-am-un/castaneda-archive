Early March was full of mind-blowing magic, things that really pushed my own limits and understanding and made me feel like I was operating on a completely different level to before. And I was.\n\nThen I had to do recap because it was clear that there were some unresolved issues in my past that I really needed to untangle or they were going to hold me back. There wasn't much magic but that was okay. At least when I recapped there were always IOBs around lending me encouragement. But after a while even they dispersed.\n\nIt got so boring.\n\nI tried re-arranging things in my life to gather whatever energy I could. I changed my relationships, I went hunting for power and intending dreaming in places I knew were good for me, I visited the Olmec statues at the gallery. I couldn't figure out where my energy had gone or why it was so hard for me to relax into dreaming.\n\nThen finally it changed.\n\nWhile practicing and expecting very little a couple of days ago, I started to see dream objects appear in my vision. Just brief flashes but it was more than I'd had in weeks. Realising this was my opportunity, I reached over and grabbed my phone. I had set an alarm so that I wouldn't miss an appointment later but I knew I could squeeze out some extra time. I changed the alarm, put it down, and got back to focusing.\n\nI could feel an IOB around. At first it was a presence and a voice, but later became a buzzing pressure I would feel periodically make contact with my energy body. It didn't feel like Ren but they had a similar weight to them and I was gladly going to accept whatever help I could get.\n\nI relax and more dream objects begin to appear, but only in brief flashes. I move my arms and legs around. It feels like I am really moving my physical body but I know my dog is asleep on my lap and if he hasn't kicked me in the stomach yet for disturbing him then I am very clearly in my double. I begin to celebrate and dance around. Finally! It feels so good to be back.\n\nI look ahead of me. I can see a room with white painted walls as though I'm sitting on the floor in a hallway but the image only lasts a second and is gone. I know I have enough energy to stay in my double but I can barely keep any images in view. The room has disappeared and I can't enter it.\n\nThen something kind of abstract happens. I'm aware of these strange orbs in the space around me. They are like large, blue, glass marbles or pearls. Inside them there are dreams. I go to the first one and instinctively try to enter it but it too disappears in an instant.\n\n'Fine, I'll do it on my own then.' I lift my hands up in front of me with my index finger and thumbs pointed outwards at right angles to each other as though I was about to frame a shot for a video, but I started with my hands overlapping. I slowly drew them outwards, forming a small rectangle in the space between my hands as though I was making a soap bubble, intending it would open a window to a dream.\n\nI sort of had the idea from Everything Everywhere All At Once where the main characters look through a gap in their hands into another world, but it wasn't the first time I'd seen this suggestion. I'd heard that witches used to use hagstones (river pebbles with a hole passing all the way through) for the same thing. Looking through the hole would allow them to see straight into the other world.\n\nMy vision shut off again but I kept slowly dragging my hands apart. I /knew/ my intent was good, I /knew/ it would work. If I kept trying I should see a dream start to appear...\n\nSuddenly a rush of purple stuff erupted from the centre point between my hands and flared outwards and I felt myself get pulled away.\n\nThat was definitely not what I was expecting to see, but the effect was the same.\n\nI was now standing in a kitchen somewhere. Out the window in front of me was a misty garden gently illuminated by the soft rays of the morning sun. I could feel the ambient temperature of the room as well as the warmth of the sunlight seeping into my bones. It felt like it was energising me so I stood there for a few seconds just basking in the warmth.\n\nI'm always amazed at the ability to feel ambient temperature in dreaming now. It is not something Ive ever noticed in ordinary sleeping dreams but I don't know if it's just a peculiarity for me or if it is similar for other people.\n\nI went to continue the experience. There were some events with the IOB that was nearby and some other things that are not worth recounting here. But the entire experience was cut short. My alarm started going off and brought me back to my physical body.\n\nI picked up my phone and it was still early in the session.\n\nI had already switched to my double before I had tried to change my alarm at the start.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Finally", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"33n0qr7oqw491": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/33n0qr7oqw491.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ad04949dcc5c42b150d9c6f2551686ef07cd298"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/33n0qr7oqw491.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e53376eec66e686abdbc4c1fb0f738438243f7e3"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/33n0qr7oqw491.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90cf0fa1b3eb0ad31add74ae4b9ff85dc5a72da3"}], "s": {"y": 408, "x": 612, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/33n0qr7oqw491.jpg?width=612&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba0ffcf0d037d542db2d8f2a50f576ff5e649f86"}, "id": "33n0qr7oqw491"}}, "name": "t3_v9o3wi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_4dz9kepm", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/C_amzfruTeZwD14iWSWyP6kX2JeYx_y0abG-DuewBMY.jpg", "edited": 1654916447.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1654915864.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/33n0qr7oqw491.jpg?width=612&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ba0ffcf0d037d542db2d8f2a50f576ff5e649f86\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/33n0qr7oqw491.jpg?width=612&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ba0ffcf0d037d542db2d8f2a50f576ff5e649f86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know things go in waves and cycles, but I start going crazy without magic in my life.

She taught me \"to leave the darkroom\".\n\nTruly did!\n\nAnd then I suppose she was done.\n\nBut I'm up to my ears in new IOBs lately.\n\nAnd things I can't identify.  Totally smooth movements, perfectly stable too.\n\nIt's since Minx and I made friends, with Cholita's \"blessing\".\n\nNot that Cholita is happy about it, but she seems calmer. Like she doesn't have to babysit a crazy inorganic being all day long anymore.\n\nAs for me, she still loathes me. I offered to build her a house of her own last night, and she wouldn't even speak to me about it.\n\nBut she has lent me Minx.\n\nHe brings other IOBs to me.\n\nKeep in mind, this is the darndest thing you can see.\n\nIt's real!\n\nExcept to perceive it awake, you have to be far out near or in the purple zone of the J curve.\n\nUp until then, perhaps the IOBs are just manifestations, and short lived.\n\nIf you shift far horizontally, you slip into a mostly non-lucid waking dreaming, and the IOBS can be spectacularly \"real\" looking.\n\nBut to be in the middle of the J curve, and not shifted into nutty out of control dreaming at all, and yet they are still very real, is unusual.\n\nWhich might be easier to reach, with a \"project\" to keep you focused.\n\nI'm making that \"Dream Bubble Station\" with a witch.\n\nI sent Minx and all of his buddies (6-8) through the tunnel, and they gave the witch on the other end a hard time, sucking up energy like vampires.  Might even have disturbed her guests.\n\nI don't mind that sort of thing myself, but it can be disturbing at first when they try to feast on you.\n\nSo tonight Minx returned from Cholita's side of the house, and I gave him a lecture about his friends.  \n\nHe agreed to keep them under control.\n\nStanding right there!  In Cholita's \"weird little boy\" form.\n\nI felt bad telling him they couldn't use the tunnel because of bad behavior, but added that the station and surrounding transportation network needed workers.\n\nIf any wanted a job, they were welcome.\n\nI sent Minx down the tunnel, and a while later his friend who likes to wear \"big armor\", like the samurai wore in battle, showed up.\n\nBut in a security guard outfit, with a white helmet.  It had padded shoulders so he could take stick blows, sort of like an Asian riot suit.\n\nI hired him as a guard, and he walked off into the vast dark underground complex.\n\nAgain, I was fully awake, eyes open, no drugs.\n\nYou simply get to be Harry Potter or Merlin the Magician, some nights.\n\nFor real!!!\n\nBut don't expect to be excited.  It's likely all in \"sleepwalking\" territory.\n\nIt's not exciting. It can be mildly surprising and certainly amusing.\n\nBut you don't get the kind of thrill people try to pretend, in the river of shit.\n\n\\&gt;'Fine, I'll do it on my own then.' I lift my hands up \n\nSo, here's a \"secret\".\n\nWe have 2 brains.  Two minds.\n\nThe tensegrity tries to bring out the silent mind.  The one that manages muscle memory.\n\nBut our tonal mind is always watching and doubting.  Or not doubting. Just rating the gain from something.  No gain, then it's not \"real\".\n\nStill, as you learn waking dreaming (I have no idea if this works in sleeping dreaming), you learn to raise up an arm, when you are viewing a dream.  It's just easier to sustain the dream vision.\n\nEven Juann seems to have noticed that.\n\nOr you raise both arms up, the way the old seer is doing on the cover of wheel of time, to summon his dream vision in the sky.\n\nYou \"engage the body\" as an energetic structure, with physical movements or gestures that you learn make it easier.\n\nThe old Olmec figuring called, \"The Wrestler\" taunts us with that knowledge.\n\nHe's pressing his shoulder forward while he leans, and then his other hand is formed into a fist, so he can punch.\n\nHe \"leans\" in some rarely used energy, stirred by hunching his shoulder and moving it slightly forward, and the fist down there can be  used to \"activate\" things.  To \"inject\" some tonal reasoning.\n\nThe Affection pass is very much like that statue, except that it engages the double as an entity \"outside yourself\".\n\n\\&gt;I was now standing in a kitchen somewhere. Out the window in front of me was a misty garden\n\nSo as it turns out, sleeping dreamers, especially women, can \"align\" to waking dreamers.\n\nIt could be that the best combination of pairs is a waking dreamer male, and a sleeping dreamer woman.\n\nI'm kind of \"down on sleeping dreaming\", but I've learned that's only a good stance, for men.\n\nWomen can go right into lucid dreaming, and don't have any \"book deal aspirations\" because it's just normal for them.  Caused by their assemblage points being more fluid.\n\n\\&gt;Suddenly a rush of purple stuff erupted\n\nI've learned that this happens when the energy body \"reforms\".\n\nBut that's in waking dreaming.  I didn't expect it in sleeping dreaming, because I assumed the entire scene was built out of the energy body.\n\nThat it could \"rush together\" or swarm, but you were still in a fully realistic dream, would surprise me.\n\nConsider humans as clueless shapeshifters.\n\nAnd in their dreams, their shapeshifting body surrounds them like a bubble and projects phantom worlds.\n\nThere's just enough left of the energy body to give the impression of a \"person\" walking around, but if you have done a lot of 4 gates dreaming, you realize that the \"person\" walking around is pretty flexible about being present, or not being present. He can simply watch like it was a movie.\n\nOr be one of the phantom characters. Even an animal.\n\nWe \"find our hands\" to insure he's forming a body for us to use for experimenting with scouts.  \"Dispersed\" into the dream scene, there's not much for the scouts to play with.\n\nWhen we \"form\" solid by looking at our hands and at objects, they can come play.\n\nBut when freely dreaming, it looks like you discovered the sights of some \"energy body\" parts returning to the middle to concentrate, and produce a dream change.  Maybe they needed to \"consult\" with the tonal awareness first?\n\n\\&gt;I'm always amazed at the ability to feel ambient temperature in dreaming now.\n\nSince creating a link to another sorcerer's house, I can not only feel temperature coming from there, but also smells.\n\nI never noticed smells before.\n\nBut if they bake cookies on the other side, there's a good chance I'll smell them now.\n\nHaven't \"heard\" a sound from the other side yet though.\n\nBut probably all the senses can detect things in dreaming.\n\nThe emanations are DESIGNED to produce \"sensory data\".\n\nThat's why we get confused into believing it's \"real\".", "edited": 1654963656.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ibzhd82", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;It didn&amp;#39;t feel like Ren&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe Ren got charged with too much male energy, by helping me out?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hasn&amp;#39;t been back since she blocked me from visiting Pleiades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then she finished what she promised.

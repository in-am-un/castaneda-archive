We&amp;#39;re just seeking the flexibility to choose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what happened to Mankind, according to Carlos, is that a special variety of inorganic being learned to &amp;quot;lick&amp;quot; our shiny outer coating down to where all we could focus on was that &amp;quot;me, me, me&amp;quot; spot between the toes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery alters that, so that the shiny outer coating grows back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it reaches the knees perhaps, the fliers don&amp;#39;t like the taste and leave you alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about &amp;quot;the fliers mind&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bobby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z9gl4vz2rmdc1.png?width=672&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dd142292bca2afaf7b546540b1bc9e55ce383027\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/z9gl4vz2rmdc1.png?width=672&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dd142292bca2afaf7b546540b1bc9e55ce383027&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really just what your internal dialogue turned into, while focusing only on &amp;quot;me,  me, me&amp;quot; and how you could gain what you believe you want for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Human attention, fame, money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the kinds of things which are meaningless, once you can change worlds for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Famous where???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not in all 600 worlds we have access to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you really like the pull to this hellhole world, of being &amp;quot;famous&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Famous in the river of shit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One more obstacle to overcome, if you want to escape it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why Carlos had to become Joe C\u00f3rdova.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fry cook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, why isn&amp;#39;t it just the &amp;quot;me, me, me mind&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why include &amp;quot;the fliers&amp;quot; in naming the results of them licking us down?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learn the answer to that, if you make it to the red zone on the J curve and have an Ally helper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same way the Allies can teach you down there, sometimes with an audible voice, sometimes seemingly by telepathy, &amp;quot;the fliers&amp;quot; do the same to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being inorganic beings, it&amp;#39;s likely the same process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can cause ideas to come into our mind, and make them seem like really good ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they have a representative licking on all people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And can tell what they&amp;#39;re up to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that if they want to attack something, like this subreddit,  they can always find a person into whose mind they can whisper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They use &amp;quot;Jedi Mind Tricks&amp;quot; on people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus maybe &amp;quot;the flier&amp;#39;s mind&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t mean what we think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t mean their mind has been inserted into ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means, in our crippled state of &amp;quot;me, me, me&amp;quot; obsession, it&amp;#39;s easy for them to install ideas into your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They OWN your mind by virtual of being able to convince it to think anything they like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not THEIR mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That topic was not given to use in much detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve never &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;

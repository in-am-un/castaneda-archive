What was \"It\"? I wrote literally about 10 pages a day for a week that could explain in \"grand\" but I'll save you the trouble and give you a \"crumble\" instead.\n\n*Let Your Assemblage Point Move First*\n\nI've been waiting, patiently, for a long time. The truth is I died a long time ago but the timing wasn't quite right so I've been on life support by means of a litany of psychiatric drugs--one in particular--I'm titrating down (zyprexa). 10 years ago when I died, I knew the rules, I knew what I was supposed to do, but I was just 24 at the time, broke, and alone. I wasn't \"mad\" but I couldn't work in the river of filth without pharmaceuticals because the world was just waves and fog at the time--or the \"hellscape\" as I call it. Fast forward to 2019: I started experimenting not taking that dastardly drug (just the fun ones I kept) and the Abstract opened up and swallowed me into a mystery (one you can read all about deep in my comments in my profile) that hit a turning point on 2021-06-26 around 9:30am PDT. What the conclusion to that mystery is remains unknown, but what kept me in the river of filth to begin with for so long?\n\nI forget what CC called it if he did at all, so I'll call it the \"ghost fiber\". The ghost fiber is an emotional filament attached to a sorcerer's heart, so to speak, that he or she must unplug to fulfill their fate--it's usually the last one--or at least the last major one. How this is done is different for everyone, usually it's just a random act of ruthlessness, but what is the same for everyone is you must wait, patiently. I waited a decade, in fact, until several days after my 32d birthday. It can be really anything actually, I chose to write a poem, since that worked for CC--I chose to include it below (it doesn't really mean anything but I guess it's the feeling that counts).\n\nI have a few disorders I developed during my wait. Like for example, I cry involuntarily at inappropriate times, like in the frozen food aisle. I always suspected this was because of the ghost fiber haunting me, but it was all just numbness in the mix on my pharmaceutical cocktail to me. It's not really a weep, just a swelling of inert tears that spill out of my eyes. My mother raised me witch style because she's a violent but sweet schizo, but she never fails to compliment me on my \"cry-e-eyes\". What ultimately ripped my ghost fiber was self defeat. I had a perversion as a small child that I would never make it past age 31 and that day I had failed myself. I ate my daily breakfast at the Chick-fil-A two blocks down from my place, not quite as proudly as I could have on the 26th, more alone than ever.\n\n*Then Years Later Have The Realization*\n\nAs I walked out of the establishment, I could feel something growing in me like I was about the implode. I lit a cigarette and it was all the sudden clear to me, watching the parade of animals in their Teslas and Land Rovers honk and grind in the Star-fucker 15 minute line, that all I had to do this whole time was slow down, real slow. I was enraged watching these asshats from my position on the lot and I let the anger out little by little and focused it by pinching my cigarette butt, until the world stopped. I was fluid with the wind and time unlike I have ever been, it was quite the spectacle. When I got in the car I said fuck it, let's jump, and I turned inside out and landed back in my seat, a new person--literally. I knew exactly what I needed to do and how to do it.\n\nI have another disorder that started in childhood. I never could shake the feeling that existence wasn't \"real\". A psychologist would say this was because my mother would tell me to stop \"pretending\" when I would talk to her as a child, just normal as could be things like \"Can I watch a this movie, Mom?\"--maybe that's why I didn't start speaking until age 5. For the first time, everything \"felt\" real, and beautiful, but I was back in the hellscape now--but it was all bliss. I realized then I didn't need anything, it was the feeling, the silence, that really did count. The funny thing is, my chest, around my heart, actually was in acute pain on the 26th.\n\nThe past few weeks have been like a movie for me, the known is overrated. I never could make heads or tails of \"affirmations\" from the spirit, but now they are obvious to me, like they were to my mother, but I would just cry and call her a crazy bitch, when she would teach me about \"colors\". I'm not quite sure what ripped my ghost fiber like a parachute, but it's clear that it's gone now. I'm free, from myself. I'm reminded of something DJ said: What we badly need is sobriety, and no one can give it to us or help us get it except ourselves.\n\n*The Ghost Fiber Poem*\n\nChase a rainbow, broken by design, IOTA we spell,\n\nAbstract is nature's fold, the absurd ride the swell,\n\nReason's riddle is redemption, absent in abandon,\n\nTokens of fear and hope, buy time death to consume,\n\nTheir power is the cycle over the simplex to resume,\n\nIn the relentless revel over the abysmal abdication,\n\nLaughter, the bell jar cries, silence your remains,\n\nCome and see, behold the dissonant mirror of wrath,\n\nPeace wages chaos, ash lights up the warrior's path,\n\nRoam the land, say the angels, long truths crumble,\n\nSolace is the edifice, on the ellipse, no belong,\n\nThere is a rainbow compass, etched, ATOI we spell.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20210802124254/https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/okijwv/the\\_ghost\\_fiber\\_requiem\\_to\\_my\\_last\\_post\\_here/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802124254/https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/okijwv/the_ghost_fiber_requiem_to_my_last_post_here/)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kpp1yj9", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ghost Fiber (Requiem To My Last Post Here)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, was the OP&amp;#39;s title for this [user-deleted] post.

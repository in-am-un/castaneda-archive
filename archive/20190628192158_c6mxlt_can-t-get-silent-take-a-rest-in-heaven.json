That\u2019s the drawback of this technique.  Even so, you can enjoy it without fully passing away.\n\nEveryone uses this technique. Catholics, Buddhists, Yogis, Taoists, Mystics, and even small animals.  The next time you see your dog\u2019s legs twitching as she sleeps, she was probably using this technique. It's extremely simple: you fall asleep but retain consciousness, and look through the beginnings of the second attention, which manifest in front of your closed eyes.\n\nFirst the background, so that no one has a religious breakdown on hearing how you do it.  Some of you are NOT going to like it.  \n\nAs 107-year-old Joshu Sasaki the Zen master said, \u201cMost of my students are here because they\u2019re rebelling against their native religion.  It would be better if they were here because they wanted to learn, but what can I do?\u201d\n\nFrom The Fire From Within:\n\n\u201cI found myself walking with don Juan in a place that by then was very familiar to me: a deserted plain with yellow dunes of what seemed to be sulfur. I recalled then that don Juan had made me perceive that world hundreds of times. I also recalled that beyond the desolate landscape of the dunes there was another world shining with an exquisite, uniform, pure white light. When don Juan and I entered into it this time, I sensed that the light, which came from every direction, was not an invigorating light, but was so soothing that it gave me the feeling that it was sacred. As that sacred light bathed me a rational thought exploded in my inner silence. I thought it was quite possible that mystics and saints had made this journey of the assemblage point. They had seen God in the mold of man. They had seen hell in the sulfur dunes. And then they had seen the glory of heaven in the diaphanous light.\u201d\n\nFrom an article on Swami Muktananda, a guru also from Santa Monica, who described his visit to Hell and Heaven in one of his very entertaining books, which I can\u2019t find because he\u2019s pre-internet and died before Carlos went public:\n\n\u201cMy guru, Swami Muktananda Paramahansa, in his book Play of Consciousness, revealed that in the course of his journey to God-realization he discovered the concepts of Heaven and Hell, for example, were hardly imaginary, but represented real places on the astral plane.\u201d\n\nWhat are we to make of this?  The \u201cSorcerers of Ancient Mexico\u201d were not the only ones who left behind some intent.\n\nThat brings us to, \u201cContemplative Meditation\u201d.  Even the Catholics endorse that kind of meditation.    \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be silent. In fact, you put your internal dialogue to full use.  You just alter what it\u2019s thinking about.  But not mildly.  You relentlessly alter what it\u2019s thinking about, forcing it onto just one topic, whatever it is you are contemplating.\n\nIn that sense, it requires just as much concentration as forcing silence, and yet it\u2019s somehow 10 times easier to think a different thing, then to stop thinking at all.\n\nEven better, you don\u2019t have to sit up on the bed all night and make a spectacle of yourself.  The room doesn\u2019t have to be dark. You don\u2019t have to wear weird eyewear.  \n\nBest of all, your spouse won\u2019t even know you\u2019re cheating on them!\n\nNow the technique, but to be fair, you could do this for Taoism (and they do), Buddhism (they relish in it), or even Satanism (they\u2019re probably naked).\n\nYou lie on your side in bed (or otherwise), eyes closed, and you begin to contemplate the creation of the universe.  For a Christian, it might go like this:\n\n\u201cGod created the universe saying, let there be light.  And there WAS light. And it was good.   Then he formed the people of the earth, intending to lead them to righteousness, so that they could take their place in heaven.   But Eve partook of the serpent, and Adam joined in.  Finding themselves naked, they covered their genitals with fig leaves and ...\u201d\n\nOk, maybe you can modify yours to be a little better.  But keep the story going until the end of the bible, covering key points you can recall.\n\nOr if you\u2019re a Buddhist, you can start with the guilt of the wealthy and entitled Siddhartha, who on seeing the suffering of poor people outside his palace sat down under a tree, and refused to move until he reached enlightenment.  He finally concluded, everyone got what they deserved anyway and became the wisest man in Asia.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Taoists contemplate if they don\u2019t feel like forcing themselves silent, but I suspect it\u2019s quite interesting. \n\nAs you lie on your side, you\u2019ll begin to fall asleep.  But the continuous repetition of your \u201cstory\u201d will move your assemblage point just a tiny amount, into heightened awareness.\n\nAs don Juan said, \u201cmoving the AP is very difficult and yet it's the simplest thing in the world\u2026  mysticism, high fever, hunger, fear, love or hate could do it and also unbending intent, which is the preferred method of sorcerers.\n\nBut\u2026   \u201cThe best way to make a hit on the second attention is through ritual acts\u201d\n\nAs you engage in your repetitious ritual act of contemplative meditation, the second attention will activate.  If you\u2019ve done a good job of sticking to the script, your assemblage point will have moved far enough into heightened awareness to help you remain awake, as you activate the second attention (dreaming).\n\nThis will manifest as something different about what you\u2019re seeing with your eyes closed. Depth is the most basic difference, but you can also see any of the colors you would find in darkness, while forcing silence. As it turns out, the colors don\u2019t care about what you\u2019re thinking.  They\u2019ll be just as bright if you are praying, as if you are absolutely silent.\n\nIdeally, you\u2019ll find my favorite, the purple patch.  As you continue your contemplation, which can include praying without any extra penalty, stare through the color to see what you can see.\n\nI once found myself practicing this technique after drinking 10 shots of strong whiskey in a bar outside Vietnam, as part of negotiations for a business deal (sort of).  Because I wanted to work fast, I consumed them in a period of 20 minutes.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn\u2019t feel like forcing myself silent the next morning, and had to get up to meet with my comrades in the hotel lobby.  I went there early, and started this form of contemplative meditation.\n\nI found myself in the waiting room of heaven. It was magnificent!  Gold accented hand carved wood decorated everything, with plush, rich fabrics and pillows, and ornamented furniture to sit on.  Sitting there in the waiting room of heaven, I heard a voice.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d, my sales rep from Singapore asked me.  \u201cDon\u2019t you have a hangover?\u201d\n\nI whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sitting in the waiting room of heaven...\u201d\n\nBeing a Taoist, he took that answer literally and went off to get some coffee, so he wouldn\u2019t disturb me.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the technique. Nothing to it.  \n\nExcept, for best results visiting heaven, you have to heed the metaphysical literature regarding \u201cSutratma\u201d, the \u201cSilver Cord\u201d, which connects our higher self to our body. \n\nFor example, if you check out the Christian bible closely, or read a good commentary on it, every time someone (Stephen, Paul, Moses, Ezekiel) visited or was going to visit heaven, death was in the air.  The silver cord was weakened.  From Acts 7:55, after Stephen had been beaten to near death:\n\n\u201cBut Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cI see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\u201d  At this they covered their ears, cried out in a loud voice, and rushed together at him.\u2026\u201d\n\nAccording to Muktananda, you don\u2019t need to heed the silver cord to visit hell.  And I suspect that\u2019s just as much fun.\n\nEdited: once but had to use old.reddit.com", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Can't Get Silent?

But he seemed to benefit from it, while reading off the wall.\n\nIn general, if your assemblage point shifts to heightened awareness, you don't worry nearly as much about aging and body effects.  Each new event is sort of an opportunity.  Lose one thing, and there's another cool thing you wouldn't have noticed otherwise.  \n\nSame for your job.  I can\u2019t imagine a real sorcerer deciding to hook himself to Carlos\u2019 lineage and use Carlos' own lingo, to make money by writing books based on lies.\n\nA real sorcerer is happy flipping burgers, just as much as he\u2019d be happy designing a space shuttle.  It\u2019s a position of the assemblage point, and only one\u2019s integrity controls decisions. \n\nBoy, that sounds like warrior talk.  Sorry about that.  \n\nIn Stormtrooper terms, any battle is as good as another, and only your reputation is important while in battle. You don't switch to an easier battle, or the one that'll make you more famous.  That would ruin your battle reputation and it could never be redeemed.\n\nYour technique for going back and forth while forcing silence in a restful condition, with eyes closed, works very well.  And more than anything else, everyone can do it. It doesn\u2019t use up any of your time, since you have to lie that way to go to sleep.\n\nOur big problem:  #1 Issue for all of you!!!!!   (Except a few lurkers).\n\nYou have to actually work.  Imagining and posturing isn\u2019t going to get it.  Impeccable warriors lead shitty lives, if they can\u2019t move their assemblage points.  What's the point of using death as an adviser, if you never do any work?  You'll just worry yourself to death.\n\n(That wasn\u2019t about the person I replied to; it was about multiple other people).\n\n I used the technique you described around 20 years ago.  And I didn't have anyone telling me, that technique can lead all the way.  As a result, I didn't emphasize doing it the way I should have.  I didn\u2019t realize it was practice for merging the first and second attention, and learning to shift the assemblage point on your own.\n\nBut I have to say, that technique is like doing the gates of dreaming. I spent a good 10 years on that. Hours and hours a day.  \n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't get you to the right place. It's more like a side trip, something you can do for free because you dream anyway.  Like visiting Calico Ghost Town on the way to Las Vegas. The ghosts aren\u2019t really going to get you to Vegas faster.  And you can indeed waste a lot of time there, in the gift shop.\n\nNo one who emphasized that Gates of Dreaming technique (to my knowledge), ever got anywhere permanent.  Permanent means, you keep practicing and there's no way you'd stop learning.  And you aren't all fluff and eagle feathers.\n\nI'm afraid to say that technique, namely going back and forth between sleep and waking, is similar in results to the Gates of dreaming.\n\nIt's just not as effective as Zuleica's technique.\n\nI have a correspondent who has been doing that first attention / second attention semi-sleep technique for 6 months now, and it seems like he's put a lot of time into it. I was encouraged to hear that he has multiple mini-dreams each time he does it, and has enough control to select which direction he goes (awake or back into a vision). He\u2019s completely saturated with moving back and forth, and now understands what the second attention is.\n\nBut today he announced he was \"bored\" with that technique.\n\nSo I say, maybe that one is good for practice, but ultimately isn't enough.\n\nContrast that with my experience last night, using Zuleica's technique.  I woke up at 2AM, feeling crummy. Stormtroopers don't take good care of themselves, in their down time.  They aren't happy all the time, like warriors.\n\nBut I typically get up at that time to practice, and my body has learned to wake on its own. In fact, if I'd decided to go back to sleep, I'd likely have awoke just an hour later anyway.\n\nI could barely manage to get myself to sit up on the bed.  And I'd forgotten to put a double shot espresso can next to the bed.\n\nI felt sad, lonely, and hopeless.  A lot like I know my other family members do all the time.  We inherited that position of the assemblage point.\n\nThey\u2019ve gotten used to it, but I\u2019ve had a taste of not feeling that way.  So I know how near relief is.  And how awful being at the normal position of the assemblage point can be.\n\nI forced myself silent, knowing it was only a matter of time until my assemblage point shifted to the place of no pity, and I\u2019d feel like I was in heaven.  But yes, I was bored also.  I thought about turning on the TV instead.\n\nIt took 1 hour before I realized, I wasn\u2019t seeing enough lights to shift my assemblage point. I saw some colors, puffs all around, but they weren\u2019t vivid enough to move my assemblage point fast.  And its important to remember, it's not your wonderfulness that can move the assemblage point.   There's no effort you can make at first, and no mistake you can make, other than giving up.  You simply need to be silent, and watch things that come from the second attention. Just watch them and don't fret.\n\nI got up and switched to the first technique don Juan taught Carlos. Walking around looking at the ground, for differences.\n\nI saw a lot more details, and I felt a little rush of happiness.  My breathing deepened a bit.\n\nBut yes, I was still bored. Just like the person who wrote to me.  And yet I knew, relief from boredom was in the same place:  A shift of my assemblage point into heightened awareness.\n\nI forced myself to do some tensegrity, and started to see my feet. That\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s absolutely dark in my room now.  \n\nI saw my torso, but it was made out of lights.  Fibers and puffs.  I tried swinging it back and forth to sweep the floor (also from Zuleica), and the lights in the room got very bright.\n\nI saw my floating head ghost (she\u2019s more of a ghost now) going by, making weird face changes. Those used to frighten me, now it\u2019s just what she does.\n\nThe wall started to have details, and I found myself back at the little Fairies home world, a sandstone and pebble cliff, with holes in the side. They live there, very close together.  At least, that\u2019s what it looks like from my point of view.\n\nMy boredom and sadness were officially gone, so I gave myself a big thumbs up.  I\u2019ll remind everyone, that\u2019s not silly. It\u2019s important to mark things, or you won\u2019t remember.\n\nBut my main trick for remembering is writing it down for you guys, otherwise everything I\u2019d done so far would seem like it never happened.  I suspect that\u2019s true of sorcery lineages in general:  The leaders never learn so much in their entire lives, as they do when trying to teach others.\n\nI\u2019d gotten to the place in practice where it feels like you can hold that assemblage point position all day long, and never suffer again.  Well, physical injury aside.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of it.  I went back to the bed hoping to entice one of Carlos allies to make an entry, the way it did the last time I assembled that Fairy world.\n\nI saw something forming on the wall, but it was 4 blue squares.  They were flat, and attached to each other in a line, with a yellow seam.  They were about 12 inches high and the set of 4 was 4 feet long.\n\nI was no longer in my room.  I seemed to be seated at a desk of some sort.  But it could also have been a brief case, with the blue squares attached to the locking system.  Both made sense at the time.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2018d fallen into abstract dreaming.   It seems to be a barrier we\u2019ll all run into along the way.  But it's not a crazy total loss. I've recalled abstract dreams I had while in Carlos' classes.  They keep coming back.  I have to think there's some reality to them.\n\nStaring at the abstract blue squares, I realized they were the answer to further shutting off the internal dialogue. It made perfect sense (at the time).\n\nFirst you shift your assemblage point into heightened awareness, then from that position of bliss and silence, you tap on the blue squares.   In sequence.  You don\u2019t exactly poke them, but you cause them to push a bit, and do that over and over.\n\nMy mind knew that made no sense, so I tried to inject some reason.

But he seemed to benefit from it, while reading off the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, if your assemblage point shifts to heightened awareness, you don&amp;#39;t worry nearly as much about aging and body effects.  Each new event is sort of an opportunity.  Lose one thing, and there&amp;#39;s another cool thing you wouldn&amp;#39;t have noticed otherwise.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for your job.  I can\u2019t imagine a real sorcerer deciding to hook himself to Carlos\u2019 lineage and use Carlos&amp;#39; own lingo, to make money by writing books based on lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A real sorcerer is happy flipping burgers, just as much as he\u2019d be happy designing a space shuttle.  It\u2019s a position of the assemblage point, and only one\u2019s integrity controls decisions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boy, that sounds like warrior talk.  Sorry about that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Stormtrooper terms, any battle is as good as another, and only your reputation is important while in battle. You don&amp;#39;t switch to an easier battle, or the one that&amp;#39;ll make you more famous.  That would ruin your battle reputation and it could never be redeemed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your technique for going back and forth while forcing silence in a restful condition, with eyes closed, works very well.  And more than anything else, everyone can do it. It doesn\u2019t use up any of your time, since you have to lie that way to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our big problem:  #1 Issue for all of you!!!!!   (Except a few lurkers).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to actually work.  Imagining and posturing isn\u2019t going to get it.  Impeccable warriors lead shitty lives, if they can\u2019t move their assemblage points.  What&amp;#39;s the point of using death as an adviser, if you never do any work?  You&amp;#39;ll just worry yourself to death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(That wasn\u2019t about the person I replied to; it was about multiple other people).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used the technique you described around 20 years ago.  And I didn&amp;#39;t have anyone telling me, that technique can lead all the way.  As a result, I didn&amp;#39;t emphasize doing it the way I should have.  I didn\u2019t realize it was practice for merging the first and second attention, and learning to shift the assemblage point on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I have to say, that technique is like doing the gates of dreaming. I spent a good 10 years on that. Hours and hours a day.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#39;t get you to the right place. It&amp;#39;s more like a side trip, something you can do for free because you dream anyway.  Like visiting Calico Ghost Town on the way to Las Vegas. The ghosts aren\u2019t really going to get you to Vegas faster.  And you can indeed waste a lot of time there, in the gift shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one who emphasized that Gates of Dreaming technique (to my knowledge), ever got anywhere permanent.  Permanent means, you keep practicing and there&amp;#39;s no way you&amp;#39;d stop learning.  And you aren&amp;#39;t all fluff and eagle feathers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid to say that technique, namely going back and forth between sleep and waking, is similar in results to the Gates of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just not as effective as Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a correspondent who has been doing that first attention / second attention semi-sleep technique for 6 months now, and it seems like he&amp;#39;s put a lot of time into it. I was encouraged to hear that he has multiple mini-dreams each time he does it, and has enough control to select which direction he goes (awake or back into a vision). He\u2019s completely saturated with moving back and forth, and now understands what the second attention is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But today he announced he was &amp;quot;bored&amp;quot; with that technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I say, maybe that one is good for practice, but ultimately isn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with my experience last night, using Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique.  I woke up at 2AM, feeling crummy. Stormtroopers don&amp;#39;t take good care of themselves, in their down time.  They aren&amp;#39;t happy all the time, like warriors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I typically get up at that time to practice, and my body has learned to wake on its own. In fact, if I&amp;#39;d decided to go back to sleep, I&amp;#39;d likely have awoke just an hour later anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could barely manage to get myself to sit up on the bed.  And I&amp;#39;d forgotten to put a double shot espresso can next to the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt sad, lonely, and hopeless.  A lot like I know my other family members do all the time.  We inherited that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019ve gotten used to it, but I\u2019ve had a taste of not feeling that way.  So I know how near relief is.  And how awful being at the normal position of the assemblage point can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced myself silent, knowing it was only a matter of time until my assemblage point shifted to the place of no pity, and I\u2019d feel like I was in heaven.  But yes, I was bored also.  I thought about turning on the TV instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took 1 hour before I realized, I wasn\u2019t seeing enough lights to shift my assemblage point. I saw some colors, puffs all around, but they weren\u2019t vivid enough to move my assemblage point fast.  And its important to remember, it&amp;#39;s not your wonderfulness that can move the assemblage point.   There&amp;#39;s no effort you can make at first, and no mistake you can make, other than giving up.  You simply need to be silent, and watch things that come from the second attention. Just watch them and don&amp;#39;t fret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up and switched to the first technique don Juan taught Carlos. Walking around looking at the ground, for differences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot more details, and I felt a little rush of happiness.  My breathing deepened a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yes, I was still bored. Just like the person who wrote to me.  And yet I knew, relief from boredom was in the same place:  A shift of my assemblage point into heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced myself to do some tensegrity, and started to see my feet. That\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s absolutely dark in my room now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw my torso, but it was made out of lights.  Fibers and puffs.  I tried swinging it back and forth to sweep the floor (also from Zuleica), and the lights in the room got very bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw my floating head ghost (she\u2019s more of a ghost now) going by, making weird face changes. Those used to frighten me, now it\u2019s just what she does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wall started to have details, and I found myself back at the little Fairies home world, a sandstone and pebble cliff, with holes in the side. They live there, very close together.  At least, that\u2019s what it looks like from my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boredom and sadness were officially gone, so I gave myself a big thumbs up.  I\u2019ll remind everyone, that\u2019s not silly. It\u2019s important to mark things, or you won\u2019t remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my main trick for remembering is writing it down for you guys, otherwise everything I\u2019d done so far would seem like it never happened.  I suspect that\u2019s true of sorcery lineages in general:  The leaders never learn so much in their entire lives, as they do when trying to teach others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d gotten to the place in practice where it feels like you can hold that assemblage point position all day long, and never suffer again.  Well, physical injury aside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that wasn\u2019t the end of it.  I went back to the bed hoping to entice one of Carlos allies to make an entry, the way it did the last time I assembled that Fairy world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw something forming on the wall, but it was 4 blue squares.  They were flat, and attached to each other in a line, with a yellow seam.  They were about 12 inches high and the set of 4 was 4 feet long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was no longer in my room.  I seemed to be seated at a desk of some sort.  But it could also have been a brief case, with the blue squares attached to the locking system.  Both made sense at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I\u2018d fallen into abstract dreaming.   It seems to be a barrier we\u2019ll all run into along the way.  But it&amp;#39;s not a crazy total loss. I&amp;#39;ve recalled abstract dreams I had while in Carlos&amp;#39; classes.  They keep coming back.  I have to think there&amp;#39;s some reality to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Staring at the abstract blue squares, I realized they were the answer to further shutting off the internal dialogue. It made perfect sense (at the time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First you shift your assemblage point into heightened awareness, then from that position of bliss and silence, you tap on the blue squares.   In sequence.  You don\u2019t exactly poke them, but you cause them to push a bit, and do that over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mind knew that made no sense, so I tried to inject some reason.  I got the impression that the squares could also be yellow or light brown, and that would work just as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was satisfied. It made sense as long as the squares didn&amp;#39;t always have to be those ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave it a try, and my internal dialogue reached a state of profound silence. I could see or do anything I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that I didn\u2019t want anything.  I was good with whatever was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That had taken at least 4 hours, and I could still see the blue squares whenever I wanted.

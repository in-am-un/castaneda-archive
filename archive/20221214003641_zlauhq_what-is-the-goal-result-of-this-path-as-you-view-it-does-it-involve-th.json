It\u2019s about dreaming, learning to control your dreaming body, and ultimately being able to make use of it in this realm.  A being of ultimate power.\n\nMakes sense. The part I'm not familiar with is the 'being able to make use of it in this realm' part. How does one cultivate that? I've got a basic sense, conceptually, of the puff gathering and moving practices to build dream body and such in dark room practices. How, as this develops, does it reconnect with non-dark room practices? Or if you'd rather is there a link to places that discuss this more in depth?\n\n&gt;Along they way you make friends with beings from other energetic planes, or get scared to death by them perhaps first, experience expanded consciousness states and other transcendent types of experiences, explore dreaming in a pragmatic way, all through cleaning your link to Intent, or removing all the layers of shit that prevent you from commanding it to the greatest extent possible for the continuation of your journey through the universe.  That\u2019s the goal anyway, or die trying.\n\nSo the puff practices are about 'cleaning your link to Intent'? Is this somehow related then to bringing the practices back into regular life in the form of psychic powers and such, even if not exactly in the form normally understood?

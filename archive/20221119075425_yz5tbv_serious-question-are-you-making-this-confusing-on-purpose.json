Once it becomes flexable, u simply look for what is unusual and interact with that to get ur AP to shift downward. This is literally all u need to know to start making progress\n\nMaybe u should join the reddit chat? That will probably be a better way to clear up any questions u have\n\nDo this in a darkroom, that is the easiest way to get the ap to shift.\n\nTake note that it will take u atleast 5 minutes of forcing silence to actually start getting results, and even then they will probably just be vague colors. You need to focus on whatever u can.\n\nI also recommend u look into some simple tensegrity passes, as they help to shift the ap and prevent u from falling asleep\n\nThe content detailed in the wiki explains this very clearly, if u take some time to read theough the posts u should find that u will have a far better understanding of how to begin atleast. It will all make much more sense as u progress ofc, so just take what i said above as most important atm\n\nEdit: in order to make serious progress u also need to tap into the ancient seers intent, which means dropping the current paths u are on to persue this one.

Once it becomes flexable, u simply look for what is unusual and interact with that to get ur AP to shift downward. This is literally all u need to know to start making progress&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe u should join the reddit chat? That will probably be a better way to clear up any questions u have&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do this in a darkroom, that is the easiest way to get the ap to shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take note that it will take u atleast 5 minutes of forcing silence to actually start getting results, and even then they will probably just be vague colors. You need to focus on whatever u can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also recommend u look into some simple tensegrity passes, as they help to shift the ap and prevent u from falling asleep&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The content detailed in the wiki explains this very clearly, if u take some time to read theough the posts u should find that u will have a far better understanding of how to begin atleast. It will all make much more sense as u progress ofc, so just take what i said above as most important atm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: in order to make serious progress u also need to tap into the ancient seers intent, which means dropping the current paths u are on to persue this one.

Despite this pattern I am magnetically attracted to these books in a way that few others have attracted me (some examples being the Journeys out of the Body Series by Robert Monroe, Fingerprints of the Gods, few others), and before these, none have seemed to slowly weave one of the main characters energy and teachings into my own life through a number of undeniable and profound ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I should probably determine that I have a choice here right?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_yz5tbv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yz5tbv/serious_question_are_you_making_this_confusing_on/ix64ugk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668992730.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1668992730.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iwz8rqx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "NightComprehensive52", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668868954.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iwz2f8x", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_7zxv6xqs", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Read the rest of the books!

All these bad player monikers are just shitty human labels created by other shit humans to make their new-found environment more tolerable. What truly baffles me, however, is why they genuinely believe that once you\u2019ve moved your assemblage point far enough, you somehow automatically adopt their exact views, as if all sorcerers end up as some type of monolith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess someone else can answer that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, drop the healing; you\u2019ll never succeed in healing anyone within your lifetime, even if you fully commit to this sorcery path. Trust me, I\u2019m a Gypsy, and we\u2019re famously good at telling fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I\u2019m partly joking.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yz5tbv/serious_question_are_you_making_this_confusing_on/ix0yuyt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668896077.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_yz5tbv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": -1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iwzvx07", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "imagineDoll", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668879344.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_yz5tbv", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_kcna67r3", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "all i can do is laugh \ud83d\ude02 at these replies you got. btw id love to learn from you about alchemy and sorcery. care to share any resources? thanks", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iwzvx07", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;all i can do is laugh \ud83d\ude02 at these replies you got. btw id love to learn from you about alchemy and sorcery. care to share any resources? thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yz5tbv/serious_question_are_you_making_this_confusing_on/iwzvx07/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668879344.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_yz5tbv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 0}}], "before": null}}]

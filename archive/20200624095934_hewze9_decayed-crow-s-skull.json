That moves the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you do indeed find witches using dead things as tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dare to say, the old sorcerers probably had some gruesome artifacts around, since rituals were their preferred way to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll repeat this so it&amp;#39;s in more than one place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The earliest of Carlos&amp;#39; books include a lot of rituals to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason was, no one in their right mind wants to learn sorcery for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not even among Castaneda fans, despite what they say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don Juan sort of tricked him with procedures he could list, making it seem like he was just doing anthropology research.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s another side to those books.  They&amp;#39;re a map for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get lost, and you might remember a road sign from the books, suggesting which way to go in that case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I believe, the rituals with power plants were also a taste of how the old sorcerers lived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we could get the genuine feel of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would make them re-run retrieved, rather than something borrowed from one of the local tribes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little evidence for this can be found among the local Indians of southern California and Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That ritual with the Devil&amp;#39;s weed requires you to grow plants for generations, so that you have very long roots, and know the strength of what you&amp;#39;re about to use.  Dosages can vary wildly among various Devil&amp;#39;s weed plants, which could be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how could such a step in that ritual evolve, when the Indians were being moved around against their will, to be herded into reservations?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morongo for instance, where Carlos started, was certainly not the original home of the Indian tribes living there now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those shamans barely remembered the older rituals.

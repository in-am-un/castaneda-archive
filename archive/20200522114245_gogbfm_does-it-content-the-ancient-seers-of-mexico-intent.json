It's wasting energy all day long.\n\nSo it's a course for people who still have the internal dialogue driving them nuts.\n\nWhich unfortunately, is pretty much the entire Castaneda audience.\n\nIf you have none, or have pretty much overcome it, the whole idea behind the course is puzzling.\n\nHopefully it's about stalking.\n\nNote: If you learn to get silent, those things do indeed go away.\n\nBut not all the time!

I actually had \"smear\" marks on my legs!\n\nI'm going to have to depict that in a drawing, so you guys know what your missing.\n\nI ask you?

It&amp;#39;s wasting energy all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s a course for people who still have the internal dialogue driving them nuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which unfortunately, is pretty much the entire Castaneda audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have none, or have pretty much overcome it, the whole idea behind the course is puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it&amp;#39;s about stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: If you learn to get silent, those things do indeed go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not all the time!  Of course you still have to catch yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you notice you&amp;#39;re back to insane, you don&amp;#39;t have to pull out your &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; and put them in effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just drop it.  In a second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not always a struggle forever, to get rid of the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It becomes easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the rewards are amazing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Far more than you&amp;#39;ll get out of that course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I put in 30 minutes of cellphone sunlight glitter gazing.  I was turbocharged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By 5AM I had streaks of intense purple and pink stretching around the room, with Fairy hiding and popping out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, playing  hide and seek with inorganic beings is a very fast way to learn to redeploy energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to do that a lot, before I discovered assembling other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point I realized, I still haven&amp;#39;t managed to zip my tonal up inside my nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think, if you do cool stuff at first, but haven&amp;#39;t finished Zuleica&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;fold in half&amp;quot; technique, you have to do everything in your dreaming body.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the physical body has to remain where it was when you started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, if I follow Cholita&amp;#39;s dreaming double through the bedroom wall, I know for sure, my body has to still be back in the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if I can&amp;#39;t figure out what it&amp;#39;s up to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So eventually, I&amp;#39;ll find myself in bed, asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you finish Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique, your physical body can &amp;quot;go along for the ride&amp;quot;, and wake up wherever you end up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, Zuleica is the key to teleportation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realizing I&amp;#39;d gotten lazy about scooping, the basis of her technique,  I scraped up as much of the purple stuff as I could, and applied it to my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1 minute, my body was glowing purple like a furnace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I could even see the individual &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; of purple light I&amp;#39;d scraped off the colors around me, and placed on my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smeared them all over, as if they were globs of bright purple paint, and they behaved exactly like that. I actually had &amp;quot;smear&amp;quot; marks on my legs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to have to depict that in a drawing, so you guys know what your missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask you?  Personal power course so you don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;blame, complain, or excuse&amp;quot; , or would you rather have real magic daily?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, anyone who can should take that course.

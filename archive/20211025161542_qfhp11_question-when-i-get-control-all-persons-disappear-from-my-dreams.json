This is still something I periodically have to work on as well but my ally has been helping me with this recently, so hopefully you might also be able to derive some benefit from it.\n\nFirst, I've found that the most useful beings that you encounter in a dream (at least at this stage) are more human-like and can communicate easily. The animal-like ones I find are generally not very intelligent. They aren't /bad/ to interact with as all interaction teaches you something, but I've found usually you might exchange a bit of energy and then lose the dream, like in your otter dream.\n\nI try to be slower when I'm approaching entities. Intelligent IOBs can appear as animals so its important to look at them from a distance first. In this way you can get a vibe for their energy. If it feels a bit gross, creepy, or just not what I'm really looking for, then I move on and look for someone else. If you do this from a distance, they are unlikely to notice you. If you run right up at them and stare at them or try to talk to them, they will almost definitely notice you, and then if you only realise after the fact that all they want is to stick themselves to you like some kind of weird snail or barnacle, then your dream will probably end with you trying to get them off you.\n\nLike I said, it's not dangerous but it does mean you can't get as much out of that dream experience. Looking at them from a distance gives you more opportunities within the one dream to meet someone helpful.\n\nMy best advice would be to try to change your beliefs and attitudes towards IOBs while you are awake. Think of them as people, humans, helpful and easy to talk to. Think of them as people rather than bizarre and alien. By changing your attitude towards them to one of friendly curiosity and desire to meet as equals, they may be more compelled to make themselves known to you.\n\nDon Juan tells Carlos to generate a sense of welcoming to attract the IOBs. A sense of \"I would love to see you! And if you don't come I would miss you. Please come and visit me some time and I will welcome you.\" They respond a lot to moods and feelings and if the helpful ones detect feelings that they like, they are more likely to approach you. Then, you don't need to shout at them to take you to their world, you can literally just ask like you would ask a friend. My best 2nd gate experiences came from this friendly approach of just asking them. \n\nIf you can build up this friendly attitude to the beings in your dreams there's a good chance you'll find them more populated again. I would be very interested to hear what the effects are for you.

Don Juan tells Carlos that something similar happens, that the dreams of ordinary people are packed full of scouts but the dreams of sorcerer's are quite barren in comparison. \n\nIt frustrated me to no end. But it's really a blessing in disguise. You have nothing to distract you from learning practical dreaming skills that will come in helpful when you reach the second gate. It also means that if scouts -want- you to see them, they'll stand out like a sore thumb because there's no background noise to get them confused with. That could be your little bright jumping creatures but not necessarily, there's not enough information to go on there. You need to learn how to tell if something is a phantom or not yourself.\n\nYou should use the time in these empty dreams to try to improve your dreaming ability. Learning how to zip around and change dreams like Dan suggested is a good idea. You can also learn how to change dreams by going into the space between dreams and starting a new one from there. Try dropping down through the floor of the dream and outside of it. Then when you are outside of the dream, reach down and touch the ground as though you expect it to be there. This will start a new dream.\n\nLearning how to move around is important, but learning how to stay still is even more so. It's easy to think that we are making all our decisions yet we are compelled to search and explore and have trouble staying in the one place doing very little. Being able to stay still helps you from transitioning between dreams too quickly if your lucidity or cohesion is not very strong. \n\nLucidity and cohesion are not the same thing. Cohesion is basically our ability to stay on a single position of the assemblage point in dreaming. If you can keep the dream in view you have cohesion with that dream. When you follow an IOB, the transition itself can wake you up, so it's important to be able to move back to that position at will and remained fixed on it. \n\nClosely related to cohesion is stability. You'll find what works best for you, but stabilisation techniques need to become habit. They allow you to extend the dream duration and prevent yourself from slipping back into non-lucidity. Look back at your hands at regular intervals, really look at them, then look at your surroundings. Rub your hands together and rub them over your body if you feel like your stability is breaking down. \n\nI do Zuleica's daytime looking-for-power technique in lucid dreams too and it seems to really help my dreaming attention. I do it awake and asleep and it helps in both instances. Find an object, it can be a wall or the ground if there are no objects around, and look at it. Really look at its detail, but don't take longer than ten seconds or so looking at each one. You don't want to have feelings about the object, but you want to really get your senses involved in perceiving it. Soak it up. Look at things up close, then look at things at the horizon. Can you feel temperature? Can you smell? Taste? Do the branches of trees move in different directions in the wind? Do you have peripheral vision? \n\nNot every empty dream is really empty. Sometimes there is an IOB hanging around behind it, watching what you are doing. Useful IOBs are more likely to be compelled to interact with you if you can maintain your own stability to some degree. If you act like a drunk dreamer you'll get IOBs that just want to pander to your drunkeness instead. \n\nSometimes they even use these empty dreams to -get- us lucid. One of my IOBs changes my dreams to be just realistic empty rooms if they want to talk. The lack of things to do, and that moment of 'wait what was I doing here?' can be enough to make us lucid. I then go through a process of short stabilising dreams before we have our full interaction. \n\nSo if you are in an empty dream and have already done a series of practices (moving around, staying still, stabilising, looking at objects) try just asking out loud at the dream if there is a being present and if it will make itself visible to you. If they hear you, they will probably appear. Make sure you don't just assume the first thing you see is definitely an IOB though, it's easy to create phantoms when we expect them.

I wondered if there was a way to make the colors appear quicker. I thought maybe you could train the behavior through quick repetition. So I set an alarm for 10 minutes, closed my eyes, laid back on my couch, and attempted to see colors before the alarm went off. I repeated this over and over again, and on the 3rd or 4th try a really strange thing happened.\n  \n\n  \nA leaf, out of nowhere, popped into view, floated around for a minute, and landed near my feet. But this wasn't a vague, silhouette of a leaf. It was very realistic looking. It had a brownish-red color, with visible veins, and looked like your typical fall leaf... but floating amongst the black background of my closed eyes. When it landed a surge of electricity went up my legs and then everything abruptly disappeared.\n  \n\n  \nThat got me pretty excited, and I thought I was on the verge of something more remarkable... but I continued and nothing else happened. I didn't even see any colors.\n  \n\n  \nFast forward to tonight, and I thought I would try the exercise again. I thought, maybe looking for colors was limiting myself and I should try to induce silence instead. This would open me up to more possibilities.\n  \n\n  \nSo, I did the repeating alarm again, but this time I just tried to quiet my mind as quickly as possible, before the alarm would go off. Hoping it would induce some kind of vision. It again, took 3 or 4 times before anything started happening, but after that, each attempt starting produce unique results and it would happen sooner or be more intense each time.\n  \n\n  \nHere are the things that I saw tonight.

I would quickly write down what happened after each attempt, before setting the alarm again for another 10 minutes.\n  \n\n  \n\u2022  A burning green light / flame\n\n\n  \n\u2022  I saw someone, who looked like me, wearing a blue, slightly shiny, space uniform, with neatly combed hair. It was a profile view, and the person was just looking around and didn't notice me.\n\n\n  \n\u2022  A white, humanoid creature, with black eyes, that peered around a corner and looked at me. It had a rounded face, sort of like a baby, and it almost seemed cute. But it sent shivers of fear down my body when it looked at me.\n\n\n  \n\u2022  Waves of nearly orgasmic energy started flowing through my body\n\n\n  \n\u2022  A few of the attempts had times where a blinding white/yellow light would appear briefly\n\n\n  \nThe odd thing is I have done the closed eyes, darkroom practice before and the things I saw, aside from the colors and smoke, were mostly silhouetted or b&amp;w faces. These experiences were in full color and very real looking.\n  \n\n  \nAnyway, I don't know if this a good exercise to do every night.

But you don't feel slow; and no, you don't have the curse of being blind for 2 minutes, like I used to.\n\nYou have to be honest: If you had learned to have astral projections at will, and make them last as long as you want, maybe you would make it a \"complete path\".

It comes out when our internal dialogue is stopped, such as when we are sleeping. In the books it's called, \"The second ring of power\", the first being what you are using right now.\n\nBecause it only comes out when we sleep, as dreams, we've been taught to believe it's  just our mind playing tricks at night, maybe to relieve stress.\n\nBut it's just not so. It comes out anytime the internal dialogue stops.\n\nThe internal dialogue goes like this:  \"How on earth can he dare to say that to me???  ME????  Next time I see him, I'm going to say...\"\n\nDoesn't matter if that situation took place 5 minutes ago, or 30 years ago.\n\nThat voice in our head keeps telling us, \"This reality is the real one, and I'm going to fix it to be more like I deserve!\"\n\nSo we're stuck here, perceiving only this reality.\n\nIt only takes our \"assemblage point\" 2 minutes to start to drift, if we get rid of the internal dialogue.  The assemblage point, the glow of awareness in our body which \"assembles\" our reality from all possibilities, is only known to sorcerers.\n\nOdd...  Hindus never even discovered it!  And yet, they surely explored infinity deeply.\n\nKnowing about that assemblage point, gives you a \"reality dial\".  You can turn the dial. That's what we do in the darkroom.  We \"change the channel\".\n\nThen we start to slide into perceiving other possibilities.\n\nBut oddly, the internal dialogue NEVER stops the necessary 2 minutes, so that our assemblage point can move.\n\nCan you believe that?  All day long, with that horrible voice nagging you endlessly.\n\nWe weren't born with it. It was added on to us, to control us.\n\nSo even a TINY piece of the second attention is valuable.  As a focus, to help us see that we have other worlds available to us, and don't need to obsess over this one.\n\nAnd it helps sooth the internal dialogue, to be viewing magic right in your face.  So it's easier to shut it off even longer.  At the 2 hour mark, you reach \"enlightenment\".\n\nIf you get in the dark and you only see vague colors as a mist, be grateful.\n\nThat's what we need to sustain.  No matter how lame they are.\n\nWith silence they get more structure, until you can gather them into a \"chi ball\", and toss them.\n\nDaniel Ingrams the Dzogchen master does that, so we're not alone.\n\nAnd Shinzen Young sees giant insects, as he walks through his old college.\n\nThose are tree spirits, but his Zen tradition ignores magic so they don't know about it.\n\nThe Buddhists like Ingrams are religious. So they're afraid of spirits.    That puts a limit on their exploration.\n\nIt's only sorcerers in our tradition who embrace it all.  It was created 10,000 years ago, so they weren't worried about \"What would Jesus do?\"\n\nAnd they couldn't read, so they weren't filled with endless astral travel and European witchcraft prejudices.\n\nThey were simply exploring reality, the way babies do, without too much judgement.\n\nWe don't make rules about what's ok to perceive.  We only explore it, hopefully without any opinions regarding it.\n\nThe reason we can do that is, we get so good at changing over to our dreaming attention, that we can literally change who we are. Change worlds.\n\nIt turns out, we have 600 choices for where to live, and can switch to another if it suits us.\n\nPermanently.\n\nBecause of that, we aren't religious at all.  Religion belongs to the local social order. To the world in which you are currently playing.\n\nSwitch worlds, and it's another religion over there. Maybe they worship the cosmic bran muffin.  It's rather difficult for us, from here, to get too worked up about a cosmic muffin.\n\nLearning that, we stop obsessing over the religion in this copy of the world.\n\nSo we don't worry about the usual concerns,  such as \"demons are evil!\", allowing us to perceive everything possible to humans.\n\nI'm not too sure about the toilet in your picture though...\n\nAccording to Cholita, toilets are evil.  They make strange noises at night, indicating they're possessed with an evil entity.\n\nThere was a period of weeks where she kept disabling the toilet no matter what I did.\n\nWe both had to use buckets.\n\nSo watch out for toilets.\n\nThe demon girl on the other hand, is fine.\n\nUsed to be my girlfriend.

Did you recall Carlos mentioning the movement of the AP outside the cocoon?\n\nI came across some words from the Art of Dreaming on that:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But new worlds exist! They are wrapped one around the other, like the skins of an onion.\r\nThe world we exist in is but one of those skins.\"\r\n\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the goal of your teaching is to prepare me to go into those\r\nworlds?\"\r\n\"No. I don't mean that. We go into those worlds only as an exercise. Those journeys are the\r\nantecedents of the sorcerers of today. We do the same dreaming that the old sorcerers used to do,\r\nbut at one moment we deviate into new ground. The old sorcerers preferred the shifts of the\r\nassemblage point, so they were always on more or less known, predictable ground. We prefer the\r\nmovements of the assemblage point. The old sorcerers were after the human unknown. We are\r\nafter the nonhuman unknown.\"\r\n\"I haven't gotten to that yet, have I?\"\r\n\"No. You are only beginning. And at the beginning everyone has to go through the old\r\nsorcerers' steps. After all, they were the ones who invented dreaming.\"\r\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt;\"\"What can the nonhuman unknown be?\"\r\n\"Freedom from being human. Inconceivable worlds that are outside the band of man but that\r\nwe still can perceive. This is where modern sorcerers take the side road. Their predilection is\r\nwhat's outside the human domain. And what are outside that domain are all-inclusive worlds, not\rmerely the realm of birds or the realm of animals or the realm of man, even if it be the unknown\r\nman. What I am talking about are worlds, like the one where we live; total worlds with endless\r\nrealms.\"\r\n\"Where are those worlds, don Juan? In different positions of the assemblage point?\"\r\n\"Right. In different positions of the assemblage point, but positions sorcerers arrive at with a\r\nmovement of the assemblage point, not a shift. Entering into those worlds is the type of dreaming\r\nonly sorcerers of today do. The old sorcerers stayed away from it, because it requires a great deal\r\nof detachment and no self-importance whatsoever. A price they couldn't afford to pay.\"\n\nAs far as there was no one to *see*, I can only hypothesize that after completing the whole J curve, the next way for the AP is even \"deeper\", and causing a movement outside the cocoon, to grab the new band?\n\nMost interestingly, don Juan also mentioned that IOBs taught sorcerers to do this. So it is possible, that your visits to Fairy's world emphasize such a journey after all.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\"The sorcerers of antiquity used them, and they are the ones who coined the name allies. \r\nTheir allies taught them to move the assemblage point out of the egg's boundaries into \r\nthe non human universe.

Did you recall Carlos mentioning the movement of the AP outside the cocoon?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came across some words from the Art of Dreaming on that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But new worlds exist! They are wrapped one around the other, like the skins of an onion.\nThe world we exist in is but one of those skins.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Do you mean, don Juan, that the goal of your teaching is to prepare me to go into those\nworlds?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;No. I don&amp;#39;t mean that. We go into those worlds only as an exercise. Those journeys are the\nantecedents of the sorcerers of today. We do the same dreaming that the old sorcerers used to do,\nbut at one moment we deviate into new ground. The old sorcerers preferred the shifts of the\nassemblage point, so they were always on more or less known, predictable ground. We prefer the\nmovements of the assemblage point. The old sorcerers were after the human unknown. We are\nafter the nonhuman unknown.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t gotten to that yet, have I?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;No. You are only beginning. And at the beginning everyone has to go through the old\nsorcerers&amp;#39; steps. After all, they were the ones who invented dreaming.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;What can the nonhuman unknown be?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Freedom from being human. Inconceivable worlds that are outside the band of man but that\nwe still can perceive. This is where modern sorcerers take the side road. Their predilection is\nwhat&amp;#39;s outside the human domain. And what are outside that domain are all-inclusive worlds, not\nmerely the realm of birds or the realm of animals or the realm of man, even if it be the unknown\nman. What I am talking about are worlds, like the one where we live; total worlds with endless\nrealms.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Where are those worlds, don Juan? In different positions of the assemblage point?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Right. In different positions of the assemblage point, but positions sorcerers arrive at with a\nmovement of the assemblage point, not a shift. Entering into those worlds is the type of dreaming\nonly sorcerers of today do. The old sorcerers stayed away from it, because it requires a great deal\nof detachment and no self-importance whatsoever. A price they couldn&amp;#39;t afford to pay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as there was no one to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, I can only hypothesize that after completing the whole J curve, the next way for the AP is even &amp;quot;deeper&amp;quot;, and causing a movement outside the cocoon, to grab the new band?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most interestingly, don Juan also mentioned that IOBs taught sorcerers to do this.

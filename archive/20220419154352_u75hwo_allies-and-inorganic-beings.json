[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "The universe is populated by countless numbers of both organic and inorganic beings (IOBs). Both kinds of beings possess awareness and their awareness is held together by an agglutinating force. They differ  in that organic beings (like us) possess an organic body and inorganic beings do not.\n\nDon Juan uses the term 'ally' a few different ways in the books. Sometimes he uses it interchangeably with the term 'inorganic being'. He says that what the new seers call 'inorganic beings', the old seers called 'allies'. In other places he makes the distinction that inorganic beings may form relationships with sorcerers and become allies. This is the usage that I use. 'Inorganic being' describes the type of being itself whereas 'ally' describes the nature of the relationship.\\*\n\n**An ally then is a being with which a sorcerer has developed a mutual and beneficial relationship with for the purposes of sorcery.**\n\nThe assistance of an ally is one of the most useful resources that a sorcerer can have. That said, allies are not in any way a requirement for sorcery. A person can become a great sorcerer without any allies, although it is doubtful that they could be a sorcerer without ever interacting with inorganic beings.\n\nThere are a wide range of things that an ally can do. They can assist the sorcerer with feats by helping to move their assemblage point, provide them with energy, provide instruction and guidance, act as a protector or guardian, warn us of ensuing danger, provide insight that we may have overlooked, act as an intermediary to the Spirit and Silent Knowledge, and keep us company and share a sense of intimacy and camaraderie in the face of the unknown.\n\nWhat they are capable of is largely dependent on their experience as individuals and the type of inorganic being that they are. Those that share more emanations with us are more akin to us and are even capable of emotions that are similar to our own. Others are quite alien and forming a relationship with them might be more challenging but come with its own advantages.\n\nThere is an immense diversity in the kinds of inorganic beings that exist in the universe, just as there is with organic beings as well. On our Earth alone, don Juan describes seven great bands of emanations that give rise to inorganic life in comparison to our single organic band. All organic life on Earth comes from this band. The other seven bands are associated with other total worlds on our Earth, separated by a barrier of perception, populated by inorganic beings of a multitude of types.\n\nAnd this is just for our Earth. There are countless other worlds that exist in the cosmos. At one point don Juan describes the old seers choosing allies that come from the depths of the universe because they found the speed and nature of their awareness more suited to their needs and desires.\n\nIn the books, a multitude of descriptions are given for the different kinds that exist. There are fiery ones and watery ones, ones whose awareness is slower than ours and ones whose awareness is faster, ones like bundles of canes, ones like zippered up sleeping bags, mobile shadows, hollow tunnels, ones akin to plants and others more akin to humans, ones that can only make noise, ones that can only cause fright, ones that are capable of genuine affection, and ones who share no emanations with us at all so that we can neither perceive nor communicate with them.\n\nIt's this diversity of types that can make things a bit confusing for newcomers. Especially as cultures all around the world have their own folklore and warnings about spirit beings, only some of which is useful, generalisable information while the rest only serve as superstition. There are *many, many* different kinds just as there are many different kinds of organic species on Earth.\n\nIn addition to this, one of the most important things to remember is that the vast majority of inorganic beings that you may encounter while on Earth are able to change their appearance at will. To be more accurate, what we usually see of them is only their projection not their body, and they can project themselves however they choose, usually with a little of our own inventory mixed in.\n\nAs such, they can appear as people, animals, inanimate objects, abstract shapes, whole groups of people as Dan mentioned in his last post, entire environments, or nothing at all. When you are dreaming with inorganic beings, the whole dreamscape is often their projection. This is why it can be useful to think of them as more of a presence. They also use their ability to project sensory information to us as a way of interacting and some are better at this than others.\n\nJust as we are learning to communicate with inorganic beings, a number of them are still learning how to communicate with us. We all have our own idiosyncrasies that we have to adapt to and learn the idiosyncrasies of them as well.\n\nSo that leads into the big question, how do we get an ally? In a way, it is much like getting a romantic partner. First you have to learn how to talk to people.\n\nThat means we need to learn how to communicate with IOBs.\n\nBut there is another side to that analogy as well. An alliance is a relationship. We need to learn how to form healthy relationships and recognise when the relationships we have are not healthy.\n\nOkay. Do you know how to do this? If not, you may want to go and recapitulate your past relationships; romantic, platonic, familial, collegial, whatever.\n\nNot every inorganic that we come across is going to become an ally or is even suitable to be an ally. Just remember this. Those relationships will emerge on their own. In the mean time, practice having cordial communication with IOBs instead. Much like when learning a new language, the best way to learn is to go out and speak to other people with that language. The good thing is IOBs are everywhere and they are trying to interact with us all the time. The difficulty is that many of them are used to only being acknowledged if they push buttons that can unbalance us.\n\nFear is a good example, but also pride and grandiosity. It is not uncommon for IOBs to present themselves as a deity or a possessor of vast cosmic knowledge just to hook peoples' attention and make them feel special. We are all susceptible to that desire to feel special and it is an easy feeling for them to leverage to get us to continue talking to them. You can often tell if this is the case because they'll use New Age or esoteric buzz words right out of the gate or speak to you in a commanding, authoritative air about things unrelated to sorcery.\n\nLuckily, we don't care what they're talking *about*, we only care that they are talking. Often, if you are frank and honest with them that you just want to chat and practice, they'll drop the pretenses because you have just made yourself more interesting than the vast majority of humans that they come across.\n\n**So, how do we talk to inorganic beings?**\n\nWell first, your assemblage point has to have moved away from its customary position. You can find many mentions throughout the sub of how to do this. In it's most basic summary, when we practice inner silence we create the conditions through which the assemblage point is able to move on its own.\n\nIt can be possible to communicate with IOBs while at the Blue Line (our customary position) but I am not going to teach you about doing this. This normally comes after learning it at a different position first.\n\nThankfully, you don't need to move the AP very far. Green Line on the J Curve is enough. I usually use the state of hypnagogia or hypnapompia. You want to be awake but with a mostly silent and relaxed mind. If you start to experience small dream visuals or sensory hallucinations, this is good.\n\nIt can be a little tricky at first to tell the difference between an IOB and a phantom hallucination. My rule of thumb is to only consider it an IOB if I am able to have a back-and-forth conversation of dialogue where they respond directly and sensically to what I am saying to them.\n\n(There are other organic beings out there and sorcerers who have technically become inorganic after retaining their awareness through death and it is possible to encounter these as well.)\n\nIOBs can communicate with us through a wide variety of means. They may speak verbally, telepathically, transfer thoughts or feelings, communicate with visions and images, physical sensations, or environmental effects (omens). A lot of them will use a combination of different methods in one sitting. Some of them are good with human languages and others... aren't. You might find that their sentences somehow make sense but their grammar and syntax is bizarre.\n\n(This post I talked about an IOB I met who used a combination of verbal communication, telepathic, visual, and even tried to speak Spanish to me: [A new IOB \"Vulture\" and some AP comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/og3lnp/a_new_iob_vulture_and_some_ap_comments/))\n\n(Yes, I'm reusing some old posts to make a point because it's taking me ages to type these up)\n\nWhen we are trying to communicate back to them, you have some options. You can speak out loud if you like but it is not necessary. You can speak with your internal voice, think your questions, focus purely on the idea and feeling you want to convey without any words, use visuals etc. That will be up to your own individual preference and what you find works with your current conversational partner.\n\nOh, this is probably a good time to mention that there is another reason that we learn how to silence our mind. **IOBs can see your internal dialogue.** \n\nYou'll probably find through talking to them that a lot of them, even if they like us, are thoroughly unimpressed with humans. It's really no wonder why. \n\nWhen it comes to attracting IOBs in order to interact with them, I have to post this quote again. Just as they can see our internal dialogue, they can also easily detect our mood. And the good thing about holding this mood to welcome them is that you can do it even when you aren't practicing.  \n\n\n&gt;\"What do sorcerers do with inorganic beings?\"    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"They mingle with them. They turn them into allies. They form associations; create extraordinary friendships. I call them vast enterprises where perception plays the uppermost role. We are social beings. We unavoidably seek the company of consciousness.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"With inorganic beings, the secret is not to fear them. And this must be done from the beginning.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The intent one has to send out to them has to be of power and abandon. In that intent one must encode the message \"I don't fear you. Come to see me. If you do, I'll welcome you. If you don't want to come, I'll miss you.\" With a message like this, they'll get so curious that they'll come for sure.\"    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Why should they come to seek me, or why on earth should I seek them?\"    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Dreamers, whether they like it or not, in their dreaming seek associations with other beings. This may come to you as a shock, but dreamers automatically seek groups of beings; nexuses \\[\\* nexuses- connected series or groups\\] of inorganic beings in this case. Dreamers seek them avidly.\"    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"This is very strange to me, don Juan. Why would dreamers do that?\"    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The novelty for us is the inorganic beings. And the novelty for them is one of our kind crossing the boundaries of their realm. The thing you must bear in mind from now on is that inorganic beings, with their superb consciousness, exert a tremendous pull over dreamers and can easily transport them into worlds beyond description.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The sorcerers of antiquity used them, and they are the ones who coined the name 'allies'. Their allies taught them to move the assemblage point out of the egg's boundaries into the non-human universe. So when they transport a sorcerer, they transport him to worlds beyond the human domain.\" \n\n\\**In the first book, don Juan uses the term 'ally' quite differently and uses it primarily when introducing Carlos to various psychoactive power plants. He clarifies his use quite directly in the second book, A Separate Reality, where he tells Carlos that the ally is not in the smoking mixture but the smoking mixture is used to help one go to meet the ally, and after that point the smoking mixture isn't needed anymore. In the following books, he always uses ally to refer to inorganic beings.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to finish with a story from early last month. It has a couple of different inorganic beings in it and some examples of different communication styles.\n\nI was practicing in the morning, awake. I quieted my mind and visuals began rapidly. There were IOBs waiting because instead of swimming through a haze of dreamlets and random hallucinations, as soon as my AP moved I heard a flurry of little voices and saw a dream object appear in front of me. A set of hands held out a brass dinner plate and objects were thrown onto it from different directions. They seemed like simple, random things; a string of beads, a handkerchief - but one of them stands out most. It was a cooked piece of meat like the steaks I had been eating for dinner.\n\nI knew what this was all for because it had happened many times before. The dream objects being held in front of me were to hook my attention and keep my awareness centred on them. The piece of meat to me seemed like one of them had panicked when my AP moved and chosen the first object that came to mind.\n\nThey speak to me. It sounds like there are several of them but I do not recognise them specifically, I only recognise their method of getting my attention. Their voices are high-pitched and childlike. They remind me of pixies.\n\nNow that my attention is on them they quickly hand me another object. \"It's a sign!\" they cheer. The object is an enamel pin with a white and gold peacock on it. It is indeed a sign, or rather an answer to a question I had asked my ally much earlier. The answer to me is clear. They must have been instructed to give this to me.\n\nStill awake, I rub the pin between my fingers. The enamel rubs off and I can feel its rubbery texture with my finger tips. \n\nNext, I see visuals in front of me. I can see a map. There are countries marked in different colours and areas of water. I can easily see that this map is not of anywhere on our Earth. As I watch it starts to zoom out so I can see more and more of it. The new areas I can see are all very similar to the first area; just more countries and bodies of water, but something inside me is deeply upset. I feel a jolt of existential fear, something like looking into a black hole. I can't rationalise why I feel this, the map is just a map, but there is some unsettling suggestion of immense size that I feel deep in my body.\n\n\"Oh my god!\" I shout internally. The map immediately stops and disappears and I go back to normal. I feel better and let them show me the map again. It starts the same way. I see a small section of countries and then the view zooms out and I feel that jolt again. They must notice my distressed reaction as the map disappears again.\n\nI then suddenly see a different vision, like a video on a television set. The video is like a children's show with puppets. A girl puppet in a pink dress swoons in distress and two other puppets on either side of her catch her, surprised by what's happened. They are like twins; both have upright black hair, black clothes, and monochromatic faces and I know they are not supposed to be human. They support her, unsure what to do.\n\n\"It's okay,\" I reassure them. \"I don't know why that happened but it was only very minor. I feel okay, please continue.\" \n\nIt's then that we are interrupted. I see what looks like a SWAT van pull up in the darkness. I know this is a visual metaphor to indicate that someone else has arrived. The pixies have played their part keeping watch and have called in someone else. I recognise that it's my ally. As I talk with them we enter completely into dreaming. I don't pay much attention to the transition as I have my attention on them instead. It's only later when I wake up that I realise my physical body must have fallen asleep. \n\nMy ally walks me through several dream environments that they have constructed, each saturated with meaning. In one they tell me that I need to stop carrying my parents' baggage around and recapitulate my relationship with them. Sometimes he speaks to me with words and the voices of people I know, sometimes I just hear his thoughts.\n\nThe dream fades to black and I am roused by a rattling sound. I look up. There is a small ceramic jug sitting on a plate near where I am lying. They are rattling by themselves. He is rattling them to get my attention. They are so realistic. I can feel their texture in my hands and see the lines where they've been painted. I get this feeling I am about to see something very important.\n\nI look up and see a wall. It is so realistic. It is covered in a white and gold wallpaper depicting flowers in bloom. I know very specifically that this is also in answer to the same question for which the pixies gave me the pin. It makes perfect sense to me, I know what the symbols mean. \n\nI am awed and humbled. This dream was one of many that I had experienced in recent weeks. All of them had been so vivid and stable and hyper-realistic, unlike any ordinary sleeping dream. All those years of practice had paid off. All of this was REAL. \n\nHe answered my thoughts and told me how this was possible from forging the energy body. There was still more to do but I'd crossed an important threshold and it was forged enough to hold me after death. My joy was bittersweet. If this was true, then what about the people we love?\n\nHe answered my question in a very personal way, so I am going to paraphrase him instead.\n\n**\"You can't teach them. This is not within your control. Only the Spirit can decide. What you can do is love them and support them and give them the space they need so that the Spirit can do its work.\"**\n\nIf the Spirit wants our help, it has ways of letting us know.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Allies and Inorganic Beings", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_u75hwo", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 46, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_4dz9kepm", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 46, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650375832.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The universe is populated by countless numbers of both organic and inorganic beings (IOBs).

If you don&amp;#39;t want to come, I&amp;#39;ll miss you.&amp;quot; With a message like this, they&amp;#39;ll get so curious that they&amp;#39;ll come for sure.&amp;quot;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why should they come to seek me, or why on earth should I seek them?&amp;quot;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dreamers, whether they like it or not, in their dreaming seek associations with other beings. This may come to you as a shock, but dreamers automatically seek groups of beings; nexuses [* nexuses- connected series or groups] of inorganic beings in this case. Dreamers seek them avidly.&amp;quot;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is very strange to me, don Juan. Why would dreamers do that?&amp;quot;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The novelty for us is the inorganic beings. And the novelty for them is one of our kind crossing the boundaries of their realm. The thing you must bear in mind from now on is that inorganic beings, with their superb consciousness, exert a tremendous pull over dreamers and can easily transport them into worlds beyond description.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The sorcerers of antiquity used them, and they are the ones who coined the name &amp;#39;allies&amp;#39;. Their allies taught them to move the assemblage point out of the egg&amp;#39;s boundaries into the non-human universe. So when they transport a sorcerer, they transport him to worlds beyond the human domain.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;In the first book, don Juan uses the term &amp;#39;ally&amp;#39; quite differently and uses it primarily when introducing Carlos to various psychoactive power plants. He clarifies his use quite directly in the second book, A Separate Reality, where he tells Carlos that the ally is not in the smoking mixture but the smoking mixture is used to help one go to meet the ally, and after that point the smoking mixture isn&amp;#39;t needed anymore. In the following books, he always uses ally to refer to inorganic beings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to finish with a story from early last month. It has a couple of different inorganic beings in it and some examples of different communication styles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was practicing in the morning, awake. I quieted my mind and visuals began rapidly. There were IOBs waiting because instead of swimming through a haze of dreamlets and random hallucinations, as soon as my AP moved I heard a flurry of little voices and saw a dream object appear in front of me. A set of hands held out a brass dinner plate and objects were thrown onto it from different directions. They seemed like simple, random things; a string of beads, a handkerchief - but one of them stands out most. It was a cooked piece of meat like the steaks I had been eating for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew what this was all for because it had happened many times before. The dream objects being held in front of me were to hook my attention and keep my awareness centred on them. The piece of meat to me seemed like one of them had panicked when my AP moved and chosen the first object that came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They speak to me. It sounds like there are several of them but I do not recognise them specifically, I only recognise their method of getting my attention. Their voices are high-pitched and childlike. They remind me of pixies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that my attention is on them they quickly hand me another object. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a sign!&amp;quot; they cheer. The object is an enamel pin with a white and gold peacock on it. It is indeed a sign, or rather an answer to a question I had asked my ally much earlier. The answer to me is clear. They must have been instructed to give this to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still awake, I rub the pin between my fingers. The enamel rubs off and I can feel its rubbery texture with my finger tips. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, I see visuals in front of me. I can see a map. There are countries marked in different colours and areas of water. I can easily see that this map is not of anywhere on our Earth. As I watch it starts to zoom out so I can see more and more of it. The new areas I can see are all very similar to the first area; just more countries and bodies of water, but something inside me is deeply upset. I feel a jolt of existential fear, something like looking into a black hole. I can&amp;#39;t rationalise why I feel this, the map is just a map, but there is some unsettling suggestion of immense size that I feel deep in my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my god!&amp;quot; I shout internally. The map immediately stops and disappears and I go back to normal. I feel better and let them show me the map again. It starts the same way. I see a small section of countries and then the view zooms out and I feel that jolt again. They must notice my distressed reaction as the map disappears again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then suddenly see a different vision, like a video on a television set. The video is like a children&amp;#39;s show with puppets. A girl puppet in a pink dress swoons in distress and two other puppets on either side of her catch her, surprised by what&amp;#39;s happened. They are like twins; both have upright black hair, black clothes, and monochromatic faces and I know they are not supposed to be human. They support her, unsure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay,&amp;quot; I reassure them. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know why that happened but it was only very minor. I feel okay, please continue.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s then that we are interrupted. I see what looks like a SWAT van pull up in the darkness. I know this is a visual metaphor to indicate that someone else has arrived. The pixies have played their part keeping watch and have called in someone else. I recognise that it&amp;#39;s my ally. As I talk with them we enter completely into dreaming. I don&amp;#39;t pay much attention to the transition as I have my attention on them instead. It&amp;#39;s only later when I wake up that I realise my physical body must have fallen asleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ally walks me through several dream environments that they have constructed, each saturated with meaning. In one they tell me that I need to stop carrying my parents&amp;#39; baggage around and recapitulate my relationship with them. Sometimes he speaks to me with words and the voices of people I know, sometimes I just hear his thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dream fades to black and I am roused by a rattling sound. I look up. There is a small ceramic jug sitting on a plate near where I am lying. They are rattling by themselves. He is rattling them to get my attention. They are so realistic. I can feel their texture in my hands and see the lines where they&amp;#39;ve been painted. I get this feeling I am about to see something very important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look up and see a wall. It is so realistic. It is covered in a white and gold wallpaper depicting flowers in bloom. I know very specifically that this is also in answer to the same question for which the pixies gave me the pin. It makes perfect sense to me, I know what the symbols mean. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am awed and humbled. This dream was one of many that I had experienced in recent weeks. All of them had been so vivid and stable and hyper-realistic, unlike any ordinary sleeping dream. All those years of practice had paid off. All of this was REAL. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He answered my thoughts and told me how this was possible from forging the energy body. There was still more to do but I&amp;#39;d crossed an important threshold and it was forged enough to hold me after death. My joy was bittersweet. If this was true, then what about the people we love?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He answered my question in a very personal way, so I am going to paraphrase him instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t teach them. This is not within your control. Only the Spirit can decide. What you can do is love them and support them and give them the space they need so that the Spirit can do its work.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Spirit wants our help, it has ways of letting us know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "25c96bb2-6006-11ea-a318-0e7b3e95c21d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "u75hwo", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "the-mad-prophet", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 34, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/u75hwo/allies_and_inorganic_beings/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/u75hwo/allies_and_inorganic_beings/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1650375832.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i5da8gg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1650389424.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_u75hwo", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I stole it for Facebook.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i5da8gg", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stole it for Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/u75hwo/allies_and_inorganic_beings/i5da8gg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1650389424.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_u75hwo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i5cmfgh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dirgable_dirigible", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1650380337.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_u75hwo", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_j1twu", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "This is excellent.

it's more like my mind is working through trauma when I am dreaming and figuring it out - but I rarely experience beings in my dreams unless I am just about to wake up - occasionally I will find one watching me, but it's female and the one I mentioned is male.\n\nIt hasn't really tried to mess with my emotions too much, other than asking that I learn to Love from a higher perspective, which I'm working on.  He is philosophically, dark, like the dark heart of humanity - but there is light there and he has partitioned a wall to keep me from learning about the darker side too soon.  Eventually I will have to learn about this part of human nature - and then I'll understand a bit more how we manifest chaotic energy, but until I am ready - I plan on chewing salvia to get to a state where I can experience this nature - I simply wish to understand fully both yin and yang so that when I work with Love and Light that I can genuinely understand both sides of the coin.  If I just work with Light, and not Dark - then my knowledge will be cut in half.\n\nThere isn't really arrogance - it's like... past that.  When I meet him there is usually concern for me - and a willingness to guide me to a better place.\n\nI use alchemy with my art so I am able to bring life into it.  He would be considered, in this model - nigredo, that I am trying to bring to albedo - white, then citrinitas, then finally rubedo.\n\nI use a few different sources aside from Castaneda, and so I'm coming from a few different perspectives on darkness.\n\nI'm sorry if the posts are a bit too long - much of what he told me is quite lengthy.  I learned a lot about archetypes, how energies influence us and the natural world - he seems very \"natural\", like not... arrogant... but a feedback loop that can be moved across the board as either positive or negative and it is up to me to decide how it plays out.  I don't feel influenced by him - so much as I just remember the energy at various times and with it comes a download of what is on the other side.  I am told to work on my karma and be a good person, and help other people as much as I can.  \n\nHe tells me things that grow darkness or move towards the light and when I have done things towards others and myself that are not good, I can feel that collective energy, and I know to transmute it to positive intention.  He serves as like a guard - a wall against what the darkness is - I can't actually penetrate it - and so I \"feel\" the darkness, but there is mostly like a positive... movement towards better behaviour.  Like, he warns me.  Sometimes I am not the best person in the world, and I can feel that energy grow - and then if I do good, positive things and feel good things in the name of love and light - then I am not so close to the dark wall - he is still there influencing me, but I am partitioned from evil; almost like a parent teaching a child not to touch the stove, and what they can play with and so forth.\n\nBecause I am still quite the novice with this work, he is patient.  He's a being that takes a long time to get to, the communication is very slow so I have a lot of time in between to contemplate and self reflect, and work on myself positively.  It has been a positive experience because I am not being harmed emotionally or mentally.\n\nWhen I got very sick, I was really out of it, and the first time he made himself known there was a very strong jolt of concern.  He doesn't \"love\" - but recognizes areas of growth that a human can take - he recognizes after I spoke with him about using human energy in the wrong way, that it harms the host and so he no longer does it.  I told him that it is an evolutionarily flawed virus that kills the host, and a smart one that learns to work with it; and so he works with me.\n\nAs for the legion, I can explain it like this song:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5VgEpTV5P0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5VgEpTV5P0)\n\nSee how it starts off as a unified, singular entity?  It brings forward the Light to work with, and then splits apart, all the pieces working in unison?  That is how his species works - it comes forward as a singular entity, but he is the energetic library of a species of some sort of being that exists outside of this dimension.  We humans have this library as well, and connect to it through our hearts - but a negatively oriented legion/social complex has evolved 'over' that, and moved into the realm of wisdom.  But in order to continue to evolve, you need God's Love - this is a continual energy source that doesn't deplete.  And so this is what they are seeking - is the ability to manufacture their own energy without the use of 3rd dimensional creatures such as us.\n\nWhen I first met him, he was using my energy - and when I got sick, he was concerned and surprised because that wasn't his intention - and has not used it beyond me using bhakti yoga to send Love outwards for him and for my soul family.\n\nWhen his energy is there, it isn't arrogance, it is wise, stoic, cold, observant, and his intentions are to further his wisdom.  It's almost like a masculine polarity.  I think that the male side has a harder time with love and light, and bringing that forward - but is able to accomplish many feats as far as building and creating goes.  He says he is like a natural feedback loop, and has been an influence in various species from start to finish - that our stories and archetypes are manufactured and created from these original intentions - so it's more like... a movement.  Like, the brutal side of nature - the parts that we don't look at that make up the whole scenery, if that makes sense.\n\n[https://youtu.be/inVZoI1AkC8](https://youtu.be/inVZoI1AkC8)\n\nLike this \\^ - there are positive and negative feedback loops in nature that create certain affects - and some of the beings that are a part of our evolutionary lineage contain the brutal aspects of human nature - the kind that is more animalistic.  Like when a lion kills a gazelle to feed it's cubs, it's brutal, sad, the gazelle has a terrible death - but it is natural, normal and a part of what makes nature work.\n\nAnd there are shadows and aspects to it that I have a hard time understanding.  It's like the virus that makes humans violent, greedy and selfish is self aware - it doesn't cause any of these actions because we have free will - he's like a farmer - or philosophically - like a Shiva, but not quite - he is like \"The End\" - and is very neutral - there isn't things like happiness, or joy, or arrogance - it's like ... past that, like a slow, steady observational drip.\n\nI hope all of this makes sense.

I told him that it is an evolutionarily flawed virus that kills the host, and a smart one that learns to work with it; and so he works with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the legion, I can explain it like this song:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5VgEpTV5P0\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5VgEpTV5P0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See how it starts off as a unified, singular entity?  It brings forward the Light to work with, and then splits apart, all the pieces working in unison?  That is how his species works - it comes forward as a singular entity, but he is the energetic library of a species of some sort of being that exists outside of this dimension.  We humans have this library as well, and connect to it through our hearts - but a negatively oriented legion/social complex has evolved &amp;#39;over&amp;#39; that, and moved into the realm of wisdom.  But in order to continue to evolve, you need God&amp;#39;s Love - this is a continual energy source that doesn&amp;#39;t deplete.  And so this is what they are seeking - is the ability to manufacture their own energy without the use of 3rd dimensional creatures such as us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first met him, he was using my energy - and when I got sick, he was concerned and surprised because that wasn&amp;#39;t his intention - and has not used it beyond me using bhakti yoga to send Love outwards for him and for my soul family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When his energy is there, it isn&amp;#39;t arrogance, it is wise, stoic, cold, observant, and his intentions are to further his wisdom.  It&amp;#39;s almost like a masculine polarity.  I think that the male side has a harder time with love and light, and bringing that forward - but is able to accomplish many feats as far as building and creating goes.  He says he is like a natural feedback loop, and has been an influence in various species from start to finish - that our stories and archetypes are manufactured and created from these original intentions - so it&amp;#39;s more like... a movement.  Like, the brutal side of nature - the parts that we don&amp;#39;t look at that make up the whole scenery, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/inVZoI1AkC8\"&gt;https://youtu.be/inVZoI1AkC8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like this ^ - there are positive and negative feedback loops in nature that create certain affects - and some of the beings that are a part of our evolutionary lineage contain the brutal aspects of human nature - the kind that is more animalistic.  Like when a lion kills a gazelle to feed it&amp;#39;s cubs, it&amp;#39;s brutal, sad, the gazelle has a terrible death - but it is natural, normal and a part of what makes nature work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are shadows and aspects to it that I have a hard time understanding.  It&amp;#39;s like the virus that makes humans violent, greedy and selfish is self aware - it doesn&amp;#39;t cause any of these actions because we have free will - he&amp;#39;s like a farmer - or philosophically - like a Shiva, but not quite - he is like &amp;quot;The End&amp;quot; - and is very neutral - there isn&amp;#39;t things like happiness, or joy, or arrogance - it&amp;#39;s like ... past that, like a slow, steady observational drip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope all of this makes sense.  Sorry for the long post, I would also love to hear about some of your experiences if you have the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_u75hwo", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/u75hwo/allies_and_inorganic_beings/i5fkez5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1650422358.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1650422358.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i5fenme", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "monkeyguy999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i5fcx95", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_14w1ssx0", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Nah arrogance can be iob as well.

What I have found most salient so far is that the energy body needs to be forged into a suitable form. This is an active process and the best way to forge it is by using it. It might be useful to think of the word 'form' more like 'pattern' rather than 'object'. Each time we travel in our energy body in full consciousness we temporarily force it to take on the pattern of our awareness. Doing this over and over again strengthens that pattern so that it becomes easier for us to use it in this way in future.\n\nI have been able to track how certain practices have assisted me in the process of forging my energy body and the qualitative results of this forging. Obviously though this process isn't complete, so anything I can comment on is only specifically for where I find myself now. That said I've found that through training and frequent use, the sensory experience while using my energy body has become incredibly realistic (as far as physical reality goes) and my mental abilities have increased as well. I have been able to hold myself in these states for longer periods of time and move between them at will with greater ease, but I am still learning so this fluctuates based on how well I'm attending to my practices.\n\nOver time, I've been able to increase my mental facility while in my energy body to the point where I am able to have full executive function and inner silence while in it. This includes reasoning, planning, memory, arithmetic, etc. without internal dialogue. I've also noticed that my sensorium has improved in intriguing ways, such that I can actually feel the muscles in my calves when I am walking while in Dreaming.\n\nIn my experience I've noticed that you need to begin by imposing these things on your energy body. I don't miraculously have executive function because I'm a good person or believed in the right philosophies, I have it because every time I got lucid, even in ordinary dreams as opposed to Dreaming, I practiced honing my attention and doing mental exercises. \n\nThe great part of this though is that you can practice this while awake as well. The pattern of our physical body is enough that if we let our attention wander, we still stay fairly focused within our body, but in dreaming if our attention wanders then the whole dream is likely to do so as well. By practicing building the pattern of attention in our ordinary waking state (while in a state of inner silence, although your AP doesn't have to move in any significant way) then that pattern becomes easier to transfer to our energy body, almost automatic.\n\nThe things I've found most important are:\n\n**- Intention**\n\n**- Attention**\n\nBoth also require **Inner Silence**, but the level of silence needed varies for different things and becomes easier with a little practice.\n\n**Intention** is really **Intent** as described in Castaneda's books and I'd normally just describe it as that but I like the rhyme between the two words. Intent is a mysterious force. It is not like willpower is often described. Willpower has a very outward, mustering feel to it where you are actively doing a thing. Intent is more like an internal orientation that you align yourself with. Hence the mood that you carry with you is actually very important because it's much easier to align with Intent in the way that works best for you if you are in a good or suitable mood. Intent is everywhere and in all things. We clean our connection to Intent and in that manner we have more fluidity and decision in how we orient with it.\n\n**Attention** is our ability to place our focus on various clusters of energy. It allows you to control where you place your focus, how long you are able to maintain that focus, and to choose to take your focus away from something. It is essential for stable Dreaming. Practicing inner silence doubles as a way of training your attention, especially if you are doing a concentration practice. You can then use your attention more fully in the waking world to experience sensory stimuli which in turn helps the energy body copy this pattern as well.\n\nThere's a well-known modern author who writes about alchemy who makes reference to Intention and Attention as well. Given that my ally had been guiding me through alchemical teachings when I originally wrote this post I think it is fair to mention it here. This author associated Attention with the White Queen and Intention with the Red King. I completely disagree, it is the other way around. The tonal can become quite the petty tyrant and think it can claim Intent for itself! But it -is- very good at honing attention and executive function and indeed it should do so.\n\nThe more I have practiced, experienced, studied, and learned from my Allies, the more I have noticed that these teachings have appeared in no uncertain terms in other traditions, especially that what we are is an agglutination of parts that would usually go separate ways after death, but that through forging our energy body which every person has but begins in an unforged state, we can retain our awareness and identity after death. When this is done you become an inorganic being not because you have changed species but because you are a being who no longer has an organic form. \n\nIt makes me suspect that one of the very purposes of organic life is to train awareness in this manner.\n\nIt also becomes clear that there are many traditions out there that have similar beliefs about the energy body but their methods for forging it are largely ineffectual or have lost whatever effect they might have once had.\n\nBecause this sub is specifically for Castaneda though, I won't go into them here, but I do find it interesting and don't mind discussing it in private.\n\nAlso, there are other means by which one may apparently retain their awareness after death that I can't claim to know anything about. Castaneda speaks about Burning from the Fire from Within and alludes that different members of his lineage have followed different paths after death. The Witches and he also list a great number of other practices that are useful for developing the energy body, such as the recapitulation, gazing, stalking etc. but if you are reading the books then I am sure you will find these yourself and they can explain them better than I. \n\nAgain, this is all only my personal experience of what I've found most helpful. It may be different for others depending on where they are in life and it is not comprehensive by any means.

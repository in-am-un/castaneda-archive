Don't use \"Joe Phlim's tibettan finger puzzle technique\".\n\nUntil you get to the whitish light, and can make it do things.\n\nThen you can see what Joe Phlim's Tibettan finger puzzle does.  Until then, don't do that.\n\nWe're trying to lure a wild animal to help us.  The Spirit is like a shy animal at first.\n\nAnd to lure it, you have to do what it's familiar with. ONLY what the Olmecs did.  NOT what Joe did.\n\nAnd forget your amazing Buddhist training.\n\nDon't clench your eye balls to force \"puffs\" to appear.\n\nDon't do any Daoist chants, and don't pray to Hindu Gods.\n\nOnly silence!\n\nLook at it this way. If you add those other things and they work (they won't), you'll be ruining the entire process.\n\nThis process is just a way to force you to use silence.  No silence, no puffs.\n\nIf you get the \"Joe puffs\",  or the \"eye damage\" versions, you messed up big time.\n\nBecause you ignored the entire point.  If you aren't silent, there's no puffs.\n\nIf you get MORE silent, there's MORE puffs.\n\nWhat could be more effective?  Sorcery is about silence, and nothing else.\n\nI'll tell you a secret:  If you get fully silent, you have a choice to use the Double's perception, or your own.   If you switch to the double's perception, the laws of physics go out the window.\n\nThat kind of power is not even known in other systems.\n\nWhen you can see what's shown while doing the Affection for the Energy Body pass, you're good now.\n\nDon't need any of us anymore.\n\nThe whitish light shows up soon if you managed to create a creepy copy of yourself.  But you can also get it by scooping puffs onto your 3 pouches.  Right side of stomach, left side, and a line across the chest just above those.\n\nStuff as much light into those as you can.\n\nCool thing is: later the  pouches are actually visible!  Not just the puffs.  You can actually look into the pouches and see that in the center of where you stuffed a puff, a fireworks style sparkle is now present.  You literally look \"inside\" yourself, and there's a little sparkle. Not a vague one!   It's as bright as a 4th of July sparkler.\n\nI posted some advanced info on how to use the double over in the advanced subreddit.\n\nBut we have \"pretenders\" lately.\n\nPretenders are attention hungry, so if you tell them, NEVER TRY THIS UNTIL YOU ARE ADVANCED!\n\nThat's all they do.\n\nAnd they try to get out of using silence.  They find what they believe to be an easier way, and if anyone corrects them, they get angry.\n\nIt's like a cooking class making something covered in chocolate syrup, but they're using Indian Mint sauce.\n\nAnd then they have to make up results, because they believed you can \"learn\" sorcery,\n\nThey \"cheat\" to make the puffs, as if impressing others was all we're here to do.\n\nWhy not?  That's what everyone else cares about in the other subreddits.\n\nBut we can't do that!\n\nWe need help from **the spirit** or it's a no-go.\n\nIf the spirit sees you are an attention seeker, then it will help you seek attention.\n\nAnd you'll be tossed out of here.\n\nIt needs instead to see that you are a very hard worker, who is seeking the path of the Olmecs.\n\nThen it'll take you along that path which contains 5000  years of continuous real magic, void of the fake stuff that was created as religions to get money from people.\n\nThe Olmecs had no money.   If you wanted to buy something, you needed a chicken or a fish.\n\nAnd they kept their magic secret.\n\nSo there's zero motivation to trick you in their techniques.\n\nNo religion, no tricks. Just technology.\n\nThat's what you want!  5000 years of perfecting real magic as a technology, void of \"beliefs\".\n\nBut lets say you you decided to \"Buddha up\" because you admire the guy (????).\n\nYou'll fail.\n\nDon't do that.\n\n**Don't** close your eyes. **Do** walk around so you don't doze off and lie about your dream, making that into \"magic\".\n\nIt's not.  We don't need to know about  your dreams in here.  That's another path, and it's never worked for anyone.  And guaranteed it won't work for you also.\n\nThe whitish light comes when the assemblage point switches sides. Going from the back, to the front.\n\nOnly silence can get you there. Shrooms can't even access those states.\n\nNo other system gets anyone there.  Because it requires internal silence which is very painful to achieve, and not profitable if you need to get money from students.\n\nYou'd go out of business.\n\nThey use a substitute for silence, with merely reduces the internal dialogue by replacing it with something else.\n\nThat's capable of getting you to the green line.  But so is jogging.  Or ritualized dance.\n\nAnd maybe meditation can get you to the red, if you go on an all week meditation workshop marathon.   But out of 50 years of practicing meditation in multiple systems, I never heard of anyone getting that far.\n\nAdvanced people in here even shun the red zone, which is the highest achievement in other systems. Only their \"saints\" see a taste of the red, and doing it nightly for hours is unthinkable for them.\n\nSo drop it all, except silence.  That will work, to get you to the whitish light.\n\nThe whitish light does what you see there in those pictures.  It's no theory.\n\nI do those things for  hours every single day.  It never fails these days because I never took a day off.\n\nYou have to get to where it never fails, because there's a lot to explore out there.\n\nGetting to the whitish light is not the goal. It's just the starting line for a marathon.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The 3 Distances of Whitish Light", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "link_ids": ["t3_jkedo9", "t3_ixrw34", "t3_iubqq2", "t3_kea5zt", "t3_lwckni", "t3_lwcg6o", "t3_lqz7b6", "t3_lqr6zf", "t3_lnt8a6", "t3_lmp574", "t3_lm4zws", "t3_ll9z5w", "t3_lelqm7", "t3_leo7sy", "t3_ld3845", "t3_lc1ls0", "t3_lbsls8", "t3_l7cp8f", "t3_l6o7at", "t3_mz3kz7", "t3_mzx9gl", "t3_m0kyjq", "t3_lwwshw", "t3_m1oqf1", "t3_mx3d2u", "t3_mw8sve", "t3_mtfwhb", "t3_m2u0a0", "t3_mrkitp", "t3_mlhy6f", "t3_mauwly", "t3_cm1zxx", "t3_m30hb1", "t3_n17jdy", "t3_n1ljja", "t3_n7pwp8", "t3_n7zeae", "t3_naznr8", "t3_nc8q8m", "t3_ndsc7q", "t3_neslbo", "t3_nfw7xg", "t3_nir9g2", "t3_nk25ms", "t3_nkyszq", "t3_nogrjo", "t3_ns7tky", "t3_nvehdz", "t3_o0ifzx", "t3_o3inhw", "t3_o53rhe", "t3_o7qp2a", "t3_ogafdn", "t3_org1tv", "t3_owrd1h", "t3_ovqmgq", "t3_oyt4zt", "t3_oxczfa", "t3_ogzoth", "t3_pcyx4h", "t3_p9anre", "t3_p8asd8", "t3_p6ga7i", "t3_p5l6ye", "t3_p0fmbc", "t3_ozfrz4", "t3_pij28q", "t3_posqcc", "t3_pu14ic", "t3_pwrrc0", "t3_pxfw1a", "t3_q1fcee", "t3_q4x5cs", "t3_q57hxg", "t3_q7jpwq", "t3_q7snvr", "t3_q9epxq", "t3_qceavx", "t3_qctyq7", "t3_qdp6bb", "t3_q9idzp", "t3_qklney", "t3_qmbwgp", "t3_qn9y63", "t3_qo8gj1", "t3_qpoc9e", "t3_qr6cta", "t3_qqyzj8", "t3_rwu1f0", "t3_rw73iz", "t3_rb5o0q", "t3_sdgq2p", "t3_sf44pk", "t3_te7jnl", "t3_tu3w80", "t3_tzc628"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 2", "created_at_utc": 1611109587.162, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1676831407.209, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"oav04imox2e81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oav04imox2e81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f7dd43555aefa64b980ce1a278010e1007d00f5"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oav04imox2e81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c54e609ca0d25b51d10c970aa7cfaeb632d9922"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oav04imox2e81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=059844fc3555c75b08043adb75b981848b906a21"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oav04imox2e81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aea2ee5dedad3aa54565b9f66c874b25adc06d9"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oav04imox2e81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc547fcbd1a9bd1468e68425588f4e5f830e1b93"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oav04imox2e81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6c1fc52467304a9cc69ef1ded0188df9126957b"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oav04imox2e81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b0cefb88ec9587bfe6354bfc17c16cc595b485"}, "id": "oav04imox2e81"}}, "name": "t3_sdgq2p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-2gumXXpeuFHLoQm8QYQRB-kGFlbU8fPsVabWUz1eQQ.jpg", "edited": 1643233584.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643231928.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oav04imox2e81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c3b0cefb88ec9587bfe6354bfc17c16cc595b485\"&gt;\\&amp;quot;Safe\\&amp;quot;

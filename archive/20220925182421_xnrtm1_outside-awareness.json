And you can bring down some more.\n\nThe limit of course is that you run out of dreaming attention.  It seems, watching endless 3D animation tutorials as I've been doing lately, also burns up a bit of dreaming attention.\n\nAnd there's the actual purpose of \"The Warrior's Way\".  It's not a boy scout loyalty pledge, to make you feel like you are accomplishing something, when you haven't done anything at all.\n\nIt's designed to save dreaming energy.\n\nBut what use is that, if you can't do waking dreaming?\n\nNone it seems, since no one following that path for the last 50 years, ever managed to learn any sorcery at all.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nOne of the \"New Witches\", meaning real ones over in the castaneda subreddit, two trained directly by Florinda and Taisha, remembered that there is advice in the books about women gathering energy or awareness from the wind. We compared notes, but I'm afraid Carlos told me to stop reading the books so my knowledge of such things has faded.\n\nWe did remember Carlos sending women to a cave overlooking Malibu, to expose themselves to the wind.  A bit of public nudity, in the privacy of a cave that you must risk your life to enter, and which is hidden from public view.  You can see lovely Malibu Beach below, but you're too far away for anyone to notice you.\n\nLa Gorda was rumoured to go there. Perhaps even with Soledad.\n\nWe also remembered that the Men of Knowledge, the confused and superstitious profiteers similar to modern Mesoamerican shamans, believed that you could go to the world of the Brujos and that it was windy there.\n\nIt's nonsense of course, but that doesn't mean they didn't do exactly what they said.\n\nAnd there's sort of where the idea of \"alien awareness\" comes in.\n\nSorcery is vast, and humans have the ability to fill in \"missing details\" of the perception of other worlds,  using phantom creations.\n\nEven more interesting, alien awareness can aid us in this task, the way the Devil's Weed Ally could help Carlos speak to lizards.  Or the way Little Smoke, the entity, could summon mushroom shapes to allow Carlos to \"see\" people long before he was capable of that on his own.\n\nIn the case of the Allies, the appearance you see for them is ALL phantom creation.\n\nAt least, until you can align the assemble point on your back, with the one on the front at your right side just below the navel. That's the assemblage point of the energy body.  The goal of sorcery is to move the one on the back to the front, and align it with that second one on the right.\n\nMan's band of awareness is slightly angled in our luminous shell, which is why it starts up on the left shoulder blade, but as it moves precisely in the center of man's band it ends up on the right.  Where \"The Nagual's Blow\" puts it.\n\nOnce there, you have reached \"Silent Knowledge\". The goal Carlos gave to us, just before he left. In that state, you can perceive what the Allies really are.\n\nBut who cares!  They're great at parties.\n\nYour own tonal awareness, which I often see as  yellowish, is tainted.\n\nTainted with worries, grief, and memories. All the stuff your internal dialogue goes over, constantly.\n\nBUT, it has also developed \"reason\" and \"rationality\".  Those come in handy when you have an organic body that can easily be damaged!\n\nWhen we move the assemblage point the way needed to reach Silent Knowledge, we merge our rationality and sense of purpose with the infinite power of our double.\n\nBut it's very hard to get there!!!  It's thick as mud from the shoulder blade to the bottom, under, and back up to the front. It gets especially thick, trying to cross over to the right at the bottom on the front.\n\nTensegrity can help stir the mud, so the assemblage point moves more easily.\n\nBut you need actual mental silence. Not the pretend kind, or you keep pulling it back to the shoulder with your thoughts of this ugly shoulder blade level reality.\n\nWomen, who can store alien (dark) energy in their womb, have an advantage.  They can \"sneak\" through the mud on little paths men cannot find.\n\nBut they lack the intense purpose men can obsess over, so it comes out relatively equal in terms of who has an advantage.\n\nYet if the women have an advantage due to storing alien energy in their womb, are there other types of alien awareness we can attract to ourselves? Maybe some the men could even gather?\n\nYes!  Stellar Hatch does just that, and the results are STUNNING when done in Silent Knowledge.  It kicks even Dr. Strange's butt for visual coolness.\n\nAnd we know there's a second type of inorganic being out there who should never be stared at, or they might notice you. And they will attack any humans they notice.\n\nNot a big threat, just a curiosity.\n\nAnd we know that the Allies of Carlos come from 46 billion light years away, in the center of the universe.\n\nAnd yet they can easily send a ball of their own awareness, so we can interact with them. They will appear in any form we desire once you learn how to play the way they like it.  Even a bilingual talking coyote!\n\nSo there are other forms of awareness we can bring to ourselves, perhaps giving us more little \"paths\" to find, making it easier to move our assemblage point all the way along the path of the outside egg.  So we can replace the need for the Nagual's Blow.\n\nBut you have to stop pretending. And ditch the fake \"Naguals\".  Those are very bad men and if you listen to anything they are selling, your chances to learn real sorcery are greatly reduced.\n\nImagine lying about sorcery abilities the way Krelman (the Nagual Speedos) does, and then stealing from others using those lies!  And even staging fake \"interviews\" to play on Youtube, to give the impression \"experts\" recognize your knowledge.  It's pretty pathetic!\n\nYou know who these people are!  Shame them, and don't ever buy stuff or support their lies. They almost destroyed the entire body of knowledge Carlos left to us, out of their own greed and lack of concern for others.\n\nTensegrity is wonderful, and seems to be well preserved for now.\n\nBut without actual magic it was doomed to eventually be forgotten and modified for profit, until it was as useless as chi gung.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Outside Awareness", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3fdich4c71q91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c94052b5b64f868f3e0b1d1e56d58f45a0b7d92"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7716fa47f42522cb530c1fbd3924e6da986315"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bc22120f836ebc3e431b390a697184c65d4ae93"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f29741cecde25be2b430f0932c20888dee6c630"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e53b0f3833476e867b907c1f4709ba13ad9403bb"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35f74238b72b2c4407b13d17b53cde9b3c4834e9"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72aa2f248b638f2e60dd749dfa2a736f07e6840b"}, "id": "3fdich4c71q91"}}, "name": "t3_xnrtm1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/OmMvE53mq_yGNml3CXfsvPX9rutsDE4gbSAqZi_q9Rc.jpg", "edited": 1664127866.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1664123061.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=72aa2f248b638f2e60dd749dfa2a736f07e6840b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3fdich4c71q91.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=72aa2f248b638f2e60dd749dfa2a736f07e6840b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouldn&amp;#39;t have made this,  I need to keep watching animation tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there was a specific reason on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here it is, unmodified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think we consider the possible effects of locating outside awareness or energy, and adding it to our own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t stick around long, but I estimate that a &amp;quot;Stellar Puff&amp;quot; is good for at least 5 minutes.

That the wind can fly into your womb?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THERE&amp;#39;S where it&amp;#39;s best not to ask what&amp;#39;s actually in &amp;quot;the hotdogs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t ask.  You might not want to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, after someone mentioned the wind thing and the passages with Soledad, and her tile floor and orientation of the window to face her direction, I realized that&amp;#39;s what Cholita does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As best she can with the limited resources she has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why she got very angry when I bought her some potted plants she couldn&amp;#39;t possibly afford, a couple of months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She forbid me to buy any more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t understand what she was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also didn&amp;#39;t do her any favor, putting environmentally friendly weed stop all over the empty part of the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It stops new plants but doesn&amp;#39;t harm anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it grows tall with weeds.  And then later someone has to cut them down because they become a fire hazard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought Choita would be happy she didn&amp;#39;t have a huge patch of weeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she likes weeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_xnrtm1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xnrtm1/outside_awareness/iq0ano5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1664219537.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iq01xwe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Jadeyelmonte", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1664216171.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_xnrtm1", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_ckktqt40", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;We did remember Carlos sending women to a cave overlooking Malibu, to expose themselves to the wind.

The &amp;quot;Buddha Band&amp;quot; lives on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to have high hopes for Ingram, but he didn&amp;#39;t seem to learn more after his initial experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for Shinzen. Still has a baby&amp;#39;s understanding of what he described that made him seem advanced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never went further?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So initially, no one can find time to put in a serious effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those that do reach the green line, see some beginners magic, and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers were given very young children, so they didn&amp;#39;t have this problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the new seers has 15 sorcerers pushing apprentices around and tricking them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even using Allies to threaten them if they didn&amp;#39;t work hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_xnrtm1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xnrtm1/outside_awareness/ipvsgd7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1664136352.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ipvpi01", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "KrazyTayl", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1664135264.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_xnrtm1", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3i08j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Thank you for the post.

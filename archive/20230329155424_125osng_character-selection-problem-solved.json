And for individual movements, perhaps as little as 5MB.\n\nWhich is of concern because I'd like to create tools for facilitators to make their own custom \"workshop\" previews.  \n\nOf the Tensegrity moves they plan to teach.\n\nAnd as it turns out, you can in fact store ALL of them into the same blender file with easy pull down menus to switch which one is active on the selected character. \n\nWith as many of these characters from the \"normal\" animations as needed.\n\nI just picked 3 but could have put the others in there.\n\nAnd backgrounds are available.\n\nMostly we want to make sure the Tensegrity moves are never lost, and by putting them on Github that almost assures they have to stick around.\n\nProgrammers everywhere use that, and many software add-ons you buy will update themselves automatically from there.\n\nSo if we have all tensegrity moves there, someone is going to save them for as long as we'll be alive (I hope).\n\nKeep in mind, you can \"stack\" tensegrity moves to cause a combination to do something else.\n\nAnd even better Carlos taught individual movements at first, which later ended up in some sequences (long forms).\n\nSo we have \"permission\" to combine single movements, into long forms.\n\nAt least, as much permission as you can get now.\n\nSo a tensegrity instructor CAN then make up new forms.\n\nBut LEGAL ones. With each movement a true, tensegrity movement.\n\nI think the facilitators might like making new forms!\n\nI do.\n\nI originally learned only single movements.  And when the long forms came along in private classes, it was explained as an attempt to use muscle memory to help us get silent.\n\nBUT, darkroom doesn't function without silence.\n\nSo there's no real need to worry if a new combination doesn't have the same effect at helping with silence, that Carlos designed into the long forms.\n\nHe simply made his own \"custom\" long forms, the way I'm suggesting you all can do yourself, once you can \"see energy\" while doing the tensegrity.\n\nSo, make our own forms!\n\nBut legitimate ones.\n\nI have combinations to summon each of my 3 allies. They work every single time, although when it's a \"bad night\" I have to do  them as many as 9 times in a row.\n\nUsually just twice will manifest an Ally.  And 4 times might allow your Ally to \"waterboard\" you a while.\n\nThink that sounds impossible that you can summon an ally with a Tensegrity form?\n\nThink again!\n\nCarlos and the witches took care to let us know what we needed to know.\n\nTaisha summoned Phoebus by lighting a match, and holding it upside down!\n\nAnd naturally some total losers criticized her and said, \"That's a Daoist technique!!\"\n\nThe shit slinging never ends, in the river of shit.\n\nThere are NO Daoists who can summon visible, semi-solid, nearly immortal spirits with a match.\n\nOr by any other method.\n\nThey only wish...\n\nYou can see how Daoists summon spirits on youtube. It's kind of bloody most of the time.\n\nFor anyone confused, this animation tool is NOT the same as you've been seeing in previous posts.\n\nYou aren't seeing the same thing repeated.\n\nThis works in a FREE program which does EVERYTHING you need to make a full movie from scratch.\n\nAnyone can download it and use it.\n\nAnd we'll make both the tensegrity move animations available, as well as the characters.\n\nExcept Cholita. She won't like that.  Doesn't want any grubby people making her dance to their own music inside the computer.\n\nHopefully I can figure out how to include optional backgrounds for someone who doesn't like the \"lost in the void\" look.  But if not, there's a cheap add-on for that.  $70.\n\nI kind of like that \"endless void\" look myself... \n\nIf I'd just rendered it a bit pink, I think even Juann would agree it looks like home.\n\nBut here's a tiny fraction of the backgrounds I have.

Not asleep, or it would be a meaningless story.\n\nIt's similar to how Miles accidentally walked into the copy of Carlos' house on Pandora, but in his case he seemed not to be lucid enough to realize it had happened, and one of the witches had to go bring him out.\n\nIt doesn't seem now like he was ever aware of it at all because he's joined the others in Cleargreen, making up their own new \"magical\" passes.\n\nYou can't make up magical passes!  \n\nThat's so wrong, anyone can figure that out.\n\nInside what seemed to be my own very real house, but was actually a copy of it like Zuleica's house where Taisha's entire last book took place, I found a lizard on the living room floor.\n\nScratching his long toenails on the wood grain.\n\nI went to complain to Cholita that leaving the doors wide open only invites animals to come in.  I could see her working in her garden, through the wide open door.  She was bathed in sunlight.\n\nI turned around to point to the lizard.\n\nBut now it was a squirrel.\n\nIt was Minx. Most likely, the \"Devil's Weed Entity\" from the books of Carlos, assuming he got the two allies who taught him most during his apprenticeship.  In the books, La Gorda took 2, and Carlos took 2.\n\nOut of the 4 that were chasing them.\n\nBut it never said who got which.\n\nCarlos passed his two on to us in private classes.\n\nBut I'd met Minx in another form, a short time earlier when Cholita walked through my solid darkroom door, and walked over to lay across my legs on the bed and pin me down.  \n\nI'd been gazing at energy, sitting up with my legs outstretched.\n\nKind of hoping Cholita would show up!\n\nA little blue cloud floated in following her, low to the ground.\n\nCholita looked up near to the ceiling at the foot of the bed in front of us both, grinning.\n\nThe little cloud floated up there and turned into a hideous monster head, threatening to bite me in half.\n\nA perfect example of \"wrestling an Ally\".\n\nNot only was I not afraid, but I complemented its hideous look.\n\nThe threatening expression changed to one of disappointment, and then it turned into the most amazing magical object I have ever seen.\n\nA mobius strip fountain.  A structure that was impossible in the real world, and yet there it was.\n\nCholita had vanished, so I got up and walked over to it thinking there must be an on/off switch on the bottom, because it was glowing as brightly as a huge lamp in the darkness.\n\nAt the time I didn't realize that the three of us focusing on the impossible had split our home into two copies.\n\nIt's a sorcery principle all of you will someday realize, if you don't give up.\n\nBut it wasn't until some time later that I stumbled into the new version of our home, by accident.\n\nWe share Minx in our group, and this story you see actually happened.\n\nWe never found the writing pad.\n\nThe Allies like paper almost as much as water.\n\nA secret: I couldn't purchase a squirrel anywhere that was compatible with my software.\n\nSo I bought another rodent, and modified it.\n\nBut the ears also animate, and I don't know how to edit the \"bone\" positions yet.  So they're bent back in all of the animations it came with.\n\nI figured I'd make it perfect later, but then realized exactly what I told you first in this post.\n\nMagic is NOT dignified.\n\nAnd Minx never looks the same way twice.\n\nIf you faithfully memorized this image of him, and then later during darkroom practice you lured Minx to come sit on your lap, and looked at him very closely, you'd find this image is absolutely accurate!\n\nEven though, the last time you saw him it was not.\n\nAnd if you lifted him up to make sure you'd find him turning into a pink ball of fur, becoming more and more solid.\n\nYou don't want Minx becoming too solid...\n\nJust let him be whatever he will be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Just to make a cover photo for the

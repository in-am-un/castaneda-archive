I knew about Castaneda, bought a book but never read it. But it seems like the missing piece in a puzzle I've been trying to solve. \n\nI had an experience one year ago. My energy was very high back then, I would do long daily meditations and had 4 cats around me and would invest pretty much all of my energy in 'opening' my energy (I believe the cats energies really helped). I wasn't really conscious at the time of everything that I was doing. \n\nOne day some friends brought some amphetamine with them and I decided to do a very small amount (I've done all kinds of substances so I was not interested in the full effect just wanted to go with the flow of the evening). Friends left and I went straight into meditation and free writing, and noticed had very long moments of silence, I felt like the wind. I ended up meditating and doing creative work for 3 days. I did take extra care of my body, slept for couple hours in between and made soup and ate a lot of healthy things. \n\nSo the third day.. I decided to draw a portrait, but got completely lost in the details, dot for dot. While I was drawing I must have zoned out, I looked up and it was dark outside. I looked at the time and concluded that I was at it for 8 hours of which I could remember nothing. I looked at the drawing, which had turned out very intense. I noticed the lines were moving. At first I thought I was perhaps exhausted/sleep deprived and hallucinating. But the energy seemed to 'rise'. My cats were reacting like crazy, which alarmed me a little. Meowing and purring like they were in heat. I felt that the energy must have overwhelmed them somehow. I went to my bedroom and closed  the door. Looking around I began to see very bright almost neon colors (mostly violet). They were moving like DNA strands. I sat and tried to analyze the situation, I have experienced every kind of hallucination (on drugs or tired) and this was something different entirely. I began to see symbols on the walls and closet doors. The strangest thing was that while most of the wall seemed still and unchanged, there were 'patches' which almost seemed holographic and when I got closer to examine I freaked out a little because the symbols were 'alive', moving like a scene. The energy was still 'rising' and I began to see beings around me, their shape see through but thick like water. I still have a lot of thoughts about who they were but what I directly felt intuitivly was that they were an advanced type, I felt their higher intelligence which was a little intimadating, but felt that they were not harmful, but wanted to help me. \n\nI decided to draw a bath (my bathroom was kind of a sacred space which I held a lot of my rituals) to calm myself. The lights and colours stayed. It was magical. I noticed that each droplet of water contained a moving symbol. I laughed at the symbols because I thought they dumbed their symbolism down for me to understand. Maybe I did that.. I dont know. But instead of ancient hieroglyphics now they were simple. A child playing, a bag of money, very simple things. Then came the next mindfuck. While focusing on one moving symbol, I could actually pull it towards me. Out of the druplet. I choose to do this with the money symbol (I know.. But I feel like I had everything else in my life). When it got close enough I felt like I went inside it. \n\nThere were some other strange experiences, but this already is quit a long story. After an hour or so (not exactly sure) each symbol turned into a blinking warning sign. I gathered that whatever the warning was about I should better get out of the bath tub. I noticed the energy started to slowely close, wade away. I went to my balcony (the sun was coming up) and there I realized there were a lot more beings around.. I saw some behind bushes, freaky tree like ones (a little like the one someone posted  recently), a sort of mini human child. I just watched in awe untill everything stabilized. \n\nI'm really grateful for this subreddit, at least I have some things to work with now. After that experience I really felt that Magic was real, like really real.. The colours stayed for two weeks or so. But I had a traumatic experience afterwards, which closed my whole system, which I'm working through right now. I'm slowely regaining strength and then I'm diving head first into practice. Thank you again Daniel and everybody posting their experiences, makes me feel a lot less alone on this journey. I welcome any insights or feedback. I'm not entirely up to date with all termonology but I can relate to some. Like recapulitation is part my practice, always has been, it seems to never stop. I'm thinking doing the dark room practices with 3d blindfolds. I'm currently staying with my parents so I dont have a lot of options. This has definitly put some fire in my search for a new home..\n\nJust have to add: I feel like I had a glimpse into something, but not much control. And that my energy at the time wasn't stable enough.

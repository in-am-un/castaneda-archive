I didn't pay much attention, continued, and completed the series.\n\nI finished the series of silence and decided to attempt the \"Pandora box\" movement.\n\nBefore that, this movement had never yielded noteworthy results; at most, I saw the puff expanding from my hand above me and then disappearing.\n\nYesterday, however, after expanding from my hand, the puff didn't disappear immediately but remained as a huge purple cloud in front of me. It stayed stable, I would say at least for a minute before diminishing in intensity, but without disappearing.\n\n\nI did Pandora box three times, and on the third attempt, I saw fleeting images inside the puff.

The dark shadow extended its hand, or at least it seemed so because I saw what looked like an arm emerging from the shadow, only the hand wasn't well-defined, it looked like an arm with a fist.\n\nThis startled me and somehow made me aware of what was happening.

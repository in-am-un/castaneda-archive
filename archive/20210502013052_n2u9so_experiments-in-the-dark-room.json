This was the best I could manage.](https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c91bd2649f2c96258a31276c457f4874a67e6ce)\n\nThe other day I got the idea to manifest dreams in the air during recapitulation, as you can with dark room gazing,   and hopefully remembering the scene would select the dreams.  Recapitulation is supposed to be fully visual in the long run, even allowing entry to the past.\n\nYou'd attract an inorganic being for sure that way, and you could scoop him into your hand and send him into the dreams to check them out for you.  If you didn't want to enter.\n\nYou could watch your memory like a TV.\n\nI already do that often in darkroom gazing.\n\nIt's not \"you\". It's \"them\". They can do that.  All we can do, is notice when it's offered.\n\nYou can even tell your IOB, who is inside that dream, what to do next by \"narrating\" the show.\n\nI'm not sure it would work if you tried to command them.  But I think not.\n\nThey care most about \"what is\", I've been told.  \"What could be\" is harder for them.\n\nBut it might be more profitable if the mini-dream was actually a memory instead of a random phantom world.\n\nThere's no \"goal\" when watching an inorganic being explore a random dream for you.\n\nAt the very least, trying to do that could make recapitulation visual long before you would have gotten there by the normal path.\n\nBut the point is, we MUST get there.  Something is currently very wrong in recapitulation land.\n\nI believe we have gazing and seeing under control to some extent now.  Because of this subreddit, it's now known out there that those techniques \"work\".\n\nThat will motivate some to work hard, because they'll realize you get real results.\n\nAnd Tensegrity is fine.\n\nIt's become a fully visible activity where energy gets redeployed in stunning ways.\n\nAnd it's been proven to be absolutely necessary for sorcery. Not some fanciful kungfu Carlos copied from Howard Lee.\n\nCarlos honored him by using that format, but his real problem was teaching hundreds at workshops.\n\nOne on one, such as Clara and Emilito showed Taisha, would not be practical.\n\nThe whole, \"new style kungfu\" doubts held everyone back for decades.\n\nBut now we know, no tensegrity and waking dreaming is nearly impossible to pursue.\n\nThe Tensegrity redeploys enough energy to get you started playing with \"silence feedback\" in the dark room.\n\nBut recapitulation still sucks.   There's no tales of power coming from the supposedly huge population of people practicing recapitulation.\n\nHow can that be?\n\nEveryone must be hanging out like old men sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, regretting their nearly over lives.\n\nOr worse, sitting there counting the minutes until they can stop,  while they fuss over what their lover dared to say to them 6 years ago.\n\nWe need to discover what's gone wrong,  and fix it!\n\nA beginner should not try that \"idea\" I mentioned at the start, until they've done recapitulation the \"normal\" way for at least 6 months of intense effort.\n\nWe don't want to break the Carlos provided link to *intent*!\n\nPromise this to yourself.  \"I will not risk my link to *intent*, until I  fully understand what *intent* really is.\"\n\nI recommend you take this to extremes.  Treat it like wearing a COVID mask.\n\nLet's say you're fully immunized.\n\nAnd you're walking outside in the sunlight.\n\nAt least 20 feet from anyone else.\n\nAnd there's more chance you experience a brain tumor which will push on your frontal lobes, and cause you to go bezerk killing people.  More chance than you giving anyone COVID, that is.\n\nBut wear 2 masks anyway.\n\nWhen passers by see that, they'll think to themselves, \"Man, that person is dedicated.\"\n\nThat's what we want *intent* to think.\n\nSo that way,  it \"owes\" you a gift as often as possible.\n\nFor example,  let's say you're walking down the street and a guy in a monk robe is ahead, obviously starving for \"monkish affection\".\n\nCross the street before you get near to him.\n\nAnd at all costs, don't bow to him!\n\nDon't encourage that sort of thing at all.\n\nAnd if you're in a Russian Jewish deli between Beverly Hills and downtown LA,  looking at the amazing New Yorker Petit Fours behind the glass counter, ask the Deli owner, \"Is this type used in any religious holidays?\"\n\nIf he says yes, get the bear claws instead.\n\nKeep it clean for a while, until you understand *intent*.\n\nAnd so last night, with me wanting to \"fix\" recapitulation because so many are doing it and so little is coming from it, I sat up on pillows in perfect darkness preparing to recapitulate and summon visual scenes of the memories.\n\nI've been skipping the puffery lately, and each day I do the colors get dimmer.\n\nSo I returned to the puffery pass Carlos showed us to use, presumably as a warm up.\n\nPandora's Box.\n\nPandora's Box hasn't fully \"worked\" until you see an intense purple ball being squished and deformed, and when you pull your hands apart it stretches like violet shaving cream.  Stuck to each hand.\n\nIt should become fully directional if you have moved your assemblage point at least to the red line  on the J curve.\n\nMine got it to be somewhat directional last night.\n\nThe shaving cream was more like Crema Mexicana (something Carlos once served me), and it stuck to each hand.\n\nSo I stopped there.\n\nThen I started recapitulation.\n\nOf Cholita.\n\nI didn't have Cholita with me the last time I did intense recap, so any memories of her are still filled with energy.\n\nThe first thing I noticed, sweeping my head back and forth remembering Cholita tell stories as we headed for Whole Foods, was that Miles might be right.\n\nSweeping too far left and right gives you a neck ache.\n\nCould be last time (25 years ago) I was younger, and didn't appreciate the subtlety of the head sweep.\n\nI tried the Miles mini-sweep, but for what I wanted it was inappropriate.\n\nI wanted to gaze at the inside of my luminous shell while I was recapitulating, so I could notice any \"bright spots\".  I had to cover more area.\n\nThose, for me, are typically pinkish, not purple like puffs.\n\nI compromised and used something halfway between Miles, and the neck wrenching full distance I used  back when Carlos was alive.\n\nWhile sweeping I summoned some pinkish spots in the air. Actually they're always \"out there\", but they get pushed to the extreme of the shell.\n\nPuffery teaches them to obey your gaze.\n\nSo once I was\"expecting\" little pink spots around 6 feet from my body, all over in the air, I started to see some.\n\nThey drifted in from the outside.\n\nI believe Zuleica mentioned that possible method of building your energy body.\n\nSuck the colors closer, from the inside.\n\nAll looked good until I realized I had stopped visualizing the scenes.  I was too obsessed with the colors.\n\nIt was difficult to see the colors, while remembering the past.  VERY difficult.\n\nI hadn't expected that.\n\nI resumed remembering a story Cholita told me, and the pink spots reacted like someone had bumped each one a few inches, as my head passed it by.\n\nThey were bouncing around in the air, colliding with each other.\n\nI forced myself to ignore that, and focus only on the memory of Cholita.\n\nThe whole room shook, and was torn to pieces.  My neck made that classic \"popping sound\" indicating the second attention is coming out.\n\nI thought to myself, \"*NOW* you come out, after the room has exploded!!???\"\n\nWhere each of at least 10 pink patches had been in the air, a hole in reality was now visible.\n\nSquare holes, ripped out of the second attention fog.\n\nThey were framed in metal.  Probably steel.\n\nI tried to pretend they weren't there.   I was after mini-dreams, not square portals.\n\nI strained.\n\nWhat was that Cholita said about the Rinpoche she slept in the same  house with?  That was a fun story.\n\nThe room shook again, and I fell into one of the square holes in reality.\n\nI was trapped, a few feet below the surface.  Sitting, thankfully.\n\nI tried clawing my way out, but then realized all of this was in the abstract. There really wasn't anything at all there.\n\nAs soon as I got the idea it was merely a manifestation of the abstract, I saw an \"innocent\" looking face floating near my head.\n\nIt was \"Noname\", the inorganic being who had overexposed me to the abstract a few days earlier.\n\nHe was doing a little facial expression show for me. Trying to be cute, and soothing.\n\n\"Do you like this look?\" he'd seem to be asking. Then he'd turn his head, and do another.\n\nI was watching the refresh rate, thinking to myself, \"Yep, 2 frames per second.  They can't go faster than that.\"\n\nNoname turned his head to face me, glared into my eyes and frowned, at full speed.\n\nThen he turned back and resumed the 1990s web camera look of half second pictures.\n\nThe fright, or maybe that he didn't rise up and murder me, calmed me down.\n\nI complimented him on his assortment of \"looks\".\n\nI wasn't stuck in a hole anymore.\n\nThe square break in reality had turned into an \"object\".\n\nI had some abstract representation of a toaster floating at eye level, a tiny bit too close to focus on it.\n\nBut it was real.\n\nThe intensity of the toaster made it easy to be silent.  I had fallen onto a \"shelf\" of silence, something that happens at the green line, and then more deeply at the red line.\n\nSilence becomes easier, as if you were resting the internal dialogue on something, to put it to sleep.\n\nBut obsessed with an abstract object, I thought the object itself was a word.\n\nPart of my internal dialogue I had not removed.\n\nAnd if it wasn't a \"word\", it was certainly \"an image in your mind.\"\n\nThose have to go too, if you want to be truly silent.\n\nI tried to force the toaster \"off\".\n\nIt became transparent the harder I tried, and I saw a wall of fire on the other side of my bedroom wall.\n\nIt was the view you get when you \"stop the world\".\n\nI could make it out, through my bedroom wall.\n\nIt's been a while since I stopped the world. There's no point to it, for my current situation.\n\nIt uses all of your energy to do it, for several days, and doesn't produce anything useful for anyone else.\n\nIt's just a \"Tale of Power\".\n\nWhat we need is \"Practical Magic\".\n\nBut I tried harder to get perfect silence anyway,  since I could nearly see the bundles of emanations and the infinite expanse of individual emanations  blazing like a forest fire in front of me.\n\nI forced the toaster image from my mind so fiercely, it cracked.\n\nParts fell off, revealing what was inside the toaster.\n\nI'm sorry I couldn't draw that. It just wasn't possible.\n\nBut the left half and right half of the metal \"toaster\" turned into bisque pottery, and cracked off.\n\nInside was a little man, curled up in fetal position.\n\nHe was feeling sorry for himself.  Hiding behind the meaning of the word, to make himself feel safe.\n\n\"That's the object\",  Noname informed me.  He was still around.\n\nI thought to myself, \"This isn't right!  An object is not **me**.\"\n\nBut I could feel that although the word was not actually me, it was only \"me\" that sustained it.\n\nThe word was like modeling clay built over self-pity.  To make it easier to live with.\n\nI kept trying to shut off the \"toaster\", until the little man fell out of the cracked object, plummeted to the floor, and I could then see right through the object.\n\nThrough the holes created by the cracks, and the \"self\" stuffing of the object having been removed.  It was a long way down. I felt that if I leaned into those holes, I'd fall into that view of \"stopping the world\".\n\n\"See, it was you \", Noname informed me.  \"All objects are filled with you.\"\n\n\"It's a rather depressing thought, isn't it?\"\n\nI consoled myself thinking, it wasn't my idea to install that fake self in my head.\n\n\"But you have to face facts if you want to go on.  It's all you.  The trick is to toss it all out anyway,  without caring.\"\n\n\"Sorcery is a lonely path. You'll have a hard time releasing the things you toss. As you swing your arms, your fingers will grip anyway.  Just see, it will make you sad when each one hits the floor with a thump!\"\n\nI remembered what happened when Cholita moved in with me.\n\nImmediately she proceeded to throw all of my belongings away, perhaps 30 years worth, not even paying attention to what any of them were.\n\nIf it was mine, it was contaminated.\n\nThey all went into the trash bin.\n\nI had to pull some chemicals out of there on the 10th day, because if the city workers found them police would show up at our home.\n\nThey were chemicals for making sky rockets.\n\nCholita didn't care.  Just bottles to her, and they had to go.\n\nCholita taught me long ago, she's a nomad. And each time she changes where she lives, she likes to have less stuff.\n\nShe feels like she's making progress that way.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\"Experiments\" in the Dark Room", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 124, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"eh2j747eglw61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 96, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50dbffd3b7f2c100289df699991ae3ea3a8f8865"}, {"y": 192, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f4bc828822fe61931a136417195f2fb5aecde39"}, {"y": 284, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=008a977b35dc1e57f6d4aef16eeb9c8ab6b54020"}, {"y": 568, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e19c798542e4633ad82c074191822e37b4fbc208"}, {"y": 853, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c4680a7c3f3e95727c1cd2838310bf14af92ed"}, {"y": 960, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e234f05df9aedd1b6a31f6639a253db0ae8d2cfc"}], "s": {"y": 960, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c91bd2649f2c96258a31276c457f4874a67e6ce"}, "id": "eh2j747eglw61"}}, "name": "t3_n2u9so", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2ktaEAiqZO7lEJaY0zB-yerJifdqBgfsnwpJgBMlXAQ.jpg", "edited": 1619913419.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1619911852.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eh2j747eglw61.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9c91bd2649f2c96258a31276c457f4874a67e6ce\"&gt;The Abstract is hard to draw.

I was too obsessed with the colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to see the colors, while remembering the past.  VERY difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t expected that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I resumed remembering a story Cholita told me, and the pink spots reacted like someone had bumped each one a few inches, as my head passed it by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were bouncing around in the air, colliding with each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced myself to ignore that, and focus only on the memory of Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole room shook, and was torn to pieces.  My neck made that classic &amp;quot;popping sound&amp;quot; indicating the second attention is coming out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;NOW&lt;/em&gt; you come out, after the room has exploded!!???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where each of at least 10 pink patches had been in the air, a hole in reality was now visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Square holes, ripped out of the second attention fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were framed in metal.  Probably steel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to pretend they weren&amp;#39;t there.   I was after mini-dreams, not square portals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I strained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What was that Cholita said about the Rinpoche she slept in the same  house with?  That was a fun story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room shook again, and I fell into one of the square holes in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trapped, a few feet below the surface.  Sitting, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried clawing my way out, but then realized all of this was in the abstract. There really wasn&amp;#39;t anything at all there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I got the idea it was merely a manifestation of the abstract, I saw an &amp;quot;innocent&amp;quot; looking face floating near my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was &amp;quot;Noname&amp;quot;, the inorganic being who had overexposed me to the abstract a few days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was doing a little facial expression show for me. Trying to be cute, and soothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you like this look?&amp;quot; he&amp;#39;d seem to be asking. Then he&amp;#39;d turn his head, and do another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was watching the refresh rate, thinking to myself, &amp;quot;Yep, 2 frames per second.  They can&amp;#39;t go faster than that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noname turned his head to face me, glared into my eyes and frowned, at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he turned back and resumed the 1990s web camera look of half second pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fright, or maybe that he didn&amp;#39;t rise up and murder me, calmed me down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I complimented him on his assortment of &amp;quot;looks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t stuck in a hole anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The square break in reality had turned into an &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had some abstract representation of a toaster floating at eye level, a tiny bit too close to focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intensity of the toaster made it easy to be silent.  I had fallen onto a &amp;quot;shelf&amp;quot; of silence, something that happens at the green line, and then more deeply at the red line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence becomes easier, as if you were resting the internal dialogue on something, to put it to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But obsessed with an abstract object, I thought the object itself was a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of my internal dialogue I had not removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if it wasn&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;, it was certainly &amp;quot;an image in your mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those have to go too, if you want to be truly silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to force the toaster &amp;quot;off&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It became transparent the harder I tried, and I saw a wall of fire on the other side of my bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the view you get when you &amp;quot;stop the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could make it out, through my bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a while since I stopped the world. There&amp;#39;s no point to it, for my current situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It uses all of your energy to do it, for several days, and doesn&amp;#39;t produce anything useful for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;Tale of Power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we need is &amp;quot;Practical Magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I tried harder to get perfect silence anyway,  since I could nearly see the bundles of emanations and the infinite expanse of individual emanations  blazing like a forest fire in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced the toaster image from my mind so fiercely, it cracked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parts fell off, revealing what was inside the toaster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry I couldn&amp;#39;t draw that. It just wasn&amp;#39;t possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the left half and right half of the metal &amp;quot;toaster&amp;quot; turned into bisque pottery, and cracked off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside was a little man, curled up in fetal position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was feeling sorry for himself.  Hiding behind the meaning of the word, to make himself feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the object&amp;quot;,  Noname informed me.  He was still around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t right!  An object is not &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I could feel that although the word was not actually me, it was only &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; that sustained it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word was like modeling clay built over self-pity.  To make it easier to live with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept trying to shut off the &amp;quot;toaster&amp;quot;, until the little man fell out of the cracked object, plummeted to the floor, and I could then see right through the object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through the holes created by the cracks, and the &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; stuffing of the object having been removed.  It was a long way down. I felt that if I leaned into those holes, I&amp;#39;d fall into that view of &amp;quot;stopping the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;See, it was you &amp;quot;, Noname informed me.  &amp;quot;All objects are filled with you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a rather depressing thought, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I consoled myself thinking, it wasn&amp;#39;t my idea to install that fake self in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But you have to face facts if you want to go on.  It&amp;#39;s all you.  The trick is to toss it all out anyway,  without caring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorcery is a lonely path. You&amp;#39;ll have a hard time releasing the things you toss. As you swing your arms, your fingers will grip anyway.  Just see, it will make you sad when each one hits the floor with a thump!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered what happened when Cholita moved in with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immediately she proceeded to throw all of my belongings away, perhaps 30 years worth, not even paying attention to what any of them were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it was mine, it was contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all went into the trash bin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to pull some chemicals out of there on the 10th day, because if the city workers found them police would show up at our home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were chemicals for making sky rockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita didn&amp;#39;t care.  Just bottles to her, and they had to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita taught me long ago, she&amp;#39;s a nomad. And each time she changes where she lives, she likes to have less stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She feels like she&amp;#39;s making progress that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b5a42f16-6005-11ea-af1f-0e3247926003", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "n2u9so", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/n2u9so/experiments_in_the_dark_room/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/n2u9so/experiments_in_the_dark_room/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1619911852.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gwo5ufx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1619968787.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gwm06a5", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "So it's not practical for you to try to make it visual using darkroom, unless you have the time and dark space.\n\nIf you can't manufacture a phantom copy of your bedroom to practice in, you probably won't be able to do those things I wrote about.\n\nBut you can get by without them.  \n\nRecap requires that the assemblage point moves, before anything cool can happen.\n\nAnd it will take hours to move it using recap alone.\n\nSo the important thing is doing more than 1 hour, to get it to at least budge a little.\n\n3 hours is ideal, especially if you can manage to do that twice a day.\n\nLikely the reason the ENTIRE recap community failed (I get tired of saying that, but it's true and anyone it pisses off is a bad player anyway) is that they weren't actually doing as much as they claim.\n\nAnd likely their internal dialogues are raging the whole time.\n\nI suspect the natural state of man is not to have that internal dialogue, and instead to have images in the mind, with which we think and summon what we want.\n\nThe internal dialogue is more like a list maker, to keep us alert about problems and worries.

The only practice I can allow myself to recommend you, is Mindfulness. Read about it, find books that are truly respected and recommended. Maybe you find a group in your area who teaches or practice Mindfulness 1 or 2 times a week?\nIt's not only a way to learn focusing and to see all your thoughts come and go. With practice, you can learn to let go of anything. First of all to see you as you are without turning away, but with letting it come and go, then get you focus back on breading or other methods. In a way, it's a way to see your ego, accepting it and let go. As with all magic and spells, you destroy them by knowing their name, its energy, and with that, letting it go. But this is the only advice I can give you, and it is a very good teaching, learning and knowledge to take with you. In one ore another form, all Brujas, Shamans, Sorcerers do practice Mindfulness. And it is very important to clean ourself, forgive ourselves in different ways. Finding a stranger and just talk about all you need to emty yourself, and just go/leave. You doubtly ever see him again anyway.\ud83d\ude0a As some of the Christians have their confession cage, you will see when reading Carlos Castaneda, that they also build a small cage for 1 person, you.

The only practice I can allow myself to recommend you, is Mindfulness. Read about it, find books that are truly respected and recommended. Maybe you find a group in your area who teaches or practice Mindfulness 1 or 2 times a week?\nIt&amp;#39;s not only a way to learn focusing and to see all your thoughts come and go. With practice, you can learn to let go of anything. First of all to see you as you are without turning away, but with letting it come and go, then get you focus back on breading or other methods. In a way, it&amp;#39;s a way to see your ego, accepting it and let go. As with all magic and spells, you destroy them by knowing their name, its energy, and with that, letting it go. But this is the only advice I can give you, and it is a very good teaching, learning and knowledge to take with you. In one ore another form, all Brujas, Shamans, Sorcerers do practice Mindfulness.

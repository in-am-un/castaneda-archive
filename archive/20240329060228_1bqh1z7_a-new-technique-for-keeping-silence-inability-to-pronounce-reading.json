You wouldn't even believe you ever did that.\n\nSo it would come to nothing.\n\nWe aren't in a \"binary system\" where a success means you have become a \"master\".\n\nThere's no such thing in real magic.\n\nYou either grow up from age 3 around a seer (the way the old seers taught apprentices), so that you are never messed up in the first place.\n\nOr you are tricked into learning by a lineage of 15 powerful sorcerers who take you all over the place in alternate realities, most of which you can't remember, and then ditch you and leave you with the task of remembering all they did with you.\n\nThose are the only 2 ways magic has been learned so far in recent human history.\n\nBut we have a 3rd.  You learn it by crawling down the muddy dirt road on your belly, every inch of the way.\n\nAlone.\n\nIt ought to result in failure, but as it turns out you get \"help\" from infinity.\n\nAnd thus we gain a clear understanding of what sorcery is, and how we learned it.\n\nSomething that's never existed in humans at all, as far as the history of this type of magic goes.\n\nThus there's a huge value to \"struggling\".\n\nIf there's an easy trick, that's nice, and please exploit it.\n\nBut it's a little like having a Taxi with darkened windows through which you can't see the road as you drive, pick you up on the side of that muddy road and drive you to a rest stop 20 miles away, let you get out and look around, and then bring you back home.\n\nNever having seen anything of the road itself. Just a nice rest stop with refreshments and bathrooms.\n\nIn the long run, that doesn't teach you anything much about this path other than that there are rest stops along the way.\n\nAnd it seems very close to book deal thinking, to me.\n\nBut if you can make it work, go for it!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kx4m57m", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you could just try FORCING silence, until you get a nose bleed and feel like puking up your guts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing that pays off big time later, when you completely understand that there are specific &amp;quot;layers&amp;quot; to the internal dialogue.

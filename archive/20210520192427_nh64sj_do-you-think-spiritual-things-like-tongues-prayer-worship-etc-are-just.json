We had  a set of 3 \"counter intent\" people today, it's perplexing to me.\n\nIn your case, you don't realize what sorcery really is. You're focused on some social aspect, and being a \"reasonable person\".\n\nIt's fatal for learning.\n\nYou should read around to figure that out.  But I'll try to give you a head start.\n\nYou can't learn sorcery.  You can't memorize facts and gain insight into it.  You can't join a group with a shared interest, and make any progress (unless you could get your hands on a don Juan quality lineage)\n\nThe problem is that name, \"sorcery\".  It's not an accurate description of what were trying to learn.\n\nA good example would be inorganic beings and how they manifest. They don't have enough overlapping emanations to produce a \"real\" and reliable look, so we fill in what we expect, and for most cultures that means they come out scary, like demons.\n\nBut once you learn to interact with them, as don Juan said, a sorcerer can make them take any form he desires.\n\nWhat this really all means is, we light up a certain range of emanations in order to perceive the world.  Other combinations are always possible, which is why sorcery is so weird.\n\nWe're trying to learn to change which range we are perceiving, like  a technical skill.\n\nBut it's impossible to do by ourselves. We absolutely need help from one of 2 possible sources.\n\nOtherwise our assemblage points will always return to this normal view of the world.\n\nOne possible source is *intent*.  It gifts us for hard work.\n\nBut the gifts are based on what we're trying to accomplish.\n\nSo if you're a sorcerer who is also a Jehovah's witness, you'll get gifts based on both, and it becomes impossible to make any progress in sorcery.  The two are not compatible.\n\nThat's a real problem for new people, because even if they aren't that messed up (to be following an obviously phony religion), they have \"mini-religions\" going on in their own mind.\n\nThat's your main issue.\n\nSorcery is so very difficult, it can't allow for any deviations or the assemblage point can't move far enough to make a difference.\n\nThe cure for that is the other way we get help.\n\nReality is sort of sticky.  Which is why sorcerers can create entire villages to share, which don't actually exist in normal terms.  Carlos called them \"skimings of Phantom Intent\".\n\nIt's how Carlos created a phantom copy of his compound that even people like Miles who had  no familiarity with it, could fall into by accident.\n\nCholita made one here in our home.\n\nOur own normal reality is merely the one billions of people have made, so it's extremely easy to get stuck in.\n\nIf you picture millions of emanations available to perceive, the ones that are already glowing are the easiest to assemble.  The ones never used are very difficult to perceive, and even harder to collect into a useful bundle.\n\nSo for example, if you decided to live in a pink pony world, it's not impossible.  But alone you'd never be able to accomplish it.\n\nThat's sort of what the phony sorcery teachers out there have done. Made themselves a pink pony world to live in, and they're trying to suck outsiders into it on their social media.\n\nI suppose this is hard for a new person to understand because although this topic is covered over and over in the books, it's ignored in the community because it's not good for the phony sorcerers if people remember that issue.\n\nCarlos was so concerned about it as he was dying, that he kept repeating over and over, \"The intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nHe quoted don Juan as saying it was the \"only viable intent\" we have.\n\nAnd to make use of that to help us out, or more properly, to help refine the \"intent gifts\" we get, we can't deviate from that old seers view of things.\n\nCan't add in believing we have a past life we've uncovered.  We have a new person convinced they've got that.  And it's easy to understand why people do that.  To get attention. It's an easy to manufacture \"experience\" you can pass around in discussion groups.\n\nProblem is, if you reincarnated then there's no eagle.  No eagle, no need to recapitulate, and no reason to practice sorcery, since you'll survive death anyway, and come back as something else.\n\nSame happens if you believe Chinese philosophy has truths that can help us learn sorcery.  Each one you cling to selects a whole path that is not compatible with sorcery. In fact, sorcery is evil in Chinese philosophy, and causes harm to your soul.\n\nHoward Lee is partly responsible for the idea that \"Carlos went bad\" used by phony sorcerers to justify them taking his place.\n\nCloudfoot (a truly crazy man) claims that.  His followers all repeat, \"Carlos went bad\" if you try to talk them out of following that faker.  They have some other book deal going in their mind, and have attached themselves to Cloudfoot to justify that they have the sorcery aspect covered, so they can focus on their Zen thing, or whatever they've added in.\n\nHoward said \"Carlos went bad\" based on his Taoist beliefs.\n\n**So Chinese philosophy has caused the largest amount of damage to don Juan's teachings.**\n\nYou just can't add things, or subtract things, or you won't hook on to the intent the ancient sorcerers created.\n\nAnd your assemblage point won't move the way we need.\n\nIts like train tracks.  You have to get only on the very specific set of Olmec Indian tracks, or the destination is impossible.\n\nYou must not alter things, and especially not based on your internal dialogue's desire to be reasonable or fair or inclusive.  \n\nWhich is just a cover for something else going on in your mind.\n\nSome instantly get that. Others don't.  I have to think that the ones who don't find that obvious, always have ulterior motives.  Some book deal in the back of their mind, they hope to succeed at producing at some point in the future.\n\nWhich means they come in here, with a goal that's harmful to magic as we know it.\n\nThey're trying to produce a 1 or 2 person magic path, but we have to stick to the old seers path or we're out of luck.\n\nAs don Juan said, we have to stick to that entire path, until the very end when both old and new seers altered the shape of their luminous shell.\n\nI believe you will find that idea actively taught against in every single fake sorcery teacher group.  They're hooked on the pretending stuff, like being impeccable.  Anyone can claim to be a \"warrior\", without having to actually learn anything at all.\n\nOne of the fake teachers I was exposed to today has \"17 years as an impeccable warrior\" as one of his credentials. Russian naturally. They produce some of  the  worst fakers.  Maybe because it's harder to make a living there?\n\nIn a community where there was absolutely no magic, and that caused the reputation of Carlos go to into the toilet, so that in any non-Castaneda system his name means fraud, people pretend to be replacing him.  \n\nAnd they actually brag about being part of the downfall of magic!\n\nBut it doesn't even get noticed in the phony sorcerer groups. They pretend magic, instead of working for the real thing as described over and over, in the books.\n\nSome look in here, and see the obvious magic they've been missing.\n\nSome look in here and see things they don't like, because it points out the mistakes they've been making over and over, and they don't want to give up some imaginary goal.\n\nBut instead of going away, they hang out and harm others, trying to force their wrong understanding off on the group\n\nIf you want to avoid becoming part of a social group pretending to be following Castaneda's sorcery you need to remember his books a little more clearly and give up your socialization which has prevented your ability to perceive anything outside what you were programmed to perceive.\n\nYou have to give up the mini books deals you're carrying in your mind.", "edited": 1621609452.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gyxq8q7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re actually a bit harmful to this sub at this point.

They pretend magic, instead of working for the real thing as described over and over, in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some look in here, and see the obvious magic they&amp;#39;ve been missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some look in here and see things they don&amp;#39;t like, because it points out the mistakes they&amp;#39;ve been making over and over, and they don&amp;#39;t want to give up some imaginary goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead of going away, they hang out and harm others, trying to force their wrong understanding off on the group&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to avoid becoming part of a social group pretending to be following Castaneda&amp;#39;s sorcery you need to remember his books a little more clearly and give up your socialization which has prevented your ability to perceive anything outside what you were programmed to perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to give up the mini books deals you&amp;#39;re carrying in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_nh64sj", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nh64sj/do_you_think_spiritual_things_like_tongues_prayer/gyxq8q7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1621600535.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1621600535.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gyw9rb5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Anonomous87", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gyvtkxs", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_tbe777h", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Lol about that last statement from Cholita.

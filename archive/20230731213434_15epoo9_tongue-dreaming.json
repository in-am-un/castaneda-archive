Some people probably misunderstood the passage to be talking about the tongue in your dreaming. \n\nI tried it two times already, and in my experience it is the single best tech i have done. \n\nSo what you do is you are in the darkroom ideally and i recommend chair silence. You will be pressing your tongue against the roof of your mouth for a LONG time. Relax and silence you internal dialog. \n\nFor me that was enough to get to the red zone relatively fast in comparison to when i didn't practice this before. The reason why is i think that because you relax the rest of your body, your tonal kindoff falls \"asleep\". But of course because your pressing your tongue pretty hard against the roof, your keeping a part if you awake. \n\nSome of you are probably thinking. \"How is this any different then silence stones or something like that\"\n\nIt is not very different but here is why i think its better.\n\nYour breathing changes significantly.\n\nYes this was the biggest wow factor for me because it did something to my breathing i did not expect at all. It made breathing noiceless and smooth and deeper and more efficient. That alone was enough to somehow boost me to easily get silent (easier then normal but you still have to force it and try). \n\nThen i think what carlos is saying about some untapped energy there is definitely true. The technique works when logic said that it shouldn't. \n\nIt also forces you to clench your jaw, which is tiering but forces you to be awake when you would normally fall asleep. \n\nAlso some people might think that you will have to be asleep to be \"dreaming\". That is simply untrue and dreaming while your fully awake or semi awake is superior to when fully asleep. So do not fall in the trap of thinking you will be better of doing it \"in\" your dreams. That like thinking your better of doing transegrity in your dreams. Simply untrue and delucional thinking. \n\nI did this technique once laying down and once in the chair. Once laying down i was seeing \"glimpses\" of dreams way faster, and \"full\", but that is because your becoming semi asleep and likley shifting sideways and your AP is becoming unstable. This runs the risk of you falling asleep. Its is also less vivid and your not remembering fully what you saw seemingly a second ago. I would not recommend laying down.\n\nIn the chair it was harder at first but i was able to precive the dream bubles or visions for way longer, as i had to fully \"remove\" myself from what i was seing by being so focused on pressing my tongue. I several times noticed a phenomenal thing about the weak dreaming bubles or visions. They where most vivid when you didn't pay \"attention\" to them. But once i started like thinking \"omg this is insane\",  or \"where is this forest\", they slowly faded and i had to focus on silence and pressing my tongue harder again. \n\nThe key to doing this technique is to press your tongue hard enough for it to be a mental struggle but not so hard your mouth or tongue hurts, for obvious reasons. \n\nNote: You really want to be taking advantage of the darkroom, as it is simply is superior. I wish someone made sleeping dreaming work, but realistically it won't happen because nobody has the discipline to keep a part of them \"awake\" during dreams. It takes too much effort. Unless its womb dreaming which does exactly that with great efficiency.

For darkness we have Zuleica's instructions.  But for twilight we have nothing.\n\nWhy does that matter?  Get to the second attention and you'll find out. Sorcery is endless, and a single impression in the mind will direct the focus of our attention, and produce a result in the second attention.\n\nHow come Zen practitioners don't assemble other worlds or enlist the aid of spirits (inorganic beings)?  They certainly seem to emphasize learning to be silent.\n\nWrong turn, that's why.\n\nWithout a map, we'll all make wrong turns also, and each wrong turn can use up a lot of your practice time.  That's one danger to me-too naguals.\n\nAfter all that pessimism, I have to say it's probably just as Zuleica described.  As I recall, the first tensegrity movement Carlos taught in a class where I was present, was Zuleica's movement for drawing the colors you see in darkness, closer to your stomach.  He didn't say what it was for. He just stood there grinning while we did it.  We held our hands at our sides, and swept energy into the center with right hand, fingers curled like they could push it in as a bunch, then the left hand, then right hand again. On and on, drawing energy to our second attention's assemblage point.  At the same time, he instructed us to rotate our hips a little, to counter balance the hand movement.  That produced a rocking motion in the stomach relative to the ground.  That's the final stage of Zuleica's technique, where the fibers attached to our stomachs sweep the floor, so we can become aware of the luminous body.\n\nThat was in full office lighting conditions.  And I\u2019ve done tensegrity in a group in reduced lighting conditions, and saw blobs of orange energy a few times.  I once saw an orange ball of energy travel between Gabrielle, Leigh, and a couple more private class members whose names I can't remember, because most of the people in private classes found it fun to come up with a new name for themselves.\n\nIt wasn't vague, it was a bright orange ball checking us out, shortly after Carlos' death.  And yet when I was encouraged to describe what I was seeing, it seemed so vague that all I could say was, \"it was nothing.\"\n\nMy recommendations:  the path in twilight is the same, but you have to get to the point of activating the second attention in order to modify it back to Zuleica's technique.\n\nTry spreading the fingers of your right hand (gently), palm down towards whatever surface you're sitting on, and wave it very slowly above a surface which has other details, like a comforter on your bed that's wrinkled up a bit.  It's the same hand sweeping motion used to find an Ally in Carlos' books.\n\nSquint until you find a spot where the dark and light of your fingers merges with dark and light from your comforter, to form a \"new thing\".  Gaze at that, maximizing the alien look.  (Note:  don't forget to feel for cobwebs, or ant crawling on your skin feelings).\n\nNow look for 2 things. An area of very deep shadow that isn\u2019t warranted by the lighting conditions. That can spread out and then you\u2019re in business.   It\u2019s still a color;  it\u2019s just jet black. In fact, that black is typically present in the purple colors you can find in total darkness.\n\nOrange and purple colors (and thus hypnogogic images) can appear in the middle of those dark blobs, because now you\u2019re back to gazing in darkness (limited in size and manufactured by yourself).\n\nThe other effect I recommend looking for is vague lines of dark and light, monotone, surrounding your hands. It\u2019s as if the brain can\u2019t figure out what that mess is, sees the lines of your fingers, and adds some more.\n\nKeep the squinting just right so that you can dare to move your hand, and then gently move it around and watch those lines light up your luminous shell, in the immediate vicinity of your stomach. It\u2019s possible (easy) to turn that into a sort of curved surface made out of lines of light.  Easy once you get to heightened awareness that is.  Not so easy if you aren't there yet.  But you have to start somewhere, and you can make up for any lack by spending more time.\n\nOnce you see that luminous shell, you\u2019ll hopefully realize something important.  Sorcerers are kind of jokesters, in addition to being tricksters.   They make up names for things that are the ultimate in simplicity, then speak about them as if it were a complicated and extremely difficult thing to understand.\n\nThat\u2019s to motivate you. If they told you, \u201cHey, this nonsense is pathetically obvious\u201d, you wouldn\u2019t practice nearly as hard.  But if it\u2019s mysterious and unfathomable, they\u2019ve got most of us hooked.  Then when it turns out to be obvious, we get a little rush of pride, for having figured it out.\n\nCookie reward!   Sorcerers aren't entirely adverse to cookies.  Or Cuban fried plantains in Carlos' case.\n\nWhat's the joke in the terms they create? \u201cInorganic being\u201d is merely a being you see (for example, has a face) that has no organic body.  \u201cSecond attention\u201d is merely something you can pay attention to, which isn\u2019t generated by our normal poor-baby-me view of the physical world.  \u201cLuminous shell\u201d is merely something shaped like a shell (curved in on itself at all sides, with details of lines and bumps, and not too thick), which is luminous.\n\nSorcerers don\u2019t make up horribly complex esoteric terms, the way Buddhism and Hinduism to.  No need to do that, since under normal conditions, there aren\u2019t any extra donations flowing from perplexing the students with specialist lingo.\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1561333470.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_erq67en", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to use eclipse goggles to gaze in twilight conditions:  I don&amp;#39;t know.

That&amp;#39;s the final stage of Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique, where the fibers attached to our stomachs sweep the floor, so we can become aware of the luminous body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was in full office lighting conditions.  And I\u2019ve done tensegrity in a group in reduced lighting conditions, and saw blobs of orange energy a few times.  I once saw an orange ball of energy travel between Gabrielle, Leigh, and a couple more private class members whose names I can&amp;#39;t remember, because most of the people in private classes found it fun to come up with a new name for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t vague, it was a bright orange ball checking us out, shortly after Carlos&amp;#39; death.  And yet when I was encouraged to describe what I was seeing, it seemed so vague that all I could say was, &amp;quot;it was nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My recommendations:  the path in twilight is the same, but you have to get to the point of activating the second attention in order to modify it back to Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try spreading the fingers of your right hand (gently), palm down towards whatever surface you&amp;#39;re sitting on, and wave it very slowly above a surface which has other details, like a comforter on your bed that&amp;#39;s wrinkled up a bit.  It&amp;#39;s the same hand sweeping motion used to find an Ally in Carlos&amp;#39; books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Squint until you find a spot where the dark and light of your fingers merges with dark and light from your comforter, to form a &amp;quot;new thing&amp;quot;.  Gaze at that, maximizing the alien look.  (Note:  don&amp;#39;t forget to feel for cobwebs, or ant crawling on your skin feelings).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now look for 2 things. An area of very deep shadow that isn\u2019t warranted by the lighting conditions. That can spread out and then you\u2019re in business.   It\u2019s still a color;  it\u2019s just jet black. In fact, that black is typically present in the purple colors you can find in total darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Orange and purple colors (and thus hypnogogic images) can appear in the middle of those dark blobs, because now you\u2019re back to gazing in darkness (limited in size and manufactured by yourself).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other effect I recommend looking for is vague lines of dark and light, monotone, surrounding your hands. It\u2019s as if the brain can\u2019t figure out what that mess is, sees the lines of your fingers, and adds some more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep the squinting just right so that you can dare to move your hand, and then gently move it around and watch those lines light up your luminous shell, in the immediate vicinity of your stomach. It\u2019s possible (easy) to turn that into a sort of curved surface made out of lines of light.  Easy once you get to heightened awareness that is.  Not so easy if you aren&amp;#39;t there yet.  But you have to start somewhere, and you can make up for any lack by spending more time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you see that luminous shell, you\u2019ll hopefully realize something important.  Sorcerers are kind of jokesters, in addition to being tricksters.   They make up names for things that are the ultimate in simplicity, then speak about them as if it were a complicated and extremely difficult thing to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s to motivate you. If they told you, \u201cHey, this nonsense is pathetically obvious\u201d, you wouldn\u2019t practice nearly as hard.  But if it\u2019s mysterious and unfathomable, they\u2019ve got most of us hooked.  Then when it turns out to be obvious, we get a little rush of pride, for having figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cookie reward!   Sorcerers aren&amp;#39;t entirely adverse to cookies.  Or Cuban fried plantains in Carlos&amp;#39; case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the joke in the terms they create? \u201cInorganic being\u201d is merely a being you see (for example, has a face) that has no organic body.  \u201cSecond attention\u201d is merely something you can pay attention to, which isn\u2019t generated by our normal poor-baby-me view of the physical world.  \u201cLuminous shell\u201d is merely something shaped like a shell (curved in on itself at all sides, with details of lines and bumps, and not too thick), which is luminous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers don\u2019t make up horribly complex esoteric terms, the way Buddhism and Hinduism to.  No need to do that, since under normal conditions, there aren\u2019t any extra donations flowing from perplexing the students with specialist lingo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c3cpns/eclipse_goggles/erq67en/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1561136117.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_c3cpns", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "es3okna", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1561567242.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_es3le8g", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That's exactly what I'm hoping for.  10 dreamers who can write useful things here, so that anyone interested in Carlos will realize, they can do it too.\n\nI can't disagree with what you said here at all, in fact it makes perfect sense.

You expect me to fall for that again?\"\n\nYour spouse isn't going to like it...\n\nOne more thing: I'd rather be looking at the \"real\" room in darkness, than a flat painted surface. That's because it's nice to believe that the little light you're seeing might correspond to something real, some deeper level of reality that's there, but you didn't see it before.  If it's painted solid black, you know it's only in your mind. That's the same as practicing dreaming; you never feel like you did anything real.  But if there's the possibility it's real, and sitting on your floor, it's more motivating.\n\nI often see little creatures made out of jet blackness, encaged in glowing lines.  After seeing my 10th, I concluded they were real beings with less energy than we have, and the glowing lines are the formation of their energy body. A cage of sorts, their luminous shell, for holding the real mass, which is very dull because it's a low energy being (inorganic being living billions of years).\nWith the painted over diving mask, I wouldn't be thinking in those terms.\n\nEdited three times to add place of no pity, inorganic beings, and a request for a little more modesty than Carlos' had.", "edited": 1561154505.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_erqqy7q", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, that&amp;#39;s cool what they&amp;#39;re trying to do with that thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe there&amp;#39;s a little correction needed on this idea of removing all light.

Then you&amp;#39;ll REALLY annoy people.  People expect to manipulate us with sadness or anger, but once you succeed in reaching no pity, you&amp;#39;ll just say, &amp;quot;Come on!  You expect me to fall for that again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your spouse isn&amp;#39;t going to like it...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One more thing: I&amp;#39;d rather be looking at the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; room in darkness, than a flat painted surface. That&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s nice to believe that the little light you&amp;#39;re seeing might correspond to something real, some deeper level of reality that&amp;#39;s there, but you didn&amp;#39;t see it before.  If it&amp;#39;s painted solid black, you know it&amp;#39;s only in your mind. That&amp;#39;s the same as practicing dreaming; you never feel like you did anything real.  But if there&amp;#39;s the possibility it&amp;#39;s real, and sitting on your floor, it&amp;#39;s more motivating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often see little creatures made out of jet blackness, encaged in glowing lines.  After seeing my 10th, I concluded they were real beings with less energy than we have, and the glowing lines are the formation of their energy body. A cage of sorts, their luminous shell, for holding the real mass, which is very dull because it&amp;#39;s a low energy being (inorganic being living billions of years).\nWith the painted over diving mask, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be thinking in those terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times to add place of no pity, inorganic beings, and a request for a little more modesty than Carlos&amp;#39; had.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_c3cpns", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c3cpns/eclipse_goggles/erqqy7q/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1561149885.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1561149885.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "erql8oa", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1561146015.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_erqd27i", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "\ud83d\ude06\n\nI think I may have a solution for the mask problem, at least the total darkness issue.

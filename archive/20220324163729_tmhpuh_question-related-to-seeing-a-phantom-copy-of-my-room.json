Focusing entirely on a task at hand.\n\nDoesn't work for the Zen people.\n\nYou could make that work, however unlikely,  but why would you restrict it to a single activity?\n\nBe silent ALL THE TIME.  You ultimately will realize you have to do that.\n\nSo you can't get out of it.\n\nAnd in the meantime, focus on whatever gets the most magic \"in your face\" to protect you from being pulled back into the river of shit.\n\n\\&gt;are really just good at being silent and devoting their entire attention to what they are doing?\n\nNone of those golfers and other such things, would believe what you can see in here.

Because you're not just doing \"darkroom gazing\".\n\nYou are \"summoning intent\".\n\nTaking a poop on the floor, might be a valid technique for that activity!\n\nNow, later on, far far out on the J curve, there are little \"tips\" that could greatly help people.\n\nI run into those all the time!\n\nBut anyone who can get over there, doesn't need them.\n\nStill, here's one that's good for just before you reach silent knowledge.\n\nAlways keep forcing silence.  If you have manifestations of floating dreams, but they're not well formed, you are at the assemblage point position needed to reach SK.\n\nAnd if you are not \"crossing over\", there are 2 possibilities.\n\nBoth of which can be \"tested\".\n\nOne possibility is that you are doing \"lazy silence\".  You can keep silent, but you aren't pushing the edge of it.\n\nImagine you cleaned your living room because you had a hot date, but when she comes she sees that you cleaned the middle part, but a walk around the walls shows it's still filthy.\n\nThe test for \"lazy silence\" is to force silence extremely hard while looking at those badly formed floating dreams.\n\nIf you don't get \"sucked into one\" fairly soon, you have lazy silence.  Your \"edges are still dirty\".  And holding you where you are, like mud.\n\nFor example, this morning I was on my 3rd session for the day, and saw a badly formed dream floating in the air.  I tried to gaze at it, and get it to become more vivid and real.\n\nI realized my efforts to force silence had gotten lazy, so I intensified them greatly.\n\nAs I watched the poorly formed dream, I thought I recognized tree branches covered in leaves.\n\nI suddenly found myself standing next to a homeless person's shopping cart filled with junk, hiding in the shade of that tree.  It was 100% real, and I was inside the dream.\n\nSo \"lazy silence\" keeps you at a distance, because the assemblage point is not loose enough to keep moving around, that far off into the irrational reaches of the second attention.\n\nThen there's \"misfocusing\" the attention.\n\nWe really are NOT trying to be silent.\n\nAs odd as that sounds.\n\nWe are trying to control where we focus our attention.\n\nThe internal dialogue \"mis-focuses\" it, and not under our control.\n\nSo do your best on silence, gaze at the darkness, which hopefully has some of that fog you saw.\n\nThen find any \"change\" in the smoothness, and focus ALL of your attention on it.\n\nIt should feel like a \"thing\" if you are that far out in the orange zone.\n\nWhen you \"move towards\" where you are focusing your attention, like it was a rubber band pulling on you, then back off, so you move back to where you were.\n\nIt's like \"pushing and pulling\" on the inorganic beings in their world.\n\nBut using your attention, on something you find in the darkness.\n\nCould be just 2 dim bubbles, barely there.\n\nUse your \"attention\" to pull and push on the things you see, then drop it, and find another.\n\nKeep practicing \"focusing your attention\".\n\nA very specific \"thing\" will happen, but best I don't tell anyone,  or trying to look for that will prevent it.\n\n\\&gt;I've been doing the practice in a dark closet and so unable to move.\n\nThat's not a bad thing for the group overall, if you got good at that.\n\nYou could create a \"specialty branch\" of dark room.\n\nDark closet.\n\nWhere \"creepiness\" is the goal and darkroom gazing just the means.\n\nOne day, we'll have dozens of \"specialists\".", "edited": 1648318829.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i27x2yb", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to be 3-5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s good news!

Focusing entirely on a task at hand. If not, then does that mean that all the athletes (Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Roger Federer) or musicians who are at the top of their profession are really just good at being silent and devoting their entire attention to what they are doing? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it seems that they can only do that with the one skill and are just as ordinary at everything else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When someone reports an experience and I&amp;#39;ve never heard them complain how awful it is to try to get silent, that is almost surely an indication they aren&amp;#39;t actually following darkroom procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do think it&amp;#39;s extremely frustrating. I do notice that after being in the dark for half an hour or so I start seeing very very light fog like movement that&amp;#39;s barely visible that keeps repeating. And, just like in typing, if a thought comes to my mind (like oh I wonder what this is and I&amp;#39;ll ask Dan about it), it disappears before I start focusing on being silent again and not getting carried away with letting my imagination run wild. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I find myself not directly looking at the darkness but almost viewing everything slightly cross eyed. Is that expected or should I be focussing directly into the darkness while forcing silence? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you combined what you are doing with tensegrity, you could see the start of the red zone, by watching for &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot;, and then you can &amp;quot;scoop a puff and place it on a pouch&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&amp;#39;ve been doing the practice in a dark closet and so unable to move. But, i did end up buying the dark mask that Techno suggested. So, I&amp;#39;ll try that out as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the pointers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_tmhpuh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tmhpuh/question_related_to_seeing_a_phantom_copy_of_my/i24zqer/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1648256023.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1648256023.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i1zh5x1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i1z4955", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Forcing silence means, not a single word can enter your thoughts.\n\nBut some beginners can't see if that's true or not.

In such cases it seems to me that to some degree we have forgotten about ourselves, we are not talking to ourselves or fantasising (as far as I\u2019ve been aware), and for the most part there is no internal imagery.\n\n&gt;Would total undivided focus/attention to the task at hand at least be a taste, an inkling, of what I should be doing to FORCE INNER SILENCE (cut off the internal dialogue) while practicing DRG? So, not strictly FORCING, but the INNER SILENCE comes indirectly by focussing on the task?\n\nu/danl999 - No. That's a buddhist delusion. Designed to turn followers into zombies.\n\n**Inner silence means, sleep walking**. **The precise opposite of \"be here now\".**\n\nHowever, once you have real magic \"in your face\", focusing entirely on that will shift the assemblage point. Either down the middle if you look for even better magic to come from it, or horizontally if you \"treat it as real\", in which case things can get very bizarre. horizontal shifts are fun, but they come with increasing lack of sobriety. Sobriety seems to require being relatively in the middle of Man's band. At least, at first.\n\n&gt;I haven't been consistent at all, so no it's been hard as hell to get 'silent' lmao, or even something approximating silence. Dan is right, I need to find a better motivation in order to keep doing this, other than being miserable in the river of shit. Other people are miserable too, and they don't become sorcerers. Maybe I just need to be stronger. I try not to comment too much because I know I'm a bad player lmao, but holy shit this is tough.\n\nu/danl999 - yes, but even Buddhists and Yogis admit that if you get rid of the internal dialogue, you are \"enlightened\".\n\nSo you'll reach the level they claim is some kind of ultimate, and even more fully than they do, since they never end up seeing the kind of magic we do. Which means, they barely got silent at all.\n\nI suppose without the \"endorsements\" from a Buddhist master, people aren't as interested in being \"enlightened\"? But if you check, you'll see many westernized Buddhists admitting if you can get rid of the internal dialogue, you've done all they pretend to do. Odd that they believe they fully got rid of it, but it's impossible to hold an honest conversation with them. They know it's fake, so they've very defensive. I suppose they think it's real, but they're lacking. And believe if they just keep pretending it's the ultimate, they'll catch up with whoever they believe really did achieve what their system pretends to do.\n\nWish I had an honest Buddhist master to question. But there aren't any. Even Shinzen's head explodes if you question what he's doing .I can't imagine what Ingram would do, but I don't want to find out. At least he's got some beginner's magic going on. He's a valuable asset to us, because we can monitor if anyone is capable of finding their way out of the green and red zones, without precisely following the path of the old seers. My inclination is to believe that's not possible.

In such cases it seems to me that to some degree we have forgotten about ourselves, we are not talking to ourselves or fantasising (as far as I\u2019ve been aware), and for the most part there is no internal imagery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would total undivided focus/attention to the task at hand at least be a taste, an inkling, of what I should be doing to FORCE INNER SILENCE (cut off the internal dialogue) while practicing DRG? So, not strictly FORCING, but the INNER SILENCE comes indirectly by focussing on the task?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/danl999\"&gt;u/danl999&lt;/a&gt; - No. That&amp;#39;s a buddhist delusion. Designed to turn followers into zombies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner silence means, sleep walking&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;The precise opposite of &amp;quot;be here now&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, once you have real magic &amp;quot;in your face&amp;quot;, focusing entirely on that will shift the assemblage point. Either down the middle if you look for even better magic to come from it, or horizontally if you &amp;quot;treat it as real&amp;quot;, in which case things can get very bizarre. horizontal shifts are fun, but they come with increasing lack of sobriety. Sobriety seems to require being relatively in the middle of Man&amp;#39;s band. At least, at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been consistent at all, so no it&amp;#39;s been hard as hell to get &amp;#39;silent&amp;#39; lmao, or even something approximating silence. Dan is right, I need to find a better motivation in order to keep doing this, other than being miserable in the river of shit. Other people are miserable too, and they don&amp;#39;t become sorcerers. Maybe I just need to be stronger. I try not to comment too much because I know I&amp;#39;m a bad player lmao, but holy shit this is tough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/danl999\"&gt;u/danl999&lt;/a&gt; - yes, but even Buddhists and Yogis admit that if you get rid of the internal dialogue, you are &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ll reach the level they claim is some kind of ultimate, and even more fully than they do, since they never end up seeing the kind of magic we do. Which means, they barely got silent at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose without the &amp;quot;endorsements&amp;quot; from a Buddhist master, people aren&amp;#39;t as interested in being &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot;? But if you check, you&amp;#39;ll see many westernized Buddhists admitting if you can get rid of the internal dialogue, you&amp;#39;ve done all they pretend to do. Odd that they believe they fully got rid of it, but it&amp;#39;s impossible to hold an honest conversation with them. They know it&amp;#39;s fake, so they&amp;#39;ve very defensive. I suppose they think it&amp;#39;s real, but they&amp;#39;re lacking. And believe if they just keep pretending it&amp;#39;s the ultimate, they&amp;#39;ll catch up with whoever they believe really did achieve what their system pretends to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wish I had an honest Buddhist master to question. But there aren&amp;#39;t any. Even Shinzen&amp;#39;s head explodes if you question what he&amp;#39;s doing .I can&amp;#39;t imagine what Ingram would do, but I don&amp;#39;t want to find out. At least he&amp;#39;s got some beginner&amp;#39;s magic going on.

But still, out of ignorance they try to claim Carlos stole from them.\n\nEven though the results don't match what they're going on about at all.\n\nSo they're full of it.\n\nBut they're green zone obsessed and anytime they smell something that wreaks of green zone activities, they try to claim it.   Even when it's lame closed eye nonsense.\n\nAnd the western world lets them get away with it. That's not always true in Asia, but even that simple knowledge isn't present in the west. They believe the Buddhist church is admired in Asia.\n\nWhen that's only true in highly religious countries like Thailand.\n\nI won't go into the details, but  in Burma for example that church has a far different and very sinister reputation.  More like what we blame the catholic church for, but 10 times more frequent.\n\nWesternized Buddhists are ignorant of what they signed up for, and go around claiming anything they can to make up for the absolute lack of what they were promised.\n\nWe see it in our bad players who make up stuff to compensate for not having real magic to look forward to.\n\nYou stop being  like that, when you have the real thing.\n\nLike this desperate attempt by Buddhists to claim Star Wars.\n\nI saw it on several web pages.

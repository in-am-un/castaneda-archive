Sometimes, the story is just to motivate, and not actually true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story being that poor Genaro lost Ixlan as a result of &amp;quot;spinning with the Ally&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way it&amp;#39;s described, you can see a little tear form at the edge of his eye, as he tells Carlos he&amp;#39;s still looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge makes you almost godlike!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way you&amp;#39;d long for the river of shit you lived in before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More likely is, you&amp;#39;d see the horrors you lived, in Ixtlan. And be amazed you managed to escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you don&amp;#39;t need to &amp;quot;spin&amp;quot; with the ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can just give them a stern lecture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Works the same!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, that wasn&amp;#39;t even don Genaro telling that tale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was his double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The books are not a &amp;quot;bible&amp;quot;, and should never be read that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evaluate whether something is applicable to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And make sure it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; superstitions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also make sure you aren&amp;#39;t trying to do something specific, to get out of learning to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s usually book deal thinking!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose putting a good effort into recap is as good as learning silence, but you&amp;#39;ll be at HUGE RISK of giving up before you see enough to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life will pull you back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you make up your mind to learn, I&amp;#39;d say you have 6 months tops before you&amp;#39;d better start seeing real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you&amp;#39;ll burn out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, NO ONE did recap as their only path to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They would all have quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They did so much recap, because they had an entire lineage of sorcerers showing them mind boggling magic outside the recapitulation booth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They actually did recap to get more dreaming energy.  To use when journeying under someone else&amp;#39;s power, such as Emilito.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a community, our leaders have fallen into giving the impression recapitulation is all there is to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should add, what&amp;#39;s the point of the second usher event?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t make that happen!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just mental masturbation to think about it as if it were important to any of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ynzji8/confused_about_the_usher_event_upon_recapitulating/ivblxz4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1667763850.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ynzji8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ivblg1n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1667763658.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ynzji8", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "You can't force The Usher memory. \n\nJust keep on recapping, and if it happens for us rogue agents, it will...of it's own accord.", "edited": 1667767116.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ivblg1n", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t force The Usher memory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep on recapping, and if it happens for us rogue agents, it will...of it&amp;#39;s own accord.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ynzji8/confused_about_the_usher_event_upon_recapitulating/ivblg1n/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1667763658.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ynzji8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}]

But you have no choice.  Some cannibals are hot on  your tail. And you're clutching a huge bag of their priceless pink diamonds.\n\nWhat do you suppose will happen if you get out a picture of your little girl to kiss as you jump,  worry what will happen if you die and you wife is stuck paying the mortgage, and as you jump you glance over to the little pagan native temple on this side of the cliff, and pray to the virgin Mary?\n\nMeanwhile it occurs to you, that if you make the leap you can finally finish that book and become famous!\n\nI have no idea.  But certainly that's a lot easier than pulling open a curtain in reality, so you can travel to another realm using energy borrowed from inorganic beings.\n\nIn the second case, you're trying to alter the very reality in which you reside.\n\nAnd the problem with that is, reality is created from where you focus your attention.\n\nNormally our attention is so used up, that statement seems crazy.\n\nBut when you learn to be silent, you slowly learn that can be changed.\n\nAnd if your attention truly focuses somewhere else, the whole situation in which you reside has to \"rescan\" to adjust for it.\n\nThat of course is best learned in a darkroom, where there are many fewer distractions.  But it applies to any situation.\n\nThe \"distractions\" are magnets which pull on  your attention.\n\nIf you could get rid of all of those, there would be only your own attention to worry about.\n\nThat's a little hard to understand for a beginner, so let's use the analogy of 4 gates dreaming.\n\nAt the first gate, you just need to learn how to retain lucidity, and keep the dream going as long as possible. Typically at first, 30 seconds of good lucidity would be a HUGE achievement.\n\nWhen you learn to stay in there, one trick you'll surely pick up is that a \"dream change\" resets the time you have left.  It's like an \"extra life\".\n\nBut the inorganic being scouts in your dream quickly learn how you tend to escape them with dream changes,  and decide to hunt you down the instant they detect you.\n\nAnd hold you on the ground so that you can't do your usual dream change technique. Such as leap into a painting.\n\nYou can't possibly outrun them, so you learn to gaze at the top of a distant mountain, and \"zip\" over to it.\n\nThe key there, is to focus ALL of your attention on the mountain, to force the dream to \"rescan\".\n\nIf you glance to the side as you try that, even a tiny bit, your attention is divided, and the mountain top won't pull you over.\n\nBut you learn, you need at least 15 seconds to do that. It takes a while to let go of everything, even in a dream, and gaze with the intensity needed.\n\nIf you have less than 15 seconds, one of the scouts will reach out and grab the back of your shirt.\n\nYour attention is thus divided, and the mountain will not pull you over.\n\nEventually you learn how to \"withdraw\"  your attention from the scouts hand pulling on your back, and the mountain can pull you.  You don't have any \"anchors\" to overcome.\n\nOf course, the scout will love that.  They like zipping around as much as the next phantom.\n\nSo as it turns out, that's one of the easiest ways to visit their world.\n\nWith their help.\n\nBut still, inside a dream it's all about where your attention is focused, and how well you can drop any distractions which would focus it elsewhere.\n\nIn the darkroom, when you want to leave it, the same is true.\n\nYou have to remove your \"anchors\" to the real world.\n\nAnd you do in fact need an IOB around somewhere.  Or at least, I have yet to fully leave the darkroom, if I haven't been charged up by an IOB.\n\nOr Cholita.\n\nBut what has this to do with that picture?\n\nAnything you are clinging to in that picture, is an \"anchor\" to this reality.\n\nEven with the help of an IOB, you won't be going anywhere while you are tied to the dock.\n\nIf you're the type who says,  \"I can respect that Buddha guy. And I can respect Astral Travel. And what's wrong with hanging out with like minded people, who also want to learn magic?\"\n\nThe only place you'll be going, is where you already are.\n\nWhere your attention is entirely consumed.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Where the Attention Focuses is the key to Travel", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"8looto0lp8j81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8looto0lp8j81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=653716d682178e3a11d5cd4d7524ebd1afee452d"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8looto0lp8j81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bed5ca2f3835592786af8d826e088c0f6d15e4f"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8looto0lp8j81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb6fdfe8a059c87667557f6fdbe100b7bcd2030b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8looto0lp8j81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2b6a15e133c83f6614cc64c58b460199f7a43df"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8looto0lp8j81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0398dacac49ab9a7c6e4a91097313c1cdf29399a"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8looto0lp8j81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ff7d3bf5b7e3992ac46ef6b9dd3f9d855fdf895"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8looto0lp8j81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48302df46b795c7f2d6c9dfeabfc38e92e904a81"}, "id": "8looto0lp8j81"}}, "name": "t3_sy32mm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mTHKB2fIP6KabWGxvWoo07Ll089JuIGY8DfenxMUCks.jpg", "edited": 1645475913.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1645474201.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8looto0lp8j81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=48302df46b795c7f2d6c9dfeabfc38e92e904a81\"&gt;Please tell me none of you are still drinking out of the toilet?

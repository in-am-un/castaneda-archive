I was using that purple lens thing you see, noticed the red line on the J curve was now a dirt path, and got the weird idea you could dig up a new animal form for yourself.\n\nFancy didn't set me straight. In fact, she supervised the digging.\n\nTook me until this morning to remember it.  I went back to the red zone, Fancy was doing funny faces, and then I remembered those pillars of grey smoke.\n\nAnd the dirt path...\n\nSo there it is: \"The Quagmire\".\n\nDoes it really look that scary?\n\nNow, normally I like to make the intensity and realness of the images accurate, so beginners know what to look for.\n\nEverything there is ok, except for the dirt path.\n\nI want to say, that was around half as bright.\n\nBut when I try to say it, it seems  untrue.\n\nSort of like, if you turned to glance to the right and looked at a beach, you'd describe one level of brightness.\n\nBut then if you turned on your seat to face it directly, you'd realize it was a little brighter than you thought.\n\nAnd if you walked into the scene, even brighter.\n\nSo how bright that dirt road is, depends on how I remember it.\n\nThat's not to say that most of the time, Fancy is just a very vague little head, barely recognizable as a head.\n\nI have to \"greet her\", to get her to become solid enough not to be an imaginary thing.\n\nAnd that's her normal state.\n\nBut you can't think about it like that.\n\nAt any given depth on the J curve, an inorganic being manifestation will have a certain level of \"brightness\", or \"realness\".\n\nTransparency is usually the problem for me.  How transparent is she?\n\nCan you see on the other side?\n\nYes?\n\nWait a minute...  The room is pitch black!\n\nThat's the problem with judging what's going on in the darkroom.  Stuff starts to be all wrong.  Like, you can see an entire room, with all the details a room has when the lights are on.\n\nBut you're ignoring it.  And probably it's not your room.\n\nYou just stop caring about details like that, and are happy to have any magic that comes along.\n\nIt's how much you shifted horizontally that causes that confusion.  And you can't overpower the kind of confusion that comes from a shifted assemblage point.\n\nNot to mention, it's dark here.  You made that dark room yourself, so of course it's dark.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's dark \"over there\".\n\n\"Over there\" comes into existence eventually, if you keep doing darkroom.\n\nAs I recall, don Juan even made a point of saying if it was day here, it was night there.\n\nI don't think we can take that as universal, but he said that for a reason.\n\nAnd if you pay close attention in the dark room, you might notice that's indeed true at times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Strange Thing

So it can work.\n\n\\&gt; What exactly is that? \n\nWe'll never know.\n\nCertainly something about what you saw, had the right emanations to be reskimmed, and turned into the thing you saw.\n\nDon't make the mistake of thinking it all comes from you.  Inside your head.\n\nIn fact, it likely NEVER comes from there.\n\nWhat's in there, comes from the same place outside, that the little man in the balloon came from.\n\nThis is hard to understand until you see it.\n\nBut NOTHING we see makes any sense at all.\n\nBut the level of silence needed to perceive that, is the same level needed to perceive \"The Nagual\" directly.\n\n\\&gt; What about things like making to-do's and forming a plan on what needs to be done?\n\nYou can't \"talk\" an idea into existence!  Rather, you delay it.\n\nThe talking is only to help you remember the idea, after it pops into your mind.\n\nIf you're silent, more will pop in.  That's what silent knowledge is.\n\nWe just get a very poor flow of that, due to all of our thinking. We keep \"changing the topic\" before the lizards have answered the question.\n\nImagine the absurdity of thinking to yourself continuously during the lizard magic, where they answer a question you had.\n\nAnd then later, you congratulate yourself for talking that into existence, in your mind.\n\nYou didn't!  If anything, you risked having the lizards pick up a new question, and stop answering the old one.\n\n\\&gt; Are you writing in C or C++? \n\nI used those maybe 30 years ago.\n\nI've written in many languages.\n\nBut I wouldn't write hardware code in C!  \n\nIt would be pointless.

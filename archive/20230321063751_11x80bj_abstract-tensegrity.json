Don't doubt it.\n\nThat's actually an understatement!\n\nAnd when it shows up there's you, and \"you over there\".  \"Over there\" is when your awareness merges a bit with his, and you have a waking dream inside him. Somehow smoothly moving \"over there\".\n\nBut why doesn't your tonal fall over to the ground, if you \"switch\" over to perceiving where he's located across the room?  Didn't you kind of \"fall asleep\", even if you are still awake?\n\nBeats me.\n\nBut it doesn't.  Wouldn't it be the same as la Gorda opening that sliding door in reality, so she and Carlos could escape the allies?  But then later they find out they're back in the room where they started?\n\nThat is in fact in the realm of what makes sorcery work so well.\n\n\"Beats me\".  The realization that you can't explain some things, and shouldn't even try.  An \"explanation\" of something impossible which happens,  is just an attempt to repair damage to the blue line reality we're usually living in.\n\nThat in itself is something you have to embrace.  Allowing things to be impossible.\n\nA good \"beats me\" mystery is as exciting as brilliant puffs being molded into actual objects down in the red zone.\n\nSo here you are in your tonal.  Here.\n\nThen you switch over to your double. There.\n\nAnd between the here and the there, as Carlos explained, \"the abstract becomes visible\".\n\nI haven't seen that directly yet.  Keep in mind, a clear switch from tonal to energy body, is a gigantic victory.\n\nA \"clear\" one I said.  Accidental ones or ones you can't remember at  all, are likely common.\n\nSo it's not like we're going to master that overnight.  A conscious full on switch from tonal body, to energy body.\n\nAnyone confused about \"energy body\" versus double, don't be. They're the same.  The double is just the energy body when it wants to \"look cool and fit in\".\n\nOf this type of crazy magic, at first, all you'll get is \"previews\".\n\nExcept the women.\n\nNo one can put a limit on what they could do, before they ever even practiced doing it.\n\nDarned witches...  They make male bragging fruitless.\n\nIt reminds me of a bible story.\n\nA woman goes and kills a huge enemy of Israel, perhaps a rival king or his evil sorcerer priest.  I can't remember now.  There was possibly some symbolic serpent worship involved.\n\nShe kills him by herself.\n\nShe returns home to see the male warriors of her tribe bragging down at the river about their petty victories battling that king's forces.\n\nAs I recall she cuts them some slack and doesn't mention that she just killed that leader.\n\nAnyway, I guess I've got nothing to brag about in this anyway.  I've never \"looked\" between the here, and the there.  As far as traveling from my tonal, into the double.\n\nTo see if there's perhaps some sparkling or bubbling chaos in multiple colors.\n\nWhich can't be described.\n\nThat's what a short glimpse of the abstract is kind of like, if you can remember it at all.\n\nBut I have seen that in other circumstances.\n\nIt starts to happen more often all by itself once you pass that level of having your double visibly in your room with you.  Meaning, the first one time event changes the course of things, from time to time.\n\nIt's like you got exposed just once to the abstract, and now it's full uncovering is inevitable.\n\nYou don't have to have the double come sit on the end of your bed, in your full view.\n\nWhich it absolutely can.  Mine even pretends to be someone else once in a while.\n\nDon't worry about looking eye to eye.  Your double won't let that happen\n\nHe's always facing away or behind you, so you can't look at his face.\n\nBesides... How silly.  It's also a \"blue ball of energy\".\n\nI have my doubts about the Star Trek style antimatter explosion annihilating the universe, if you gaze into the double's eyes.\n\nWhich he actually doesn't have.\n\nBut... Out of safety of course, avoid it.\n\nRemember when Don Juan and Genaro leaped on Carlos, because he was about to turn around and his double was there.\n\nEven in that story from the books, the double knew where to hang out for safety.\n\nBut he doesn't have to get that close to count as a \"there\".\n\nHe could be in another galaxy, and you could still visibly see him\n\nIt'll still work to have seen the here, and the there of wherever he is, if you remote view him in a dream bubble in the air.\n\nA dream bubble is just 1 second plus a 1 second blank out and wake up, from wherever it leads.\n\nYou'll get a glimpse of the abstract that way too. Maybe it's why you blank out in the first place, leaping into dream bubbles.\n\nNow, an inorganic being can trap you in the abstract!\n\nAnd you forget any purpose you might normally have, on finding yourself in such an unusual magical situation.\n\nYou only focus on whatever \"concern\" they put into your mind, which keeps your attention focused on the indescribable abstract.\n\nIf you escape a tiny bit you'll try, now in your tonal alone and not in your double, to remember what just happened.\n\nAnd some visible representation of it will come into mind.  Like remembering a vague dream after you wake up from it.\n\nBut that's the trick the IOB uses!   Curiosity.\n\nThat's how it traps you.\n\nIt pushes you into the abstract, you're stuck over some \"concern\" such as \"how many of those abstract objects are there, and are any missing?\"\n\nWhen you realize you've been stuck counting objects a long time and manage to push your way out,  your curiosity creates an image in your mind of what was going on.\n\nIncluding the IOB pinning you down to suck energy out of you.\n\nAnd that curiosity sucks you back in, because you \"visualized\" the situation.\n\nEach loop makes the scene stronger, until you'll have a vivid dreaming image of it.\n\nSuch as, your IOB as a beautiful woman sitting on the bed next to you, pressing down on your chest with pillows.  Except she brought her boyfriend along, and he's sitting at your feet.\n\nBut at that point you get such a clear vision of it, you are now supercharged with their dark energy, and can simply \"wake up\".  Escape the abstract.\n\nIn my case once, I had been counting pastel painted clay pitchers.  Blue, yellow, and pink I believe.  I kept counting to make sure there were 3, and no one had taken any.  There's a post with picture somewhere in here.\n\nAs a group, we get to see that all of the random crazy stuff we encounter, does in fact come back and turn out to be part of a real path to sorcery.\n\nUnless you made it up, or \"visualized\" it yourself.  Then, it's not real and won't come up again.\n\nBut I don't believe the IOBs control that part of one's reaction to the obsession they give you.\n\nThe counting.\n\nBecause Cholita pushed me into the abstract by herself.  And trust me, it was very bizarre when she did it.\n\nShe did it on purpose.\n\nI also ended up counting things.\n\nBut very, very, slowly.  And I was enjoying it.\n\nPerhaps because there was no inorganic being sucking up energy.\n\nSo I just enjoyed the experience in the abstract, aware it was a strange gift from Cholita.\n\nAnd maybe the counting part, was just all the \"reason\" I could muster, while gazing at something abstract.\n\nIf you think about it, one of the most basic uses of tribal human reasoning is, \"Do I still have 10 mangoes, or did that awful woman grab some again for her new lover?\"\n\nSo in the abstract, maybe it's still possible to use that type of logic and reasoning.\n\nCounting.\n\nI even realized I was in the abstract from Cholita's spell, as I gazed closely at the abstract objects I was counting.\n\nInstead of having a slightly scary realization, popping out, then being sucked me back into the abstract by visualizing some representation of what was going on.\n\nI just enjoyed it myself, for around 90 minutes.  A very different type of experience in the abstract.\n\nSame length of time perhaps, as the average IOB attack.\n\nAs an analogy, you have to go to the DMV.  You go to \"Whittier\" office, which is filled with a bunch of ragged people sitting next to you.\n\nSome real characters for sure!\n\nBut not all that pleasant to look at. And you're stuck waiting there an hour before you are called to do what you need to do there.  It seems like a very long hour.\n\nOr you go to the office in the wealthy area, and are surrounded by hot milfs all decked out hoping some guy comes over to start up a conversation.  It's like a visit to Whole Foods, without the shopping carts.\n\nEntirely different experience!\n\nThe hour seems to end far too fast.\n\nI like to describe being in the abstract from inorganic beings placing you there, as being \"waterboarded\".\n\nBut on some kind of prescription \"chill pill\".\n\nSo that you don't really care you're being waterboarded.\n\nExcept that it feels like you're being drained of energy in some odd way and ought to put a stop to it.\n\nNow here's the hard part to describe.\n\nImaging being sucked into that kind of \"abstract trap\", but while doing the tensegrity forms.\n\nIt's far past the puffs!  Far past the whitish light too.\n\nThe puffs perhaps, just maybe, have formed that blue ball of energy around your tonal, so that you are doing the tensegrity inside a bubble made of your double.\n\nWhen your hand sweeps across the air, your double's hand does too.\n\nBut it's a very odd hand.  It doesn't need to take a concrete form.\n\nIt can simply \"feel\" that it swept the same as your tonal.  Like an echo.\n\nImagine a little girl watching you rub your hand on a smooth object.\n\nThen after you leave, she wants to rub her hand on it too, to see why you were interested in that.\n\nThe result is an \"echo\" of your tensegrity  movements, centered on \"feeling\" instead of sight or form.\n\nAnd your double \"drags\" solidity to form and emerge into the air.\n\nTrailing your hand.\n\nIt's a little like your tonal hand \"disturbs\" a region of space, and solid objects bubble up in it.\n\nIf the tensegrity form turns on itself in space, you can almost feel that you collided with some objects you made before.\n\nBut that's impossible!\n\nSo your mind tries to make a visual image.  To \"explain\" what you just experienced.\n\nAnd your curiosity sucks you back into it.\n\nYou either cling to the tensegrity at this point, as the only reference you can have for such a confusing thing as the abstract, or you do as I do.\n\nI go \"off course\" with the tensegrity.\n\nJust go \"free form\".  I'm so fascinated with how my hand can create an echo which is producing objects, that I stop to play with that.\n\nI suppose this is why Zuleica told Taisha it was ok to modify the forms. So that if you noticed something, you'd feel free to explore it.\n\nAnd not beat yourself over the head when you realize the abstract pushed you out of following the form's prescribed movements.\n\nSo you're experiencing the same thing that happens when an IOB or a witch pushes you into the abstract.\n\nYou go back and forth from being rational, to being in some weird world of objects which can't be described.\n\nYou could even say that your movements crystalize the second attention fog, but with roundish colorful objects the size of an orange.  All around.\n\nYou're doing tensegrity in a children's \"ball pit\".\n\nKind of.\n\nSubmerged over your head.\n\nSo that tensegrity can be done in the puffs, it can be done in silent knowledge, which means inside phantom realms, but it can also be done in the abstract.\n\nWhich activates the sense of touch fully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Abstract Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"sd3bcss811pa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02efa20f085e870e99cdf408e70bc2ca81027761"}, {"y": 120, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=938d0b882dd994357831ac052c699072a1187c4c"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ede8feaccc26c598f9389eaf14ed4da9bf97e3b"}, {"y": 358, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fb10ee957e32709c207b5e2e026f601ed592d08"}, {"y": 537, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae7980a28b763760fb516cce64a776cd12fa7bc8"}, {"y": 604, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8759040aa01a45e5b6c8f714fbdee73d14215c21"}], "s": {"y": 1146, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c15e6e749c1271e82d22da7154f337387e557541"}, "id": "sd3bcss811pa1"}}, "name": "t3_11x80bj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/pWDvdB2aQ1Q7jJ4JfxcRMCgkMxnRYndCHJSk7eVKlCw.jpg", "edited": 1679409233.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1679377071.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c15e6e749c1271e82d22da7154f337387e557541\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/sd3bcss811pa1.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c15e6e749c1271e82d22da7154f337387e557541&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract is still a big mystery to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Silent Knowledge and/or Readers of Infinity publications, Carlos explains how as the assemblage point moves, the double becomes visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sure does!!!

And I was enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because there was no inorganic being sucking up energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just enjoyed the experience in the abstract, aware it was a strange gift from Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe the counting part, was just all the &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; I could muster, while gazing at something abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, one of the most basic uses of tribal human reasoning is, &amp;quot;Do I still have 10 mangoes, or did that awful woman grab some again for her new lover?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the abstract, maybe it&amp;#39;s still possible to use that type of logic and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Counting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even realized I was in the abstract from Cholita&amp;#39;s spell, as I gazed closely at the abstract objects I was counting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of having a slightly scary realization, popping out, then being sucked me back into the abstract by visualizing some representation of what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just enjoyed it myself, for around 90 minutes.  A very different type of experience in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same length of time perhaps, as the average IOB attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an analogy, you have to go to the DMV.  You go to &amp;quot;Whittier&amp;quot; office, which is filled with a bunch of ragged people sitting next to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some real characters for sure!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not all that pleasant to look at. And you&amp;#39;re stuck waiting there an hour before you are called to do what you need to do there.  It seems like a very long hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you go to the office in the wealthy area, and are surrounded by hot milfs all decked out hoping some guy comes over to start up a conversation.  It&amp;#39;s like a visit to Whole Foods, without the shopping carts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Entirely different experience!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hour seems to end far too fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to describe being in the abstract from inorganic beings placing you there, as being &amp;quot;waterboarded&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on some kind of prescription &amp;quot;chill pill&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you don&amp;#39;t really care you&amp;#39;re being waterboarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that it feels like you&amp;#39;re being drained of energy in some odd way and ought to put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s the hard part to describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imaging being sucked into that kind of &amp;quot;abstract trap&amp;quot;, but while doing the tensegrity forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s far past the puffs!  Far past the whitish light too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs perhaps, just maybe, have formed that blue ball of energy around your tonal, so that you are doing the tensegrity inside a bubble made of your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your hand sweeps across the air, your double&amp;#39;s hand does too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a very odd hand.  It doesn&amp;#39;t need to take a concrete form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can simply &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; that it swept the same as your tonal.  Like an echo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a little girl watching you rub your hand on a smooth object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then after you leave, she wants to rub her hand on it too, to see why you were interested in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result is an &amp;quot;echo&amp;quot; of your tensegrity  movements, centered on &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; instead of sight or form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And your double &amp;quot;drags&amp;quot; solidity to form and emerge into the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trailing your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a little like your tonal hand &amp;quot;disturbs&amp;quot; a region of space, and solid objects bubble up in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the tensegrity form turns on itself in space, you can almost feel that you collided with some objects you made before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s impossible!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your mind tries to make a visual image.  To &amp;quot;explain&amp;quot; what you just experienced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And your curiosity sucks you back into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You either cling to the tensegrity at this point, as the only reference you can have for such a confusing thing as the abstract, or you do as I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go &amp;quot;off course&amp;quot; with the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just go &amp;quot;free form&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;m so fascinated with how my hand can create an echo which is producing objects, that I stop to play with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose this is why Zuleica told Taisha it was ok to modify the forms. So that if you noticed something, you&amp;#39;d feel free to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not beat yourself over the head when you realize the abstract pushed you out of following the form&amp;#39;s prescribed movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re experiencing the same thing that happens when an IOB or a witch pushes you into the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You go back and forth from being rational, to being in some weird world of objects which can&amp;#39;t be described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could even say that your movements crystalize the second attention fog, but with roundish colorful objects the size of an orange.  All around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re doing tensegrity in a children&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;ball pit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Submerged over your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that tensegrity can be done in the puffs, it can be done in silent knowledge, which means inside phantom realms, but it can also be done in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which activates the sense of touch fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,

When you're a young man and you find sorcery, there are a couple of 'Holy Grails' you secretly hope to achieve, at least for me.  \n\nLet me name some, see if they ring a bell with you too:\n\n1) Fuck anyone you want in dreaming.  As Dan says, yes, you can indeed do this.  You can have sex with an IOB and you can certainly intend them to look like what/who you want.  Honestly, it's disturbing how quickly I found myself tryign to fuck dream characters when I first started out practicing dreaming/lucid dreaming.  Really shows you something about your 'core' personae when society isn't there to hold you in check, doesn't it? \n\n2) Increase personal attractiveness.  See: regrowing lost hair.  But also, lean muscle, 'wet/illuminated' eyes, etc. etc.  \n\n3)  Reverse disease like cancer.\n\n4) Remote view and spy on ex-girlfriends or anyone, for that matter.\n\n5) Enter other people's dreams to manipulate their subconcious.\n\n6)  And of course, the holiest of holies:  cheat death.\n\nAnd my conclusions?\n\n**If you are in the sorcery world for any of the above reasons, move on.  They are all the wrong reasons, and intent will avoid you like the plague.  We study for one reason: to polish our connection with intent, and ultimately, to  learn mastery of intent.** \n\nWhen you refer to Julian's AP being shifted to avoid death, you are into some seriously deep and specific aspects of DJ's sorcery party, and unless you or me or someone else was there, we can't know specifically what that was referring to.  Might you be able to shift an AP to lower blood pressure so blood slows down and you delay someone who has been shot from bleeding out?  Maybe.  Who knows.  Who wants to find out?  \n\nBut we know you won't be able to reverse disease, or reverse aging, just through intent. Again, the Nagual himself couldn't.  Carlos passed from cancer.  Yes, as another comment  pointed out, you can certainly reduce your stress and cortisol levels and reap the benefits, but that's not really what you are asking is it? \n\nYou're asking, if you can use magic, to evade death.\n\nThe short answer is a hard no, full stop.  I say this so you start off on the path with the right footing, early on.  Don't have visions of grandeur of curing your own cancer, regrowing your own hair, and cheating your own death.\n\nDo you remember DJ talking about how some of the old sorcerers had such mastery over intent, they could essentially do anything they wanted, and so they wound up doing nothing? \n\nThat, to me, is sorta the goal.  When you want nothing from intent, that's when she comes.  When you have no hidden agendas, that's when you \"Level up\".  You can take my word for it, or find out the hard way.  If what you are after is Magick with a k, this isn't the place.  Go read Crowley or some shit like that.  And you'll wind up just like those guys, chanting to red candles for your hair to grow back and to have sex power.  \n\nThat's not real magic.\n\nAs Dan has said over and over, this is the only place where you can learn actual magic - the mastery of intent, and what that means.  I looked for 10 years in my 20s and for decades ever since, and nothing, NOT A SINGLE COGNITIVE SYSTEM, anywhere, will give the the ability to reverse aging, cure your own diseases, and beat death. \n\nOne caveat: the fire from within.  It's not the \"cheating\" of death that we've been talking about here.  You don't live in your mortal body forever.  But I do believe it may be possible (if you don't know what TFFW is, you can check wiki or read that book).  I believe yes, you might be able to retain your awareness just as your physical body succumbs.  But that's only my belief, obviously.  How would we truly know?  \n\nEverything else I know to be true about sorcery I have personally verified:  the dreaming gates, shape-shifting, meeting IOBS, traveling past dreams into other worlds....  All of that IS real, and  attainable.  However, the Fire From Within is the only thing I haven't verified that I still \"believe\".  I guess on that fateful day, we may find out, to some degree. \n\nIf we want true sorcery, you have to come at it light as a feather, a mood of happiness, alertness, with a decent amount of energy.  If you come burdened with thoughts of reversing disease, or getting back at an ex, or any of that murky, mired down shit, you don't have a shot.  And by the way, I'm not saying I come to intent this way when I practice, I'm actually saying the opposite: I spent HUNDREDS of hours coming to my practice with secret, nefarious desires, and every time I got nowhere.  Not once, after a hundred tries, could I remote view an ex, or grow a single follicle lol.  So you can either see for yourself, and waste a lot of time, or you can take the words of Don Juan himself and drop everything - your inventory, your past - everything - and approach sorcery empty, light, open and ready to develop your relationship with intent, without any agenda at all.

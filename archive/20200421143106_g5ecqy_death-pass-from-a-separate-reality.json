become a little spooky, preferring to look like a dark ghost.\n\nBut otherwise she's very helpful.\n\nIt's super nice! I suddenly have infinite power.\n\nI could always get to that point for a short duration after several hours.\n\nBut with an inorganic around to follow me, I can remain in that state as long as I have time.\n\nIt works like this:\n\nWithout one, you have to scoop colors for hours, and work like a dog to get more silent. And you keep getting distracted.\n\nBut with an inorganic, you only have to scoop enough to see anything at all.\n\nThey can then manifest using that energy.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll follow you along as your assemblage point moves, manifesting in more and more realistic looking ways.\n\nMaybe they start out as just 2 eyes and a mouth, on a pathetic puff of purple color.\n\nBut when you see that it tugs your assemblage point, and the eyes and mouth turn into a real face.\n\nI suggest, there\u2019s a 2-10 second delay you should keep in mind, so you can connect cause to effect.  It's easy to forget things in the second attention, so that something new seems not to flow from anything  before.\n\nWhen you see that real face form, you get a  mini \"wow!\" sensation. The assemblage point moves even further, and they can then emerge from the puff, as a stand alone  figure.\n\nMore \"Wow!\"!\n\nIt goes on and on, until they\u2019re showing you other worlds you can enter.\n\nIncluding theirs.\n\nIt\u2019s like they take your hand, to keep you focused, and slowly lead you out into the dark waters.\n\nYes, if you want to be paranoid they're probably \"grooming\" you.\n\nVery friendly, until they stick you in the closet.\n\nSo what?  Just don't go into the closet.\n\nWith the fairy floating around like a ghost, so that I could always see her, I was swiping worlds I didn't want to bother with last night, because I was trying to find the living room.\n\nI had too many riches!\n\nDrinking too much wine and being tired is my only problem with Cholita gone.\n\nEveryone, get an inorganic as fast as you can!\n\nJust make up your mind to be doomed, frightened, kidnapped, bitten, scratched, and to have evil poltergeists throwing things at your head.\n\nMaybe they\u2019ll even pester your girlfriend or mom!\n\nDon't make up worries to justify why you\u2019re lazy.\n\nAlso make up your mind to be a stinking, filthy old sorcerer type, and give up on the idea you\u2019ll be a superior \u201cnew sorcerer\u201d, with all the shiny glamour you believe that brings you.\n\nStop puffing up your ego and put in some work!\n\nBesides, you'll be lucky if you even get a glimpse of an inorganic.\n\nHaving a book thrown at your head would make your day!\n\n(Someone was worried about that recently.)\n\nI doubt they can push that hard, alone. I\u2019d estimate, they can push a small cup, but not a vase.\n\nDon't forget, don Juan made frequent use of his allies to scare the apprentices. He didn't seem worried it would cause them real harm.\n\nHe liked to threaten the apprentices, by pretending he had the allies in a gourd on his belt.\n\nAnd he passed those to Carlos, who passed them to us.\n\nThey seem to have a teaching agenda.\n\nMy dark mini-ghost (how my fairy now appears), certainly has one.\n\nShe's deviated me from trying to learn how to find Cholita using my dreaming double.\n\nShe seems bent on teaching me to see \"the wall\" on my hand.\n\nI almost wonder if that's why she appeared behind a door yesterday, trying to communicate through it.\n\nUsing the glass windows on the French door was sort of obvious.\n\nAnd forcing me to stop watching Cholita, and look at  her, was also kind of obvious.\n\nIf someone missed that post, I was startled out of bliss, by my inorganic being shouting behind a glass door, with no sound.  I realized I'd just been with Cholita somewhere else, turned back to that, and the inorganic being insisted I had to  pay attention to her, trying to communicate through that door.\n\nI peer at Cholita through that door, when I want to check up on her at night in the living room.\n\nSo the door image was easy to produce.\n\nTrying to shout through it might have meant, there's a \"wall\" between us. That's why you can't hear me.  And forget about Cholita.  She isn't helping these days.\n\nDon Juan said everything they do is significant.\n\nI'm starting to think he really meant, everything they do is confusing. And you might just ignore it as random.\n\nBut you\u2019ll profit if you can figure out why they did it.\n\nI ignored my inorganic last night, while practicing in darkness.  I was trying to find the living room so I could try to travel there in my double.  I need a way to locate Cholita when she runs away.\n\nWhile I was summoning different rooms she kept getting stuck to my hand.  I'd be swiping one I didn't want,  as if it were a 3D cellphone picture, and I'd notice a dark grey blob on my hand that wouldn't shake off.\n\nThat forced me to take a look, and she had a tiny dream going there. It wasn't just her, it was her doing something with other things. Confined to my hand!\n\nI was gazing at her on my right hand, and turned to see if I could copy that on my left, when a dark form stood up from the floor.\n\nIt was around 6 feet high, and obviously a man.  Very threatening.\n\nAnd all dark, like a hole in space.

And you keep getting distracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with an inorganic, you only have to scoop enough to see anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can then manifest using that energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they\u2019ll follow you along as your assemblage point moves, manifesting in more and more realistic looking ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe they start out as just 2 eyes and a mouth, on a pathetic puff of purple color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you see that it tugs your assemblage point, and the eyes and mouth turn into a real face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest, there\u2019s a 2-10 second delay you should keep in mind, so you can connect cause to effect.  It&amp;#39;s easy to forget things in the second attention, so that something new seems not to flow from anything  before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you see that real face form, you get a  mini &amp;quot;wow!&amp;quot; sensation. The assemblage point moves even further, and they can then emerge from the puff, as a stand alone  figure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More &amp;quot;Wow!&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes on and on, until they\u2019re showing you other worlds you can enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Including theirs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s like they take your hand, to keep you focused, and slowly lead you out into the dark waters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, if you want to be paranoid they&amp;#39;re probably &amp;quot;grooming&amp;quot; you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very friendly, until they stick you in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what?  Just don&amp;#39;t go into the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the fairy floating around like a ghost, so that I could always see her, I was swiping worlds I didn&amp;#39;t want to bother with last night, because I was trying to find the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had too many riches!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drinking too much wine and being tired is my only problem with Cholita gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone, get an inorganic as fast as you can!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just make up your mind to be doomed, frightened, kidnapped, bitten, scratched, and to have evil poltergeists throwing things at your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe they\u2019ll even pester your girlfriend or mom!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t make up worries to justify why you\u2019re lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also make up your mind to be a stinking, filthy old sorcerer type, and give up on the idea you\u2019ll be a superior \u201cnew sorcerer\u201d, with all the shiny glamour you believe that brings you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop puffing up your ego and put in some work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, you&amp;#39;ll be lucky if you even get a glimpse of an inorganic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having a book thrown at your head would make your day!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Someone was worried about that recently.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt they can push that hard, alone. I\u2019d estimate, they can push a small cup, but not a vase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget, don Juan made frequent use of his allies to scare the apprentices. He didn&amp;#39;t seem worried it would cause them real harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He liked to threaten the apprentices, by pretending he had the allies in a gourd on his belt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he passed those to Carlos, who passed them to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They seem to have a teaching agenda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dark mini-ghost (how my fairy now appears), certainly has one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s deviated me from trying to learn how to find Cholita using my dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She seems bent on teaching me to see &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; on my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I almost wonder if that&amp;#39;s why she appeared behind a door yesterday, trying to communicate through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using the glass windows on the French door was sort of obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And forcing me to stop watching Cholita, and look at  her, was also kind of obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone missed that post, I was startled out of bliss, by my inorganic being shouting behind a glass door, with no sound.  I realized I&amp;#39;d just been with Cholita somewhere else, turned back to that, and the inorganic being insisted I had to  pay attention to her, trying to communicate through that door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I peer at Cholita through that door, when I want to check up on her at night in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the door image was easy to produce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to shout through it might have meant, there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; between us. That&amp;#39;s why you can&amp;#39;t hear me.  And forget about Cholita.  She isn&amp;#39;t helping these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said everything they do is significant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to think he really meant, everything they do is confusing. And you might just ignore it as random.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you\u2019ll profit if you can figure out why they did it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ignored my inorganic last night, while practicing in darkness.  I was trying to find the living room so I could try to travel there in my double.  I need a way to locate Cholita when she runs away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was summoning different rooms she kept getting stuck to my hand.  I&amp;#39;d be swiping one I didn&amp;#39;t want,  as if it were a 3D cellphone picture, and I&amp;#39;d notice a dark grey blob on my hand that wouldn&amp;#39;t shake off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That forced me to take a look, and she had a tiny dream going there. It wasn&amp;#39;t just her, it was her doing something with other things. Confined to my hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gazing at her on my right hand, and turned to see if I could copy that on my left, when a dark form stood up from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was around 6 feet high, and obviously a man.  Very threatening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all dark, like a hole in space.  A classic &amp;quot;dead man rising from the grave&amp;quot; sort of image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its presence lit up enough of the room to see things, perhaps just so it could be more striking as a black figure against the bedroom details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if inorganic beings retain anything from who they hang out with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did Cholita make her more creepy, or did Cholita teach me to enjoy creepy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita likes to show me pics of bloated, rotting dead bodies, on her cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who flattened who?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the scarier and creepier the better,  in my book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fright moves the assemblage point faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that&amp;#39;s why people like scary rides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the movement of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_g5ecqy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g5ecqy/death_pass_from_a_separate_reality/fo3heam/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1587486943.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fo2y2yq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "CruzWayne", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1587476739.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fo2xioa", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_2smcozmg", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I think I can picture how it's done, not quite sure of the orientation of the palms just, perhaps with practice it'll find its own way.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fo2y2yq", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I can picture how it&amp;#39;s done, not quite sure of the orientation of the palms just, perhaps with practice it&amp;#39;ll find its own way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_g5ecqy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g5ecqy/death_pass_from_a_separate_reality/fo2y2yq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1587476739.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fo2xioa", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1587476390.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_g5ecqy", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I put it into the Wiki 2 months ago:\n\n[Don Juan's Death Pass](https://reddit.com/r/castaneda/w/tensegrity/misc_tensegrity/don_juans_death_pass)\n\nAlso, u/danl999's inorganic familiar recently managed to inform him that the reason she had appeared to be flat lately was that Cholita had flattened **him**.\n\nHe is perplexed as well.

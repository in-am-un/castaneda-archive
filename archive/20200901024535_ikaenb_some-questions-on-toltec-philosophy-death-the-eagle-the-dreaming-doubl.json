I read the Art of Dreaming but it\u2019s been years. I\u2019ve been reading through dozens of posts on this sub to try and familiarize myself with the terminology and various practices, but I still find myself with a few questions on the more philosophical side. I\u2019ve tried searching the sub with keywords to see if these questions have been asked before but can\u2019t find anything that completely satisfies the questions. \n\nA little bit about my experience:\n\nI\u2019ve been a natural lucid dreamer since childhood when I would wake up all the time in the middle of the night with sleep paralysis. Probably due to being a light sleeper. After doing research, I learned how to consciously enter into dream realms when I found myself paralyzed. \n\nI\u2019ve had my fair share of entity encounters. But nothing too frightening yet to be honest. The most frightening was when I encountered what I now realize was probably an IOB, while I was completely awake. I had awoken from my nap, looked across my room, and found a short gnome like creature in a witch hat and ragged clothes, staring directly at me. I ran past him out of my room and got my mom. I brought her in there and he was gone. I was probably 6 at the time. \n\nI\u2019ve had times where it felt like I could lucid dream multiple times a week. Right now I\u2019m at the point where it only happens about 4-5 times a month. Mostly short lived. I could probably make them happen way more if I put the necessary effort in. \n\nI grew up Christian, but left the church after college. The past couple years I\u2019ve studied Tibetan Buddhism and participated in my local Tibetan sangha. Never became too involved. I did study dream yoga as taught by tenzin wangyal rinpoche, but haven\u2019t put those specific techniques into practice yet. \n\nI now practice a samatha type meditation taught by Tibetan Buddhist (and self-proclaimed arhat) Daniel Ingram called Fire Kasina. It reminds me a bit of dark room practice I\u2019ve seen on here, but is still pretty different. \n\nNot sure that wall of text was necessary, but here are my actual questions:\n\nI know most of this sub is dedicated to the pragmatic aspects of sorcery rather than philosophy, but I have a very philosophical mind and can\u2019t help but explore my curiosity on these subjects. \n\nI keep hearing about The Eagle. How at death, you wander around in a dreamlike state for a while, until finally the eagle swallows up your awareness and you cease to exist. And how there are certain techniques to bypass the eagle to retain your awareness and individuality. \n\nThe thing that confuses me is it seems like this contradicts a lot of what I\u2019ve studied about the after death state, or the bardo as they call it in Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism teaches that after death, one wanders around in a dreamlike state for a while (similar) but instead of one\u2019s awareness being consumed/obliterated, it is instead transformed, and reborn into a new body. Until one escapes the wheel. \n\nThis also seems to contradict the accounts of nde\u2019s. They all talk about wandering around the astral for a bit, going into a tunnel of white light, meeting the being of light, having the \u201clife review\u201d (sounds similar to recapitulation), but no talk of The Eagle, or any other force that threatens to swallow up their consciousness. \n\nI know most people in the Toltec system don\u2019t believe in reincarnation, but how do you explain all the accounts of young children talking about their past lives, which are later on identified as real people who lived? \n\nI\u2019m honestly not convinced completely on reincarnation either, just trying to reconcile the seemingly contradictory ideas on the after death state  from various systems. \n\nMy last question is on the dreaming double. I was told by someone in another forum that the reason Don Juan told Castaneda to look at his hands in dreaming, was because the act of doing this was \u201cforming\u201d the dreaming double, and that it would \u201csolidify\u201d a little more each time. And that this also brings reason/logic to the dreaming mind, which it inherently doesn\u2019t have. \n\nThat all sounds right, but doesn\u2019t everyone already have a dreaming double? What body are people who haven\u2019t formed the double using in their dreams, lucid or otherwise?\n\nAnd on escaping the eagle at death, I\u2019ve heard a lot of talk about this, but nothing on how it\u2019s actually done. What are the techniques to do this? Does one need to just become lucid at death? Is it a matter of how much you\u2019ve recapitulated? \n\nSorry if these are dumb questions. But like I said, I can become very curious on the philosophical side of things when learning about new concepts.

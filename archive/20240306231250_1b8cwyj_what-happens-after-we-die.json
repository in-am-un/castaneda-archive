Perhaps 8 sentient pieces for each half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, you can take a puff of your energy body and form it into a sentient being using  the Pandora&amp;#39;s box pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might even stick around in your darkroom for more than an entire day!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fully visible.  Possibly even able to poke you with its finger and be felt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your tonal awareness can subdivide too. It&amp;#39;s just that it&amp;#39;s mostly stuck in your organic body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, it sends a tiny puff along into sleeping dreams, which is how you can be rational in them (once you find your hands).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So all of your awareness can &amp;quot;subdivide&amp;quot;. And your energy body even tends to flatten out, on the inside of your luminous shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are facts you can see for yourself, with your own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what typically happens at death, according to the new seers, is that your awareness is freed, thus without any container, on death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finds itself being examined by &amp;quot;The Eagle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is just a mistake some new seer made hundreds of  years ago, claiming that whatever it is that cares about probing the multiverse using manufactured living beings, looks like an eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But whatever it is, other than an emergent property of awareness flowing in the zillions of superstring &amp;quot;emanations&amp;quot;, it extracts &amp;quot;meaningfulness&amp;quot; from the awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Takes what it was after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; all possible realities from the point of view of a being which lived in one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recapitulation gives it those key conclusions ahead of time, so that the extraction process is somehow weakened enough for you to dart around whatever it is, and escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you still need to find a container.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you&amp;#39;ll subdivide exploring without one, until you aren&amp;#39;t sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the fate of most people, according to the new seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seers in general devised schemes to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s no point in discussing those, since you can&amp;#39;t possibly benefit from knowing about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you can witness your awareness directly, as we do in darkroom, you might as well join the Jesus people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have the easiest pretend path to immortality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you like to party in the nude, join the Satanists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Buddhists should be avoided because they want to steal your entire life, and will still tell you it&amp;#39;s probably not enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false,

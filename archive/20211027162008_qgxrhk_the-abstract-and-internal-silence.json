We get some idea of that whenever Carol Tiggs lectures.\n\nBut Carlos tried to keep it \"believable\".\n\nHe censored his accounts.\n\nSo rather than exaggerate or make them up, as his critics like to claim, he had to water them down.\n\nFor human consumption.\n\nI've run into that myself!\n\nOccasionally I get an eager Buddhist, anxious to explain to me that Carlos took it all from some obscure Buddhist scripture.  I figure, at least they know it exists. If they need to pretend to the Buddha gets credit for it for a while, they still might be salvageable.\n\nI can keep up with them a while (pacify their Buddha boy anger), but eventually if I just tell them what's up, hoping they'll get excited and try it, they disappear.\n\nThey decide I'm not an \"advanced colleague\", but rather a crazy man.\n\nFact is, Buddhists virtually never experience anything worth mentioning.\n\nThey're just suppressed bad players.\n\nBad players (someone who says they want magic, but really just wants human attention) who are fearful of the meditation police.\n\nSo they try to pretend to be \"scholars of consciousness\". They become \"inventory experts\".\n\nFrankly, I don't understand why they get cut so much slack!\n\nIf I believed in the Fliers, I'd say they're mostly Buddhist!\n\nCatholics are a little easier to deal with, when they see a picture like that.\n\nThey just figure you're possessed.   You just need to go to confession a few times, and get counseling from one of the older Bishops.\n\nAnd as long as I'm religion bashing, I suppose the Hindus wouldn't blink at this picture.\n\nYou'd hear something like, \"Oh yes, this is our troubled lord Indra Dev!  I recognize him from his tricks.\"\n\nIt's a good policy.  Every god, every manifestation, is automatically included in their belief system.\n\nIf you say, \"Do you know Jesus?\", they say, \"Yes, we honor our divine prophet Jesus.\"\n\nAnd smile.\n\nSo the Mormons go away.\n\nBut in fact, there's no madness or demonic deception going on in this picture.\n\nJust normal darkroom at the far end of the orange zone.\n\nThere, the abstract can come out.\n\nCarlos said that we will find the abstract between the \"here\" (us), and the \"there\" (the double).\n\nI thought, traveling between you and your double, so that you could experience them in a short time period and compare, caused you to \"zip\" from you, into the double, and then back again.\n\nI've done it!\n\nAnd during the \"zipping\" you were traveling through something.  A medium.\n\nThe abstract.\n\nI thought it was some sort of glue between time and space.\n\nAnd it might be!\n\nBut in fact, the abstract can simply come to you.\n\nTo be perceived.\n\nThe inorganic beings have learned to put that into a \"loop\".\n\nTo trap you.\n\nIt's pretty simple.  You perceive the abstract.  It makes no sense.\n\nYou try to understand it.  You start at \"the beginning\".\n\nIs it a thing, or a place?\n\nNeither.\n\nOk, then did it just happen, or it was hours ago?\n\nBoth.\n\nDid I do that before?\n\nAlways.\n\nAt some point, you either have enough info and want to give up, or you believe you have enough understanding to move on.\n\nDrop it.\n\nThat \"enough understanding\" comes with a little spark of energy, like that light bulb they use in cartoons, to show someone just had an idea.  The light bulb is above their head, and fully lit up.\n\nYou get that feeling of *knowing*, and the IOBs knock it back to the start.\n\nThey tie the feeling of \"understanding\" back to the feeling of \"discovery\" at the beginning of your perception of the abstract.\n\nAnd you get caught in a loop.\n\nFor hours even.\n\nMeanwhile, they suck you dry of energy.\n\nPlaying with the abstract last night, I got a \"re-run\" of private classes.\n\nCarlos took a young woman by the shoulders, and walked her behind me in class. He used his hands to motion to a couple standing there, who often stood at that point, that he wanted this new woman to stand there.\n\nI'm face blind, so I have no idea who that was.  But usually Virginia stood there with a friend.\n\nThe woman he brought over looked distracted.\n\nA few minutes later, Carlos walked past me and started talking as if he'd been in a conversation with her about what's she's been experiencing lately.\n\nHe began to talk about \"abstract dreaming\".\n\nAs usual, he  used the energy of a woman to introduce class to a new topic.  \n\nAnd so, I got a \"heads up\" that's been useful to this subreddit.\n\nOnce I realized Carlos had done that on purpose, I got a little vision of him moving people around the room several times, in different classes, in order to put the energy of one person next to another, so it would \"rub off\".\n\nCarlos hadn't yet made what he wanted.  But a few people might have had \"part\" of what he wanted.\n\nAnd apparently, he manipulated them as if they were \"flavors\" you could mix.\n\nCreate a combination of that, just by putting 2 different levels of understanding within a few feet of each other.\n\nOnce I realized that, and even saw the \"proof\" in re-runs of the past, I thought...\n\nNaahh...   No way.\n\nAnd dropped it.  That's outside my believability range.\n\nPlease don't misunderstand that picture. That's Minx in the background.  Cholita's Ally.\n\nHe wasn't sucking anyone dry there. He was trying to get my attention from the other side of the wall, in the phantom copy of the house.\n\nHe kept making really odd sounds.\n\nEach sound so loud, and so close to my head because it was coming from the wall behind my bed's headboard, that I was sure Cholita had returned and was trying out a spell.\n\nOnce in a while her spells have a sound component.\n\nBut it was just Minx.  Reminding me, Cholita's gone.\n\nHe made some truly weird sounds.\n\nThe Abstract in that picture was unrelated to Minx, who's been unhappy for days.\n\nMinx even formed a little band out in the back yard, as close to my window as you could get from there.  The music only lasted until I stopped watching TV to try to figure out why Cholita would do such a thing.\n\nHe was just reminding me.\n\nI typed up a bunch of notes about the abstract in the middle of the night, but now realize they're all pointless.\n\nThe only purpose they could have in here, is to keep the stories flowing.\n\nCarlos had don Juan to lead him.\n\nWe have nothing but stories.\n\nBut those will just have to do.\n\nI guess we're a little like boy and girl scouts on a hiking trip.  We stop at the large rocks, and it's obvious all the kids what to go home.\n\nSo the leaders tell them stories about the huge cat fish they can catch at the beautiful lake at the top of the mountain range over there, and remind them of the angry bears down below, on the way back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Abstract and Internal Silence", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"dgi67vx4u0w71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dgi67vx4u0w71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=752ed986bcc92a233bb443031ea4ef176ba4083c"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dgi67vx4u0w71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b624e10a516109ebdc1c241491060c6f6e972e55"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dgi67vx4u0w71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b558c7914e4e53588a4547cadc0244489f52501"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dgi67vx4u0w71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=554458133a80bce5d79d9b04f7c217704a1661cc"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dgi67vx4u0w71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a916878c982cc3e242497a2e8474409efd88f63a"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dgi67vx4u0w71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee06e7b16975e11e73caeb6f68ecc215fddf9d21"}, "id": "dgi67vx4u0w71"}}, "name": "t3_qgxrhk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oJSZhjQiOeSGmSwQMwsXIIheemYd5luV4uXyxHMXS8E.jpg", "edited": 1635356628.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1635344408.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dgi67vx4u0w71.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ee06e7b16975e11e73caeb6f68ecc215fddf9d21\"&gt;A tiny fraction of last night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put the raw notes from last night in private chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was afraid to lose it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I could put it in another place, but over there I can&amp;#39;t, &amp;quot;chicken out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is very weird.

it harder to get to remote viewing. but this is so crazy, i really want to remember.\n\nCarlos was manipulating who stood where in private class. i don't know what he did with distant points in the room,but for up in the front I caught a re-run of him putting a woman behind me, just so he could strike up a conversation with her on the abstract, so I had a chance to notice it\n\nthe abstract is inevitable if you j curve.\n\nno need to look for it.\n\nhowever if you consisder that the double also begins to become visible, the abstract is also visible because th edoubles time lines dont mesh with our tonal. you have 2 separte time lines goinng on. so if you remembrr something the double did, you cant account for when. because you reember what your tonal was doing then, so t heres no room for the double to havce been doing something.\n\nits possible the doubles thougth process either works in the abstract, or can handle that mor ethan ou rational mind, so it seems like it thinks entirely that way.\n\nand that way i sso crazy, were screwed for underswtanding it..\n\nif you do darkroom to theorange, eventually youll fall into abstract dreaming before a session.\n\nin abstract dreaming you havce some bizarre obsession with something. and get trapped\n\nbut thats triggered by iobs. they ake use of it.\n\nif it;s you activating it, then you dont get trapped in a loop, so you complete the abstract path. or seems more like obsession when you reembver it.\n\nI followed one for a good h our, trapped in abstract dreaming, and it kept reaching conclusions, and dputting the info of hte conclusion into a collection of an object, so I could reference it later.\n\nmy absgtract tried to send my tonal a postit note of sorts. not literally. it just created something I could find useful.\n\nbut it was a streak of brown wires on goo, around 2 feet wide, t6 in ches hight, and it was a tip on how to find the whitish lines of light faster, and how to feel about them, so that they had more power.\n\nso it was a series of observations and feelings, but when I try to rememver it, it turns out to havce manufactured an object I can remote view from a timeline that cant exist.\n\nit seems that the abstgract has no basis in time.\n\nif you look at th eabstract and try to apply the concept of time, you end up with a viw of time itself. and you realize, its a hollow thing. just an intellectual construct. mostly based on ME I suppose, since it seems obsessed with wrongs done to ME, and what sequeencce thyee occurred in.\n\nso you bacck off from that view of time, having seen it;s a mental construcct, and you end up seeing little 3 second videos, like shorts on youtube.\n\nthe abstract is just a series of memories of those.\n\nbut since its abstract, you dont see an understandable view, like a person walking to a car, or something simple.'\n\nits like the steps of the person walking separate from the leg, and tht connects to the weather that day, with the tv set that showed you the weather last week.\n\nthe abstracg reaches across what we belive to be time, to find connecitons between seemingly unrelated awareness clips. those segments.k\n\nin darkroom, you learn to do things, move eher or there, wave your hands. you are learning tonal activities,, which ake ksense.\n\nand so youre still a separate you in the darkroom, and that separate you take s on powers\n\nthosee poweers exist at thepeak of the orange zone.\n\nand the red too I suppose\n\nmost darkroomers want those powers. and htat;s ok!\n\nthe tonal always wants advantages\n\nbut the abstract is over gthat hill. on the other side, headed down towards no advantages.\n\nso the gain to the abstract is not what you would expect.\n\nthe j curve seems to lead to more and dmore powers.\n\nbut at the end, they decline.\n\nthe good part is t hat the abstrat rearranges how you feel about the faar point on the jcurve, making much deeper silence possible.\n\nwe use puffs to gete silent bedause if yo ufocus on those, you are not focused on ME.k\n\nthe abstract is like tht, on steroids\n\nbecuasee the abstract is out of time. it skips across incidents in time to build something new.\n\nthus if you can just focus on even a single memory of the abstract, theres absolutely no way to obsess over ME. ME is gone at that point.\n\nso while the abstract doesnt by itself lead to s\\\\ome new thing you could exploit, its better because it leads to silence and emptiness in the tonal side of things.\n\nI have to warn everyone, theres a price to pay for skipping a session, once you get to the deep orange zone.\n\nseeing energy is not exactly the same as seeing. seeing is knowleedge coming to you, with little daydrream like visions of each aspec of it, to prove it to you in your mind. so y ou see clearly that its true.\n\nthat;s not the same as trying to remote view. Or to see a video like on the cover of wheel of time.\n\nI suppose thats \"reading off the wall\".\n\nOne might give in to either and r un to write it down like I;m doiing here, but its more so hte mental one with th eproofs, than the remote viewing understandings, which you would get excited to write down.\n\nso one is pratical. remote viewing. pracctical magic evcen.\n\nthe other is just egghead kowleedge.\n\nif you decide to save the egghead knowleedge that night, interrupting your attempts to push the practica magic further, you get penalyzed around 4 days work, on the practical side.\n\nI suppose you \"hurt intents feelings\" in some odd way.\n\nlike when the lizards stopped talking in the books.\n\nwhich reminds me, carlos did in fact position people in classes and lectures, to try to move something on had gained or understood, into another person, but without even having to do anything but place them there.\n\nspeaking of which, once of those incidents involved him warning me 20 years ago, about cholitas double.\n\nits one of those that is sometimes \"right there\", giving sorcerers access.\n\nat the time i didnt understand what \"access\" meant.\n\nbut now i realize, that just means itll show up! thats all hte magic a beginner could need. to see one of those for real.\n\nnot to mention theyre interactive, so I suppose thats access too.\n\nhowever, this can also happen with random peole you run into.\n\nso your boss at work might be one of those. its not lmited to sorcerers\n\nnot related in fact. its just a double who likes to phone home once in a whilee.\n\nill pay for this...\n\nno remote viewing tonight...\n\nabout carol tiggs. she says her life is not linear anymore. what she means is, shes viewing the abstract.\n\nit skips from one awarness incident to another, across time, and they donte even havec ot seem to be related. they just form something new, which feels very meaningful.\n\nbut you could extract any meaning. theres no way to translate the out of sequence nature over.\n\nits non-linear.\n\nits also not a good thing for us.\n\nwere worrying about learning and getting help, while someone who can experience the abstract has realized nothing really matters.\n\nwe wall want to realize nothing really matters, but we dont want our teacher to realize that.\n\nand im afraid women who realize that, are 4 times as much trouble as women normally are to men.\n\nthe thing hat frustrates men about women, is precisely what they gain many times more of, by handling the abstract.\n\ntheres an example of that in the books, where carlos goes to senior florinda after don juan is gone, and she laughs at what he might expect from her.\n\nthats what we have with carol.\n\ni suppose males can reach the abstract and still slum it, to help out apprentices.\n\nbut the only way to beneift from a woman in the abstract might be to follow her around, so you get woven up into it and she might comment once in a while.\n\nthe differene between how men handle the abstract, and how women handle it, might be why male energy exists.\n\nits like the curiosa witch, who no longer cares about the concrete, and just crates connections between things, for the eagle.\n\nmen lead people down those paths?\n\nbut i;m not sure theres even a path until a man examines it.\n\nthe abstract is out of time. one moment h ere, a moment from the past comes next, but then a moment from the future.\n\nand a momen that has no place in time.\n\nthey all form somethint new thats a thing by itself.\n\nthen men want to know how to use that thing. while somen move to the next one.\n\nits like women search, and men try to exploit what is found.", "edited": 1635352835.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null,

thats all hte magic a beginner could need. to see one of those for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;not to mention theyre interactive, so I suppose thats access too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;however, this can also happen with random peole you run into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so your boss at work might be one of those. its not lmited to sorcerers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;not related in fact. its just a double who likes to phone home once in a whilee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ill pay for this...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;no remote viewing tonight...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;about carol tiggs. she says her life is not linear anymore. what she means is, shes viewing the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it skips from one awarness incident to another, across time, and they donte even havec ot seem to be related. they just form something new, which feels very meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but you could extract any meaning. theres no way to translate the out of sequence nature over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;its non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;its also not a good thing for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;were worrying about learning and getting help, while someone who can experience the abstract has realized nothing really matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;we wall want to realize nothing really matters, but we dont want our teacher to realize that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and im afraid women who realize that, are 4 times as much trouble as women normally are to men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the thing hat frustrates men about women, is precisely what they gain many times more of, by handling the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;theres an example of that in the books, where carlos goes to senior florinda after don juan is gone, and she laughs at what he might expect from her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thats what we have with carol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i suppose males can reach the abstract and still slum it, to help out apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but the only way to beneift from a woman in the abstract might be to follow her around, so you get woven up into it and she might comment once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the differene between how men handle the abstract, and how women handle it, might be why male energy exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;its like the curiosa witch, who no longer cares about the concrete, and just crates connections between things, for the eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;men lead people down those paths?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but i;m not sure theres even a path until a man examines it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the abstract is out of time. one moment h ere, a moment from the past comes next, but then a moment from the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and a momen that has no place in time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;they all form somethint new thats a thing by itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then men want to know how to use that thing. while somen move to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;its like women search, and men try to exploit what is found.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qgxrhk/the_abstract_and_internal_silence/hi90gfs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1635344475.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_qgxrhk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}]

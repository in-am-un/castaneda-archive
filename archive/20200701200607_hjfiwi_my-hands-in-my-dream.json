It was about lateral shifts at the bottom of the j curve.\n\nIt seems that our sense of being \"us\" is tied to being in the middle.\n\nCarlos showed that with his finger. He moved it down a certain path, to show how the assemblage point moves.\n\nAt 2 deeper positions he moved it left and right, to acquaint us with lateral shifts and their effects.\n\nI wish I'd paid more attention!\n\nIt was the girl he did the demo on. I got distracted.\n\nOn the other hand, I might not have remembered the importance if he hadn't used her.\n\nWe're ourselves if you move straight down.\n\nAs don Juan said, people in heightened awareness have huge advantages. They instantly comprehend things that would make no sense to a non-sorcerer.\n\nBut they're nearly themselves in that state.  They aren't in some bizarre dream world, confused without lucidity.  Or transformed into a log rolling in the foam of the second attention.\n\nLateral shifts are weird at any depth.\n\nAt the top, along the blue line, possibly as far down as the green line, you get non-lucid dreaming.  That of course includes feverish dreams, along with wonderful dreams that you can't control.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here, and explain beyond my understanding.\n\nLucid dreaming expands the horizontal range at which \"you\", are you.\n\nIt widens where you can be, relative to the center of the line that moves in that J pattern.  It expands what's considered a  \"nominal\" movement of the assemblage point.\n\nOr, alternately, maybe it expands the range it can move laterally, and you can still muster the desire to become lucid.\n\nWhen practicing at our stages, we need to retain the desire to practice, and the reasoning to understand what's happening so we can influence the results.\n\nWe're going to move the assemblage point very far, and if it goes off to the right or left, it'll be a blockage to us continuing to learn for that day.\n\nThere's no procedure to keep it in the middle.\n\nJust be you.  The \"you\" is the middle.\n\nYou can stray off to the side, if you pay too much attention to the weirdness forming around you, while the assemblage point moves.\n\nBut it's not something you need to think about.\n\nYou'll get a valuable lesson either way.\n\nIt's just that, in the long run, we need to move it as far as we can each day, without any side trips.\n\nImagine it's like a child on a swing in the park.\n\nYou can see the little girls swing so high, it looks like they're about to go over the top of the swing and come down on the other side.\n\nWhen they aren't trying to frighten onlookers, they just swing the full range of the swing.\n\nThat's what we want to do. Each swing is a day's work.\n\nThat's how you get to the 3rd attention.  Making it easier and easier to swing the full range.\n\nA little boy comes along. He's not very good at swinging.\n\nMostly he's good at breaking things.\n\nHe starts to contort and twist on the swing.   Yank on the chain, rock back and forth.\n\nHe's not doing very much swinging.\n\nHe's shifting laterally instead.\n\nMaybe even flirting with the girls, by making the swing set unstable.\n\nBad boy...  \n\nAnd idiot!

It was about lateral shifts at the bottom of the j curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that our sense of being &amp;quot;us&amp;quot; is tied to being in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos showed that with his finger. He moved it down a certain path, to show how the assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 2 deeper positions he moved it left and right, to acquaint us with lateral shifts and their effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I&amp;#39;d paid more attention!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the girl he did the demo on. I got distracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I might not have remembered the importance if he hadn&amp;#39;t used her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re ourselves if you move straight down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan said, people in heightened awareness have huge advantages. They instantly comprehend things that would make no sense to a non-sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re nearly themselves in that state.  They aren&amp;#39;t in some bizarre dream world, confused without lucidity.  Or transformed into a log rolling in the foam of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lateral shifts are weird at any depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the top, along the blue line, possibly as far down as the green line, you get non-lucid dreaming.  That of course includes feverish dreams, along with wonderful dreams that you can&amp;#39;t control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to go out on a limb here, and explain beyond my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucid dreaming expands the horizontal range at which &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, are you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It widens where you can be, relative to the center of the line that moves in that J pattern.  It expands what&amp;#39;s considered a  &amp;quot;nominal&amp;quot; movement of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, alternately, maybe it expands the range it can move laterally, and you can still muster the desire to become lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When practicing at our stages, we need to retain the desire to practice, and the reasoning to understand what&amp;#39;s happening so we can influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re going to move the assemblage point very far, and if it goes off to the right or left, it&amp;#39;ll be a blockage to us continuing to learn for that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no procedure to keep it in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just be you.  The &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; is the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can stray off to the side, if you pay too much attention to the weirdness forming around you, while the assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not something you need to think about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll get a valuable lesson either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that, in the long run, we need to move it as far as we can each day, without any side trips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine it&amp;#39;s like a child on a swing in the park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see the little girls swing so high, it looks like they&amp;#39;re about to go over the top of the swing and come down on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they aren&amp;#39;t trying to frighten onlookers, they just swing the full range of the swing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we want to do. Each swing is a day&amp;#39;s work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how you get to the 3rd attention.  Making it easier and easier to swing the full range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little boy comes along. He&amp;#39;s not very good at swinging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly he&amp;#39;s good at breaking things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He starts to contort and twist on the swing.   Yank on the chain, rock back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s not doing very much swinging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s shifting laterally instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even flirting with the girls, by making the swing set unstable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad boy...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And idiot!  You want to stand in front of the swing, and watch those skirts go by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not get on the darned thing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he still learns how to break things better, doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A single male sorcerer should go for women first, if he wants to produce a group.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absent a real lineage that is, where he can have lots of help, and handle multiple apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s just you, the women are more useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get yourself a set of 4 swinging women, all in unison, and you might be able to afford one man, swinging laterally and trying to break stuff on the same swing set which can handle 5.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women swinging so perfectly and so high,  will guilt trip him into actually behaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you run into a &amp;quot;new sorcery group&amp;quot; somewhere, and it&amp;#39;s 2 or more men, forget it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fake.

Nuts.\n\nBut it just works out.\n\nAh, only in \"A Separate Reality\"?\n\nPlease notice, it's ALL inorganic beings teaching Carlos.\n\nThe Castaneda community, in the absence of actual knowledge, has made themselves feel better by hating the old sorcerers and inorganic beings.\n\nIt's like a poverty stricken person who has to eat nothing but stale bread from a dumpster, hating fine Caviar.

If you have the time, you will get waking &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually using waking &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt;, you discover the sleeping &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; realm, and enter it either in your physical body, or you doze off an instant to switch bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then that dreaming body can leave and come into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both methods produce the same results, ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The waking dreaming method makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lucid dreaming method makes you sullen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But waking dreaming requires a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucid dreaming, being hit or miss, requires no work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So people choose the easy path, but it never gets them very far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than 1200 people who went that path gave up, since the mid 90s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s rare to run into any of those, who are still interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new crop is optimistic, but I suggest they ought to heed history and modify their practices so they don&amp;#39;t end up quitting also.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hjfiwi/my_hands_in_my_dream/fwlwcwo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1593627326.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hjfiwi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fxfg3fn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Luisyelsol", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fxbaxf1", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3x9578py", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I have been going to places with the intent to be at \"el sitio\" it has helped me, maybe is a placebo, but it definitly works.\n\nFunny, yesterday I was meditating with me wife, for her trying to silence her thinking is a bit harder.

I have a post about it today in the advanced subreddit, but it's best beginners don't think about most of those methods.\n\nBut believing in magic elsewhere, in other systems, causes you to subconsciously think that if things got too hard doing darkroom,  you could always go do what Daoists do.\n\nSomething easier, like stare at candles.\n\nOr try Hindu meditation.  Become a \"guru\"!!!  Grow a beard, and get a youtube channel.\n\nOr \"Master\" Zen, and soak up admiration from all the pathetic monks who have to chant for you.\n\nThose are all such ugly desires, you aren't going to get the double to participate in any of that.\n\nYou know your double well!  You play inside him, in dreams each night.\n\nYou just didn't realize he can come out into the \"real world\".\n\nIf you give him a reason.\n\nChildren know that, but we talk them out of it.\n\nThe double is tricky.  There are MANY ways to lure him out.\n\nEmbarrassment, curiosity over magic your tonal body is trying to do, fright, extreme danger. All of those are given as examples in the books of Carlos, so you can learn about it.\n\nRepetitious rituals bring him out.  Thus the \"shaman\" style magic.  Using rituals, spirits, and usually drugs.\n\nDuring darkroom practices you'll often find you have extra body parts.  That's him!  He got interested.\n\nLike a \"third arm\".\n\nYou got him curious so he came back from wandering around in dreams, to see what you were up to in your tiny little realm of reality.\n\nHey... I'm not making up stuff here.   \n\nYou'll eventually learn to \"rip apart\" reality in front of you, like a visible curtain, to find him standing right there in the room.\n\nHe wasn't before, but the fact that you could do that got him intensely interested.\n\nI must have done that 3 times last night with various levels of success!  I wanted to steal his \"night vision\", where the room looks like the sun is shining into it. Even though it's pitch black.\n\nJulian (a teacher before our teacher's teacher), tossed an apprentice into a raging river to die.  In order to force his \"double\" (the puffs) to take solid form and help him.\n\nThat same apprentice had previously been dressed up in women's clothing, against his will, because Julian used one of his Allies to trick the apprentice into thinking a monsterous man was after him and he had to hide out as a woman.\n\nThat Julian was what I like to call a \"rat bastard\" teacher.\n\nIf he could force you naked, have sex with you,  scare the hell out of you, or even put you in danger of death, in order to bring out your double, he did it!\n\nFortunately for us, we can bring our double out with darkness and some physical movements he'll like.\n\nThe Tensegrity movements \"come from\" dreams. And are still hooked to them!\n\nFor real.\n\nWe have no theories here.  There's no \"masters hiding in China\" keeping the sacred scrolls safe from you.\n\nI played with my double all last night, and he even started to teach me about how to bring him out more.\n\nSo if  if you start darkroom thinking it's like Daoist candles, and you don't realize you need to follow ALL of the instructions, because they pertain to \"the double\" more than to you, and the double is the puffs of purple,  you have already doomed yourself based on the mistaken beliefs in other systems.  \n\n\nIt's mostly NOT about \"you\". It's mostly about \"him\".\n\nIdeally, you'd be afraid the double really is going to show up, and scare the bejesus out of you.\n\nExcept those types tend to quit when IOBs start visiting. \"Fear is the first enemy\" we like to say.\n\nSo maybe \"intense curiosity\" in combination with darkness and perfect silence, is the best way to find the puffs.\n\nBut don't \"diss\" the puffs.\n\nThey know what you're thinking!\n\nMy guess is that your double can split into 8 fully independent beings, as \"pieces\" of the whole.\n\nEach sentient.\n\nExcept that the less you have of his purple puffs, because he's spread too thin, the less useful he becomes.\n\nI like to build things from a single purple puff, like a little car or a freeway overpass, and then switch over to my double at least 80%, so I can \"use them\".\n\nDrive off in the car, or wait at the bottom of the freeway overpass, for my Ally \"Fancy\" to crash and plunge to her death, at my feet.\n\nJust as an experiment that is...  \n\nAnd she gets even.  So it's ok.\n\nThere's no frigging Daoists out there doing anything even remotely as magical!\n\nAnd if they have \"something\" they can do, it's once a year for a few seconds.\n\nSo they can brag about it, and make up a new \"course\" to sell westerners for cash.  Chinese people won't fall for their nonsense, because they have to live in the same city with the Daoist pervert fortune tellers.\n\nThough, lonely old women go to them for specific \"magic spells\".  So they \"get by\".  Often they'll cheat an old woman and claim the magic she wants \"shortens their life by 1 year\", so she has to pay more for it.\n\nThat's what Daoists do (still trying to convince you to give up eastern crap magic).\n\nWe do intense magic for HOURS a night, every single night.\n\nJust don't \"diss\" the puffs...\n\nThey'll probably snub you.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ig5bqiy", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be that you don&amp;#39;t feel they&amp;#39;re important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, they hide out on the outskirts of our &amp;quot;egg&amp;quot; shape, pushed there by worry and grief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They want nothing to do with us.

In order to force his &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; (the puffs) to take solid form and help him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That same apprentice had previously been dressed up in women&amp;#39;s clothing, against his will, because Julian used one of his Allies to trick the apprentice into thinking a monsterous man was after him and he had to hide out as a woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That Julian was what I like to call a &amp;quot;rat bastard&amp;quot; teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he could force you naked, have sex with you,  scare the hell out of you, or even put you in danger of death, in order to bring out your double, he did it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for us, we can bring our double out with darkness and some physical movements he&amp;#39;ll like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity movements &amp;quot;come from&amp;quot; dreams. And are still hooked to them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have no theories here.  There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;masters hiding in China&amp;quot; keeping the sacred scrolls safe from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I played with my double all last night, and he even started to teach me about how to bring him out more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if  if you start darkroom thinking it&amp;#39;s like Daoist candles, and you don&amp;#39;t realize you need to follow ALL of the instructions, because they pertain to &amp;quot;the double&amp;quot; more than to you, and the double is the puffs of purple,  you have already doomed yourself based on the mistaken beliefs in other systems.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s mostly NOT about &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s mostly about &amp;quot;him&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you&amp;#39;d be afraid the double really is going to show up, and scare the bejesus out of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except those types tend to quit when IOBs start visiting. &amp;quot;Fear is the first enemy&amp;quot; we like to say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe &amp;quot;intense curiosity&amp;quot; in combination with darkness and perfect silence, is the best way to find the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;diss&amp;quot; the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They know what you&amp;#39;re thinking!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is that your double can split into 8 fully independent beings, as &amp;quot;pieces&amp;quot; of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that the less you have of his purple puffs, because he&amp;#39;s spread too thin, the less useful he becomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to build things from a single purple puff, like a little car or a freeway overpass, and then switch over to my double at least 80%, so I can &amp;quot;use them&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drive off in the car, or wait at the bottom of the freeway overpass, for my Ally &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; to crash and plunge to her death, at my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as an experiment that is...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she gets even.  So it&amp;#39;s ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no frigging Daoists out there doing anything even remotely as magical!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if they have &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; they can do, it&amp;#39;s once a year for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can brag about it, and make up a new &amp;quot;course&amp;quot; to sell westerners for cash.  Chinese people won&amp;#39;t fall for their nonsense, because they have to live in the same city with the Daoist pervert fortune tellers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though, lonely old women go to them for specific &amp;quot;magic spells&amp;quot;.  So they &amp;quot;get by&amp;quot;.  Often they&amp;#39;ll cheat an old woman and claim the magic she wants &amp;quot;shortens their life by 1 year&amp;quot;, so she has to pay more for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what Daoists do (still trying to convince you to give up eastern crap magic).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do intense magic for HOURS a night, every single night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;diss&amp;quot; the puffs...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll probably snub you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_vxg15t", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vxg15t/deleted_by_user/ig5bqiy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1657816939.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1657816939.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ig2qmpu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1657764897.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ig0tf0l", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Right, I definitely agree with you on a lot of things.

Vivid puffs came.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t have done that a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for me now, getting to the deep orange zone only takes 10 minutes on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge however still takes the full 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that&amp;#39;s because there&amp;#39;s a different thing needed to get to SK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not just silence, but that &amp;quot;clean link to intent&amp;quot; part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So once in a while, way out in the orange zone in &amp;quot;continuous seeing mode&amp;quot; (not quite the same as Silent Knowledge), I &amp;quot;realize&amp;quot; what&amp;#39;s different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That darkroom isn&amp;#39;t just getting rid of the internal dialogue. There&amp;#39;s at least 2 other things needed to reach SK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t remember them over here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just that, the tensegrity accomplishes both of the other 2 automatically, when done correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that Carlos &amp;quot;screwed up&amp;quot; due to having too much knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t realize no one was going to put in the time learning to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just assumed they&amp;#39;d do the work outside private classes and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that they had enough silence to get their assemblage point loose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of not understanding how lazy we all were, he didn&amp;#39;t emphasis that as much as was needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Took it for granted&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got desperate towards the end, even having us force silence during private classes. Just to make sure we got in 10 minutes of serious effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before that, maybe he just covered the &amp;quot;other things&amp;quot; you need to reach SK.  Embedding those in the Tensegrity and the &amp;quot;mood&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not realizing that wasn&amp;#39;t suitable for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe he was teaching calculus to people who still couldn&amp;#39;t multiply and divide?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vxg15t/deleted_by_user/ifvtn86/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1657647806.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_vxg15t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}], "before": null}}]

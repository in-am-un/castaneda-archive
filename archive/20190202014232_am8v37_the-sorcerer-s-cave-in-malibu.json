[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "On Malibu Road near Los Angeles, there exists a \"Sorcerer's Cave\".  Carlos taught his class about it.\n\nIt's not far from that odd space-age looking round building on the cliffs of Malibu Road.  I believe that house was sort of featured in Iron Man (in which they blew it up).  Maybe even in a Mel Gibson movie where they pulled it down with a truck.\n\nThe round building used to be a key feature along that road, but Malibu hills have been built up so much that this house doesn't stand out anymore.\n\nThe cliff where the sorcerer's cave exists is further up on that road.  It has an amazing drop. Someone has put a metal loop deep into a rock which hands over it, as some sort of climbing aid.  They named it, \u201cEagle\u2019s Rock\u201d, but that\u2019s not much use for finding it because just about every state park in California has an \u201cEagle\u2019s Rock\u201d.\n\nIf you walk as far as that metal hoop and your body doesn't freeze on the spot, refusing to go any further, you're a better man than I am.\n\nThe cave is to the right of that.   It's a cave that someone has hand carved out of limestone rock, with a \"couch\" of sorts in the middle.   The cave looks out on the ocean, in one of the wealthiest spots in southern California.\n\nThe cave is rumored to have been used by La Gorda and Carlos, when she visited north into Santa Monica.  Certainly, Santa Monica mountains were very popular with Carlos\u2019 classmates.\n\nIf you go to the cave, you take your life into your own hands.  You risk an easy death trying to get into the cave.  Unless you're very agile, don't even try it.  Better yet, it might be possible to tie a long rope all the way around the huge rock that contains it, without going out too close to the edge.  Maybe you could use that as support.\n\nBut don't complain to me if you end up dead and smashed at the bottom of the cliff. There's only a narrow limestone ledge leading into the cave.  That ledge leans towards the sheer drop of the cliff.   It\u2019s not flat.   You have to make at least one step of faith onto that, to get into the cave.\n\nAt the bottom of the cliff you'll see old automobiles which either crashed and landed there, or were put there by Hollywood.  It's a popular movie place to crash cars down a cliff and have them burst into flames.\n\nMalibu road has been a very popular set for 1950-1990s movies.  Colombo has driven there.  Horror movies of the 50s loved it.  All likely because it's about 20 minutes from Hollywood (back in the 50s that is) and the road twists and turns as it winds up the mountain. It\u2019s a perfect movie gimmick for someone\u2019s brakes being sabotaged on their way down that mountain.\n\nCarlos advised all the women in our classes to go there, and \u201cexpose themselves\u201d to the ocean view.  They were supposed to go into the cave, take off their panties, spread their legs, and expose themselves. I brought a couple of them up there because I knew where the cave was.  My main concern was, do I get to go into the cave with them and watch?  Nope.\n\nThe explanation for why women needed to do that is a little fuzzy to me.  Carlos gave a lengthy one, but I was more worried about the whole idea of exposing themselves.  It reminds me of a story Carlos told in class.  He said someone made it possible for him to meet a pretty young woman, and he was told she was a virgin. All Carlos could say was, \u201cA V..V\u2026.Virgin????\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s sort of what I was thinking while Carlos explained why the women needed to take off their panties and expose themselves to the ocean.  And so I don\u2019t remember the reasoning behind it.\n\nNow while this sounds a bit odd so far, it\u2019s certainly nothing compared to the other sexy doings of Carlos.  Baths of rosemary water for new women.  Shaving pubic hair into spiral patterns.   Bisexual Orgies, to which I thankfully never got invited.  Well\u2026 There was that one time someone suggested one of the witches wouldn\u2019t mind being my friend.\n\nI believe you almost had to have a \u201csponsor\u201d to get into the inner group.  And certainly, Carlos was up to his ears in women.  At one point I was told Carlos was trying to gather 200 women. I got to go to the first class where they were being taught tensegrity.   Someone informed me they\u2019d only gotten 50.  The classes were canceled as far as I know.\n\nThe main theory was that Carlos was trying to \u201cjump groves\u201d, to beat his deadly illness. He explained in class how sorcerers can do that, and that he himself had even done it once before.  But to do it, he needed more energy than he currently had.\n\nHow did they get women?  As far as I can tell, one of the dirty little secrets of young women trying to live in Los Angeles is that it\u2019s too darned expensive.  So, they aren\u2019t picky about accepting charity. Some of them likely just needed a place to stay, a current classmate of Carlos offered to let them stay at their place, and then they ended up in Carlos\u2019 private classes.\n\nOne day I was pondering all this with some concern.  Carlos\u2019 doings with women.   He was 72 years old, and rumored to be sexually active with multiple women.  At one point I counted, and it was 16. But that was a long time ago;  I\u2019m a little fuzzy on it now.\n\nIs it really scandalous to be sexually active with 16 women at 72? Or is it closer to amazing? I\u2019m only 62, and the whole thing seems a little grotesque to me now.\n\nAnd why didn\u2019t Carlos try to be more discrete? He seemed to want to be found out.  Surely the shit would hit the fan when he died.  Especially since he'd told all the men they had to be celebate.\n\nIf he intended to break up the group at his death, you couldn\u2019t have designed a better way to do it.  It\u2019s actually rather amusing if you think about it without the encumbrance of western morals.  There\u2019s a famous wealthy 80-year-old in Asia with an 18-year-old wife, and other assorted girlfriends. He\u2019s considered powerful.  Not perverted.  Chinese women admire him.\n\nAnd I can tell you, the women from the classes that I can converse with, have no problem with Carlos' sexual exploits.\n\nWhile pondering what Carlos was up to with his odd handling of women, which included pitting them against each other in mini-power struggles, I remembered the demise of the reputation of the famous Zen master of LA, who wanted to teach Japanese Zen in American terms. Instead of \u201cthe sound of one hand clapping\u201d, he changed it to \u201c the sound of a telephone ringing.\u201d\n\nHe lived to 106.  But in his 90s (a very grumpy 90s I\u2019ve been told by the monks) a nun accused him of inappropriate behavior and his reputation was tarnished.\n\nI remember those Zen nuns.  They were famous among the men for crying a lot. However, I can say without reservation, that the men were merely better at hiding their crying.\n\nI was so bothered to know why Carlos couldn\u2019t keep his pants on, that I decided to see \u201cthe wall\u201d to find the answer, hoping one of the allies would show up to aid.\n\nMy mind was saturated with considerations about Carlos and Joshu Sasaki.  But I silenced it, saw the purple colors, a floating hypnogogic head appeared in a little swirl above the colors, and the wall materialized in front of me.  It was filled with all the worries I had been unable to understand, regarding Carlos.\n\nAt one point, an Indian looking head appeared above it.  I was surprised to see it, because it was somewhat interactive.  Usually phantasm heads above the wall are too bizarre to be interactive, or even to move.  A common head looks like it could have been carved on the pyramids in Mexico. It certainly makes me wonder If those carvings weren\u2019t about that type of being.\n\nBut this one was definitely an Indian face.  The nose was kind of long and thick, but not bizarrely so.  It could have been don Juan for all I know.\n\nMy worries formed into little dreaming scenes on the wall, like applications lined up for selecting on a computer desktop, except that each was an animation of a scene too dim to really see.  I just knew they were the residue of my concerns.\n\nThe Indian man was looking down into the windows from the upper left above them.  In the distance to his right, and above him, there was an ally.  Not in its disguised form, but as a vertical bar of light. I misinterpreted it by its shape as a religious figure on a Mexican Catholic  glass jar candle.  It could easily have been God.   Being the way intent works, that\u2019s what I saw after that.  It couldn\u2019t be just a vertical bar of light, so it had to be God.\n\nBut in fact, it was what the allies seem to be able to do. They can project multiple people.  And it was the source of the projection of the Indian man looking at my concerns.\n\nHis eyes moved, and the windows started to circulate.  They rotated around, switched places on the wall, combined, and generally seemed to be trying to compare each other, to reduce the number of unresolved  windows.\n\nFinally, they stopped.  A voice said loudly and clearly, \u201cWomen Repurpose Men!  That\u2019s your answer.\u201d\n\nSince then I\u2019ve concluded, managing female apprentices is much harder than managing males. The males fill their heads up with idealistic visions of how grand they\u2019ll be when they\u2019re finally a sorcerer, how much cash they can get writing their own book, how they can tell their family they were right all along, and I\u2019m sure, but can\u2019t prove it, that most of them have visions of lording it over dozens of subservient disciples.\n\nThat makes them easy to manage.  The women are harder to figure.   I\u2019ve tried to teach a few.  You can tell them a very difficult technique which takes years to master.  You can explain all the complex procedures needed to learn it, pointing out that each one alone can take weeks to master.\n\nThe next day they say, \u201cI did that technique.  What\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Sorcerer's Cave in Malibu", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Places of Power"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_am8v37", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Places of Power", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1583875623.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1549068152.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Malibu Road near Los Angeles, there exists a &amp;quot;Sorcerer&amp;#39;s Cave&amp;quot;.

And implying that each pair had the potential to turn into something more than that.  Become some sort of energetic combination with special powers.\n\nThese projects included \"Journals\" only their best buddy could read.\n\nI believe, as a result of the \"project\" women got direct contact with the witches selected for them.\n\nA sneaky way to control the interactions!\n\nCholita got assigned to Florinda, being a dreamer. And she actually had a \"buddy\".\n\nI was surprised. I thought everyone was terrified of Cholita.\n\nPossibly the witches were trying to keep the women around, by giving them a sense of community?\n\nFemale junk...    Like smelly baths and flowers.\n\nNaturally I'd like to have seen Taisha explaining the layers of the cocoon in detail, or Florinda explaining how to tell if you are in an energy generating world, before you can see the whitish light on things.\n\nOr spill the beans on where  they got Phoebus and Globus.  And which one looked more like a duck?\n\nBut the witches were like Zuleica and Zoila might be with the female students, braiding each other's hair.\n\nEllis was in charge of this odd request from Carlos.\n\nCarlos asked everyone to write down some important event from their past, but not based on \"ME, ME, ME\".\n\nHe wasn't specific.  People tried to get him to give more info.\n\nI suppose the closest he got to being specific was to imply it should be something that changed their direction, and it could be intimate but that wasn't the goal.\n\nHe said he was going to read them all.\n\nWe handed them in to Ellis.  Who behaved, on taking mine, as if that task were long finished and she didn't know what to do with it now.\n\nAs far as I know, nothing ever came from it. Other than Carlos wasn't happy with the results.\n\nPossibly he just wanted us to notice, we have no significant events in the past which were not \"Me, Me, Me\".\n\nMight not have intended to read them at all.\n\nIt's a terrible pity we don't have more people who spent  years in private classes, or were in the inner circle.\n\nI'm socially inept. Someone else would know interesting details about what went on.\n\nAnd not necessarily Ellis I might add.  You might not find as much inner circle details in her book, as people assume.  \n\nCholita could tell stories...\n\nWhile looking at the flair to mark this post, trying to figure out which category it belongs in,  I saw \"re-runs\" mentioned.\n\nNo one need worry about re-runs (how to get them).\n\nThey're part of \"seeing energy on a horizon\".\n\nWhich is virtually the same as being a \"Reader of Infinity\".\n\nYou'll all get there, if you learn to shut off that internal dialogue and take a look around at the \"real world\".\n\nIt works like this:\n\nYou see the whitish light.  And if you are clueless, you don't realize what that stuff is good for.\n\nEverything... That's what it's good for.\n\nBut you see it, and realize you are nearing the end of the orange zone.\n\nSo you force silence as hard as you can.  Trying to \"stop the world\".\n\nBut instead, you sense something to your lower left.\n\nYou can't say what, but your head turns all by itself, to the left a bit, and down.\n\nAnd you find yourself standing in the past.  Maybe not even as yourself.\n\nYou can \"return\" by simply turning  your head back the way you came, and it's stable enough that you can go back in a second time.  To the precise place and time.\n\nIt's sort of like you accidentally entered a tunnel, are puzzled, go back out of the entrance and look around to see if it's safe, find everything normal, so you go back into the tunnel to have a look around.\n\nI don't want to cheat you guys out of discovering things like that for yourself,  but the truth is, if you do you get an overblown idea of their value.\n\nMy mom wasn't a hoarder, but she kept some things she liked.\n\nI once had to move some around. They were up on a shelf too high in the closet.\n\nShe got very excited when I picked up a frame for a painting.  No painting, just the frame.\n\nShe said, \"That's worth a lot of money!  Be careful with it.\"\n\nIn fact, you couldn't sell it for $2 at a thrift store.\n\nShe believed it was expensive, based on the circumstances when she got it.\n\nThat happens at first, when you get so silent that you begin to travel to alternate realities or time lines.\n\nBut once you can see energy on a horizon and realize what it's good for, you enter \"continuous seeing\" mode.\n\nWhich at first feels like you got a \"sudden insight\" into something that's been bothering you in the back of your mind for a long time.\n\nSomething you didn't get around to thinking about.\n\nThen you wonder, is that seeing?\n\nBad idea.\n\nYou fall into an explanation of whether that's actually seeing.\n\nA visual presentation!\n\nAt the end you're thinking, \"What the hell was that?\"\n\nAnd then you get a presentation on what the hell that was.\n\nIt seems to be related to how the dreaming emissary teaches!\n\nOr those lizards on Carlos' shoulders, gave their answers to his question(s).\n\nIn fact, those IOBs might be taking credit where they don't really deserve any.\n\nMaybe they just shift you into being a \"Reader of Infinity\", and the fact that they're standing there in some weird costume,  looking like a Disney character, makes you think they're the ones telling you stuff.\n\nThe re-run comes up when during the natural flow of reading off infinity, something from the past puzzles you.\n\nAs it turns out, time is just some structural emanations.\n\nThey're very sticky.  But it's not inevitable.\n\nSo the seeing gives you a visual presentation on that topic, from the past.\n\nMore visual at times, but always \"known\".\n\nBut we can't resist the visual ones!\n\nIt's our past!\n\nOr one we badly want to know about.\n\nAnd we end up in there, physically.  In fact, there isn't even a transition.\n\nAnd no indication it's not real.\n\nYou're viewing a presentation on a topic, but find you were already standing in that memory from the past.\n\nHas to be the double if you ask my opinion.  My guess is, the continuous seeing interests the double, who runs around taking a look at what you were *seeing*.\n\nBy the way, there's more to Taisha's story about how to bring out the double, than meets the eye.\n\nHe's always out there.  And his memories are visible to  you, if you slow down and stop thinking.  Lay down in fact.\n\nOnce you get into the past  you'll realize, all of it is available.  \n\nAll of space and time.\n\nEverything.\n\nWon't do you any good though.\n\nIt'll still be more like an \"intent gift\" when it happens. And the next day, impossible to recreate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Odd Request From Carlos", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xmbdufeax6z71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmbdufeax6z71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c665ecadbc1b98a11fd8cc2209262f63a2810e90"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmbdufeax6z71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3483f6be575cf6b8f949c6fa723d2193bb9f1141"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmbdufeax6z71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5fb3d85f464784507242f60964bac8c36bfcb45"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmbdufeax6z71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b540142e85920fc078905886b1a0eab68194c5ac"}], "s": {"y": 550, "x": 825, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xmbdufeax6z71.jpg?width=825&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e88cfc6452681a90c7c86c9fcb48bce9f9b9cbb0"}, "id": "xmbdufeax6z71"}}, "name": "t3_qseny6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/dHVT4ztuBV7WPm9NvlIual2QGYmQUhKd9TtQxv7zou4.jpg", "edited": 1636735875.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1636733811.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xmbdufeax6z71.jpg?width=825&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e88cfc6452681a90c7c86c9fcb48bce9f9b9cbb0\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xmbdufeax6z71.jpg?width=825&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e88cfc6452681a90c7c86c9fcb48bce9f9b9cbb0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot about an odd incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happened right in the middle of the workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There had been small things like this going on with the witches as long as I was aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s possible they caused it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches would occasionally set up &amp;quot;special projects&amp;quot; with the women, including pairing them off as best buddies who could share secrets that no one else could view.

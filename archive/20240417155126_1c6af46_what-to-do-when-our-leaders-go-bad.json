When the leader dies, the followers take over and try to earn a living without their leader around.\n\nThe reason people were drawn to what they are trying to continue selling, is gone.\n\nSo they make up stuff.\n\nThat's fine if you're talking about a giant fraud like Yogananda, and the huge empire he left behind in Los Angeles.\n\nIt's easy to carry on pretend Yoga teachings, in such a beautiful setting as their temple grounds in Pacific Palisades.\n\nSome of our own, including Cholita, find the place \"inspiring\".\n\nI just see a con artist's leftover sad attention seeking groupies dressed in clown outfits, running a fake pseudo christian church, and trying to continue the theft.\n\nSame perhaps as the Apostles of Jesus did to him when he was killed.  They transformed it into a money making business.\n\nAnd even with the millions of dollars Yogananda must have stolen, his little LA park like retreat is a very impressive piece of real estate for super expensive Los Angeles.\n\nMust be worth $20M by now.\n\nYogananda died in 1952 of course,  so it possibly wasn't all that expensive back then. You could buy a beach house along the Malibu coast back then, for around $10,000.\n\nCleargreen made a video claiming Carlos went to visit Yogananda, and endorsed him as being similar to our sorcery!\n\nIt even implied that don Juan would have approved of Yogananda's mental masturbation meditation system.\n\nExcept...\n\nCarlos only arrived in the USA 1 year before Yogananda died. He arrived in San Francisco in 1951, 500 miles away.\n\nAnd Carlos was just another Peruvian immigrant, completely unknown to all.\n\nYogananda's Hindu caste system upbringing would have seen Carlos as the lowest class you can be born into.\n\nAlmost as bad as grave diggers and animal hide processors.  The obsession in Chinese and Japanese countries.\n\nThere's no way Carlos drove 500 miles south and was received by Yogananda himself, undoubtedly by then in very poor health.\n\nThe whole story is a total lie, being sold by Cleargreen in order to do...\n\nWhat I have no idea.   Some suggested some Yoga groupies have infiltrated Cleargreen.\n\nBut it's very harmful to our community whatever the reason for that Cleargreen video may be.\n\nAnd it's is still there on Youtube, despite me publicly denouncing it.\n\nThey either have no shame, or they don't pay attention to what's going on in our community.\n\nSo what to do when our leaders go bad and start teaching false beliefs that will doom those interested in the teachings of don Juan, to endless pretending forever?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nAthina just suggested, while we were discussing the latest HORRIBLE make believe being taught for money by the 4 variations of Cleargreen which have gone bad (as Carlos predicted), that maybe sorcery isn't meant for so many to learn.\n\nMight be true. It's never been taught openly as Carlos tried to do.\n\nBut I have to think Carlos gave it his best shot to succeed, having watched his efforts up close for years.\n\nAnd I will too.  He saw to that by speaking with me in private about the horrible situation, just weeks before he died.\n\nCarlos created  \"factions\" among those he brought into private classes,  on purpose.\n\nIf you go back 5 years or so in here, you'll see me explaining them all.\n\nIn this case our concern is 4 of them. One we dubbed \"The Hollywood faction\", led by Soledad,  has done well indeed, to influence movies to contain our magic.  Such as \"Star Wars\".  \n\nWe have no complaints about the factions which still have (or had) actual lineage members in them.\n\nBut the ones Carlos created while trying to teach workshops, all went bad.\n\nCleargreen proper, Aerin (who Carlos adopted as his granddaughter to protect her from Cleargreen proper), Miles (who couldn't get along with Aerin and divorced her, and is buddying up to Yoga and Daoist con artists now), and Claroverde.\n\nWhich is promoting lectures by Rinpoches.\n\nSome of the most evil clown like con artists around.  Rinpoches!!!\n\nThat's what \"Claro Verde\" has come to.\n\nBoth Yoga promoting Cleargreen, and Buddhism promoting Caroverde, obviously never learned to make any magic at all work.  Or they'd know the difference between pretending, and the real thing. And NEVER mislead people to follow the pretend stuff.  \n\nThat's literally a crime!\n\nSo here's an idea.\n\nThere's too many interconnections between those factions and long term members of our community, to be safe taking them on directly.\n\nBy the way, you're in faction #5 here.\n\nThis subreddit.\n\nIt's private class members who survived.  The ones who had no official connection to anything other than direct instruction from Carlos and the witches.\n\nWe had no dogs in the fight for power back when Carlos was still alive.\n\nBut there's only three of us left from 50 (by Cholita's count).\n\nCarlos kept me far away from the other Cleargreens, obviously on purpose.\n\nI watched him create the factions over the course of 4 years.\n\nNoticing I was supposed to stay far away from them.\n\nCholita isn't so tightly bound, and Jadey is free to go where she likes.\n\nAnd one thing seems obvious now. We'd hoped it was otherwise, but things have gotten so bad that no one with any sense can be optimistic about the Cleargreens waking up, and doing some actual work to learn and help others do the same.  \n\nMoney is all they are after at this point.\n\nIt's just us left actually trying to make the sorcery of Carlos work, and succeeding very well at it because we're following the instructions Carlos left to us.\n\nWhile the other factions seek to destroy our magic by adding pretend new stuff,  for their own gain.\n\nThe four primary Cleargreen's are creating their absolute nonsense to teach people, based on taking some \"talking point\" from the books, and pretending that's magical.\n\nTeaching people that \"dreaming\" can be learned by learning positions in which to lay on the bed.\n\nOr that \"power\" is our goal, and you have to learn how to recognize when you are in it.\n\nWhat????\n\nWhen you have \"power\", reality is obeying your every hand gesture.  Visibly!  If you have to wonder \"do I have power\", then you don't!\n\nSo here's an idea.\n\nMake a cartoon with Grian the historian, teaching a class on \"what went wrong with don Juan's lineage\".\n\nTaking it all the way to the present.  It could even include the mistaken seeing of don Juan and Silvio Manuel, who mistook Carlos and La Gorda for different types of people which a lineage had to recruit.  When in fact, neither were suitable to continue a lineage.\n\nThus ending it.\n\nI just roughed out his library/theater.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1s1v7lkmu1vc1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cac2a273cb1f07f89d8d74368108e5d2405ffbc\n\nIt would essentially be a cartoon that makes fun of all the ways people pretend their sorcery using terms like \"power\" or \"dreaming\", redefined so that anyone can pretend those easily and claim victory.\n\nBut it's just a proposal.\n\nI have no idea how to convince people who have become con artists, to get serious and actually follow the instructions Carlos gave us before he died.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title":

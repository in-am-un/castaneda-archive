At least 50 people were there that day, according to Cholita.\n\nI can see it now.  Him dropping bombs, because he'd run out of time.\n\nAt the time, it was just weird.\n\nEveryone thought he was losing it.\n\nBut he had a plan.\n\nEveryone would do tensegrity, to get into shape and help begin to rebuild their second attention body.\n\nTheir dreaming bodies were dispersed everywhere, and it\u2019s much more difficult to teach people when you don\u2019t have access to their consolidated double.\n\nAt the same time, everyone would recapitulate to fix their nasty personalities.\n\nJust look around in this subreddit to see the mental illness which plagues apprentices.\n\nTensegrity + recapitulation could fix that.\n\nThen, as he was producing a question/answer publication (The Hermaneutics Journal), where he could explain to people at large what was the plan (path), he learned he was dying.\n\nNo time left.\n\nHe didn\u2019t die of cancer.\n\nHe didn't die from too many power plants (shame on you who suggested that!).\n\nHe died of too many apprentices.\n\nWe killed him.\n\nOn his own, as Joe, he could have jumped grooves again.\n\nHis plan for us had been to go directly to stopping the world, after the tensegrity and recap.\n\nAnd ignore playing around in the second attention.\n\nOf course, the entire class wanted magic.\n\nStuff you could see with your own eyes!\n\nThey **wanted** the second attention, in all it\u2019s old sorcerer evil glory.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t in the original plan, probably for the same reason it\u2019s not in most Buddhist group plans.\n\nThey tell you to ignore the second attention, and go further.  Avoid the trouble along the way, go for the goal.\n\nTo \u201cstopping the world\u201d,  in the case of Castaneda\u2019s plan.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t have time.\n\nSo he dropped a bomb or two as he left.  Second attention bombs.\n\nI saw him drop them!\n\nI couldn't have been more than 3 feet away from him, and his grin while dropping them was palpable.\n\nIt was like a smirk.\n\nA wicked smirk.\n\nI've seen that smirk on malicious politicians.\n\nYou wanted magic?  Here it is.\n\nThe first bomb was, \u201cThe Wall\u201d.\n\nWith the wall, you have access to all of the second attention, and to all worlds available to humans.\n\nInorganic beings will fly onto your wall, to assist you.\n\nThe second bomb was a tensegrity move that never made it into workshops.\n\nI\u2019ve described it, but now I\u2019ll name it.\n\n\u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d.\n\nCleargreen ignored it, so I get to name it.\n\nAs I've learned from Minx and Fairy, naming stuff is a big deal.\n\nMinx still hasn't forgiven me.\n\nPandora's Box is the tensegrity move where you compress balls of redeployed energy, then release the concentrate into the air. It materializes into an object or being, chosen by *intent*.\n\nOnce you release such energy into the air, it spreads everywhere.\n\nYou no longer need the box.\n\nIn fact, you can't put the magic back.\n\nIt spreads everywhere, and things just show up.\n\nThis little second attention toy came out of that box.\n\nThe picture isn\u2019t fully accurate, but it\u2019s close enough for you to get the idea.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT PRETEND!\n\nIf you\u2019re practicing something that doesn\u2019t dazzled you out of your mind, and your buddies who have been at it for 20 years are just as stupid as the day they started,  get another practice!\n\nI created this toy by accident.\n\nI was looking for a yin/yang whorl, because I wanted to see that, \u201cPomegranate\u201d dot Carlos had attributed to forming the writing that emits from whorls.\n\nI'm starting to suspect, he was taunting us by claiming it could only come from that dot.\n\nHe wanted us to look closer, which means, focus our attention more, on a pure manifestation of the second attention.\n\nMake the second attention, \"real\".\n\nHere\u2019s a pic of the whorl.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/2nujnrsresw41.jpg?width=785&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82fde1248d99c8275719693092df971d4f1bb31](https://preview.redd.it/2nujnrsresw41.jpg?width=785&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82fde1248d99c8275719693092df971d4f1bb31)\n\nIt's the one emitting text.\n\nI don\u2019t pay much attention to \u201cwhorls\u201d like that these days, but they\u2019re around if I look for them.\n\nIf you want to hasten their appearance, play with dark energy you see near purple puffs.\n\nSpin it into the purple with your hand.\n\nBut normally, they show up when the assemblage point is at a deep location, very near to heightened awareness.\n\nSpinning dark into light likely just helps you get there.  By itself, it's probably doing nothing.\n\nI found a nicely formed whorl last week, and gazed closely at it hoping to see the little pomegranate dot.\n\nIt was too far away, so I reached out to put my hand under it, and then I turned my head while I moved my hand, to bring it down onto my lap.\n\nAs I gazed into it, Fairy showed up.\n\nIt started to burn intensely. That pic doesn\u2019t do it justice. It was simply mesmerizing. It changed into a 3D form, looking very much like a real object in my hand.\n\nOf course, it had been created from the *intent* of posting about crystal balls, a few days earlier.\n\nThinking I was supposed to look inside I intensified my gaze, to concentrate it on a point on the middle of the yellow ball.\n\nThe pink you see on top of it should actually be intense violet, and much more organic in form. It looked more like flower petals bent over the ball.  Like an actual jewelry mount for a mini crystal ball, but made from intense purple light.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see inside the ball, so I intensified my gaze until it was strong enough to burn a hole into the object.\n\nAnother world became visible on the bedspread, around the same intensity as you can see in that pic.  My intense gaze (intent) projected into the ball, forcing another world to assemble below it.\n\nI supposed, you could say the ball had diffused the gaze, making it wide enough to produce another world on the bed.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make out what\u2019s down below the hand, but it is in fact a world you could jump down into, under the right circumstances.\n\nIt's an aerial view of roads and buildings at night.\n\nOne time, perhaps 6 months earlier,  I was playing hide and seek with Cholita in our dreaming bodies, while awake.\n\nShe was just too fast for me, so I took to an aerial view in order to find her.\n\nLooking down I saw her walking along in a little Mexican village, not all that dissimilar to that picture.\n\nShe was a tiny little woman walking along boldly on those roads.\n\nThe gait was clearly Cholita's.\n\nShe almost reached the end of the scene,  and I worried I might not find where she'd gone next.\n\nIt was hard enough to find her in that remote Mexican village.  We started near Los Angeles.\n\nOut of frustration I smashed my fists down on that little village.\n\nI thought I could blow it up, and Cholita would have to emerge.\n\nIt broke into pieces, and I ended up hugging the right-most piece in my arms.\n\nThat was the last place I saw Cholita.  On a street to the far right.\n\nI gazed inside.\n\nCholita had escaped.\n\nThis particular power object will manifest world after world on your bed-sheets. They cycle at around 15 seconds apiece.\n\nIt seems as if,  as soon as you understand what you\u2019re looking at, a village, a road system, a desert, it produces another choice for you.\n\nPlease don\u2019t ask about Pandora\u2019s Box.\n\nI\u2019ll video tape it later.   And I\u2019ve already described it a few times.\n\nThat, and \u201cThe Wall\u201d lead into the depths of the Old Sorcerer\u2019s manipulations of the Second attention.\n\nCarlos couldn\u2019t finish teaching us, so he left us real magic instead.\n\nEdited four times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Assembling Another World Using a Toy", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 75, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"abhf3pbiz0y41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 68, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abhf3pbiz0y41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f5be8b070dffa2f0ea0b38c29690fe528989c2a"}, {"y": 136, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abhf3pbiz0y41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=522c32f9359c461428e35eb053fa7748ae0ed50f"}, {"y": 202, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abhf3pbiz0y41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95ce0eea808eaaaddee22c7a43f2cbea4a3d4d6"}, {"y": 404, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abhf3pbiz0y41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=724597ca77d20e4a87b6bb6677345f33ff7e2442"}, {"y": 606, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abhf3pbiz0y41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0481e74f959adc77472072b2922cea035273bd1"}, {"y": 682, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abhf3pbiz0y41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93ee50e660fbdd89b42f54844d1242da6c1e6102"}], "s": {"y": 718, "x": 1137, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/abhf3pbiz0y41.jpg?width=1137&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b4cf57ef7e9408b52e1e9d7499fb9b19af12372"}, "id": "abhf3pbiz0y41"}}, "name": "t3_ghcjoi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 10, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/FqZhm8iBcpHKvTTvYVK5oMysrdc-83FShl6TUymBF5k.jpg", "edited": 1589240692.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1589154813.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/abhf3pbiz0y41.jpg?width=1137&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3b4cf57ef7e9408b52e1e9d7499fb9b19af12372\"&gt;An Intense \\&amp;quot;Whorl\\&amp;quot;

My intense gaze (intent) projected into the ball, forcing another world to assemble below it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed, you could say the ball had diffused the gaze, making it wide enough to produce another world on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s hard to make out what\u2019s down below the hand, but it is in fact a world you could jump down into, under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an aerial view of roads and buildings at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time, perhaps 6 months earlier,  I was playing hide and seek with Cholita in our dreaming bodies, while awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was just too fast for me, so I took to an aerial view in order to find her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking down I saw her walking along in a little Mexican village, not all that dissimilar to that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was a tiny little woman walking along boldly on those roads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gait was clearly Cholita&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She almost reached the end of the scene,  and I worried I might not find where she&amp;#39;d gone next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was hard enough to find her in that remote Mexican village.  We started near Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of frustration I smashed my fists down on that little village.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I could blow it up, and Cholita would have to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It broke into pieces, and I ended up hugging the right-most piece in my arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the last place I saw Cholita.  On a street to the far right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had escaped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This particular power object will manifest world after world on your bed-sheets. They cycle at around 15 seconds apiece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems as if,  as soon as you understand what you\u2019re looking at, a village, a road system, a desert, it produces another choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don\u2019t ask about Pandora\u2019s Box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll video tape it later.   And I\u2019ve already described it a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That, and \u201cThe Wall\u201d lead into the depths of the Old Sorcerer\u2019s manipulations of the Second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos couldn\u2019t finish teaching us, so he left us real magic instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited four times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Learned it last night.\n\nYou can float through the second attention, inside the yellow world.\n\nLikely most small children know how to do this.\n\nYou're standing up, just sliding across that world floating above whatever ground is there,  passing though barriers and open areas as if the world didn't exist.\n\nAnd yet, it surrounds you.\n\nThere's a lot more.  But I can't access it today.\n\nIn the middle of practicing,  I asked out loud, \"Who's helping me?\"\n\nI was learning at such a fast rate, it was a little unsettling.\n\nFairy materialized, I looked to see if she would admit to having done it,  but I *knew* she was just as curious.\n\nI got no response.\n\nMy theory is that by producing images such as I've made recently, something noticed it.\n\nMaybe *intent* likes pictures better too, as do some people reading in here?\n\nI must confess.

If I had looked down at the floor, it would have seemed to be continuous, going right through the wall and bedroom door, and landing in Cholita&amp;#39;s bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That world will be steady.  The world produced by an intense gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike a dream world, which simply &amp;quot;shows up&amp;quot;, and where staring too hard makes things change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t change in a short amount of time either, the way worlds assembled on the walls of your bedroom tend to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say, stare at an intercepted dream and it begins to change instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stare at an assembled world, on the walls, and it doesn&amp;#39;t change while you look at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But having looked is the kiss of death for it. It&amp;#39;ll change when you look away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That &amp;quot;gaze beacon&amp;quot; world just didn&amp;#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a different animal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, separate topic entirely.  Learned it last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can float through the second attention, inside the yellow world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likely most small children know how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re standing up, just sliding across that world floating above whatever ground is there,  passing though barriers and open areas as if the world didn&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, it surrounds you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot more.  But I can&amp;#39;t access it today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of practicing,  I asked out loud, &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s helping me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was learning at such a fast rate, it was a little unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy materialized, I looked to see if she would admit to having done it,  but I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; she was just as curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got no response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory is that by producing images such as I&amp;#39;ve made recently, something noticed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; likes pictures better too, as do some people reading in here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must confess. I never read the articles.

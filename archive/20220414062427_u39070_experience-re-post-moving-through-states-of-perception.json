[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "This is a re-post of an experience I posted in the practitioner's sub a couple of months back. I have edited it slightly to focus on some of the aspects of the experience that I wanted to highlight. I am posting this because it is one of the clearest examples I have of a whole host of different techniques that I have since used many times with great effect and it's going to give context to some things I want to talk about in future.\n\nIn this session I had taken a low dose of pain medication for a back injury. Everything that happens in this session though are things that I have repeated multiple times before and after while completely sober. I just mention this for transparency. I was awake throughout the entire experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours after I took the medication my pain level had dropped but I could not sleep, so I decided to lie down and see how it affected a session instead.\n\n**Thought-Dreams:**  After I laid down the effects of the drugs became clear. I could still  think clearly and I could silence my internal dialogue easily, but  gossamer hallucinatory dream images were quick to begin appearing behind  my eyelids. These weren't like the strong substantial visuals of  hypnagogia. There was something really  thin and shallow about them, but they streamed continuously if I left my  attention on them.\n\nI'd seen  similar things years ago after smoking weed, but the key difference this  time was I was able to silence my internal dialogue easily, whereas  weed had only ever made it worse. This gave me some control over the  experience. The most common visuals would form as a path or tunnel or  hallway. I could lightly intend to move along these paths and after a  moment the visuals would update showing the next section of path, almost  like it was procedurally generated. Sometimes they would appear with an  intersection or a new environment and I could choose which way to move.\n\nSometimes  I would round a corner and suddenly there would be a completely out of  place looking creature sitting there. It would take me by surprise.  Several times I tried to interact with these creatures. In one instance I  was watching these strange green duck like creatures in an otherwise  normal looking park. After a while they became aware I was watching them  and ran over to me, but I still couldn't interact with them. They were  just part of the thought-stuff. In contrast, there was an IOB with me  who I could feel present with me throughout the whole experience and who  became more involved later on, sitting completely outside the  thought-dreams as well. I could communicate easily with them and feel  their energy, but the other images felt hollow. It was like I was  outside of them, watching but only influencing them from afar.\n\nOver  time other visuals were spliced in as well, mostly things that were  similar to my recent memories. Sometimes the visuals would 'peak' and  suddenly become crisper and more vivid, but this would only last a  moment and then they would return to normal. I could push them to 'peak'  by intending to see certain places in more detail, but they would  always return to normal very quickly. When sober I could push hypnagogic  images to appear and become more stable this way with a much greater  effect, but with the tramadol I seemed a little stuck in this shallow  thought-dream state.\n\n**Puffs:**  I shifted my attention to the puffs instead. They were much more vivid  than I ever see them and once I become aware of them I realised how many  there were. There were a lot of purples, but also blues and yellows,  moving and mixing in with each other. There were also very black puffs,  blacker than my eyelids, moving through the purples, eating them up and  being followed by other colours, sometimes forming circular swirls.  Seeing them like this reassured me that what I thought were the purple  puffs from my usual sits was probably accurate, but they are really  distorted from my visual snow.\n\nAs I  watched the puffs, I would become aware of the thought-dreams  continuing in a different set of vision that I could choose to focus my  attention on or ignore. I could switch between the puffs and the  thought-dreams with ease, but I was getting a bit sick of both.\n\n**Moving the Energy:**  As I was watching some video game visuals playing themselves out, the  IOB I was with piped up. It was clear I was frustrated with these  visuals a bit because they came from my memory and seemed devoid of  worth.\n\n\"These are emanations that  you have already lit up. At death, they will all light up again in  order. Try inhaling the energy from them and pull it back inside of you  as though you were doing recap.\"\n\nSo  I did. I hooked onto the feeling of these images and inhaled their  energy back in. To my amazement it worked, and it worked really well.  Those particular images stopped appearing whereas before they would  appear almost compulsively. I went through the other memory images that  were playing and inhaled them back in as well, experimenting with this  for a while. After some time, the IOB interjected again.\n\n\"This time, try inhaling ALL the energy and pulling it into the centre of your body.\"\n\nI  reached out and hooked onto the thought-dreams as a whole, whatever  this energetic 'stuff' was, whether they were my memories or not. I  pulled it all in and focused on condensing it into a point at the centre  of my body. All the visuals disappeared and then I had the sudden and  distinct tactile sensation of moving my dream arms around. Up to that  point I had just been an observer to these thought-dreams. For a brief  few moments I was aware of my dream body.\n\nI kept shifting my attention around and the thought-dreams returned. After a few minutes the IOB spoke up again.\n\n\"Let's try something else. This time, grab all the energy (of the thought-dreams) and push it upwards.\"\n\nI  did as they said. As I pushed it, the visuals stopped again and I had  the distinct feeling that I was moving downwards into darkness until I  felt like I was sitting on the floor. The IOB was now sitting to my  right.\n\n**Dream Objects:**  \"We're going to play a game,\" he said. I got the feeling of him placing  down two small cardboard boxes on the floor in front of us. \"The aim of  the game is to place down as many tokens as possible.\" He took a small  hexagonal plastic token from his box and put it down between us. I only  had a very vague visual sense of what was going on but was somehow aware  of what he was doing.\n\nI quickly  understood the purpose of this game. \"It's not really a game, right? But  you call it that so that the other person is compelled to take part,\" I  said. He nodded. It was an exercise in dream objects.\n\nI  started pulling tokens from the box and placing them face upright on  the ground. There weren't a lot of perceptual senses involved at first,  but they started to slowly come online. The tactile feel of the tokens  was easy to generate, I could start to feel their shape and texture in  my hands. The next easiest was the audible 'click' that the tiles made  as I placed them down. They felt and sounded like mahjong tiles.\n\nNext  was colour. About half way between pulling them from the box and  placing the tokens down, I would visually perceive their colour; bright  pinks, whites, yellows. Then, the difficult part, perceiving the upright  face of the token. I would place them down with more oomph, trying to  generate those visual peaks. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I  had no idea what was on the other side of the token until I saw it,  essentially creating it at the same time that I was perceiving it. I  managed to get a few to work, some had numbers, others had coloured  symbols. I experimented with creating tokens with other shapes, like  dominoes. I was even able to keep some of the domino pips stable and  place a few as though I were really matching them up.\n\nThen  I tried tarot cards and it became very clear why they were a little  trickier than tokens. They had fewer perceptual features that I could  take for granted. The tokens had a clear texture and distinct sound when  I place them down. The cards were softer and lighter and I had to  generate not only the face-up artwork, but also the artwork of the card  backing whereas the tokens were just simple plastic. The cards were much  harder to assemble.\n\nMy attention  drifted for a little until I caught myself and refocused. I pulled a  token and placed it down and was met with the IOB clapping at my action  which took me by surprise. I know it was trying to jolt me and  positively reinforce that I had successfully refocused my attention, but  it also made me feel a bit like a child.\n\nMy  energy levels started to dip from the injury and the medication and I  wanted to rest. The IOB suggested I get up and go to the bathroom so I  can 'reset' my attention. I did this and returned to bed and didn't have  any thought-dreams although I struggled to get any undisturbed sleep  until the tramadol completely wore off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Main Points:** In the months following this experience I have used the inhaling energy technique many times with great and immediate effect. If I have these thought-dreams or mid-surface level thoughts swimming around when I'm trying to practice, I inhale them and push the energy into my centre and they stop within seconds. Some of those thought-dreams are remnants of memories while others are just random thought-junk.\n\nIt's really amazed me how much energy this can free up. If I go for a session and all I'm getting is these gossamer visuals, in the past I may have assumed I wasn't balanced enough for the sit and gave up early. Now I can move quickly onto the next part.\n\nThe next part was with the dream objects. I have to stress that these are perceptually nothing like the thought-dreams or the puffs. They are incredibly realistic and sensorial. For me, it is like I am perceiving them with my physical senses, and usually all of them at once; sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste, etc.. This state is already one I was familiar with but I am learning more about it all the time. It's possible to just stay here and have very clear bi-directional communication with an ally or IOB (telepathic and/or auditory), or use this to enter straight into -very- realistic dreaming.\n\nThere is definitely a level of silence needed here that I don't talk about much in the account. You need inner silence and some command over your attention. The 'dreams' entered from silence are very different to ordinary dreams. And while I still call them dreams, reading the books again has shown me that this may actually be pretty misleading and even don Juan didn't like the term 'dreaming'.\n\nI'm going to talk more about this kind of dreaming in some coming posts and also the difference between some of the IOBs that you can meet in this 'dream object' state. This isn't different or separate to gazing, you need to still follow the gazing instructions and techniques given in the books.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Experience Re-Post: Moving Through States of Perception", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_u39070", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_4dz9kepm", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1649910267.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a re-post of an experience I posted in the practitioner&amp;#39;s sub a couple of months back.

The nice thing is that using this technique i never lost the transition (It always feels like i'm still awake). \n\nYesterday night i repeated the process two times:\n\n the first After the Electric feel i started to perceive  dry leaves all around me, was literally swimming in dry leaves and i was not doubting It was \"real\", It was one ot the most peaceful and happy sensations i had in my life. After i realized i was dreaming i tried to do some gazing but everything was dark and i couldn't move, i started noticing some White dots and one of them started moving and expanding like It knew i was paying attention, from this movement i received the typical second attention jolt of fright and being an idiot i got excited and woke up.\n\nThe second time no dry leaves but this time i was in my room (i could also hear myself snoring) but It was definetly darker than normal and i couldn't move again, i sensed a presence on my left  and i felt like It was inviting me to notice him/her to solve the problem of movement.

The nice thing is that using this technique i never lost the transition (It always feels like i&amp;#39;m still awake). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday night i repeated the process two times:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the first After the Electric feel i started to perceive  dry leaves all around me, was literally swimming in dry leaves and i was not doubting It was &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, It was one ot the most peaceful and happy sensations i had in my life. After i realized i was dreaming i tried to do some gazing but everything was dark and i couldn&amp;#39;t move, i started noticing some White dots and one of them started moving and expanding like It knew i was paying attention, from this movement i received the typical second attention jolt of fright and being an idiot i got excited and woke up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second time no dry leaves but this time i was in my room (i could also hear myself snoring) but It was definetly darker than normal and i couldn&amp;#39;t move again, i sensed a presence on my left  and i felt like It was inviting me to notice him/her to solve the problem of movement. Initially i was scared, then i thought It could be my double and suddendly i was moving (more of floating) through the room, It was almost identical to my &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; room and i remberered the story of Dan following Cholita through a wall, so trying to enter the wall seemed fun, It looked perfectly solid and real but when i decided to enter i sort of merged with It got too excited and woke up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe the question is, what i&amp;#39;m supposed to do besides looking to  find the hands (which happens steadily) or looking for scouts ecc.,?

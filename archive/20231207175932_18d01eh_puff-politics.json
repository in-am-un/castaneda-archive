To get the puffs as close to accurate as I can, for what the first person sees.\n\nKeep in mind, others see different colors and behavior.\n\nOne might tend to focus on \"purple puffs\" because Carlos saw those and described them to us.\n\nBut don't forget the \"Tragedy of the Eagle\".\n\nWhere it was so darned hard to perceive the source of everything which exists,  that the new seers had dedicated teams working on that for perhaps 300 years of their 408 year old lineage.\n\nI'm just making up the \"perhaps 300\" but the 408 is indeed how old don Juan's lineage was from first Nagual to the death of Carlos.\n\nThese dedicated seers were tasked with finding out what \"the Tyrant\" who rules all of reality really wants from us.\n\nWhich is something that makes a lot more sense to sorcerers, who get to see daily that it interferes or helps them while practicing magic.\n\nIf you don't have any actual sorcery knowledge,  or you're stuck in a make believe religion with just rank beginner's green line on the J curve style knowledge, then it sounds like more religious pretending such as all other modern (&lt; 6000 years old) magical systems are filled with.\n\nThere's NOTHING like that in sorcery. No secret scrolls, no religious ideas, and especially no make believe.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, Sorcery is not at all about \"love\".\n\nWe had someone claiming that in chat.  Or something almost that, such as \"who wants to be a crummy sorcerer if there's nothing else in your life such as love?\"\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nYou can go cruise on the Love Boat on your own time!\n\nThe old seers ate their enemies alive, and shapeshifted into fierce monsters.\n\nIt wasn't for Halloween...\n\nHopefully all of you are good, loving people.\n\nBut frankly, that has nothing to do with sorcery which is next to impossible to learn.\n\nAnd fully impossible if you believe \"love\" has anything at all to do with it.\n\nFor that belief, stick with Cleargreen.\n\nThe concepts in sorcery are just too foreign to mankind these days, so people assume they're more silly \"sacred scroll\" stuff some monk made up so he could steal money from others.\n\nAnd naturally once they believe it's all just pretending, they also believe you need \"love\" in your life, to make up for the lack of anything real in sorcery.\n\nIt's very bizarre... \n\nI went boating on a lake made entirely of straw for a good half hour last night, each visit lasting only a few minutes.\n\nAnd each one of which I was a completely different being.\n\nWith activities in the world I entered being so different from this place, that there's nothing at all you could describe from it.\n\nBut those are lives lived by living beings, the same as ours.\n\nWhen I started to run out of energy from too much \"dream hopping\", a woman showed up for the second night in a row (maybe it's 3 now) and brought her male friend with her.\n\nBoth were very old.\n\nTheir faces were just inches from mine, and absolutely stable.\n\nAnd I'm just a beginner in Silent Knowledge!\n\nSo if you think Sorcery doesn't stand up to \"the power of love\", you really need to go elsewhere.\n\nJust don't start dating Cholita. \n\nYou really won't like that at all.\n\nSorcery is not just something sounding \"wise\" so that people wouldn't dare point out, its total nonsense.\n\nLike \"Samadhi\".\n\nThe reason people argue about what Samadhi is,  is that it doesn't actually exist at all. So no one can agree on what it is.\n\nBut you have to become a sorcerer to comprehend how that can be possible.  How can so many insist they're in Samadhi, some even sitting on little thrones because of it, and yet it doesn't exist at all?\n\nBecause, that's how reality works!\n\nAnd if you're hooked on believing in Samadhi, you're a lost cause as far as learning sorcery goes.\n\nIn the case of the Eagle, the same \"effect\" is active.  That which you expect, influences what you perceive.\n\nBecause you're off in regions which have NEVER been perceived before, so their \"real\" content as opposed to their \"phantom content\" is quite low.\n\nNot that \"phantom content\" isn't also \"real\".\n\nYour daily world is a large part phantom!\n\nBut at some point in the 8000 year long history of our sorcery, no one had ever actually seen the ruler of reality before.  Until the day someone did.  And after that, they all could.\n\nRemember that the new seers COULD watch \"energy flowing in the universe\" even before seeing the Eagle.\n\nEnergy flowing in the universe is not a vague thing!\n\nI was watching it for a full half hour last night, and learned unspeakable wonders about how reality works. \n\nAwake with eyes wide open by the way.  Anything I discuss here was done awake to avoid confusion with pretending meditation systems.\n\nSo while watching and trying to figure out what \"The Tyrant\" wants from us, one of those seers tasked with learning about it said,\"Hey!!!  Doesn't that look like the wing of a giant Eagle???\"\n\nAnd the other seer said, \"Yea!!!  I can see it now.  In front of those flashes of lightning.  Is that a giant beak???\"\n\nAnd we got stuck.  Now all anyone can see, when they try to perceive the source of everything, is a crummy Eagle.\n\nI sure hope it's not the one from Walker, Texas Ranger.  Who always warns him of danger, because Chuck Norris is half native american.\n\nEagles were a bit racist in 80s TV shows.\n\nAnd that's a REALLY annoying eagle.\n\nBut not as bad as \"The Tyrant\".\n\nIn the same way we got stuck with a giant eagle who devours us on death, the puffs have no real appearance.\n\nThey're pieces of your energy body.\n\nThey do exist!\n\nBut they don't \"look like something\" other than what they are.\n\nWhich is anything they want to be.\n\nHard to understand?\n\nWhen you can pick up one of those puffs in your hand, the way the Tensegrity moves teach you to do, and you can gaze into it, also as a few Tensegrity moves do,  you'll understand why they look like whatever they want to be.\n\nYou can even leap inside them and look around!\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Puff Politics", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/b061bb3a-9e7f-4aa9-aa7a-e852027799a8", "link_ids": ["t3_ufe5n7", "t3_uqjb1b", "t3_v0blwa", "t3_vet0rc", "t3_vj02xm", "t3_vl5y3u", "t3_vljtnc", "t3_vofz7z", "t3_vskr8w", "t3_vw90yz", "t3_w06vvt", "t3_w0ef1w", "t3_w4ku1c", "t3_w69oc4", "t3_wtav5p", "t3_wzr75t", "t3_x08z4q", "t3_x394xi", "t3_x5hqin", "t3_xiqr6m", "t3_xqg5yk", "t3_yb5su0", "t3_yntpxe", "t3_yzvbf2", "t3_z29k0l", "t3_yzfldm", "t3_z6na2c", "t3_zbtriz", "t3_zuotse", "t3_zuck9m", "t3_zxxeke", "t3_zycipg", "t3_10cnn2l", "t3_10lm2xt", "t3_10og6ip", "t3_10st3r0", "t3_10t7r08", "t3_10tlqmo", "t3_112wgv2", "t3_11a9k43", "t3_11b31re", "t3_11mk18w", "t3_11mrueg", "t3_11ukc7r", "t3_11x2mm6", "t3_137rsam", "t3_13ink97", "t3_13sgu3u", "t3_13vt16r", "t3_146ari6", "t3_14hgshp", "t3_14n3guj", "t3_14nzehw", "t3_14rbo3d", "t3_159f5xc", "t3_15epoo9", "t3_15ivrij", "t3_15mmpi9", "t3_161dw6x", "t3_16tme3p", "t3_16vhq77", "t3_17hp09f", "t3_1892kzi", "t3_18d01eh", "t3_1aevm5d", "t3_1aflfh4", "t3_1aj65ur", "t3_1awevc6", "t3_1ayafsg", "t3_1b51fqk", "t3_1b88jgx", "t3_1bhyfsq"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 3", "created_at_utc": 1651408248.875, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "b061bb3a-9e7f-4aa9-aa7a-e852027799a8", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1714464584.911, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"61dwo7volw4c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/18d01eh/asset/61dwo7volw4c1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718049561%2CODAyYWM1MzA4MDY3N2EwMjA0YTFkYTZlMWRmNTQxYWRhMjIzOWIxOGRhZjEzODNhODQ5MzIxOTQ3YjVhMmUyOA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/18d01eh/asset/61dwo7volw4c1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718049561%2CZTVkNDU1OTgzY2IxNmY4NDE1Yjg5MmYwYjk0NGU1MzQ1MDg4YzlhZmVhZWNlNGVmYzNhMTcyOWQxMWNkN2UwYw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "61dwo7volw4c1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_18d01eh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/nO4f75ghtqHJlLcyvF0qjqEhrEUCeCa7yuyDckKZefo.jpg", "edited": 1701977263.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1701968372.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/18d01eh/video/61dwo7volw4c1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/18d01eh/video/61dwo7volw4c1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** From Facebook ***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More Puffs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just a back and forth for the Womb Dreaming animation.

Do I sit on chair/bad or lie down?\n\nIt depends on how easily you're able to fall asleep. If the answer is yes, then don't lay down. \n\n&gt; In the evening sometimes I am tensed from the day activities.I mean do i have to relax or wait for the body itself to do that.\n\n\nYou can facilitate it consciously, with [The Right Way of Breathing](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/onfa7t/the_right_way_to_breathe/) and progressive relaxation methods of tensing and then relaxing your muscles like in the military's technique to help soldiers fall asleep (minus the eyes closed and the actual sleeping part!):\n\n\"The military developed and tested the following method that centers around preparing your mind and body for (darkroom!) by deeply relaxing for about two minutes. It is often done while sitting, but may also work while standing:\n\n-1.  Relax your whole face. Think of it as the epicenter of your emotions. Breathe slowly and deeply. Then relax all 43 of your face muscles \u2014 no squinting or frowning. Your forehead should be smooth. Let everything go loose. Breathe out as you feel your cheeks, mouth, tongue, and jaw relax.\n\nWhen you relax your face and let your eye sockets go limp, you signal to the rest of your body it\u2019s time to relax by letting them fall deep into their sockets. There are six muscles that control your eyes; feel them progressively relax.\n\n-2.  Now it\u2019s all about the shoulders. Let them drop as low as they can go, as if they were floating down your body. You should feel the back of your neck go lifeless. Let all the muscles there go even looser.\n\nBreathe in deeply. Then exhale slowly, blowing out all of the tension.\n\n-3.  Next are your arms. Start with your dominant side. If you\u2019re right-handed, focus on your right bicep. Feel it relax and drop down your body. If it\u2019s not relaxing, tense it first, then let it go loose.\n\nThen move to your right forearm. Focus on sending it limp. Finally, comes your hand and fingers. Let them fall like a dead weight against your leg. When you\u2019ve finished with your dominant side, work through the process with your other arm.\n\n-4.  Relax your chest as you breath out. In and out. In and out...\n\nYour upper body is now nice and limp, like it\u2019s sinking into you. \n\n-5.  Relax your legs, from your thighs to your feet. Tell your right thigh muscle to sink, like a dead weight. Then tell the same thing to your right calf muscles. Then do the same thing for your ankle and foot. Feel the muscles go limp, as your leg sinks into the ground.\n\nRepeat the process with the left leg, tell your thigh, then your calf, then your ankle and foot.\"\n\nThere are some [reclined passes](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ockzp6/-/h3zizai) if you want to lay down while doing the relaxing thing.You want to be relaxed but still alert, and open eyed with the mask, as you sit-up cross-legged (bringing the right calf closer to the [2nd attention a.p.](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/omc284/the_two_assemblage_points/)helps) to gaze at the colors while forcing/intending silence after.\n\nUse Tensegrity later to prolong and intensify what comes from the seated darkroom gazing.\n\n&gt;Does movement of the body matter\n\nYes, but not right at the start. Unless you wake up at 3:00 a.m. and need to stay awake (you'd already be quite relaxed at that point)...in which case start some simple standing Tensegrity that you can do without losing your balance in the dark, so you don't fall asleep.

If the answer is yes, then don&amp;#39;t lay down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the evening sometimes I am tensed from the day activities.I mean do i have to relax or wait for the body itself to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can facilitate it consciously, with &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/onfa7t/the_right_way_to_breathe/\"&gt;The Right Way of Breathing&lt;/a&gt; and progressive relaxation methods of tensing and then relaxing your muscles like in the military&amp;#39;s technique to help soldiers fall asleep (minus the eyes closed and the actual sleeping part!):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The military developed and tested the following method that centers around preparing your mind and body for (darkroom!) by deeply relaxing for about two minutes. It is often done while sitting, but may also work while standing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-1.  Relax your whole face. Think of it as the epicenter of your emotions. Breathe slowly and deeply. Then relax all 43 of your face muscles \u2014 no squinting or frowning. Your forehead should be smooth. Let everything go loose. Breathe out as you feel your cheeks, mouth, tongue, and jaw relax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you relax your face and let your eye sockets go limp, you signal to the rest of your body it\u2019s time to relax by letting them fall deep into their sockets. There are six muscles that control your eyes; feel them progressively relax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-2.  Now it\u2019s all about the shoulders. Let them drop as low as they can go, as if they were floating down your body. You should feel the back of your neck go lifeless. Let all the muscles there go even looser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breathe in deeply. Then exhale slowly, blowing out all of the tension.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-3.  Next are your arms. Start with your dominant side. If you\u2019re right-handed, focus on your right bicep. Feel it relax and drop down your body. If it\u2019s not relaxing, tense it first, then let it go loose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then move to your right forearm. Focus on sending it limp. Finally, comes your hand and fingers. Let them fall like a dead weight against your leg. When you\u2019ve finished with your dominant side, work through the process with your other arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-4.  Relax your chest as you breath out. In and out. In and out...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your upper body is now nice and limp, like it\u2019s sinking into you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-5.  Relax your legs, from your thighs to your feet. Tell your right thigh muscle to sink, like a dead weight. Then tell the same thing to your right calf muscles. Then do the same thing for your ankle and foot. Feel the muscles go limp, as your leg sinks into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repeat the process with the left leg, tell your thigh, then your calf, then your ankle and foot.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ockzp6/-/h3zizai\"&gt;reclined passes&lt;/a&gt; if you want to lay down while doing the relaxing thing.You want to be relaxed but still alert, and open eyed with the mask, as you sit-up cross-legged (bringing the right calf closer to the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/omc284/the_two_assemblage_points/\"&gt;2nd attention a.p.&lt;/a&gt;helps) to gaze at the colors while forcing/intending silence after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use Tensegrity later to prolong and intensify what comes from the seated darkroom gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does movement of the body matter&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, but not right at the start.

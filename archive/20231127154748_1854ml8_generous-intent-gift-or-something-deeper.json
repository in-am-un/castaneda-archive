That is why I came to the conclusion that the best way is to come, read, but then to leave and \u201cforget\u201d before engaging in one own\\`s practice again. I realized that to me personally, \\`sorcery\\` is not really something you \"do\", but rather something you \"let happen\" if that makes any sense.\n\nMy plan is to spend some weeks here again (i.e. to ask questions, to get over barriers I have etc.), but to **then leave for some years once more**.\n\nI had told Techno that I have a list of various questions, however, this event happened just recently (see the \u201cexperience\u201d below) and I guess I should post it first.\n\nI also would like to be fair by stating that most likely I do not qualify for becoming part of this lineage here; it is very good that you are doing this work and I am sure that you will eventually find the 5 males and 5 females to continue the lineage.\n\nThis post is about the most intense experience I had so far (as you will see below). I wonder what your take on it is and in which way I could continue this particular path after that experience.You can also see some questions below.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------\n\n**Background info**\n\nIn terms of practice, I have not always been a \"good boy\", but at the same time I still managed to implement the methods at least for a few years. **Overall, I would still consider myself in the \"beginner\u2019s stage\".** Here is a short summary of what I did in the last years:\n\n**Tensegrity**\n\nI do a handful of moves every morning, this for ca. 2 years now. I REALLY have to learn all the other ones, I feel that I have not even explored 5% of tensegrity and its possibilities. I also \"massage\" that point to the front and right of the belly button every day.I realized that this is not only about energy as such, but also about kind of bringing your INTENT also to the physical world by making bodily movements you would NOT do if all this was not real. For me, it is kind of \"reminding\" myself of the other side every day. But as I said, there is A LOT more to this, I realized that tensegrity is ESSENTIAL and one should do it every single day. I am in the process of reading the \"Magical Passes\" book (the movements I know I got from the YouTube videos of the three women). My intent is to really develop my tensegrity further, this by learning more movements, improving the execution etc.\n\n**Recapitulation**\n\nThere were times where I recapitulated more, these days I try to recap the previous day in the morning of the next. It is essential. If one does not recap the traumas etc., then blockages will remain for sure.If something \"straining\" happens in life, I try to \"sit\" with it for some time and then to \"recapitulate\" it away. Of course, sometimes \"traces\" remain in your memory, still, you get a certain emotional distance which is helpful.I realized that most people around you are heavily impacted by traumas they never resolved; sometimes, it becomes super obvious to you (as if it is written on their foreheads, so that all their reactions are predictable), but not to the person itself. However, that seems to be a general bias; we are quick to see these things in others, and often blind to our own blockages and biases.\n\n**Stalking**\n\nI changed all kinds of habits and routines, lately I finally changed my diet and kind of cured my sugar addiction. That may have removed some blockages I had. Also, I am trying to be more aware of any habits and I always try to do things \"differently\". I realized how having routines can limit your consciousness since the brain develops \"patterns\" and as a result perception decreases. Of course, some habits have limited alternatives (i.e. which ways you take for work etc.), but changing now and then is always something one never regrets. It somehow gives a different point of view.\n\n**Dark room**\n\nThere was a time I did it more religiously, these days, I need to be kind of \"in the mood\" for it. But whenever the puffs appear, I try to go for it. Sometimes, one just falls asleep or cannot remember what happened. That is why I learned to always take notes once I woke up again.I like dark room practice a lot. I have to say, one should probably NOT have the mind-set of \"ufff, now I will need to DO it again\", but rather \"get still, and let things happen as they happen\". I am not at a stage where I can engage every night \"on purpose\", however, over the years I had my experiences and \"visited\" various points on the J-curve (see below).I should be honest in saying that in the weeks before the experience I describe in this post, I was NOT really practicing a lot. That is why my first thought was \"intent gift\", however, for that, the experience may have been a little too intense and long. You are the judge.Either way, I realized also that what was blocking me was the impression I got from this thread that DRP would be an \"effort\", as if one would go on a treadmill. I feel different, it is something \"beautiful\" which can happen if you \"let things\" happen; this by being in a \"wake-dreaming\" kind of state.\n\n**Dreaming**\n\nI had concluded that dreaming is quite a difficult approach overall. I maybe had a handful of solid dreaming experiences, well, the MOST INTENSE one will be covered in this post. But I am not at a stage where I can \"intentionally\" dream and go through the gates one-by-one. It would be nice if one day I can, right now it seems far off, but you never know.One thing this thread helped me with is that DRP actually represents another approach to \"get there\", and probably one that is more helpful to most.\n\n**Other techniques**\n\nThese five approaches are not the only ones. There are of course others. And one should REALLY be open-minded regarding that. However, the five methods are at least a good basis I guess.I have tried other approaches such as \"gazing\", with good success, they definitely have their place in my personal opinion. I believe in \\`Do what works for YOU\\`. Just make sure that you are not \"convincing\" yourself of anything, if something REALLY happened, then it feels \"REALER than REAL\". You will KNOW (and no one can tell you otherwise).\n\n**The books**\n\nI came to the conclusion that just reading the books once is not enough. Because each one is PACKED with little hints and useful tricks. So while I read a few, it is time to again do that in a more structured manner. It is impressive how much content each of the chapters has, sometimes it can be a little short paragraph which is decisive in other things. But it is a joy to read these, but one has to be REALLY focused also. If you get tired, put it away; otherwise you may miss the important point there. Happens to me all the time.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------\n\n\\*\\*Other thoughts:\\*\\*\n\nI would like to say that sometimes in this thread people talk causally about the \"red zone\", well, I personally believe that for the vast majority of people the red zone is nothing short of TERRIFYING. Probably, if one is able to go there often enough, one\\`s sensitivity towards it decreases I guess. But what I can say from my limited red zone experiences is that this is not only beyond the imagination of most, but many would just try to instantly \"run away\", well, I guess that is what Carlos did himself when Don Juan pushed it a little too far. **I really really RESPECT anything beyond the green zone, and while I wonder how it would be to have \"command\" over where to go;** we are coming to the limitations of language quickly here. All I can say is that the green zone can already enrich one\\`s life so much, because there one already has insights with regard to how \"magical\" this life really is. And how mundane the Matrix is in comparison. But of course, each position of the AP has its place I guess (see below).\n\nOn another note, I realized that once you are on this path (however you want to call it), it WILL affect the other parts of your life. This is not like jogging, where you put on your shoes, go for a run, and come back. This will increase your perception, consciousness etc. Seeing spirits here and there will be something you will just causally notice, where before it may have given you sleepless nights. I can also see how some people could easily \"lose it\" and break their minds, if they are not grounded in some way. That is an aspect that can be scary.\n\nLast but not least, everyone has an individual path and this one is not linear. I had weeks during which I did nothing, because either I was \"stuck\", or \"frustrated\" or there were other barriers (fear, confusion etc.). It is not a pony farm. And I feel that this will not really change much, in life there are phases where things \"flow\" more and phases where you somehow do not feel \"aligned\". I try to avoid New Age lingo here, but I guess you understand what I am trying to express. I guess the RoF has its ways to pull us back now and then.\n\nFurthermore, I learned that nothing in \\`sorcery\\` is linear or \"black and white\". There are not even clear answers to basic questions. Why would one engage in it? Well, there is no answer even to that question which would satisfy the typical Western mind in any way. You work, to make money; you eat less to lose weight etc. Well, when it comes to higher consciousness, there are such simple answers as far as I can see. But that is also what makes it so fascinating at the same time. It is kind of BEYOND that \"logic\"; while at the same time it feels \"realer than real\". I don't know...---------------------------------------------------\n\nAnyways, I decided to make this post because it would help me to get pointers with regard to how I could continue this path I am currently on. And what I should conclude from the experience I will now describe in detail.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Experience**\n\nThat experience felt \"realer than real\", without question it was one of the most intense / beautiful experiences in my life.It was the **27/11/2023, I could not fall asleep. Around 03:03** local time (yesterday), I suddenly fell into an \"in-between state\". While I was lying down (and not in an upward position), I soon saw the first beautiful \"puffs\" which you see during DRP. However, I was just \"going with it\" and reaching out for some of them, just appreciating their beauty, this without the actual idea of doing anything much with these.Then however, while I was still lying down and expecting to just fall asleep, I suddenly see the most DEFINED and most beautiful puff I have ever seen in my 2 years of (irregular) dark room practice.*PS: Please be aware that I did NOT take any substances whatsoever; also, this was WAY more intense than any \"trip\".*\n\n\\*\\*It was more like an \"orb\", it was almost perfectly round, it changed its colors and looked quite mesmerizing. Then, I discovered a face on it, the face looked a little \"nasty\" and \"jester-like\"; but at that point I was DETERMINED to not let this one go. It \u201cdanced\u201d in front of me (in an almost provoking way) and I am sure it would have left soon.\\*\\*Hence, I \"grabbed\" the orb as hard as I could, this not physically, but by focusing my eyes on it and not letting it go anywhere. I am not sure how long this took, probably just a few seconds, but the \"wrestling\" with the orb felt rather long and draining. In the end, I was kind of able to \"mount\" it, and it moved towards / into me.\n\n*Note: Possibly, my frustration of not progressing much within the last week led me to \u201cgo for\u201d this particularly beautiful orb, in the sense of \u201cwhatever happens, I will look into YOU\u201d. Normally, I am not that aggressive, but in this case I was and I had determination to follow this through.*\n\n**From one moment to the next, I was suddenly in \"another world\".** I was in some kind of beautiful room, rather colorful; while it looked not too different to something from planet earth, I am not sure which culture / which time period it would be from. It may as well have been \\`somewhere else\\`. The room looked simultaneously \"new\" and \"ancient\", as if one would have fused 18th century art with Einstein\u00b4s lab and some posh man cave. I know that sounds weird, but that is how it felt and looked like visually.\n\nNow, please understand, everything was COMPLETELY HD, nothing was hazy or anything like that. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from \"how\" you see in normal dreams. I could see all the details, there were various tools in the room also, again, it did not look like anything from our world, but at the same time, it neither looked as something completely foreign to us. I am sorry, it is not easy to describe. It was rather bright, had no windows and the walls had some red, velvety cushions on them.\n\nOk. So, it is not that I was just standing there. From the moment I realized I am in that room, I was standing in front of one of its walls. That particular wall looked \"blank\" and grey, it did not have anything on it. Not only that, I was aggressively hitting that wall with my fist, this repeatedly. I then heard a female voice (coming from a female, human-looking person in the back of the room), saying something like \"that is too strong, too much energy, stop it\". However, I kept hitting my fist on that wall, and every time I did that, there was some energetic response, like colorful \"sparks\" coming out.It was a bit as if I was still wrestling with that ORB, without I realizing that I was already now in that room.\n\nThen, suddenly, a man (who apparently also was in the room) came up, and also said something like \"too much excess energy......wait\", he then turned around and touched my back with his back; all this why I kept on hitting the wall.Immediately, I felt that he was somehow \"aligning\" my energy with his, I could even see that visually. I stopped hitting the wall and felt amazing.Even though we did not talk yet, I directly understood that he somehow had taken the \"excess energy\" I had from before and aligned our energies.\n\nOnce I was on that \"frequency\" of the man (sorry for the word), things calmed down and I fully realized that I was somewhere \"else\" than just a moment ago. I was absolutely AMAZED by that realization and also appreciated the \"friendly\" atmosphere (some of my previous experiences were rather scary). The man and I had a short conversation. He gave a very warm energy and had an understanding look on his face.He was probably middle-aged, dark hair, slim and had a friendly face. He did not look familiar to me (dark eye-brows, slim lips, cheek bones, not very tall...before you ask, NO, he did not look like Carlos). I do remember that I asked several questions and that the man gave me some very short answers, this with an understanding expression on his face. He had a slight smile and made me feel comfortable. Although his answers were short, I immediately felt that they were authentic. Unfortunately, I cannot completely remember the conversation. I should also say, that (also because of previous dark room experiences etc.) I was not fearful but enjoyed it all, especially once I realized that I am REALLY somewhere \"else\".\n\nBut that was just the beginning, Things were about to get REALLY far out.The man and the woman led me to a room next door. I just silently followed and somehow realized that I will be \"shown more\", this without talking.The room was dark, looked a bit like a sports hall, it was cozy, not too wide. I was lying down on a matt, just to realize that there was already a whole group of \"people\" / \"beings\" in the room, while a few more entered. Most were already lying down. Some seemed to quietly talk in languages I could not identify. Without anyone telling me anything, I realized that \"everyone\" came here to \"dream together\" and access another world together. My mind was blown!\n\nI remember taking a moment to actually look at one of the participants in more detail; this just to realize that these were rather \"Alien-looking\"; however, it felt as if these were \"avatars\" of other people or something like that. I am sorry if that all sounds absolutely insane, however, I GUARANTEE that all this was \u00b4REAL\u00b4, wherever it took place (in whatever universe)! I was thinking to myself \"oh, so as if everything was not enough already, I just realized that aliens are real also?\" I had to smile about that thought and the situation.The vibe was very friendly and warm, not cold in any way. The other beings looked even kind of cute because they had colors and some painted shapes on them. There were maybe around 20 other beings in that room. I should note that the energy of most of these beings felt very \"young\", these were beings who were not old (whatever that means for where they were from). Some of these seemed to have a female energy to them. Also, I would not say that these were IOBs, rather, these were some kind of avatars with people \u201clike\u201d me \u201cin\u201d them? I am not entirely sure about my own appearance in that situation (whether it also looked like an \"avatar\" or something).\n\nSorry to dwell on it, but I could already feel with confidence that this was NOT a dream in that sense. I was somewhere else and these beings were doing something they did before. All this did not come from my brain in any shape or form, my brain just \"received\" all that.I just \"went with it\" and acted as if I knew what I was doing, while I really was not.What followed, was some kind of \"group dreaming\" session. Everyone was lying on the ground, and we all could see each other and interact, but AGAIN in another world. It was beautiful. It was as if different beings from different places were \"exploring\" together. It was incredible.I am not sure how long this phase lasted, maybe a few hours.\n\nAt some point, it ended. However, right after everyone \"came back\" to the world in that sports hall, suddenly there is the sound of a \"scream\". It came from the outside of the room. I ran there to see what had happened. One of the beings was crying, looking at a scene which looked like an accident. A vehicle had crashed against a being, and the being seemed injured. I talked to it, but it was not in a bad mood, it said \"no, nothing serious\", while to my eye the injury looked rather severe. The being walked off (and also seemed to merge into another appearance).\n\nAt that point, it was almost over. I just remember that I asked another question to the man with the dark hair from before, I asked something like \"so how will all this end?\", and he replied by pointing at the being who was hit by that vehicle and said \"like that maybe\". The answer did not make me feel very comforted but seemed honest.\n\nAnyways, I felt how this experience came to an end and while I tried hard to stay there longer, I did not succeed and soon woke up in my bed.Immediately I took notes, in order to not forget too much.I was AMAZED like rarely before in my life.I KNEW that this was not some lucid dream or fantasy. That stuff was just somewhere else, and somehow, I managed to visit! This first and foremost by being lucky (right place at the right time?).\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring the next 3h or so I quickly took notes and also started to think about what just happened. I still did not figure it all out. However, some ideas came to my mind since then:\n\na. While I was not actively engaging in dark room practice and I rather thought that I would fall asleep, that ORB appeared (so like a \"strong\" puff, the strongest I have seen so far).\n\nb. When I realized how unique it was, I REALLY went for it in terms of \"grabbing\" it; like, \"whatever you can show me, SHOW ME IT NOW\".\n\nNote: Since I was not able to \"see\" such an HD puff before, I believe that someone / something SEND it to me. It was NOT my \"achievement\". All I did was going for it, this despite I was not upright but lying down.\n\nc. Apparently, I succeeded in \"mounting\" that orb, because it \"transported\" me to that other \"world\". Also, looking at that room with the wall, I realized that these 2 people may have \"send out\" ORBS and \"transport\" the receivers back through that wall (= portal?) to wherever they were. Note that they probably did that with all the entities which took part in that \"session\"; apparently I was one of the last visitors (a handful came after me).\n\nd. The man with the dark hair must have been some kind of \\`scout\\`. He knew what he was doing; and was leading me to the session. As explained, he also \"aligned\" my assemblage point to a precise position beforehand. Also, note how he took that \u201cexcess energy\u201d.\n\ne. The MOST MIND-BOGGLING scene was the \"dream within a dream\" that happened. Not once, but twice. Not only that, but all entities who were present were fully aware that wherever they came from, they would now \"dream together\" and get into another dream. Only later I realized that this is one of the gates of dreaming! It felt so EASY in that moment, but I would not really know how to replicate a \"dream within a dream\" experience right now!\n\nf. There was some kind of message / there were answers to various questions I had, unfortunately I do not recall many details. Also, all events there seemed to \"stand for something\". Sorry, but again we come to limitations of language here.\n\ng. I felt welcome, still I was aware that possibly I was some kind of \"uninvited guest\". The man seemed to be aware with it but there were no issues once he had \"aligned\" my energy with his. I made sure to not behave in any strange way during that \"ceremony\".\n\n**I really hope that in the future, I will get \"invited back\" to that group I was a \"part of\". I will never forget the whole thing in my life.**\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nEither way, to make a long story short, by taking this \"dark room opportunity\", I somehow (WITHOUT REALIZING in that moment) managed to open most of the \"gates of dreaming\", not because of my own actions, but rather by just following these persons / entities that were there.There is no doubt that my AP was somewhere DEEP on the J-curve, during that \"accident\" even in the red zone (at least that is my feeling).\n\nSo here is the thing. In the weeks beforehand I have not been practicing much (also note that I have neither seen any science fiction movies for a while!). So my first thought was, \"well, this was an intent gift then\"?However, it did not really feel like that.Instead, it felt like this:\n\n\\- Someone out there \"reached out\" and took on the entities that were responsive to that. My only \"luck\" was that I really went for that orb.\n\n\\- There are people / entities who engage in \"group dreaming\".\n\n\\- It seems likely that there are MANY more groups / maybe lineages we are aware of. \n\nI personally believe that there is not really any randomness. Rather, there is full causality, but sometimes we are not able to realize that...\n\nThe rest just \"happened\" once I \"entered\" it that is why this was NOT my own work, but the work from another person / being.\n\nIt would be incredible if I could learn / get better in \"making such an experience happen\", however, I wonder to which degree that can be done / even should be done.\n\nNothing about that experience felt \"wrong\" in any way, quite the opposite, the worlds, the beings, the vibe, everything was INCREDIBLY beautiful and positive, well, this until that \"crash\" outside at least. I would think that the entire experience was around the red zone of the J-curve, for certain the \u201caccident\u201d scene was.\n\nThere was also some kind of message behind that accident, and the person with dark hair told me some kind of \"answer\" about one of my questions after it, unfortunately, I could not remember all that in detail.\n\nI fear that the more time passes, even less I will remember from that dream, that is why I took notes right after.\n\nThis was not a \"dream\" or \"fantasy\" which everyone has. This was REAL, wherever it happened.**So did I just get lucky here? By sneaking in there (via the orb)?**\n\nAll I can say is, if someone can \"with intent\" and \"will\" access such other worlds, wow, my deepest respect. It is like having \"another life\" this this one here, or even several ones.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------\n\n**Various questions**\n\nAs you can imagine, I would now have various questions (if you prefer, DM me rather than posting publicly).\n\nQuestion 1:Did someone from this group here send me that \"orb\"?\n\nQuestion 2:Was someone else from this group here in that same \\`dreaming meeting\\` (on the 27/11/2023 at around 04:30 GMT+1)? Do you remember \"being\" there, too?\n\nQuestion 3:Could it be that some other person / being send the ORB? If yes, who?\n\n*Note: I am not connected to any group.*\n\nAll I can say is that if the answers to Q1 and Q2 are \"no\", **then my conclusion would be that there ARE other communities out there, and they DO practice \"dreaming together\"**. Wherever these groups are physically, they DO exist for SURE.And yes, they are \"reaching out\" by sending these \"orbs\", and one has the chance to enter.So to make a long story short, I guess I got just \"lucky\" here rather than receiving a generous intent gift.\n\nAll the best, any comments / thoughts / pointers / questions are highly appreciated.\n\nFF\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------\n\n*PS: Excuse my English.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDITED for formatting at 15:55.\n\nEDITED for formatting 17:57.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Generous INTENT GIFT or something deeper?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "4 Gates Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1854ml8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_as3sfzaz", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "4 Gates Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1701104490.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1701096468.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gone for a few years, this did me well because while this thread is very helpful of course (and the new animations are definitely amazing), one will quickly realize that it can be a double-edge sword to read the thread for too long; because the downside is to take on some &amp;quot;pre-determined&amp;quot; ideas one has read about in the thread and these can actually impact your \u00b4sorcery\u00b4 negatively, because your brain may &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; various phenomena before actually &amp;quot;experiencing&amp;quot; these. That is why I came to the conclusion that the best way is to come, read, but then to leave and \u201cforget\u201d before engaging in one own`s practice again. I realized that to me personally, `sorcery` is not really something you &amp;quot;do&amp;quot;, but rather something you &amp;quot;let happen&amp;quot; if that makes any sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan is to spend some weeks here again (i.e. to ask questions, to get over barriers I have etc.), but to &lt;strong&gt;then leave for some years once more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had told Techno that I have a list of various questions, however, this event happened just recently (see the \u201cexperience\u201d below) and I guess I should post it first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also would like to be fair by stating that most likely I do not qualify for becoming part of this lineage here; it is very good that you are doing this work and I am sure that you will eventually find the 5 males and 5 females to continue the lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post is about the most intense experience I had so far (as you will see below). I wonder what your take on it is and in which way I could continue this particular path after that experience.You can also see some questions below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background info&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of practice, I have not always been a &amp;quot;good boy&amp;quot;, but at the same time I still managed to implement the methods at least for a few years. &lt;strong&gt;Overall, I would still consider myself in the &amp;quot;beginner\u2019s stage&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; Here is a short summary of what I did in the last years:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tensegrity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do a handful of moves every morning, this for ca. 2 years now. I REALLY have to learn all the other ones, I feel that I have not even explored 5% of tensegrity and its possibilities. I also &amp;quot;massage&amp;quot; that point to the front and right of the belly button every day.I realized that this is not only about energy as such, but also about kind of bringing your INTENT also to the physical world by making bodily movements you would NOT do if all this was not real. For me, it is kind of &amp;quot;reminding&amp;quot; myself of the other side every day. But as I said, there is A LOT more to this, I realized that tensegrity is ESSENTIAL and one should do it every single day. I am in the process of reading the &amp;quot;Magical Passes&amp;quot; book (the movements I know I got from the YouTube videos of the three women). My intent is to really develop my tensegrity further, this by learning more movements, improving the execution etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recapitulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were times where I recapitulated more, these days I try to recap the previous day in the morning of the next. It is essential. If one does not recap the traumas etc., then blockages will remain for sure.If something &amp;quot;straining&amp;quot; happens in life, I try to &amp;quot;sit&amp;quot; with it for some time and then to &amp;quot;recapitulate&amp;quot; it away. Of course, sometimes &amp;quot;traces&amp;quot; remain in your memory, still, you get a certain emotional distance which is helpful.I realized that most people around you are heavily impacted by traumas they never resolved; sometimes, it becomes super obvious to you (as if it is written on their foreheads, so that all their reactions are predictable), but not to the person itself. However, that seems to be a general bias; we are quick to see these things in others, and often blind to our own blockages and biases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stalking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I changed all kinds of habits and routines, lately I finally changed my diet and kind of cured my sugar addiction. That may have removed some blockages I had. Also, I am trying to be more aware of any habits and I always try to do things &amp;quot;differently&amp;quot;. I realized how having routines can limit your consciousness since the brain develops &amp;quot;patterns&amp;quot; and as a result perception decreases. Of course, some habits have limited alternatives (i.e. which ways you take for work etc.), but changing now and then is always something one never regrets. It somehow gives a different point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a time I did it more religiously, these days, I need to be kind of &amp;quot;in the mood&amp;quot; for it. But whenever the puffs appear, I try to go for it. Sometimes, one just falls asleep or cannot remember what happened. That is why I learned to always take notes once I woke up again.I like dark room practice a lot. I have to say, one should probably NOT have the mind-set of &amp;quot;ufff, now I will need to DO it again&amp;quot;, but rather &amp;quot;get still, and let things happen as they happen&amp;quot;. I am not at a stage where I can engage every night &amp;quot;on purpose&amp;quot;, however, over the years I had my experiences and &amp;quot;visited&amp;quot; various points on the J-curve (see below).I should be honest in saying that in the weeks before the experience I describe in this post, I was NOT really practicing a lot. That is why my first thought was &amp;quot;intent gift&amp;quot;, however, for that, the experience may have been a little too intense and long. You are the judge.Either way, I realized also that what was blocking me was the impression I got from this thread that DRP would be an &amp;quot;effort&amp;quot;, as if one would go on a treadmill. I feel different, it is something &amp;quot;beautiful&amp;quot; which can happen if you &amp;quot;let things&amp;quot; happen; this by being in a &amp;quot;wake-dreaming&amp;quot; kind of state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dreaming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had concluded that dreaming is quite a difficult approach overall. I maybe had a handful of solid dreaming experiences, well, the MOST INTENSE one will be covered in this post. But I am not at a stage where I can &amp;quot;intentionally&amp;quot; dream and go through the gates one-by-one. It would be nice if one day I can, right now it seems far off, but you never know.One thing this thread helped me with is that DRP actually represents another approach to &amp;quot;get there&amp;quot;, and probably one that is more helpful to most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These five approaches are not the only ones. There are of course others. And one should REALLY be open-minded regarding that. However, the five methods are at least a good basis I guess.I have tried other approaches such as &amp;quot;gazing&amp;quot;, with good success, they definitely have their place in my personal opinion. I believe in `Do what works for YOU`. Just make sure that you are not &amp;quot;convincing&amp;quot; yourself of anything, if something REALLY happened, then it feels &amp;quot;REALER than REAL&amp;quot;. You will KNOW (and no one can tell you otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came to the conclusion that just reading the books once is not enough. Because each one is PACKED with little hints and useful tricks. So while I read a few, it is time to again do that in a more structured manner. It is impressive how much content each of the chapters has, sometimes it can be a little short paragraph which is decisive in other things. But it is a joy to read these, but one has to be REALLY focused also. If you get tired, put it away; otherwise you may miss the important point there. Happens to me all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Other thoughts:**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to say that sometimes in this thread people talk causally about the &amp;quot;red zone&amp;quot;, well, I personally believe that for the vast majority of people the red zone is nothing short of TERRIFYING. Probably, if one is able to go there often enough, one`s sensitivity towards it decreases I guess. But what I can say from my limited red zone experiences is that this is not only beyond the imagination of most, but many would just try to instantly &amp;quot;run away&amp;quot;, well, I guess that is what Carlos did himself when Don Juan pushed it a little too far. &lt;strong&gt;I really really RESPECT anything beyond the green zone, and while I wonder how it would be to have &amp;quot;command&amp;quot; over where to go;&lt;/strong&gt; we are coming to the limitations of language quickly here. All I can say is that the green zone can already enrich one`s life so much, because there one already has insights with regard to how &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; this life really is. And how mundane the Matrix is in comparison. But of course, each position of the AP has its place I guess (see below).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On another note, I realized that once you are on this path (however you want to call it), it WILL affect the other parts of your life. This is not like jogging, where you put on your shoes, go for a run, and come back. This will increase your perception, consciousness etc. Seeing spirits here and there will be something you will just causally notice, where before it may have given you sleepless nights. I can also see how some people could easily &amp;quot;lose it&amp;quot; and break their minds, if they are not grounded in some way. That is an aspect that can be scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, everyone has an individual path and this one is not linear. I had weeks during which I did nothing, because either I was &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;frustrated&amp;quot; or there were other barriers (fear, confusion etc.). It is not a pony farm. And I feel that this will not really change much, in life there are phases where things &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; more and phases where you somehow do not feel &amp;quot;aligned&amp;quot;. I try to avoid New Age lingo here, but I guess you understand what I am trying to express. I guess the RoF has its ways to pull us back now and then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I learned that nothing in `sorcery` is linear or &amp;quot;black and white&amp;quot;. There are not even clear answers to basic questions. Why would one engage in it? Well, there is no answer even to that question which would satisfy the typical Western mind in any way. You work, to make money; you eat less to lose weight etc. Well, when it comes to higher consciousness, there are such simple answers as far as I can see. But that is also what makes it so fascinating at the same time. It is kind of BEYOND that &amp;quot;logic&amp;quot;; while at the same time it feels &amp;quot;realer than real&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t know...---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I decided to make this post because it would help me to get pointers with regard to how I could continue this path I am currently on. And what I should conclude from the experience I will now describe in detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That experience felt &amp;quot;realer than real&amp;quot;, without question it was one of the most intense / beautiful experiences in my life.It was the &lt;strong&gt;27/11/2023, I could not fall asleep. Around 03:03&lt;/strong&gt; local time (yesterday), I suddenly fell into an &amp;quot;in-between state&amp;quot;. While I was lying down (and not in an upward position), I soon saw the first beautiful &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; which you see during DRP. However, I was just &amp;quot;going with it&amp;quot; and reaching out for some of them, just appreciating their beauty, this without the actual idea of doing anything much with these.Then however, while I was still lying down and expecting to just fall asleep, I suddenly see the most DEFINED and most beautiful puff I have ever seen in my 2 years of (irregular) dark room practice.&lt;em&gt;PS: Please be aware that I did NOT take any substances whatsoever; also, this was WAY more intense than any &amp;quot;trip&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**It was more like an &amp;quot;orb&amp;quot;, it was almost perfectly round, it changed its colors and looked quite mesmerizing. Then, I discovered a face on it, the face looked a little &amp;quot;nasty&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;jester-like&amp;quot;; but at that point I was DETERMINED to not let this one go. It \u201cdanced\u201d in front of me (in an almost provoking way) and I am sure it would have left soon.**Hence, I &amp;quot;grabbed&amp;quot; the orb as hard as I could, this not physically, but by focusing my eyes on it and not letting it go anywhere. I am not sure how long this took, probably just a few seconds, but the &amp;quot;wrestling&amp;quot; with the orb felt rather long and draining. In the end, I was kind of able to &amp;quot;mount&amp;quot; it, and it moved towards / into me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Possibly, my frustration of not progressing much within the last week led me to \u201cgo for\u201d this particularly beautiful orb, in the sense of \u201cwhatever happens, I will look into YOU\u201d. Normally, I am not that aggressive, but in this case I was and I had determination to follow this through.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From one moment to the next, I was suddenly in &amp;quot;another world&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; I was in some kind of beautiful room, rather colorful; while it looked not too different to something from planet earth, I am not sure which culture / which time period it would be from. It may as well have been `somewhere else`. The room looked simultaneously &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ancient&amp;quot;, as if one would have fused 18th century art with Einstein\u00b4s lab and some posh man cave. I know that sounds weird, but that is how it felt and looked like visually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, please understand, everything was COMPLETELY HD, nothing was hazy or anything like that. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; you see in normal dreams. I could see all the details, there were various tools in the room also, again, it did not look like anything from our world, but at the same time, it neither looked as something completely foreign to us. I am sorry, it is not easy to describe. It was rather bright, had no windows and the walls had some red, velvety cushions on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. So, it is not that I was just standing there. From the moment I realized I am in that room, I was standing in front of one of its walls. That particular wall looked &amp;quot;blank&amp;quot; and grey, it did not have anything on it. Not only that, I was aggressively hitting that wall with my fist, this repeatedly. I then heard a female voice (coming from a female, human-looking person in the back of the room), saying something like &amp;quot;that is too strong, too much energy, stop it&amp;quot;. However, I kept hitting my fist on that wall, and every time I did that, there was some energetic response, like colorful &amp;quot;sparks&amp;quot; coming out.It was a bit as if I was still wrestling with that ORB, without I realizing that I was already now in that room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, suddenly, a man (who apparently also was in the room) came up, and also said something like &amp;quot;too much excess energy......wait&amp;quot;, he then turned around and touched my back with his back; all this why I kept on hitting the wall.Immediately, I felt that he was somehow &amp;quot;aligning&amp;quot; my energy with his, I could even see that visually. I stopped hitting the wall and felt amazing.Even though we did not talk yet, I directly understood that he somehow had taken the &amp;quot;excess energy&amp;quot; I had from before and aligned our energies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I was on that &amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot; of the man (sorry for the word), things calmed down and I fully realized that I was somewhere &amp;quot;else&amp;quot; than just a moment ago. I was absolutely AMAZED by that realization and also appreciated the &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; atmosphere (some of my previous experiences were rather scary). The man and I had a short conversation. He gave a very warm energy and had an understanding look on his face.He was probably middle-aged, dark hair, slim and had a friendly face. He did not look familiar to me (dark eye-brows, slim lips, cheek bones, not very tall...before you ask, NO, he did not look like Carlos). I do remember that I asked several questions and that the man gave me some very short answers, this with an understanding expression on his face. He had a slight smile and made me feel comfortable. Although his answers were short, I immediately felt that they were authentic. Unfortunately, I cannot completely remember the conversation. I should also say, that (also because of previous dark room experiences etc.) I was not fearful but enjoyed it all, especially once I realized that I am REALLY somewhere &amp;quot;else&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that was just the beginning, Things were about to get REALLY far out.The man and the woman led me to a room next door. I just silently followed and somehow realized that I will be &amp;quot;shown more&amp;quot;, this without talking.The room was dark, looked a bit like a sports hall, it was cozy, not too wide. I was lying down on a matt, just to realize that there was already a whole group of &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;beings&amp;quot; in the room, while a few more entered. Most were already lying down. Some seemed to quietly talk in languages I could not identify. Without anyone telling me anything, I realized that &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; came here to &amp;quot;dream together&amp;quot; and access another world together. My mind was blown!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember taking a moment to actually look at one of the participants in more detail; this just to realize that these were rather &amp;quot;Alien-looking&amp;quot;; however, it felt as if these were &amp;quot;avatars&amp;quot; of other people or something like that. I am sorry if that all sounds absolutely insane, however, I GUARANTEE that all this was \u00b4REAL\u00b4, wherever it took place (in whatever universe)! I was thinking to myself &amp;quot;oh, so as if everything was not enough already, I just realized that aliens are real also?&amp;quot; I had to smile about that thought and the situation.The vibe was very friendly and warm, not cold in any way. The other beings looked even kind of cute because they had colors and some painted shapes on them. There were maybe around 20 other beings in that room. I should note that the energy of most of these beings felt very &amp;quot;young&amp;quot;, these were beings who were not old (whatever that means for where they were from). Some of these seemed to have a female energy to them. Also, I would not say that these were IOBs, rather, these were some kind of avatars with people \u201clike\u201d me \u201cin\u201d them? I am not entirely sure about my own appearance in that situation (whether it also looked like an &amp;quot;avatar&amp;quot; or something).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry to dwell on it, but I could already feel with confidence that this was NOT a dream in that sense. I was somewhere else and these beings were doing something they did before. All this did not come from my brain in any shape or form, my brain just &amp;quot;received&amp;quot; all that.I just &amp;quot;went with it&amp;quot; and acted as if I knew what I was doing, while I really was not.What followed, was some kind of &amp;quot;group dreaming&amp;quot; session. Everyone was lying on the ground, and we all could see each other and interact, but AGAIN in another world. It was beautiful. It was as if different beings from different places were &amp;quot;exploring&amp;quot; together. It was incredible.I am not sure how long this phase lasted, maybe a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point, it ended. However, right after everyone &amp;quot;came back&amp;quot; to the world in that sports hall, suddenly there is the sound of a &amp;quot;scream&amp;quot;. It came from the outside of the room. I ran there to see what had happened. One of the beings was crying, looking at a scene which looked like an accident. A vehicle had crashed against a being, and the being seemed injured. I talked to it, but it was not in a bad mood, it said &amp;quot;no, nothing serious&amp;quot;, while to my eye the injury looked rather severe. The being walked off (and also seemed to merge into another appearance).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, it was almost over. I just remember that I asked another question to the man with the dark hair from before, I asked something like &amp;quot;so how will all this end?&amp;quot;, and he replied by pointing at the being who was hit by that vehicle and said &amp;quot;like that maybe&amp;quot;. The answer did not make me feel very comforted but seemed honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I felt how this experience came to an end and while I tried hard to stay there longer, I did not succeed and soon woke up in my bed.Immediately I took notes, in order to not forget too much.I was AMAZED like rarely before in my life.I KNEW that this was not some lucid dream or fantasy. That stuff was just somewhere else, and somehow, I managed to visit! This first and foremost by being lucky (right place at the right time?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the next 3h or so I quickly took notes and also started to think about what just happened. I still did not figure it all out. However, some ideas came to my mind since then:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a. While I was not actively engaging in dark room practice and I rather thought that I would fall asleep, that ORB appeared (so like a &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; puff, the strongest I have seen so far).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b. When I realized how unique it was, I REALLY went for it in terms of &amp;quot;grabbing&amp;quot; it; like, &amp;quot;whatever you can show me, SHOW ME IT NOW&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: Since I was not able to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; such an HD puff before, I believe that someone / something SEND it to me. It was NOT my &amp;quot;achievement&amp;quot;. All I did was going for it, this despite I was not upright but lying down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;c. Apparently, I succeeded in &amp;quot;mounting&amp;quot; that orb, because it &amp;quot;transported&amp;quot; me to that other &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;. Also, looking at that room with the wall, I realized that these 2 people may have &amp;quot;send out&amp;quot; ORBS and &amp;quot;transport&amp;quot; the receivers back through that wall (= portal?) to wherever they were. Note that they probably did that with all the entities which took part in that &amp;quot;session&amp;quot;; apparently I was one of the last visitors (a handful came after me).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;d. The man with the dark hair must have been some kind of `scout`. He knew what he was doing; and was leading me to the session. As explained, he also &amp;quot;aligned&amp;quot; my assemblage point to a precise position beforehand. Also, note how he took that \u201cexcess energy\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;e. The MOST MIND-BOGGLING scene was the &amp;quot;dream within a dream&amp;quot; that happened. Not once, but twice. Not only that, but all entities who were present were fully aware that wherever they came from, they would now &amp;quot;dream together&amp;quot; and get into another dream. Only later I realized that this is one of the gates of dreaming! It felt so EASY in that moment, but I would not really know how to replicate a &amp;quot;dream within a dream&amp;quot; experience right now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;f. There was some kind of message / there were answers to various questions I had, unfortunately I do not recall many details. Also, all events there seemed to &amp;quot;stand for something&amp;quot;. Sorry, but again we come to limitations of language here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;g. I felt welcome, still I was aware that possibly I was some kind of &amp;quot;uninvited guest&amp;quot;. The man seemed to be aware with it but there were no issues once he had &amp;quot;aligned&amp;quot; my energy with his. I made sure to not behave in any strange way during that &amp;quot;ceremony&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really hope that in the future, I will get &amp;quot;invited back&amp;quot; to that group I was a &amp;quot;part of&amp;quot;. I will never forget the whole thing in my life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, to make a long story short, by taking this &amp;quot;dark room opportunity&amp;quot;, I somehow (WITHOUT REALIZING in that moment) managed to open most of the &amp;quot;gates of dreaming&amp;quot;, not because of my own actions, but rather by just following these persons / entities that were there.There is no doubt that my AP was somewhere DEEP on the J-curve, during that &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; even in the red zone (at least that is my feeling).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here is the thing. In the weeks beforehand I have not been practicing much (also note that I have neither seen any science fiction movies for a while!). So my first thought was, &amp;quot;well, this was an intent gift then&amp;quot;?However, it did not really feel like that.Instead, it felt like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Someone out there &amp;quot;reached out&amp;quot; and took on the entities that were responsive to that. My only &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; was that I really went for that orb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- There are people / entities who engage in &amp;quot;group dreaming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- It seems likely that there are MANY more groups / maybe lineages we are aware of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally believe that there is not really any randomness. Rather, there is full causality, but sometimes we are not able to realize that...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest just &amp;quot;happened&amp;quot; once I &amp;quot;entered&amp;quot; it that is why this was NOT my own work, but the work from another person / being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be incredible if I could learn / get better in &amp;quot;making such an experience happen&amp;quot;, however, I wonder to which degree that can be done / even should be done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing about that experience felt &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; in any way, quite the opposite, the worlds, the beings, the vibe, everything was INCREDIBLY beautiful and positive, well, this until that &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; outside at least. I would think that the entire experience was around the red zone of the J-curve, for certain the \u201caccident\u201d scene was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also some kind of message behind that accident, and the person with dark hair told me some kind of &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; about one of my questions after it, unfortunately, I could not remember all that in detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fear that the more time passes, even less I will remember from that dream, that is why I took notes right after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was not a &amp;quot;dream&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fantasy&amp;quot; which everyone has. This was REAL, wherever it happened.&lt;strong&gt;So did I just get lucky here? By sneaking in there (via the orb)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I can say is, if someone can &amp;quot;with intent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; access such other worlds, wow, my deepest respect. It is like having &amp;quot;another life&amp;quot; this this one here, or even several ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Various questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, I would now have various questions (if you prefer, DM me rather than posting publicly).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question 1:Did someone from this group here send me that &amp;quot;orb&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question 2:Was someone else from this group here in that same `dreaming meeting` (on the 27/11/2023 at around 04:30 GMT+1)? Do you remember &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; there, too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question 3:Could it be that some other person / being send the ORB? If yes, who?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I am not connected to any group.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I can say is that if the answers to Q1 and Q2 are &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, &lt;strong&gt;then my conclusion would be that there ARE other communities out there, and they DO practice &amp;quot;dreaming together&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. Wherever these groups are physically, they DO exist for SURE.And yes, they are &amp;quot;reaching out&amp;quot; by sending these &amp;quot;orbs&amp;quot;, and one has the chance to enter.So to make a long story short, I guess I got just &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; here rather than receiving a generous intent gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the best, any comments / thoughts / pointers / questions are highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FF&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: Excuse my English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDITED for formatting at 15:55.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDITED for formatting 17:57.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "1854ml8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FractalFreak21", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1854ml8/generous_intent_gift_or_something_deeper/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1854ml8/generous_intent_gift_or_something_deeper/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1701096468.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kb1a4gk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kb0wlfo", "score": 12, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; I am not sure that this will be easy.\n\nThat's what \"cleaning the link to intent\" consists of.\n\nLearning to repeat things.

not at all 4 gates) made him an expert on dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He knew better, but wanted attention so badly he promoted another guy who only seeks attention, at the expense of

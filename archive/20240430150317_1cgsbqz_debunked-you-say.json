Like Taisha and Florinda did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then Cleargreen went on pretending she was helping them, perhaps to justify some of the horrible delusions they created for things like &amp;quot;what does the energy body look like?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course we know!  Carlos taught us that in the Tensegrity moves!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I see it daily now, for perhaps a solid 20 minutes of focusing only on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks just like the tensegrity implies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when we hear some harmful make believe coming out of Cleargreen regarding the double or the energy body, we&amp;#39;re rather perplexed as to what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who really does explore the second attention, visually, wouldn&amp;#39;t insist there aren&amp;#39;t multiple views of it, and that in fact any view of it might have been &amp;quot;conceived&amp;quot; by the old and new seers, and not the only way it could be perceived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because it has no physical matter, doesn&amp;#39;t reflect light, and is only perceived at an alternate position of the assemblage point, where the emanations themselves flow the sensations and feelings to create a particular &amp;quot;sight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &amp;quot;flows&amp;quot; to you, like the bizarre history of a dream you find yourself in, which seems very real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And comes with the &amp;quot;story of your life&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There in the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s actually how our normal reality is created.  It&amp;#39;s just next to impossible to modify it, because billions of people are currently viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so what was seen in the past, is easier to &amp;quot;assemble&amp;quot; now, once you stray away from the attention trap of our blue line reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t say that anything below the deep green line, could never look any other way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus green puffs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that, how did Cleargreen see anything at all? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear they never learned any actual sorcery or the reputation of carlos wouldn&amp;#39;t have fallen to the bottom of the toilet bowl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might be Carol Tiggs told them something, but when it&amp;#39;s diametrically opposed to what Carlos and the witches said, you have to be perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was actually the point of the post, but no one needs to know that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1cgsbqz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1cgsbqz/debunked_you_say/l1yilcd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1714493575.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "l1y806e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "elainebeth", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1714489978.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1cgsbqz", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4qqswemg", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I don't know why but this image just made me sob.

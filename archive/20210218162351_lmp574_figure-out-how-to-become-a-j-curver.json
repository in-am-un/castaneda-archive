So don't expect to see amazing things in the ordinary position.\n\nEvery time you find a detail use it to grab and move there, where there are more of those!\n\nSilence will allow the movement, and a strong, unchanging focus of attention will produce it.\n\nWith some more experience you will realize what you are exactly doing with that!\n\nAnd time. I still can't do it as fast as I would like. In fact yesterday I was 4 hours and I could not reach heightened awareness. A bad day.\n\nLike Dan says, bad days feel like this just because you know the amazing things you could do, but you still do cool things.\n\nBut even on good days, the silence and the attention need to be sustainted for 2 or 3 hours to make a movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What you should perceive while moving down](https://preview.redd.it/hoi8phkb39i61.jpg?width=994&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a0a9c52ab3333bc41b8eb23efd1e1148e2cb136)\n\nThe kinds of things that you see in the drawing are perceived more or less at that position of the assemblage point (the red line on the J curve). I know it because we have similar J curve experiences with Dan, so I bet most of you will have it too.\n\nI admit that I don't understand anything on the next part, while trying to move from the \"second\" to the \"third point\". But I'm too newbie for this. Need some months to figure it out.\n\nI see the stuff in the picture EVERY DAY.

It is confusing at first because you feel that you are standing in the same place, but it is a path that can be done at will, daily.\n\nAs beginners our goal is to get to the \"second point\": heightened awareness, which is at the end of that J curve. And gain control over it.\n\nIt is also the position of the \"enlightentemnt\". And I just talk about it because it was the main thing that motivated me.\n\nCan you imagine how confusing it must be for someone trying to get enlightened, who enters in the r/Enlightenment subreddit? They obviously have no idea about the assemblage point.\n\nYou ask: \"Hi guys, how can I get there?\" And they say: \"No !! There is nothing to do! You are already enlightened, you just have to realize it.\"\n\nIt is partly true, because when your assemblage point is there, you \"are\" in some way the same person; but the attention is completely removed from the internal dialogue, and it is very easy to be silent.\n\nSo that kind of advice will never help anyone. The \"J curvers\" here know how much effort it needs, and you don't get there by chance.\n\nThe only possibility is that they learn to get silent, but this is so tricky. Why?? Because you just can't rest in silence in the normal position of the assamblage point. It doesnt work.\n\nI can only start to force \"perfect\" silence when there are animated dreams in all the puffs, which is on the front side of the J curve, and where you are almost completly desidentified with the dialogue.\n\nThat's when you feel the time stops, and get the bliss waves that are \"harassing\" Dan.\n\nPoor Dan.

Women can skip stages temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The female head is a &amp;quot;hypnogogic image&amp;quot;.  If it&amp;#39;s not an actual inorganic being, just talking to it will summon one. And it will take over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The city is a dreaming scene.  It&amp;#39;s possible to enter those. Or you can take the woman, and insert her into the city, and narrate a story of what she&amp;#39;s doing there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;ll act it out for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s better than any video game I know of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreaming scenes start to come out, as the dreaming double takes over, more and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We like to talk about 10% dreaming double, meaning, you get second attention assist, by sort of  using the double&amp;#39;s ability to perceive that directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 90% dreaming double, reality is up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the things you see along the way become an indicator of having moved down further, than merely seeing inorganic beings at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings exist in a range.  From as low as the assemblage point can go before it has to come up the front, to all the way up at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The length of your spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the very top, that barely visible blue line, you won&amp;#39;t see inorganic beings, nless you get a sudden fright, and the assemblage point slips horizontally.  So IOBs do appear on the blue line, but with sideways movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, a sudden fright can make it move down, in which case you &amp;quot;see stars&amp;quot;, or start to black out, your vision being overwritten with yellow or black, signaling you are about to fall over and bang your head on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; He&amp;#39;s only attacked by waves of enlightenment while he&amp;#39;s driving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And butterflies or moths when I&amp;#39;m walking around.   Insects seem to be able to sense something unusual going on with humans.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan could even get mosquitos to leave him alone, while Carlos got bit right next to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lmp574/figure_out_how_to_become_a_j_curver/gnwfy8s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1613666107.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_lmp574", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gny3z84", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gnxk0cv", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "You are right.

But, see that face in the pic? You can turn her into a \"dance partner\" you can visibly see.\n\nYou'll have a heart attack when she becomes \"real\" and steps out into your room.\n\nIt's just puffery.  You scoop the right hand along the right side and down near the floor so you are bending way down, and gather up brilliant purple light all along the inside of the arm.  Keep moving it up to the left, until it's like you have your arm around a human sized figure.  Keep gazing at the brilliant light, at t he head level, until a face forms.\n\nAt this point you'll be thinking, \"This is sort of cool, but dance with it???\"\n\nEven though no one does such things, you're sort of used to it, and it feels imaginary.  But try anyway.  Any moves you can think of, which can be done very slowly.  You have to keep the pilliar of brilliant purple with the face intact.\n\nEventually, if you can keep it stable as a dance partner for at least a minute, move it to the front, for \"slow dancing\".  Put your hands on its shoulders and gaze at the face.\n\nThen do whatever to give it energy.

You scoop the right hand along the right side and down near the floor so you are bending way down, and gather up brilliant purple light all along the inside of the arm.  Keep moving it up to the left, until it&amp;#39;s like you have your arm around a human sized figure.  Keep gazing at the brilliant light, at t he head level, until a face forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point you&amp;#39;ll be thinking, &amp;quot;This is sort of cool, but dance with it???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though no one does such things, you&amp;#39;re sort of used to it, and it feels imaginary.

You have to keep the pilliar of brilliant purple with the face intact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, if you can keep it stable as a dance partner for at least a minute, move it to the front, for &amp;quot;slow dancing&amp;quot;.

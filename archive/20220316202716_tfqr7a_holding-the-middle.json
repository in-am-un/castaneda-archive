It just seemed in the realm of a fantasy story.\n\nHere's the quote I \"experienced directly\" myself, last night.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n(Carlos speaking to don Juan)\n\nI assured don Juan that I did not want the inorganic being's world no matter what advantages it offered. My statement seemed to please him to no end.\n\n\"You are ready then for one final statement about that world. The most dreadful statement I can make,\" he said, and tried to smile, but did not quite make it.\n\nDon Juan searched in my eyes, I suppose for a glimmer agreement or comprehension. He was silent for a moment.\n\n\"The energy necessary to move the assemblage points of sorcerers comes from the realm of inorganic beings,\" he said, as if he were hurrying to get it over with.\n\nMy heart nearly stopped. I felt a vertigo and had to stomp my feet on the ground not to faint.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd been gifted with Silent Knowledge 2 nights in a row, and was frantic to make sure I got there each night.  To \"prove\" it wasn't just an \"intent gift\".  I didn't want to mislead anyone.\n\nThat picture I posted shows, even when you get to the whitish light it's not enough.\n\nIt has to be \"highly active\" whitish light.  Floating dreams, and materializing magical objects made from intense colors.\n\nI was up to the whitish light, and could see that I was in a phantom room. \n\nBut it was a poorly formed one.\n\nAnd try as I might I couldn't make super cool floating dreams or colorful magical objects appear in the air.\n\nWithout those you can't have the \"Silent Knowledge\" presentation, where all that can be known to man shows up in text, videos, or \"places\".\n\nThat's what makes Silent Knowledge so cool!  Your thought process determines your perception *as you think it*.\n\nAnd I couldn't cross over.\n\nI had \"traces\" of Silent Knowledge. I used to call that, \"Continuous seeing mode\".\n\nSo I ***knew*** what my problem was.  I couldn't stay in the middle of the J curve, so I could finish reaching SK.\n\nI was \"stuck\".\n\nI had Lily near. She wasn't speaking in an audible voice, but I could still feel what she wanted to say.\n\n\"You're expecting it.  That causes the assemblage point to shift, to make what you expect  real.\n\nBut your expectations are premature.    So it's shifting horizontally just before HK, and you can't get it to go further.\"\n\nI thought to myself, \"but can it shift horizontally in the orange zone?\"\n\nLily said, \"Of course.  Don't  you remember don Juan told you that!?  He said, he likes to shift slightly left at the final position sorcerers prefer, to make it 'sublime'.\"\n\nI had to agree, she had a point.  And in fact when you have a question, it's likely don Juan already answered it in the books.\n\nSo I was stuck, and no amount of silence seemed to get it to keep moving.\n\nI had a glimpse of \"not-being\".  A flash of being so alien to myself, due to the silence, that I had no opinion at all about the world.  I didn't \"feel it\" as a human would.\n\nLily said, \"That's it.  Silence is a series of discoveries like that.  You learn \"tricks\".  First you notice all the \"expectations\" you have, as a result of your horrible upbringing.  Torture at the hands of your family.\n\nYou learn to remove those perpetual worries and tendencies as you get silent, and you figure out  your own, \"silence tricks\".\n\nYou want to tell others but eventually you realize, those are personal.  You can't really help anyone by sharing those.  Might even slow them down.\n\nBut it seems, once you got into the orange zone and found you could play around there, and have a lot of fun, you forgot that your current silence level, as nice as it is, isn't enough.\n\nYou're just going through the moves of \"forcing silence\".\n\nYou have to break your silence routine to go further!\"\n\nShe continued, \"Of course, you could use the Tensegrity to go the rest of the way.  But then you'd have to get off the pillows on the bed, and you'd miss the kind of cool magic you only see, if you gaze at the darkness in front of you.  Tensegrity blinds you to anything going on, other than where you are supposed to look. It was designed that way.\n\nShe was right. I didn't want to get off the pillows.\n\nA second IOB floated in, and I noticed I hadn't been seeing as many that night.\n\nI remembered what don Juan said about needing their energy.\n\nI thought to myself, \"Is this because I didn't have enough inorganic beings around earlier?  It's not like I chased them away!  They just didn't show up much.\"\n\nLily suggested I find out.\n\nI looked over at the new IOB who had flown in from the right.\n\nShe had a goofy grin.  She was \"itching\" to just lead me through the final inch of movement.\n\nHer face got brighter and more realistic, and I knew if I said the word, she'd fly left and pull me the rest of the way.\n\nI had a horrible feeling.  I NEEDED her.\n\nI wondered if this was what don Juan was talking about.\n\n\"Not quite\", Lily answered, with no sound.  \"You can make it this far without their help.  But it takes 4 times longer, and when you get there you'll be too tired to enjoy it.\"\n\n\"So show me!\", I told her.\n\n\"I already did.  You're on your own now.\"\n\nAnd she was gone.\n\nI tried everything I could think of, including forcing silence in order to try to find another \"silence trick\", to get it deeper based on removing a human feeling.  Parts of the Human form, is what I thought.  There's still \"parts\" there.\n\nAfter 15 minutes of effort I realized, the harder forcing of silence wasn't working. So I tried raising my hand, to produce effects in the air.  \"Spontaneous Tensegrity\" I thought to myself, and was actually amused by the idea.\n\n\"I'll tickle everything!\"\n\nI could move it around and create ripples in the dreaming fog.  Nice, sharp details with vivid highlights.\n\nA little blue dot exploded, and I realized, those don't really go away.\n\nThey \"bloom\".   Into something.  But I never looked to see what they became.\n\nFor nearly a full minute, I had control over the blue dots.  Their brightness causes you to miss what they \"bloom into\", because those are fairly dark, and easily lost in the second attention fog.  if the dot was the size of a pea, what they turn into, is the size of a medium coin.   A \"quarter\".\n\nThey change to a little scene or \"thing\", floating in the air where they used to be located.\n\nThen I remembered Lily's antenna technique.  You extend the index and pinky fingers, curl the rest, and make what a child would think of as 2 antennas.\n\nLily had shown me I could fly it around in the air, like a plane, and the twisting and turning at the wrist would move my assemblage point, if I watched \"the ripples\".\n\nI was back to watching overall for \"things that shouldn't be there\", instead of anticipating what I believed was coming.\n\nI remembered Lily had also shown me to blow into the fog, and hum to any details I see.\n\nI had certainly changed the routine.\n\nI crossed the line.\n\nI had SK!\n\nSK is a \"thing\".  Like when you are meditating as a beginner, everything is just the dark grey back of the inside of your eye lid, but then it \"opens up\" into jet black space.\n\nThere's nothing there.  But you can \"feel\" space.\n\nSK is a little like that.\n\nYou can \"feel\" that you are in Silent Knowledge, even if there's no cool fireworks show floating in the air.\n\nI began to wonder, \"Now what about that *sublime* shift left?\"", "edited": 1647466547.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i0xq7nh", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you move the assemblage point to just before the position of Silent Knowledge (&amp;quot;SK&amp;quot;),  the start of the purple, you learn a few things don  Juan told us which made no sense when you read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or at least, you didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; what don Juan was saying.

I couldn&amp;#39;t stay in the middle of the J curve, so I could finish reaching SK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had Lily near. She wasn&amp;#39;t speaking in an audible voice, but I could still feel what she wanted to say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re expecting it.  That causes the assemblage point to shift, to make what you expect  real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your expectations are premature.    So it&amp;#39;s shifting horizontally just before HK, and you can&amp;#39;t get it to go further.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;but can it shift horizontally in the orange zone?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily said, &amp;quot;Of course.  Don&amp;#39;t  you remember don Juan told you that!?  He said, he likes to shift slightly left at the final position sorcerers prefer, to make it &amp;#39;sublime&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to agree, she had a point.  And in fact when you have a question, it&amp;#39;s likely don Juan already answered it in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was stuck, and no amount of silence seemed to get it to keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a glimpse of &amp;quot;not-being&amp;quot;.  A flash of being so alien to myself, due to the silence, that I had no opinion at all about the world.  I didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel it&amp;quot; as a human would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s it.  Silence is a series of discoveries like that.  You learn &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot;.  First you notice all the &amp;quot;expectations&amp;quot; you have, as a result of your horrible upbringing.  Torture at the hands of your family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learn to remove those perpetual worries and tendencies as you get silent, and you figure out  your own, &amp;quot;silence tricks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to tell others but eventually you realize, those are personal.  You can&amp;#39;t really help anyone by sharing those.  Might even slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it seems, once you got into the orange zone and found you could play around there, and have a lot of fun, you forgot that your current silence level, as nice as it is, isn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re just going through the moves of &amp;quot;forcing silence&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to break your silence routine to go further!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She continued, &amp;quot;Of course, you could use the Tensegrity to go the rest of the way.  But then you&amp;#39;d have to get off the pillows on the bed, and you&amp;#39;d miss the kind of cool magic you only see, if you gaze at the darkness in front of you.  Tensegrity blinds you to anything going on, other than where you are supposed to look. It was designed that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was right. I didn&amp;#39;t want to get off the pillows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A second IOB floated in, and I noticed I hadn&amp;#39;t been seeing as many that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered what don Juan said about needing their energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &amp;quot;Is this because I didn&amp;#39;t have enough inorganic beings around earlier?  It&amp;#39;s not like I chased them away!  They just didn&amp;#39;t show up much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily suggested I find out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked over at the new IOB who had flown in from the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had a goofy grin.  She was &amp;quot;itching&amp;quot; to just lead me through the final inch of movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her face got brighter and more realistic, and I knew if I said the word, she&amp;#39;d fly left and pull me the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a horrible feeling.  I NEEDED her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered if this was what don Juan was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not quite&amp;quot;, Lily answered, with no sound.  &amp;quot;You can make it this far without their help.  But it takes 4 times longer, and when you get there you&amp;#39;ll be too tired to enjoy it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So show me!&amp;quot;, I told her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I already did.  You&amp;#39;re on your own now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried everything I could think of, including forcing silence in order to try to find another &amp;quot;silence trick&amp;quot;, to get it deeper based on removing a human feeling.  Parts of the Human form, is what I thought.  There&amp;#39;s still &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot; there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 15 minutes of effort I realized, the harder forcing of silence wasn&amp;#39;t working. So I tried raising my hand, to produce effects in the air.  &amp;quot;Spontaneous Tensegrity&amp;quot; I thought to myself, and was actually amused by the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll tickle everything!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could move it around and create ripples in the dreaming fog.  Nice, sharp details with vivid highlights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little blue dot exploded, and I realized, those don&amp;#39;t really go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &amp;quot;bloom&amp;quot;.   Into something.  But I never looked to see what they became.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For nearly a full minute, I had control over the blue dots.  Their brightness causes you to miss what they &amp;quot;bloom into&amp;quot;, because those are fairly dark, and easily lost in the second attention fog.  if the dot was the size of a pea, what they turn into, is the size of a medium coin.   A &amp;quot;quarter&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They change to a little scene or &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;, floating in the air where they used to be located.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered Lily&amp;#39;s antenna technique.  You extend the index and pinky fingers, curl the rest, and make what a child would think of as 2 antennas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily had shown me I could fly it around in the air, like a plane, and the twisting and turning at the wrist would move my assemblage point, if I watched &amp;quot;the ripples&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was back to watching overall for &amp;quot;things that shouldn&amp;#39;t be there&amp;quot;, instead of anticipating what I believed was coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered Lily had also shown me to blow into the fog, and hum to any details I see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had certainly changed the routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I crossed the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had SK!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SK is a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.  Like when you are meditating as a beginner, everything is just the dark grey back of the inside of your eye lid, but then it &amp;quot;opens up&amp;quot; into jet black space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing there.  But you can &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SK is a little like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; that you are in Silent Knowledge, even if there&amp;#39;s no cool fireworks show floating in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to wonder, &amp;quot;Now what about that &lt;em&gt;sublime&lt;/em&gt; shift left?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tfqr7a/holding_the_middle/i0xq7nh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1647465877.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_tfqr7a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i17w685", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1647646619.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i17eocj", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The exact point.\n\nStealing them for a pic!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i17w685", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stealing them for a pic!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_tfqr7a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tfqr7a/holding_the_middle/i17w685/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1647646619.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i17eocj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1647638842.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_tfqr7a", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "You guys probably read the books all the time, so this is yet another \"inspirational quote\".

The flaw of the average man is that he thinks the result of a shift is purely mental.

He emphatically added that visions of that kind are automatically rejected by the new seers.\r  \n\r  \n\"Those visions are the product of man's inventory,\" he went on. \"They are of no value for warriors in search of total freedom, because they are produced by a lateral shift of the assemblage point.\"\r  \n\r  \nHe stopped talking and looked at me. I knew that by lateral shift he had meant a shift of the point from one side to the other along the width of man's band of emanations instead of a shift in depth. I asked him if I was right.\r  \n\r  \n\"That's exactly what I meant,\" he said. \"On both edges of man's band of emanations there is a strange storage of refuse, an incalculable pile of human junk. It's a very morbid, sinister storehouse. It had great value for the old seers but not for us.\r  \n\r  \n\"One of the easiest things one can do is to fall into it. Yesterday Genaro and I wanted to give you a quick example of that lateral shift. That was why we walked your assemblage point.

If the shift is considerable, the results are called hallucinations.\"\r  \n\r  \nI asked him to explain the act of walking the assemblage point. He said that once warriors have attained inner silence by stopping their internal dialogue, the sound of the gait of power, more than the sight of it, is what traps their assemblage points. The rhythm of muffled steps instantly catches the alignment force of the emanations inside the cocoon, which has been disconnected by inner silence.\r  \n\r  \n\"That force hooks itself immediately to the edges of the band,\" he went on. \"On the right edge we find endless visions of physical activity, violence, killing, sensuality. On the left edge we find spirituality, religion, God. Genaro and I walked your assemblage point to both edges, so as to give you a complete view of that human junk pile.\"\r  \n\r  \nDon Juan restated, as if on second thought, that one of the most mysterious aspects of the seers' knowledge is the incredible effects of inner silence. He said that once inner silence is attained, the bonds that tie the assemblage point to the particular spot where it is normally placed begin to break, and the assemblage point is free to move.\r  \n\r  \nHe said that the movement ordinarily is toward the left, and that such a directional preference is the natural reaction of most human beings, but that there are seers who can direct that movement to positions below the point's customary spot. The new seers call that shift \"the shift below.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Seers also suffer accidental shifts below,\" he went on. \"The assemblage point doesn't remain there long, and that's fortunate, because that is the place of the beast. To go below is counter to our interest, although the easiest thing to do.\"\r  \n\r  \nDon Juan also said that among the many errors of judgment the old seers had committed, one of the most grievous was moving their assemblage points to the immeasurable area below, which made them experts at adopting animal forms. They chose different animals as their point of reference and called those animals their nagual. They believed that by moving their assemblage points to specific spots they would acquire the characteristics of the animal of their choice; its strength, wisdom, cunning, agility, or ferocity.\r  \n\r  \nDon Juan assured me that there are many dreadful examples of such practices even among the seers of our day. The relative facility with which the assemblage point of man moves toward any lower position poses a great temptation to seers, especially to those whose inclination leans toward that end. It is the duty of a nagual, therefore, to test his warriors.\r  \n\r  \nHe told me then that he had put me to the test by moving my assemblage point to a position below, while I was under the influence of a power plant. He then guided my assemblage point until I could isolate the crows' band of emanations, which resulted in my changing into a crow.\r  \n\r  \nI again asked don Juan the question I had asked him dozens of times. I wanted to know whether I had physically turned into a crow, or had merely thought and felt like one. He explained that a shift of the assemblage point to the area below always results in a total transformation. He added that if the assemblage point moves beyond a crucial threshold, the world vanishes. It ceases to be what it is to us at man's level.\r  \n\r  \nHe conceded that my transformation was indeed horrifying by any standards. My reaction to that experience proved to him that I had no leanings toward that direction. Had it not been that way, I would have had to employ enormous energy in order to fight off a tendency to remain in that area below which some seers find most comfortable.\r  \n\r  \nHe further said that an unwitting downshift occurs periodically to every seer, but that such a downshift becomes less and less frequent as their assemblage points move farther toward the left. Every time it occurs, however, the power of a seer undergoing it diminishes considerably. It is a drawback that takes time and great effort to correct.\r  \n\r  \n\"Those lapses make seers extremely morose and narrow-minded,\" he continued, \"and in certain cases, extremely rational.\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i17eocj", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guys probably read the books all the time, so this is yet another &amp;quot;inspirational quote&amp;quot;.

It\u2019s almost like an infinite inventory expansion. Instead of trying to shrink their Island of the Tonal, they want to expand it.\n\nI once heard a Hindu comment about Mormons riding around on bikes, trying to convert India.  He said, \u201cSure, we welcome Jesus along with all of our other holy deities.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t assimilate stoners. Give those Mormon boys a few years, and they\u2019ll be sitting in caves smoking ganga too.\n\nDaoism ought to be the clear winner in what\u2019s the closest to Carlos\u2019 sorcery, except that they became involved in money making and expanded their hierarchy of heaven so much that it became mere gibberish, only useful for selling trinkets at the temple.\n\nAs a result, Daoists are mostly ritual sellers. They have highly complex rituals to bless or curse anything you like.  For a price.\n\nSome services are said to reduce their lifespan by a few years, in which case the price is even higher.\n\nOddly, most of what you might want will tend to fall into that category. In that respect, they\u2019re a little like dentists. It\u2019s easy for them to up-sell you.\n\nDaoists, like the Hindus, have also gone in the direction of expanding their Island of the Tonal.\n\nIf you believe that\u2019s not a big deal, you should try helping people learn sorcery. Occasionally you run across someone who seems promising, because they can say the right words at the right time.\n\nIf you\u2019re silent, you can detect silent knowledge in people\u2019s words. You just *know* when someone actually has some understanding.\n\nAnd when you run across someone who sounds like they have knowledge, it\u2019s easy to get excited. Maybe they only need a little push in the right direction, and decades of hard work can be saved!\n\nIt\u2019s never so.\n\nIt always turns out, they\u2019ve simply expanded their Island of the Tonal to include the writings of many different meditation systems. They don\u2019t possess silent knowledge. They posses the words of others who had silent knowledge.\n\nAs soon as you try to get them to focus on a specific technique so that you can learn what results they get, and tinker accordingly, you find out the truth.\n\nThey tell you, \u201cFirst I opened my heart chakra, then I used the blue glow from my life force to propel a mandala matrix of happiness towards\u2026\u201d\n\nShit.\n\nAnother hopeless cause.\n\nWhy? That person is after attention. They aren\u2019t after silent knowledge. In fact, it\u2019s likely they don\u2019t even know the difference between seeking something, and talking about seeking.\n\nThey\u2019ll do nothing but talk, and never get around to any real work.\n\nAll of their attention is focused on other people, instead of learning to reduce the Island of the Tonal enough to let them escape from time to time.\n\nAnd likely there's drug usage behind it all. They've collected all the explanations from various systems, to glorify one odd experience they had during their last drug trip.  By giving it a name in their ever expanding inventory list, they believe they've made progress.\n\nBut all of their attention is focused on justifying things, not on learning.\n\nIf your attention is focused on other people, you\u2019ll tend to become a list collector.\n\nAn \u201cexpert\u201d on what you\u2019re trying to accomplish, minus the actual accomplishment. You\u2019ll feel like you reached your goal when you can rattle off your list to some poor associate who can\u2019t get away, and has to listen.\n\nI\u2019m discussing the social side of things here. The overall motivation, and what it does to a person\u2019s internal dialogue.\n\nThe meditation techniques themselves, in all three of these systems, work just fine.\n\nThose are like submarines. You can plow down into the dark ocean of awareness daily, using them.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t get out and look around, and your waking world remains as fussy and overwhelming as it is for nearly all people, the little daily vacation won\u2019t get you much of anywhere in the long run.\n\nYou have to integrate, and reduce. Integrate the altered states of consciousness into your waking world, and reduce the noise.\n\nThe absolute best way to do that is to learn to be silent.\n\nBut even learning silence isn\u2019t the ultimate tool to shrink the Island of the Tonal.\n\nYou need to add on some stalking. Not stalking to accomplish a goal. But stalking of yourself, to let your rough edges stick out, and get rubbed the wrong way.\n\nYou need to set up the circumstances to play \"Whac-A-Mole\" with your own Tonal.\n\nNormally when someone\u2019s rough edges get rubbed the wrong way, it results in an alteration to their internal dialogue. It becomes quite angry, or afraid, or guilty. That\u2019s why conflict is so unpleasant.\n\nIt\u2019s like a direct assault on the thing with which you identify: that little nagging voice in your head.\n\nWhen a person is mostly silent, that means they\u2019re on constant lookout for relapses. It seems that some force in the universe orders us to take an inventory, from time to time. That means, even if you can get silent, it won\u2019t be perfect. You\u2019ll have to honor that inventory command.\n\nBut, if you\u2019ve recapitulated, you\u2019ll be able to easily drop whatever your internal dialogue dredges up as a result of that command.\n\nBy keeping silent whenever you haven\u2019t had the command to think, and then dropping the thinking the instant you discover it returning, you can remain in a fairly advanced state of consciousness, very near to full on heightened awareness.\n\nIt\u2019s a balance you can reach.\n\nBut then, there\u2019s Cholita\u2026\n\nCholita is a witch from my past with Castaneda, who's gone mad and is in need of full time care.\n\nShe's not only completely insane, but she's angry to boot.\n\nIf she\u2019s not at peace, no one is at peace.\n\nStrewn up the street where we now live, are piles of pulverized pottery. Cholita went on a rampage while I wasn't around, and trashed the immediate neighborhood.\n\nWho knows why?  A neighbor said the wrong thing?\n\nAnd it's my duty to take care of her.\n\nHow long?\n\nForever if she lets me.\n\nThat's the world of sorcery.  Sometimes it gets messy.  Just take a look at private class notes, such as the excellent ones written by Corey.\n\nYou might look at those and say, Castaneda's world was chaotic.  He's not a sorcerer!\n\nYou're really missing the point if you believe that.\n\nSorcerers aren't sadhus, hold up in a cave smoking ganga.  They're out in the world, bumping up against real people, with real problems.    And sometimes they have charge of the real people, with real problems.\n\nThat's fine!  It's actually part of the process of learning sorcery.\n\nAlone, it's easy to be tranquil and saintly.  If the universe commands you to think, you can easily dismiss it a second later.\n\nBut it's much harder to drop the command to take an inventory, when you\u2019ve just been smacked in the face for no obvious reason.\n\nIt\u2019s also very hard not to dig up old habits regarding human interactions, when you find yourself forced into a completely unfair, one sided social conflict.\n\nProbably all humans, given a choice, will try to turn a bad situation into a better one by using what they\u2019ve learned in their life.\n\nTheir tools are \"fussing around\", and \"rewarding\". Using a combination of threats and bribes,  they try to manipulate the people around them.\n\n\"I will do this, so that you will do that.\"\n\nWhen it doesn\u2019t work just right, they tinker with the \"what they\u2019ll do\" part, and also with the \"what they\u2019ll expect\".\n\nThere\u2019s a range of allowable failure before they fall apart and resort to desperation.\n\nWhen that range is exceeded, such as when the person involved in the interaction is completely mad, it\u2019s inevitable that people will turn to the oldest tricks in their book.\n\nThe ones they learned as children. Whimpering, whining, crying, punching things, cursing, tantrums, and so on.\n\nYou can be so silent that you can take a step across several worlds, to land your foot precisely where you had in mind on another planet.\n\nThat's not all that hard to learn!\n\nBut you\u2019re still a fussy bastard down at the base of it all.  A tantrum throwing, fussy, self-pity filled, me, me, me, self-absorbed baby.\n\nAnd you need to reduce that.  One \"me\" at a time.\n\nReduce the Island of the Tonal.\n\nGet rid of the expectations.  Yes, \"you will do this\".  But you don't expect that \"they will do that.\"\n\nYou have to expect nothing in return.  As Don Juan said, reduce your wants and needs to next to nothing.\n\nThat's the only way to achieve silence in that situation, where you're down in the muck and have  to remain there.\n\nGiving yourself over to aid other people, and especially if they\u2019re completely unreasonable and will give you nothing in return, is a fast path to reducing the Island of the Tonal.\n\nIf, you know how to get silent.  You need that extra tool to make it work.\n\nWhen you feel the fussy side coming on,  you \"feel\" why. What it wants.\n\nThen you drop it and return to silence.  You no longer want that thing. It's not expected anymore.\n\nThat\u2019s bound to happen many times a day, if you have your own Cholita to help.\n\nRefusing to get fussy, and dropping that as soon as you detect it, doesn\u2019t exactly remove that tendency.\n\nBut it softens the edges of it.  It exposes the rough parts and lets you do some work on smoothing them off.\n\nIt\u2019s like a rock polisher. You put the jagged rocks in the tumbler, they rub up against grit, and the sharp edges wear off.\n\nWhere you had a pile of sharp rocks you could squeeze hard in your hand, and draw blood, you now have smooth pebbles that will slide and ooze out of the way, if you have to put pressure on them.\n\nWe need to rub up against the world, in order to smooth off our Island of the Tonal.\n\nAnd one path to that, is almost half of the discipline of Buddhism.\n\nYou can find that written in charred bone,  on the backs of some bar girls in Thailand.\n\nA Buddhist reminder to have compassion and serve others.\n\nEdited: four times\n\nContinued later due to word limits", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Buddhist Compassion", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Buddhism"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"hk3cew2mt8441": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 162, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hk3cew2mt8441.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bed0f714d1d8cec5ce92fdde268e79bed1848d0"}, {"y": 324, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hk3cew2mt8441.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f462b9d8a3d25a92384145d732575c433e71cd7"}, {"y": 480, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hk3cew2mt8441.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14001640bc5d6730570d7c48fdca973ecaeebd5d"}, {"y": 960, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hk3cew2mt8441.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05961549bddce0efb16f1587dc2072cf90505767"}, {"y": 1440, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hk3cew2mt8441.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d88f369b141bdad989d3e0c38ec4f674d54355"}, {"y": 1620, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hk3cew2mt8441.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ea6a00734d08e736a90c91837fdb1a0f580b69c"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hk3cew2mt8441.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b327a0cfd88f87c9ba554676d2911d5062aa38a"}, "id": "hk3cew2mt8441"}}, "name": "t3_e9r79w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Buddhism", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/pWiP_UPcPiBKZgtFdb7T_-4JBRUnqt7c8QmWzaVSgnA.jpg", "edited": 1576183581.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1576174236.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hk3cew2mt8441.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0b327a0cfd88f87c9ba554676d2911d5062aa38a\"&gt;A Sadhu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhism in its purest form is about as close to Carlos\u2019 sorcery as I\u2019ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you could argue that Hinduism is too, but it\u2019s rather vast and seems to lack sobriety.

But you don&amp;#39;t expect that &amp;quot;they will do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to expect nothing in return.  As Don Juan said, reduce your wants and needs to next to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the only way to achieve silence in that situation, where you&amp;#39;re down in the muck and have  to remain there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Giving yourself over to aid other people, and especially if they\u2019re completely unreasonable and will give you nothing in return, is a fast path to reducing the Island of the Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If, you know how to get silent.  You need that extra tool to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you feel the fussy side coming on,  you &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; why. What it wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you drop it and return to silence.  You no longer want that thing. It&amp;#39;s not expected anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s bound to happen many times a day, if you have your own Cholita to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Refusing to get fussy, and dropping that as soon as you detect it, doesn\u2019t exactly remove that tendency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it softens the edges of it.  It exposes the rough parts and lets you do some work on smoothing them off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s like a rock polisher. You put the jagged rocks in the tumbler, they rub up against grit, and the sharp edges wear off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you had a pile of sharp rocks you could squeeze hard in your hand, and draw blood, you now have smooth pebbles that will slide and ooze out of the way, if you have to put pressure on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to rub up against the world, in order to smooth off our Island of the Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one path to that, is almost half of the discipline of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find that written in charred bone,  on the backs of some bar girls in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Buddhist reminder to have compassion and serve others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: four times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued later due to word limits&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "50b6d81e-6006-11ea-9dff-0e00c04b8ffb", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "e9r79w", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 23, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/e9r79w/buddhist_compassion/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/e9r79w/buddhist_compassion/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1576174236.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "faozwwk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1576276461.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_faopnby", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;You do your best, for that situation.

From Carlos\u2019 books:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**I had learned the magical act of \"paying back to the spirit of man\" from don Juan. I had asked him once, overwhelmed by the realization that I could never pay him back for all he had done for me, if there was anything in the world I could do to even the score. We were leaving a bank, after exchanging some Mexican currency.**\n\n**\"I don't need you to pay me back,\" he said, \"but if you still want to pay back, make your deposit to the spirit of man. That's always a very small account, and whatever one puts in it is more than enough.\"**\n\n**By helping that sick child I had merely paid back to the spirit of man for any help that my little boy may receive from strangers along his path.**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m posting here. To pay back Carlos, by making a deposit to the spirit of man.\n\nI\u2019d like to give it more power. The ability to use *intent*, on purpose.\n\nMagic. The real kind you don\u2019t have to make excuses about.\n\nI\u2019m all for charity, but it has to be appropriate for pursuing sorcery knowledge or it\u2019s outside this topic.\n\nIn that sense, the Buddhist concept of Compassion seems to be compatible.\n\nYou put yourself at the service of some unseen force, which has a connection to everything else.\n\nFor sorcerer\u2019s, that force would be *intent*.\n\nYou don\u2019t just pamper what comes along, you actually figure out the best way to help, and do that regardless of the trouble you get over it.\n\nIf you give yourself over to pursuing *intent*, rather than happiness, you\u2019re freed from a lot of concerns.\n\nDid you make the right choice?\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter. When you follow intent, a choice presents itself to you. You didn\u2019t pick it.\n\nYou only choose to accept that one, or not. Either way, no harm done.\n\nIf you accept it, you give up the idea of rewards. You do your best, for that situation.  And you keep it up, until the situation is resolved.\n\nMaybe that takes forever, in the case of protecting someone like Cholita, or her counterpart, Zuleica.\n\nWhat\u2019s accomplished by this is, you\u2019ve broken the endless chain of pursuing your own happiness.\n\nIt\u2019s a cycle that has to be broken, or else you won\u2019t travel as freely between worlds.\n\nYour mom put you on the path of battling against those around you, to get the best cookies,  toys, fastest place in the food line, prettiest mate.\n\nWe\u2019ve been fussing around our whole lives, pursuing pointless stuff.\n\nYou can temporarily suspend that activity, by spending a lot of time practicing sorcery.\n\nBut you haven\u2019t broken that cycle yet. You\u2019re still a cookie chaser at the base of it all.\n\nIf you put yourself at the service of something larger than yourself, and accept the punishments that come with hard work, you become engaged in the ordinary activities you used to do, except that now you aren\u2019t a happiness seeker.\n\nYou\u2019re still on a path. Everyone has to be on a path.\n\nBut it\u2019s not your own path. It\u2019s from a wiser source.\n\nYou retrain yourself to work, with no rewards expected.\n\nIf you find yourself a really troublesome condition, that\u2019s the best you can get.\n\nA perfect petty tyrant is ideal, if you have to remain around them all day long.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to understand what they can help you accomplish, until you\u2019re actually able to assemble other worlds and understand how important our social connections are.\n\nIn private class notes, we saw Carlos claim \u201cWe\u2019ve been betrayed!\u201d over a woman who turned out to be chasing a man, instead of wanting to learn sorcery.\n\nI believe that type of account often ends up being used to \u201cdisprove\u201d Carlos was what he said.\n\nQuite the opposite is true! It\u2019s hard enough to escape our current positions of the assemblage point, if you have peace and quiet to yourself.\n\nBut you can.\n\nThen, even a little turmoil in the social structures around you, has a profound effect on your practices.\n\nThe opposite is also true. If you get an energetic mass of people pursuing sorcery, *intent* starts to push them all along.\n\nIf you\u2019re at the lead, you get the best part of that.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for me to write something to post here, be a little surprised about what it concludes, go into the bathroom for a while, and then see the entire room go nuts with power.\n\nI can\u2019t describe what you might see, that\u2019ll vary. But it\u2019ll be 10 times more of whatever you\u2019ve learned to do.\n\n*Intent* pulls you along. While you\u2019re riding it\u2019s wave, you get more power.\n\nThe opposite happens when there\u2019s social turmoil.\n\nCarlos\u2019 experience with the cheating doctor might have gone like this for him: He was finally getting somewhere, and saw movement in the group. And he could see an abstract structure forming, helping him figure out the next thing to do.\n\nBut then the social turmoil came along, and he couldn\u2019t find the structure.\n\nAlso, the progress he saw in the group was fading away.\n\nHe sought to discover why, and uncovered the affair.  And everyone else knew about it. It was rumor central in private classes.\n\nHe was betrayed!\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\n*Intent* isn\u2019t blind. It has access to everything going on. You can\u2019t hide an affair from it.\n\nThe ordinary interpretation of that private class written account is, why should Carlos care?\n\nThey hid it pretty well. Just ignore it. It\u2019s none of his business.\n\nBut it is! Sorcerer\u2019s are not happiness pursuers. They follow *intent*.\n\nWe might want to ignore other people, and pretend they have no effect on us, but in fact we were socialized by sticking other people right into our face.\n\nWe were taught how to interact with them, above anything else.\n\nSo deep down inside are a lot of rough edges, related to dealing with other people. Traumatic stuff even.\n\nWe have training for how to deal with unreasonable people. But it doesn\u2019t include being forced to bump up against them, when you really didn\u2019t want to be there.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like getting smacked in the face for no reason, and not being able to get angry about it.\n\nBeing angry will disconnect you from the *intent* of it, even if it\u2019s only in a small way.\n\nWhile dealing with an unreasonable situation, various deeply buried pieces of your Island of the Tonal are exposed.\n\nHow you deal with bullies for example.\n\nHow you deal with your best efforts not being good enough.\n\nHow you relate to the people around you, what you expect them to do, and what you do if they don\u2019t live up to expectations.\n\nAny of those exposed parts of the Tonal, which contribute to a noisy internal dialogue, have to go.\n\nThey have to be understood, and undone.\n\nYou have to shrink your Island of the Tonal.\n\nAnd that\u2019s likely the purpose of Buddhist Compassion too.\n\nMaybe some Buddhists in here can tell me if I\u2019m on the wrong track. But I believe the \"Compasion\" is all about living outside your smaller self.\n\nThe purpose is to shrink the Island of the Tonal by putting yourself in the service of something outside that island. Or as a Buddhist might say, to reduce the demands of \u201cthe self\u201d.\n\n*Intent* is not only outside us, and yet aware and intelligent, but it can actually plan things in order to help you shrink more of that Island of the Tonal.", "edited": 1576270615.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_faopnby", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why am I harping on Buddhist compassion?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because some parts of the Buddhist path are super compatible with sorcery, and some aren\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d like to stick some of Carlos\u2019 knowledge into other things, to perpetuate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not actually convert anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I merely want to point out, \u201cyou can learn to do this too!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without getting lynched of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then let them figure out how it also makes sense in Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fire Kasina folks are perfect examples of what might happen if people started pursuing the experiences, rather than the religious aspects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019re already compressing balls of visible energy using tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhist\u2019s who are heavily into meditation are also hard workers.

The real kind you don\u2019t have to make excuses about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m all for charity, but it has to be appropriate for pursuing sorcery knowledge or it\u2019s outside this topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that sense, the Buddhist concept of Compassion seems to be compatible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You put yourself at the service of some unseen force, which has a connection to everything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For sorcerer\u2019s, that force would be &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don\u2019t just pamper what comes along, you actually figure out the best way to help, and do that regardless of the trouble you get over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you give yourself over to pursuing &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, rather than happiness, you\u2019re freed from a lot of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you make the right choice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn\u2019t matter. When you follow intent, a choice presents itself to you. You didn\u2019t pick it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You only choose to accept that one, or not. Either way, no harm done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you accept it, you give up the idea of rewards. You do your best, for that situation.  And you keep it up, until the situation is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that takes forever, in the case of protecting someone like Cholita, or her counterpart, Zuleica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s accomplished by this is, you\u2019ve broken the endless chain of pursuing your own happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a cycle that has to be broken, or else you won\u2019t travel as freely between worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your mom put you on the path of battling against those around you, to get the best cookies,  toys, fastest place in the food line, prettiest mate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve been fussing around our whole lives, pursuing pointless stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can temporarily suspend that activity, by spending a lot of time practicing sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you haven\u2019t broken that cycle yet. You\u2019re still a cookie chaser at the base of it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you put yourself at the service of something larger than yourself, and accept the punishments that come with hard work, you become engaged in the ordinary activities you used to do, except that now you aren\u2019t a happiness seeker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re still on a path. Everyone has to be on a path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s not your own path. It\u2019s from a wiser source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You retrain yourself to work, with no rewards expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself a really troublesome condition, that\u2019s the best you can get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A perfect petty tyrant is ideal, if you have to remain around them all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s hard to understand what they can help you accomplish, until you\u2019re actually able to assemble other worlds and understand how important our social connections are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In private class notes, we saw Carlos claim \u201cWe\u2019ve been betrayed!\u201d over a woman who turned out to be chasing a man, instead of wanting to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that type of account often ends up being used to \u201cdisprove\u201d Carlos was what he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite the opposite is true! It\u2019s hard enough to escape our current positions of the assemblage point, if you have peace and quiet to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, even a little turmoil in the social structures around you, has a profound effect on your practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The opposite is also true. If you get an energetic mass of people pursuing sorcery, &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; starts to push them all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re at the lead, you get the best part of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not uncommon for me to write something to post here, be a little surprised about what it concludes, go into the bathroom for a while, and then see the entire room go nuts with power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t describe what you might see, that\u2019ll vary. But it\u2019ll be 10 times more of whatever you\u2019ve learned to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; pulls you along. While you\u2019re riding it\u2019s wave, you get more power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The opposite happens when there\u2019s social turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos\u2019 experience with the cheating doctor might have gone like this for him: He was finally getting somewhere, and saw movement in the group. And he could see an abstract structure forming, helping him figure out the next thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then the social turmoil came along, and he couldn\u2019t find the structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the progress he saw in the group was fading away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sought to discover why, and uncovered the affair.  And everyone else knew about it. It was rumor central in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was betrayed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; isn\u2019t blind. It has access to everything going on. You can\u2019t hide an affair from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ordinary interpretation of that private class written account is, why should Carlos care?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They hid it pretty well. Just ignore it. It\u2019s none of his business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is! Sorcerer\u2019s are not happiness pursuers. They follow &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We might want to ignore other people, and pretend they have no effect on us, but in fact we were socialized by sticking other people right into our face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were taught how to interact with them, above anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So deep down inside are a lot of rough edges, related to dealing with other people. Traumatic stuff even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have training for how to deal with unreasonable people. But it doesn\u2019t include being forced to bump up against them, when you really didn\u2019t want to be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s nothing like getting smacked in the face for no reason, and not being able to get angry about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being angry will disconnect you from the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of it, even if it\u2019s only in a small way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While dealing with an unreasonable situation, various deeply buried pieces of your Island of the Tonal are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How you deal with bullies for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How you deal with your best efforts not being good enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How you relate to the people around you, what you expect them to do, and what you do if they don\u2019t live up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any of those exposed parts of the Tonal, which contribute to a noisy internal dialogue, have to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have to be understood, and undone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to shrink your Island of the Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s likely the purpose of Buddhist Compassion too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe some Buddhists in here can tell me if I\u2019m on the wrong track. But I believe the &amp;quot;Compasion&amp;quot; is all about living outside your smaller self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The purpose is to shrink the Island of the Tonal by putting yourself in the service of something outside that island. Or as a Buddhist might say, to reduce the demands of \u201cthe self\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; is not only outside us, and yet aware and intelligent, but it can actually plan things in order to help you shrink more of that Island of the Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/e9r79w/buddhist_compassion/faopnby/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1576269711.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_e9r79w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_e9r79w", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_e9r79w", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "faob5v3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1576260749.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fao9d1a", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "At this point, I'm too sensitive to dream awake.

Or you can just leap to the third, but it sounds silly until the mind has been accustomed to the principles, which occurs through modifying outward behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the highest teachings, compassion is one the words used to attempt to describe the nature of mind, which is said to be a union of &amp;quot;emptiness and compassion/clarity/bliss/awareness.&amp;quot; The teacher points out this nature of mind to the student, who then tries to stabilise awareness in it. This may be how far the tonal has to shrink to get by the eagle. From your comments and posts I&amp;#39;d guess you have ample experience of this nature of mind. I imagine heightened awareness is pretty much it, when totally purged of thoughts/notions at least. Total silence could be equated to &amp;quot;emptiness&amp;quot; and whatever that still occurs within that, because it always does, to the second part of the union.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/e9r79w/buddhist_compassion/fata1oq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1576336099.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_e9r79w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fbv5uhs", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1577125990.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fbtyogq", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "They do!

We had some on-line errands to take care of.\n\nAll of her on-line presence was gone, and she was sure it was free mason hackers trying to destroy her. Or if not free masons, some other notorious group.\n\nBut probably free masons, since Carlos used to rent a practice room at the Masonic Temple in LA.\n\nI have to say, if you have a Cholita of your own around, I completely understand why you never get in enough practice time.\n\nBut, you can definitely use people you need to take care of, to achieve deeper levels of silence.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nIf any of you figure out how, let me know.\n\nI tried to engage her in talking about the old group, but at one point she started screaming at the top of her lungs. Saliva flew from her mouth and splattered all over my hands and legs.\n\nThe force of her scream was ear shattering.\n\n\u201cI want my life back!!!!!\u201d, she kept screaming. \u201cNOW!!!!!!!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know whether it was from being mentally silent, or from the fact that her screaming mouth was only a few inches away from mine, and Cholita is very sexy.\n\nBut whatever the cause, the screaming didn\u2019t really bother me.  I was more curious about the energy involved in it. It didn\u2019t seem to expel a lot of dark energy.\n\nThere seemed to be a middle ground for her to be at her strongest. Not too angry, not too calm.\n\nWe took care of her problems, to some extent. And then I tried to stabilize her assemblage point, and shift it to some kind of temporary happy place.\n\nAfter a lot of doings, we went out to eat at a middle eastern restaurant.\n\nCholita changed tables 6 times. The servers finally gave up on trying to figure out where we\u2019d be served our food.\n\nWe ended up sitting at a table next to a middle eastern woman and her mother. She had 3 very young boys, all well mannered and obsessed with the single smart phone they were allowed to share between them. They were watching highly stylized cartoons involving cute characters jumping up and down, with a cricket chirping loudly in the background.\n\nThe youngest of the 3 boys had blue eyes, despite not having blond hair.\n\nI pointed it out to Cholita, who said, \u201cI like blue eyes!\u201d\n\nI was happy to hear that. Maybe we wouldn\u2019t need to change tables again.\n\nThe mother was feeding tiny pieces of pizza to the youngest of the boys, who was just barely old enough to talk. At one point she tore the cheese off a piece, and fed him that.\n\nShe lifted up her fist, raised his hand to make a fist pushing against hers, and said softly, \u201cFight, fight, fight\u2026\u201d\n\nIt took a little time, or maybe he wasn\u2019t finished chewing his mouthful of cheese. But he finally pushed his fist into hers and said, \u201cuh, uh, uh\u201d.\n\nI wanted to turn to Cholita and say, \u201cTHAT\u2019S where the flier\u2019s mind really comes from.\u201d\n\nBut, I\u2019m not absolutely sure of that. And you certainly wouldn\u2019t want Cholita to disagree with you, if at all avoidable. Besides being able to blast anyone with pure anger, she\u2019s also as knowledgeable about Carlos\u2019 classes and teachings as I am.\n\nAnd maybe with a different angle, because she had help from the witches.\n\nAfter finishing an entire large plate of tofu kabobs and basmati rice, Cholita smiled and said,\n\n\u201cYou did it! You made me happy again.\u201d\n\nShe proceeded to tell me a story, knowing that\u2019s what I was always after.  The story rambled a bit, so I've extracted some kind of coherent collection from what she said.\n\nAfter Carlos died, Cleargreen continued to have workshops. And people still got together to practice, but not for very long. Eventually it was more like, they got together for special occasions.\n\nOne Christmas, they had some kind of package exchange. From the list of guests, and my poor memory for faces, I surmised that it was mostly people from my faction. Faction #3.\n\nCarlos set up factions. And very skillfully. There was faction #1, Cleargreen.  But he\u2019d created turmoil in Cleargreen, insuring it would fall apart at some point. He even planted a bomb (Ellis) to insure it.\n\nThus faction #2 would be created from faction #1.\n\nI guess the hope was that one or the other of the factions would learn sorcery and teach others. If one failed, the other might succeed.\n\nBut instead, they sued each other.\n\nAnd then there was faction #3. That\u2019s my group. People who were never part of the inner circle, so they were more like observers, and wouldn\u2019t feel any blame if Cleargreen went wrong.  Without the need to justify actions leading to any blame they might feel, they also might drift back to practicing, even after decades.\n\nThere\u2019s also a faction #4, and maybe a #5, but I can\u2019t get any info on them.\n\nI hope saying they might exist doesn\u2019t lead to any book deals.\n\nCholita got all dolled up for the package exchange Christmas party, the focus of the story she was telling me.\n\nShe put on a miniskirt and fabulous boots.\n\nBut as she said, \u201cThe men weren\u2019t as randy as I\u2019d expected that day.\u201d\n\nI asked if that was always going on. She said that after Carlos died, the facades of his private class students started to come down. Actually, she tried to explain how they de-materialized in a poof, even asking me about what\u2019s behind the wall of fog, and what is it like in the sulfur dune landscape?\n\nI couldn\u2019t figure out what she was trying to say about their facades,  so I suggested they \u201cevaporated\u201d?\n\nNo, that wasn\u2019t it.\n\nShe went on to explain how the package exchange party was more like a game. At one point she was winning too much, and the female host of the party, one of the most beautiful women in private classes, became jealous. She actually became angry with Cholita, and started shoving gifts towards her, with a wicked smile.\n\nJust like that she turned on Cholita!\n\nCholita made some comment about women and human nature. I didn\u2019t understand it.\n\nCholita explained that she and the host of the party were even roommates at one point. Or maybe, when she needed a place to stay (Cholita is a bit of a nomad), she was always welcome there.\n\nThen the story got a bit odd. Cholita explained how she was the roommate of a Rinpoche. A puffed up Tibetan guru. Or maybe not the roommate, but certainly Cholita was sleeping in an adjacent room.\n\nThey were staying at a woman\u2019s large home.  Not the one from the christmas party.  This woman was not associated with Carlos, but rather had discovered the \u201cRinpoche\u201d, and was his backer.\n\nThe Rinpoche was so revered that he sat on a throne while his followers knelt in front of him, and placed gold rings, gold coins, and jewels in his basket.\n\nI had to interrupt Cholita there. \u201cYou know he\u2019s a fake don\u2019t you? A parasite feeding off people\u2019s misery!\u201d\n\nCholita giggled and explained that the host of the Christmas party she\u2019d been accounting, was fucking the Rinpoche.\n\nIn fact, she fucked just about everyone she could, both from Carlos\u2019 former students, and elsewhere when it seemed to be a spiritual environment.\n\nCholita said she was told, \u201cWe\u2019re getting energy from the men!\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t explain the \u201cwe\u201d part, but knowing Cholita, she wasn\u2019t the other person. Cholita believes in troublesome, very long courtships.\n\nAt least, most of the time.\n\nThe owner of the house where the Rinpoche was being \"sponsored\", and where Cholita was sleeping very close to the Rinpoche, found out that he was having sex with women followers.\n\nShe threw him out, saying he wasn't spiritually pure enough.\n\nI asked what happened to the Christmas party host. Cholita started to go over a long list of former private class students, where they were now,  what they were actually up to in private classes, and maybe even what other techniques they\u2019d switched to, instead of continuing to practice Carlos\u2019 sorcery.\n\nAmong the long list was an explanation about how the witches had helped them.\n\nI was immediately curious, and wanted to know if this happened after Carlos died, or before.  The disappearance of the witches is still a  huge mystery.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t answer me, and just kept talking. Florinda helped them the most. She asked me if I knew that Florinda and Taisha were both from overseas?\n\nTaisha still had a little accent.\n\nCholita began to tell me a technique they picked up from the witches, but she didn\u2019t explain any details.  She added, \"Carlos was always behind everything.\"\n\nCholita sort of wore out, stopped talking,  looked down at her empty plate and mumbled,\n\n\u201cI wish I knew where they went too.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: twice.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Another Story from Cholita", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cys2bq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1567459799.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1567445287.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picked Cholita up early on Sunday.

She taunted me that she knew a lot more than I do.  In fact she said, she should be teaching me.\n\n(I'm all for it. Let's get all the hot women from private classes in here to teach us.)\n\nSo here's what I can remember of her stories last night, after I learned that the price was too high, and stopped making mental notes:\n\nCarlos and Ellis might have had sex until they wore themselves out, but Cholita claims that was years before he died.\n\nIt was obvious that Cholita kind of knew who was fucking whom, and how.\n\nI have this theory that women tell other women everything. Just remember that the next time you .....\n\nCholita claims that Carlos told her himself, in no uncertain terms, ALWAYS get paid for services rendered.\n\nI kind of remember him saying that, or else rumors he'd said that.\n\nWe have Corey's excellent private class notes where Carlos advises people not to marry other people in order to help them get citizenship.  He says it'll end up wasting a lot of resources.\n\nMy theories on why:\n\nMoney lost = practice time lost for some people, who have no choice but to work to replace the money.\n\nGiving something to someone else only invites a moocher to keep coming back for more.  Even if you have plenty of whatever they want, having them around will not be a positive for trying to get silent.\n\nBut I suspect there's something to do with recapitulation in there. Debts owed, even if it's to you.\n\nDriving around with Cholita, who  used to be an LA buf, I went by some of the old hangouts.\n\nReal Food Daily was located just below the private class practice hall Carlos used most often.

She taunted me that she knew a lot more than I do.  In fact she said, she should be teaching me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m all for it. Let&amp;#39;s get all the hot women from private classes in here to teach us.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s what I can remember of her stories last night, after I learned that the price was too high, and stopped making mental notes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos and Ellis might have had sex until they wore themselves out, but Cholita claims that was years before he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was obvious that Cholita kind of knew who was fucking whom, and how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have this theory that women tell other women everything. Just remember that the next time you .....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita claims that Carlos told her himself, in no uncertain terms, ALWAYS get paid for services rendered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of remember him saying that, or else rumors he&amp;#39;d said that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have Corey&amp;#39;s excellent private class notes where Carlos advises people not to marry other people in order to help them get citizenship.  He says it&amp;#39;ll end up wasting a lot of resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theories on why:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Money lost = practice time lost for some people, who have no choice but to work to replace the money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Giving something to someone else only invites a moocher to keep coming back for more.  Even if you have plenty of whatever they want, having them around will not be a positive for trying to get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suspect there&amp;#39;s something to do with recapitulation in there. Debts owed, even if it&amp;#39;s to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Driving around with Cholita, who  used to be an LA buf, I went by some of the old hangouts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real Food Daily was located just below the private class practice hall Carlos used most often.

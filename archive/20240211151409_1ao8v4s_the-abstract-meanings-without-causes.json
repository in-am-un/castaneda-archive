It's too easy for beginners to join everyone else out there in pretend magical systems, and to try to fool others into thinking they have advanced knowledge, so that they can steal.\n\nThe way Buddhists do.\n\nOf course, if Buddhists would just write down what their supposedly advanced knowledge is, it would be easy to explain using sorcery, and even to show it was just rank beginner's levels which went to their head.\n\nWhen everything is out in the open, no one can hide behind being \"inscrutable\".\n\nUnfortunately, \"the abstract\" is just that. And it's a very important part of sorcery.\n\nNothing can be said, written, or even thought about, regarding 'the abstract'. This is very hard to accept, until you perceive it yourself, over and over, and try to explain it after the fact. And can't even come up with a single word to start the conversation.\n\nAnd yet, you can become trapped in it and the inorganic beings are happy to sit there beside you while you are trapped, and extract whatever form of \"energy\" it is they're after.\n\nBut don't worry. For a result no worse than getting over a mild cold, they load you up with tons of dark energy and give you passage to their realms. It's a fair trade. You just don't have the knowledge to understand that at the time.\n\nAnd as don Juan said, if you want to move your assemblage point the way sorcerers do, you NEED their dark energy.  \n\n\nSo you inorganic being snobs out there, who like to \"warn\" others against them, are quite simply CLUELESS.  Did you even bother to read all of the books of Carlos?  \n\n\nNo inorganic being \"dark energy\" and no advanced sorcery.  \n\n\nDon't listen to \"warners\". That's a type of Castaneda fan, who will never actually learn any sorcery.  They're just busy bodies.  Wannabe church goers.  With no interest at all in real magic.  \n \n\nWomen who use womb dreaming will inevitably find themselves trapped in 'the abstract'. In the early stages. And they may interpret it as a very \"concrete\" assault on their person.\n\nDon't worry... That's normal too.\n\nThe men get trapped and assaulted also, but they interpret it through their own greed.\n\nSo is 'the abstract' just a negative topic?\n\nNot at all! The abstract is near instant passage to other worlds. While viewing it an internal dialogue is utterly impossible. And when you come out, your assemblage point is free to latch on to another bundle of emanations. So you find yourself emerging from 'the abstract', into a new world that's quite amazing to behold.\n\nJust don't pursue the abstract, or you'll become a cagey pretender.

A reliable interplay of awareness energy, dances among those.\n\nWe know there are \"vacinities\" because of the \"great bands of emanations\", and because our own luminous shell encases relatively consistent ranges of emanations, among humans.  A range we can alter, by stretching our luminous egg.\n\nSo they really are somehow \"located\" near others that they'll always be located near.\n\nBut if you could reach into the dark sea with a magic hand and grab 100 emanations from a specific location, my guess is that only 5 of them had ever lit up.\n\nEver.\n\nAnd so when you perceive the emanations in a specific depth along the J curve, you can still get 20,000 permutations of that particular \"reality\".  Carlos reluctantly gave us that number.\n\nAnd even then, it's probably not much of what \"could be\" there.  \n\nYou focus your awareness, it flows into some emanations, and surrounding ones light  up to also send you back sensations. It's not just the ones you \"noticed\" which send back sensations.\n\nIt's all the ones in that vicinity which have become associated with those.\n\nAnd they associate more easily if some human have used those before.\n\nWhich is how Cholita and Minx made a phantom copy of our home.  By lighting up alternative emanations related to our home.  Some in that \"vicinity\".\n\nIt's also how God came into being. Everyone praying to him, created a bundle that's easy to light up, if you get into the green zone on the J curve.\n\nBy \"easy\", I mean Yogi easy.  Not random person easy.\n\nYogis often write about visiting God, Heaven, or Hell.\n\nAnd you can do all of those.\n\nI have.\n\nBut they aren't important in any way if you don't understand what's actually going on.\n\nI suppose Yogis can use a visit to heaven or hell to deceive followers and make a lot of money, the way Muktananda the dirty underwearing ostrich feather bopper yogi did. \n\nYou was around while Carlos was active in Santa Monica.  And still has delusional followers.\n\nBetter thing to study, in place of God or Heaven, are \"conclusions\" coming from the emanations.\n\nHigh level constructs which emerge from the dark sea on their own, helped by past usage.\n\nIn Silent knowledge you begin to notice such things, and then you notice that you can \"search\" for them, and then also you can \"remember\" them.\n\nSearching is beginners level, \"remembering\" is more advanced.\n\nAt a concrete level it's like knowing the conclusion of a short video you could watch, without watching the video.\n\nIn fact, without any imagery at all.\n\nYou just \"know\" something.\n\nI suspect the Eagle likes that.\n\nThe way a kid who ran around a deserted beach building sand castles for weeks during vacation, would like it if he saw other kids had adopted one and were decorating it with little flags,  putting lego people into the rooms.\n\nMaking his sand castle \"real\" and \"comfy\".\n\nThen on top of that \"meaning\", the Eagle seems to like \"how did you feel about it?\"\n\nThat's what it extracts after we die.

A reliable interplay of awareness energy, dances among those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know there are &amp;quot;vacinities&amp;quot; because of the &amp;quot;great bands of emanations&amp;quot;, and because our own luminous shell encases relatively consistent ranges of emanations, among humans.  A range we can alter, by stretching our luminous egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they really are somehow &amp;quot;located&amp;quot; near others that they&amp;#39;ll always be located near.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you could reach into the dark sea with a magic hand and grab 100 emanations from a specific location, my guess is that only 5 of them had ever lit up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so when you perceive the emanations in a specific depth along the J curve, you can still get 20,000 permutations of that particular &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot;.  Carlos reluctantly gave us that number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even then, it&amp;#39;s probably not much of what &amp;quot;could be&amp;quot; there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You focus your awareness, it flows into some emanations, and surrounding ones light  up to also send you back sensations. It&amp;#39;s not just the ones you &amp;quot;noticed&amp;quot; which send back sensations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all the ones in that vicinity which have become associated with those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they associate more easily if some human have used those before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is how Cholita and Minx made a phantom copy of our home.  By lighting up alternative emanations related to our home.  Some in that &amp;quot;vicinity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also how God came into being. Everyone praying to him, created a bundle that&amp;#39;s easy to light up, if you get into the green zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot;, I mean Yogi easy.

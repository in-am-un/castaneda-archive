It encompasses the very reason Tensegrity can work to convert people into sorcerers.\n\nHere it is at the key moment for this subreddit.  Where scooping and stuffing puffs is done.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\nNow, let's be honest here.   That form really sucks!\n\nI'm no Kylie here.  I take one look at it and start thinking, \"God that must be unpleasant to memorize!  And all the jumping around and weird seemingly pointless movements.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong.  If you see any tensegrity, I already learned it myself.  With Carlos standing there correcting me once in a while.\n\nIt's just that, look at that form!  My God...\n\nBut now I realize, that form is perfect.  Ideal.  And Carlos created it at his most optimistic point.\n\nWhen he had a pure idea in his mind of how the Tensegrity was going to work.\n\nLater he started adding \"exotic things\", like sending a puff probe into outer space, to bring back the awareness of a star or planet.\n\nA warning here for extremely new people, who don't entirely understand what our sorcery is.\n\nIt is NOT a sacred scroll. It's not the wise sayings of the Buddha.  It's not \"the word of the Prophets\".\n\nAnd especially it is NOT qigong.\n\nIn fact all of those things have poisoned our minds so badly, that half the battle of learning sorcery is discovering those prejudices, that pervasive brainwashing, and removing it from that which motivates where we focus our attention.\n\nWe need to reformat the hard drive, and wipe it clean.  Then start over, installing a working system piece by piece.\n\nExcept our daily lives don't allow that.\n\nWe can't just find an old shack up in the mountains, and go hermit until we get the system into better shape.\n\nSo I suppose it's natural to look at unbending intent, long form, and see the \"burden\" it contains. In terms of learning, time consumed doing it,  and disappointment when it doesn't really do anything. And we are supposed to hug our fellow practitioners and smile like a good Catholic at how superior we all are because we're on the \"path with heart\"?\n\nI was going to pick on the Jehovah's witnesses, but Carlos was obsessed with battling \"the Church\".\n\nWhich you can find hints of in Amy's excellent book.\n\nBut don't any beginners go read that one.  Even the old timers cringe over that book.\n\nIf Tensegrity is the essence of a viable path to sorcery, Amy's book shows what can go wrong along the way and how a sorcerer might have to deal with it.\n\nSo if Tensegrity is not like anything else out there, not even chi gung, what is it?\n\nWhy did both don Juan and Carlos have such \"high hopes\" for it?\n\nTensegrity is exactly like an Alien newspaper!\n\nCarlos and Carol Tiggs used to go exploring in other realities where they once found exactly that.  An Alien newspaper.\n\nWith alien font also.  I just picked that picture for this post, because it was funny and captured the \"bizarreness\". But what Carlos found in another world was an ordinary newspaper, printed in an alien language.\n\nAnd he began to try to read it.  Which is not as impossible as it sounds, for a sorcerer.\n\nNow since this post is in the beginners subreddit, let me go back to my statement before.\n\nThat sorcery is NOT based on sacred scrolls.\n\nWe DO WHAT WE SAY WE DO.  And everything you read in this subreddit, is based on stuff people really do, daily.\n\nWe don't point our finger to the highest mountain in Tibet, claiming some mysterious magic man who is so far beyond us we'll never get there, has \"handed down\" some wisdom for us to consume.\n\nWhich I suppose would make me a \"middle man\", dispensing his wisdom without actually being able to understand or do it myself.\n\nThat's what you find in all other systems, with all other teachers.\n\nThis might shock you, but they're all thieves.    All of your magic and spiritual \"teachers\" are thieves.\n\nPeople teaching things they can't actually do themselves, on the basis of it's ok to steal from others because the wise man at the top of Tibet said it's \"good for their eternal souls\".\n\nIf any of you likes that sort of thing, go ahead!\n\nCholita loves it, and often insists I pray for her.\n\nLa Gorda was like that too.\n\nSo if you want to be religious, go for it.\n\nAnd if you want to drink wine, smoke, or do other bad things everyone tends to do when no one is watching, that's fine too.  You can even eat all the sugar you like!\n\nNone of it has anything to do with sorcery other than it tires you out, and sorcerers never have enough energy to do what they want.\n\nJust be sure to remove the portion of your religion which is not compatible with sorcery.\n\nWhile remembering, sorcerers often hide in churches.\n\nOur own lineage had a catholic bishop in it.\n\nI ran into a very powerful sorcerer hiding in the ranks of saffron robe wearing monks in a large asian airport.\n\nIn Taiwan some of the very old Daoists almost surely picked up a strain of \"Islander Shamanism\" still floating around the world, and in the mountains above Taipei,  making them almost actual sorcerers.\n\nOur own lineage had a chinese pirate who did the same, the implication being he found real magic in the new world, so he gave up his previous (bogus) asian practices.\n\nHe \"found something\".  And it was so valuable, he ditched his old life completely.\n\n\"Got that shack in the hills\" is what he did.\n\nBut mainly, he had to put aside what he had learned.  Unlearn it.\n\nBecause in sorcery there's nothing to learn!  It's our natural state.\n\nOne day you'll see that.\n\nYou'll drag yourself out of bed feeling sad that you have to endure all this at your ripe old age, get up because it's now dark enough, do your tensegrity routine, and then things will transform.\n\nHalf your room will be an alien world, and there will be your best friend, a spirit.\n\nAnd if you gaze off into the half of the room that isn't  her world, you'll see choice after choice materialize in the air as dreams.\n\nPlaces to go, things to see.\n\nAnd you'll realize, this is the natural state of humans.\n\nFussing and worrying and regretting, is not.\n\nThose were imposed on us.  Carlos called it \"a foreign installation\".\n\nI still don't believe in the fliers, and won't until I visit Pleiades myself and see them there.\n\nBut I do believe that our natural lifestyle of hunting and gathering in the wilds, the life we evolved to live and did so at least 290,000 years as \"human\", has been erased by thinking too much.  First we created language, and then fairly soon after (40,000 years perhaps)  agriculture, money and religion were imposed on us, making us slaves to a system that we aren't designed for.\n\nSo there we are, trapped in that hellish world where you have to pretend the promises made, if you obey that world's rules, are true.  And the rewards are worth the effort.\n\nWhen they are obviously not. And when we never agreed to all that in the first place.\n\nIn that scenario, Tensegrity is like finding an old alien newspaper at a bus stop.\n\nThere it is, just sitting on the bench.\n\nYou pick it up and wonder, \"What the hell is this?  Is it from a joke shop?\"\n\nBut it looks real.  It even has a coffee spill on it, and you can taste a bit of chocolate frosting on the corner.\n\nIt's just a newspaper.  But it's not human.\n\nCarlos and Carol Tiggs found one of those in an alien world they visited so regularly, they watched a child who lives there grow up.\n\nCarlos was obsessed with the fact that the paper was \"real\".  He even exclaimed so to Carol Tiggs, and tried to get her to look closer and see, it was real!\n\nBut they wisely decided to put it down, and leave it alone.  There was risk of getting trapped in that new world.\n\nThe worlds we travel to seem to come in 4 kinds.\n\nThere are those which are ordinary dream worlds we visit in our sleeping double.  The copy of ourselves which runs around in dreams believing itself to be solid and real, but which is actually building realities out of pieces of it's very own awareness and then playing in them.\n\nNaturally that leaves \"holes\" in it's phantom reality, but we've been given the ability to \"gloss\" over holes, and behave as if a phantom world were perfectly fine, and normal.\n\nIf you do lucid dreaming you can see this yourself.  You wake up in the dream, find your hands, look at objects in the dream, and then have a little doubt.\n\nYou say to yourself, \"Hey, this is a bit too real.  Maybe I'm not actually dreaming after all?\"\n\nAnd so you try to remember how you got there.\n\nWhy are you standing next to an ice cream truck?\n\nThinking hard, you do in fact recall how long you had to work your other job to save up for that truck.\n\nAnd now you are a very happy ice cream sales guy, driving the roads of the city.\n\nIt's all perfectly real...\n\nThat's what humans can do.  They can build a stable reality, out of nonsense.\n\nOne of the 4 kinds of worlds we get to travel to consciously, as sorcerers.\n\nThe next kind is when you convince that double of yours, from deep in dreaming, to come out into the real world.\n\nAnd it will!  Again, no sacred scrolls here.\n\nWe do what we say!\n\nOne day you'll look over at the edge of your bed, and there you will be.  Sitting.  But not facing yourself, eye to eye.  It's as if that's not allowed.\n\nBut it's still you, right there.\n\nDarkroom brings that about.\n\nSo the dreamer can be lost in phantom realms, but the dreamer (our double) can come into the real world.\n\nWe can't control that guy, so I won't even try to explain how to make use of him.\n\nWomen can lay and focus on their womb, and slip off into that guy.\n\nThat's another kind of world we get to travel to.  Where our waking self goes into dreaming in order to guide the other copy of yourself to stop wasting time on pointless phantom worlds, and help us learn sorcery in the real world.\n\nWhile doing that, women pick up a bit of the very thing that Tensegrity is designed to produce.\n\nThe more they pick up, the \"witchier\" they become.  Which has side effects. Trust me on that one.  I live with a witch who's so powerful, I worry she's been kidnapped each time she disappears for weeks.\n\nTensegrity itself is created from the discoveries of the old seers, for what's fun to do inside a dream.\n\nAny little kid might have a small list of such things they learned to do in dreaming, but no one cares so over time they forget it all.  How to fly, how to breathe under water, how to float a foot above the ground.\n\nKids learn those things.\n\nAnd witches can go back and resume that childhood activity.\n\nMen, not so much.  We probably have to use brute force to break into dreaming.\n\nThus darkroom practices.\n\nBoth the method women can use, going directly into sleeping dreaming, and the method men can use, moving their assemblage points while fully awake, lead to the ability to travel to worlds that are more than just phantom creations of our sleeping self.\n\nThat's mostly what Carlos called \"navigating\".\n\nHe often equated it with the end result of sorcery, \"the definitive journey\".\n\nThat's where you get to keep your awareness on death, and explore all of reality without the need to force yourself to be human.  You get to venture completely outside this world we were born into.\n\nSo we now have the 4th kind of visiting other worlds.\n\nWith some of those worlds being real.\n\nOur phantom dream worlds don't have actual energy behind them.\n\nThey're using the mechanism humans have for \"filling in missing details\".\n\nYou can experiment with that, by gazing at ferns.\n\nYou find a confusing sight, let the eyes wander a bit but still keep sight of the shadows and light in the view, and try to silence the mind.\n\nThe \"confusing sight\" activates the hidden mechanism to fill in missing details, and while gazing you see a weird triangular sparkle.\n\nOr maybe a little tug boat pops out!\n\nI once saw a tiny hot air balloon, flying along the pavement because I had been gazing down there.\n\nOr you blank out and when you realize that and lift your head back up, you have memory of a tiny dream you just emerged from.\n\nThat's our \"fill in the gaps\" ability.\n\nPhantom worlds are 100% that.\n\nBut they're much too hard to sustain.\n\nIf you can find a world with its own energy, one that is at least 10% \"real\", you can explore that phantom realm again and again.  Each time it potentially becomes more real as you discover \"new sights\".\n\nAn Alien newspaper is a good one.  That's a vivid memory.\n\nBut an Alien sunset will do.\n\nEach vivid experience there is an aid to finding your way back.\n\nWe're stuck in \"the real world\" because our minds are so filled with the imagery here.\n\nDonuts, sexy clothes, fast cars, mortgage bills.\n\nIt's all mundane stuff and no one in their right mind would call those \"prison keepers\".\n\nAnd yet they are.  Each memory in the mind of \"something real\" ties you back to this reality.\n\nTheir \"realness\" pulls on you to come visit this world.\n\nAn alien newspaper in a world Carlos and Carol visited multiple times, is like one of those \"real' things we know in this world, which keeps us here.\n\nIf Carlos had in fact read the newspaper and maybe convinced Carol to take a look at the funny pages,  they would have been risking what you can find in lucid dreaming when you stop to question whether you are really dreaming, and you have memories of the current \"timeline\" there.\n\nThat you do in fact own an ice cream truck.\n\nReading the newspaper with Carol ran the risk Carlos would remember that's he's late for the office, and can't afford to get chastised by his boss again.\n\nCarol could suddenly remember she has to buy that jello mold today, for the company picnic.\n\nThat's the risk of an alien newspaper.  At least, one that's \"real\" somewhere.\n\nAs beginners we get to play in the phantom realms a very long time, so no one should worry about \"getting stuck in an alternate world\".\n\nYou wish...    That's all I can say.  Admit that would be super cool.  And don't worry. You're still hopelessly stuck in this one.  But I will add, it's one reason exploring other worlds is best done from your bedroom.  It gives you a familiar place to return to, which will automatically pull on you when it's time to go home.\n\nPlus at first we get nothing but crummy phantom worlds.  I don't believe you could actually get stuck in a phantom world.\n\nSo what was Carlos trying to do with tensegrity?\n\nTensegrity is a way to find \"alien newspapers\" in the void.\n\nThe movements move our assemblage point around as we do them.\n\nThe \"high hopes\" don Juan and Carlos had for it, was that you'd \"notice\" some of those alien newspapers.\n\nI don't want to limit this to sights, but it's easier to talk about those.  Just know, you can smell things, feel things, and hear things too.\n\nBut those seem mostly in the \"you wish...\" category.   All too rare.\n\nDoing the tensegrity in the darkness makes this easier.\n\nTake \"unbending intent\" at my favorite spot, where they jump up and grab a puff to stuff it on the side of their stomach.\n\nAfter that the palms rotate in space, pointing down at the floor.\n\nIf you're doing this in full lighting, have never seen anything at all happen, and so you are confused into thinking this is like some other \"system\", perhaps you're trying to copy the \"Kylie fierce stare\" believing that holds the key to sorcery.\n\nThat's a prejudice we all got from that Buddha guy, with the beaming smile to show he's superior to all of  us.\n\nIt's the Hindu trick:  I'm smiling and laughing so much, because I'm superior to you as a result of my meditation techniques.  Which you can buy for a reasonable price.\n\nI ought to give some credit to Krishnamurti for being an old grouchy bastard and not trying to hold that stupid grin on his face, used by most other meditation peddlers. But he was still a con artist.\n\nNone of that is what tensegrity is for.  Though I must admit, the sunglasses and black outfits did look rather cool at workshops.\n\nYou might also be imagining \"there's energy building up\" while doing the Tensegrity.\n\nPerhaps circulating \"chi\" that will somehow lead you to magical powers?\n\nThat's another \"asian crap magic\" delusion in your mind.\n\nIt is NOT what tensegrity does.\n\nIn its purest form you finish doing a tensegrity move in darkness, look up, and there's some bizarre floating flurry of sparkles.\n\nIt's right there!  Up in the air, floating, and you've even seen that before.  Perhaps many times!\n\nBut you glossed over it.  Didn't realize it was \"a thing\".\n\nIt's like an alien newspaper.  The \"realness\" of it can suck you in.\n\nIn \"unbending intent\", eventually you will literally see those purple puffs and scoop them onto your energy pouches.  And it'll stay there!\n\nThat's more like a subscription to an alien magazine.  Very real, even though it's totally nuts and you can't even mention it to your friends without them leaving hastily.\n\nBut don't be offended. It's not that they think you're brainwashed,  believing in nonsense.  No one has ever come across what we're doing.  So they have no reason to go into a \"planned strategy\" regarding your interest in sorcery.\n\nThey've never been exposed to the real thing.\n\nThey're the ones who are brainwashed.  But you've ventured into forbidden realms.  So their everyday \"common sense\" is repulsed.\n\nPretend magic is fine.  \"Going to temple\" is ok by everyone.  And you can get down on your knees and pray to Jesus, as long as you don't force them to do that too.\n\nBut real magic is nuts.  No one is going to share your interest.\n\nAll you can do is collect your alien newspapers until you have so many \"real\" things pulling you off into sorcery style worlds, that it's not difficult anymore.\n\nTake that horrible long form as an example  I dread even looking at it because it fills me with guilt that I don't put in that much effort.\n\nExcept that if you do, it becomes like an alien bookstore.\n\nWe want to find alien newspapers, so we have other \"real\" things in our life, that are outside the horrible swamp we were born into.\n\nThe long form is like going shopping in that alien bookstore.\n\nThe hands rotating over the floor after the puff episode, will literally produce a visual display.\n\nAt the least, you'll see pinkish second attention fog swirl.\n\nBut  you might also please your double, who will come away from the walls of your egg container, and float towards the middle where your physical body is doing the movement.\n\nThe vague pink swirls will now include a swarm of purple.\n\nBut other things can happen.  An inorganic being might like what she sees, and put herself visibly into the scene.\n\nAt first perhaps just a little woman's head on the pinkish swirls.\n\nBut don't think that's the end of that sight.\n\nEventually you could be doing that movement and the entire woman herself stands up from the floor as you swirl your palms in that seemingly pointless movement.\n\nIt's not pointless at all!\n\nCarlos designed something else that was used by the old seers, into that move.\n\nHe didn't \"copy some other system\" as people accuse him of.\n\nThere's some \"dark magic\" in there.\n\nAnd having an entire spirit woman stand up just because you were doing that part of the tensegrity is absolutely not out of the question.\n\nI just walked across the room with my Ally Fancy, who became fully real for me to explain some of the points I'm giving here.  She favors the north east corner of the room, for teaching.\n\nSo what is Tensegrity?\n\nIn many ways it is in fact like an alien bookstore.\n\nWe're looking for \"interesting things\" in it, so that those \"objects\" can allow our attention a path to move away from this world, into the others we can explore.\n\nWith the ultimate goal of finding those which generate their own pull of reality, the way this one does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What is Tensegrity Anyway?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 75, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"x144n8wqdvl91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 57, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x144n8wqdvl91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4f90f0e2b92ae2b2daee62d3a85664f9e58c78b"}, {"y": 115, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x144n8wqdvl91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fc4dc3a2a0ecc1238a95bcba4de3b2e0243b906"}, {"y": 171, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x144n8wqdvl91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4468d8231e1381f5e6d2261e1e11895c1612b8"}, {"y": 343, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x144n8wqdvl91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b396355f2eb1c3d0e5c7288bcfd9911097b78a1"}, {"y": 515, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x144n8wqdvl91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45062689bc35e70c2ba42b67d8e45ae3f0605a3d"}, {"y": 579, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x144n8wqdvl91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d79795dbcf18ef63b2bc0e9e25a6194e30ca1768"}], "s": {"y": 628, "x": 1170, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x144n8wqdvl91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04688418ae92f44d818d6bb62068c2d3520173e4"}, "id": "x144n8wqdvl91"}}, "name": "t3_x5l3df", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 52, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/F88UdMiOjJUrtIdrw8IarzTlIuK6CCJ0A2XWNp2L3so.jpg", "edited": 1662309431.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1662292209.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x144n8wqdvl91.jpg?width=1170&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=04688418ae92f44d818d6bb62068c2d3520173e4\"&gt;I suspect the one Carlos found was entirely Alien language and text.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just got a silent knowledge lecture on what Tensegrity is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately most can&amp;#39;t be described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And surprisingly, &amp;quot;Unbending Intent Long Form&amp;quot; is perhaps the most perfect Tensegrity example Carlos ever gave us.  It encompasses the very reason Tensegrity can work to convert people into sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here it is at the key moment for this subreddit.  Where scooping and stuffing puffs is done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s be honest here.   That form really sucks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no Kylie here.  I take one look at it and start thinking, &amp;quot;God that must be unpleasant to memorize!  And all the jumping around and weird seemingly pointless movements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong.  If you see any tensegrity, I already learned it myself.  With Carlos standing there correcting me once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that, look at that form!  My God...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now I realize, that form is perfect.

And Carlos created it at his most optimistic point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he had a pure idea in his mind of how the Tensegrity was going to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later he started adding &amp;quot;exotic things&amp;quot;, like sending a puff probe into outer space, to bring back the awareness of a star or planet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A warning here for extremely new people, who don&amp;#39;t entirely understand what our sorcery is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is NOT a sacred scroll. It&amp;#39;s not the wise sayings of the Buddha.  It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;the word of the Prophets&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And especially it is NOT qigong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact all of those things have poisoned our minds so badly, that half the battle of learning sorcery is discovering those prejudices, that pervasive brainwashing, and removing it from that which motivates where we focus our attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to reformat the hard drive, and wipe it clean.  Then start over, installing a working system piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except our daily lives don&amp;#39;t allow that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t just find an old shack up in the mountains, and go hermit until we get the system into better shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I suppose it&amp;#39;s natural to look at unbending intent, long form, and see the &amp;quot;burden&amp;quot; it contains. In terms of learning, time consumed doing it,  and disappointment when it doesn&amp;#39;t really do anything. And we are supposed to hug our fellow practitioners and smile like a good Catholic at how superior we all are because we&amp;#39;re on the &amp;quot;path with heart&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to pick on the Jehovah&amp;#39;s witnesses, but Carlos was obsessed with battling &amp;quot;the Church&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which you can find hints of in Amy&amp;#39;s excellent book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t any beginners go read that one.  Even the old timers cringe over that book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Tensegrity is the essence of a viable path to sorcery, Amy&amp;#39;s book shows what can go wrong along the way and how a sorcerer might have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if Tensegrity is not like anything else out there, not even chi gung, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did both don Juan and Carlos have such &amp;quot;high hopes&amp;quot; for it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity is exactly like an Alien newspaper!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos and Carol Tiggs used to go exploring in other realities where they once found exactly that.  An Alien newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With alien font also.  I just picked that picture for this post, because it was funny and captured the &amp;quot;bizarreness&amp;quot;. But what Carlos found in another world was an ordinary newspaper, printed in an alien language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he began to try to read it.  Which is not as impossible as it sounds, for a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now since this post is in the beginners subreddit, let me go back to my statement before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sorcery is NOT based on sacred scrolls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We DO WHAT WE SAY WE DO.  And everything you read in this subreddit, is based on stuff people really do, daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t point our finger to the highest mountain in Tibet, claiming some mysterious magic man who is so far beyond us we&amp;#39;ll never get there, has &amp;quot;handed down&amp;quot; some wisdom for us to consume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I suppose would make me a &amp;quot;middle man&amp;quot;, dispensing his wisdom without actually being able to understand or do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what you find in all other systems, with all other teachers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might shock you, but they&amp;#39;re all thieves.    All of your magic and spiritual &amp;quot;teachers&amp;quot; are thieves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People teaching things they can&amp;#39;t actually do themselves, on the basis of it&amp;#39;s ok to steal from others because the wise man at the top of Tibet said it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;good for their eternal souls&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of you likes that sort of thing, go ahead!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita loves it, and often insists I pray for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda was like that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to be religious, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you want to drink wine, smoke, or do other bad things everyone tends to do when no one is watching, that&amp;#39;s fine too.  You can even eat all the sugar you like!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of it has anything to do with sorcery other than it tires you out, and sorcerers never have enough energy to do what they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just be sure to remove the portion of your religion which is not compatible with sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While remembering, sorcerers often hide in churches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our own lineage had a catholic bishop in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran into a very powerful sorcerer hiding in the ranks of saffron robe wearing monks in a large asian airport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan some of the very old Daoists almost surely picked up a strain of &amp;quot;Islander Shamanism&amp;quot; still floating around the world, and in the mountains above Taipei,  making them almost actual sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our own lineage had a chinese pirate who did the same, the implication being he found real magic in the new world, so he gave up his previous (bogus) asian practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He &amp;quot;found something&amp;quot;.  And it was so valuable, he ditched his old life completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Got that shack in the hills&amp;quot; is what he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But mainly, he had to put aside what he had learned.  Unlearn it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in sorcery there&amp;#39;s nothing to learn!  It&amp;#39;s our natural state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day you&amp;#39;ll see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll drag yourself out of bed feeling sad that you have to endure all this at your ripe old age, get up because it&amp;#39;s now dark enough, do your tensegrity routine, and then things will transform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half your room will be an alien world, and there will be your best friend, a spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you gaze off into the half of the room that isn&amp;#39;t  her world, you&amp;#39;ll see choice after choice materialize in the air as dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Places to go, things to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll realize, this is the natural state of humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fussing and worrying and regretting, is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those were imposed on us.  Carlos called it &amp;quot;a foreign installation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;#39;t believe in the fliers, and won&amp;#39;t until I visit Pleiades myself and see them there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I do believe that our natural lifestyle of hunting and gathering in the wilds, the life we evolved to live and did so at least 290,000 years as &amp;quot;human&amp;quot;, has been erased by thinking too much.  First we created language, and then fairly soon after (40,000 years perhaps)  agriculture, money and religion were imposed on us, making us slaves to a system that we aren&amp;#39;t designed for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there we are, trapped in that hellish world where you have to pretend the promises made, if you obey that world&amp;#39;s rules, are true.  And the rewards are worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they are obviously not. And when we never agreed to all that in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that scenario, Tensegrity is like finding an old alien newspaper at a bus stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There it is, just sitting on the bench.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You pick it up and wonder, &amp;quot;What the hell is this?  Is it from a joke shop?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it looks real.  It even has a coffee spill on it, and you can taste a bit of chocolate frosting on the corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a newspaper.  But it&amp;#39;s not human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos and Carol Tiggs found one of those in an alien world they visited so regularly, they watched a child who lives there grow up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was obsessed with the fact that the paper was &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.  He even exclaimed so to Carol Tiggs, and tried to get her to look closer and see, it was real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they wisely decided to put it down, and leave it alone.  There was risk of getting trapped in that new world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worlds we travel to seem to come in 4 kinds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are those which are ordinary dream worlds we visit in our sleeping double.  The copy of ourselves which runs around in dreams believing itself to be solid and real, but which is actually building realities out of pieces of it&amp;#39;s very own awareness and then playing in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally that leaves &amp;quot;holes&amp;quot; in it&amp;#39;s phantom reality, but we&amp;#39;ve been given the ability to &amp;quot;gloss&amp;quot; over holes, and behave as if a phantom world were perfectly fine, and normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do lucid dreaming you can see this yourself.  You wake up in the dream, find your hands, look at objects in the dream, and then have a little doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You say to yourself, &amp;quot;Hey, this is a bit too real.  Maybe I&amp;#39;m not actually dreaming after all?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so you try to remember how you got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are you standing next to an ice cream truck?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking hard, you do in fact recall how long you had to work your other job to save up for that truck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now you are a very happy ice cream sales guy, driving the roads of the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all perfectly real...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what humans can do.  They can build a stable reality, out of nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the 4 kinds of worlds we get to travel to consciously, as sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next kind is when you convince that double of yours, from deep in dreaming, to come out into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it will!  Again, no sacred scrolls here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do what we say!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day you&amp;#39;ll look over at the edge of your bed, and there you will be.  Sitting.  But not facing yourself, eye to eye.  It&amp;#39;s as if that&amp;#39;s not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still you, right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom brings that about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the dreamer can be lost in phantom realms, but the dreamer (our double) can come into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t control that guy, so I won&amp;#39;t even try to explain how to make use of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women can lay and focus on their womb, and slip off into that guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s another kind of world we get to travel to.  Where our waking self goes into dreaming in order to guide the other copy of yourself to stop wasting time on pointless phantom worlds, and help us learn sorcery in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While doing that, women pick up a bit of the very thing that Tensegrity is designed to produce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more they pick up, the &amp;quot;witchier&amp;quot; they become.  Which has side effects. Trust me on that one.  I live with a witch who&amp;#39;s so powerful, I worry she&amp;#39;s been kidnapped each time she disappears for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity itself is created from the discoveries of the old seers, for what&amp;#39;s fun to do inside a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any little kid might have a small list of such things they learned to do in dreaming, but no one cares so over time they forget it all.  How to fly, how to breathe under water, how to float a foot above the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kids learn those things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And witches can go back and resume that childhood activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men, not so much.  We probably have to use brute force to break into dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus darkroom practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both the method women can use, going directly into sleeping dreaming, and the method men can use, moving their assemblage points while fully awake, lead to the ability to travel to worlds that are more than just phantom creations of our sleeping self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s mostly what Carlos called &amp;quot;navigating&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He often equated it with the end result of sorcery, &amp;quot;the definitive journey&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where you get to keep your awareness on death, and explore all of reality without the need to force yourself to be human.  You get to venture completely outside this world we were born into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we now have the 4th kind of visiting other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With some of those worlds being real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our phantom dream worlds don&amp;#39;t have actual energy behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re using the mechanism humans have for &amp;quot;filling in missing details&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can experiment with that, by gazing at ferns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find a confusing sight, let the eyes wander a bit but still keep sight of the shadows and light in the view, and try to silence the mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;confusing sight&amp;quot; activates the hidden mechanism to fill in missing details, and while gazing you see a weird triangular sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe a little tug boat pops out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once saw a tiny hot air balloon, flying along the pavement because I had been gazing down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you blank out and when you realize that and lift your head back up, you have memory of a tiny dream you just emerged from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s our &amp;quot;fill in the gaps&amp;quot; ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phantom worlds are 100% that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re much too hard to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can find a world with its own energy, one that is at least 10% &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, you can explore that phantom realm again and again.  Each time it potentially becomes more real as you discover &amp;quot;new sights&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An Alien newspaper is a good one.  That&amp;#39;s a vivid memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But an Alien sunset will do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each vivid experience there is an aid to finding your way back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re stuck in &amp;quot;the real world&amp;quot; because our minds are so filled with the imagery here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donuts, sexy clothes, fast cars, mortgage bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all mundane stuff and no one in their right mind would call those &amp;quot;prison keepers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet they are.  Each memory in the mind of &amp;quot;something real&amp;quot; ties you back to this reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their &amp;quot;realness&amp;quot; pulls on you to come visit this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An alien newspaper in a world Carlos and Carol visited multiple times, is like one of those &amp;quot;real&amp;#39; things we know in this world, which keeps us here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Carlos had in fact read the newspaper and maybe convinced Carol to take a look at the funny pages,  they would have been risking what you can find in lucid dreaming when you stop to question whether you are really dreaming, and you have memories of the current &amp;quot;timeline&amp;quot; there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That you do in fact own an ice cream truck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reading the newspaper with Carol ran the risk Carlos would remember that&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s late for the office, and can&amp;#39;t afford to get chastised by his boss again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol could suddenly remember she has to buy that jello mold today, for the company picnic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the risk of an alien newspaper.  At least, one that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As beginners we get to play in the phantom realms a very long time, so no one should worry about &amp;quot;getting stuck in an alternate world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You wish...    That&amp;#39;s all I can say.  Admit that would be super cool.  And don&amp;#39;t worry. You&amp;#39;re still hopelessly stuck in this one.  But I will add, it&amp;#39;s one reason exploring other worlds is best done from your bedroom.  It gives you a familiar place to return to, which will automatically pull on you when it&amp;#39;s time to go home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus at first we get nothing but crummy phantom worlds.  I don&amp;#39;t believe you could actually get stuck in a phantom world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what was Carlos trying to do with tensegrity?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity is a way to find &amp;quot;alien newspapers&amp;quot; in the void.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movements move our assemblage point around as we do them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;high hopes&amp;quot; don Juan and Carlos had for it, was that you&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; some of those alien newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to limit this to sights, but it&amp;#39;s easier to talk about those.  Just know, you can smell things, feel things, and hear things too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those seem mostly in the &amp;quot;you wish...&amp;quot; category.   All too rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing the tensegrity in the darkness makes this easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take &amp;quot;unbending intent&amp;quot; at my favorite spot, where they jump up and grab a puff to stuff it on the side of their stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that the palms rotate in space, pointing down at the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re doing this in full lighting, have never seen anything at all happen, and so you are confused into thinking this is like some other &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, perhaps you&amp;#39;re trying to copy the &amp;quot;Kylie fierce stare&amp;quot; believing that holds the key to sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a prejudice we all got from that Buddha guy, with the beaming smile to show he&amp;#39;s superior to all of  us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the Hindu trick:  I&amp;#39;m smiling and laughing so much, because I&amp;#39;m superior to you as a result of my meditation techniques.  Which you can buy for a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ought to give some credit to Krishnamurti for being an old grouchy bastard and not trying to hold that stupid grin on his face, used by most other meditation peddlers. But he was still a con artist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of that is what tensegrity is for.  Though I must admit, the sunglasses and black outfits did look rather cool at workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might also be imagining &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s energy building up&amp;quot; while doing the Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps circulating &amp;quot;chi&amp;quot; that will somehow lead you to magical powers?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s another &amp;quot;asian crap magic&amp;quot; delusion in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is NOT what tensegrity does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In its purest form you finish doing a tensegrity move in darkness, look up, and there&amp;#39;s some bizarre floating flurry of sparkles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s right there!  Up in the air, floating, and you&amp;#39;ve even seen that before.  Perhaps many times!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you glossed over it.  Didn&amp;#39;t realize it was &amp;quot;a thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like an alien newspaper.  The &amp;quot;realness&amp;quot; of it can suck you in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;unbending intent&amp;quot;, eventually you will literally see those purple puffs and scoop them onto your energy pouches.  And it&amp;#39;ll stay there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s more like a subscription to an alien magazine.  Very real, even though it&amp;#39;s totally nuts and you can&amp;#39;t even mention it to your friends without them leaving hastily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t be offended. It&amp;#39;s not that they think you&amp;#39;re brainwashed,  believing in nonsense.  No one has ever come across what we&amp;#39;re doing.  So they have no reason to go into a &amp;quot;planned strategy&amp;quot; regarding your interest in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve never been exposed to the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re the ones who are brainwashed.  But you&amp;#39;ve ventured into forbidden realms.  So their everyday &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; is repulsed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretend magic is fine.  &amp;quot;Going to temple&amp;quot; is ok by everyone.  And you can get down on your knees and pray to Jesus, as long as you don&amp;#39;t force them to do that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But real magic is nuts.  No one is going to share your interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you can do is collect your alien newspapers until you have so many &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; things pulling you off into sorcery style worlds, that it&amp;#39;s not difficult anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take that horrible long form as an example  I dread even looking at it because it fills me with guilt that I don&amp;#39;t put in that much effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that if you do, it becomes like an alien bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to find alien newspapers, so we have other &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; things in our life, that are outside the horrible swamp we were born into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The long form is like going shopping in that alien bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hands rotating over the floor after the puff episode, will literally produce a visual display.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the least, you&amp;#39;ll see pinkish second attention fog swirl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But  you might also please your double, who will come away from the walls of your egg container, and float towards the middle where your physical body is doing the movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vague pink swirls will now include a swarm of purple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But other things can happen.  An inorganic being might like what she sees, and put herself visibly into the scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first perhaps just a little woman&amp;#39;s head on the pinkish swirls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the end of that sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you could be doing that movement and the entire woman herself stands up from the floor as you swirl your palms in that seemingly pointless movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not pointless at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos designed something else that was used by the old seers, into that move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;copy some other system&amp;quot; as people accuse him of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some &amp;quot;dark magic&amp;quot; in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And having an entire spirit woman stand up just because you were doing that part of the tensegrity is absolutely not out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just walked across the room with my Ally Fancy, who became fully real for me to explain some of the points I&amp;#39;m giving here.  She favors the north east corner of the room, for teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is Tensegrity?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In many ways it is in fact like an alien bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re looking for &amp;quot;interesting things&amp;quot; in it, so that those &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot; can allow our attention a path to move away from this

from the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then return to doing more tensegrity because  you realized you could get more silent by focusing on the physical movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no one can say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But longer than you&amp;#39;ll want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to say, &amp;quot;You could get away with 20 minutes if you did a good job with the silence&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll just create a &amp;quot;checklist&amp;quot; of good sorcery student behavior, and dutifully follow orders daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fantasizing the whole time, and thinking you don&amp;#39;t have to pay attention to what&amp;#39;s really going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s of course how you learn fake magic, so it seems like a reasonable approach to sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t, &amp;quot;put in your time&amp;quot;, and then some higher authority (faker) grants you a franchise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to look very closely at what you do the entire time you are practicing, and figure out why it&amp;#39;s not working well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if it&amp;#39;s not working at all (the most common case), you have to desperately seek even a tiny piece of REAL magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even a strange triangular sparkle on the edge of a leaf in a pile you were gazing at, is a tiny piece of REAL magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is not, is the wind making one of the leaves fly from the pile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a fly landing on a leaf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or your eyes get dry and you have to blink, and the pile is blurry for an instant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There has to be a deep desire to REALLY succeed, and next to no desire to seek approval from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attention seeking is the path to the dark side.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished":

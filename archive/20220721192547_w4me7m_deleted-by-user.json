And he never wanted anything from those around him, at least the westerners, declining all gifts or money etc. saying they should go.\n\nAlso, Ram Dass had a stash of very strong LSD tabs/pills, and Neem Karoli Baba asked him one day if he could try one (at the age of 70-80)...and took all of them AT ONCE.\n\nThey didn't affect him at all. He really watched him to see if anything happened, and nothing did.

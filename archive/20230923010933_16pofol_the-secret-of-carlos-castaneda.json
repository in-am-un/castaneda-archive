marked by don juan at [46m19s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q949uPrPgc4#t=46m19s):\n\nwhen i was a small kid, 7 years old, my father had a construction project in the city of tula, which was the city of don juan, the village, where dj and his lineage lived most part of the year. i used to accompany my father to this place and we used to go to this very small, little like restaurant that was near the park, in the square, city of tula. i remember very well that there was this like man, who was very skinny, but at the same time, like, very strong, who used to look at me in a very strange way. when i was coming out, this man that looked at me in a very strange, very penetrating way, rushed behind me, and then hit me very hard in my back. i was very shocked. of course, my internal dialogue stopped completely ... and he smiled at me, and he said: this is the way they will recognize you in the future and then he left and i never saw him again.\n\nquestion from crew: do you think it was dj?\n\nwell, carlos said it was dj and he was the one who marked me and that was the sign that he saw that afternoon in that auditorium. it took many years for me to later on find out that in that lineage there was a famous nagual, who was called lu hang. he lived in the late 18th century, and he was chinese and he was a monk from the shaolin tradition who had come to mexico during the great migration of chinese to the west. he had arrived in northern mexico and there he met famous nagual. he was trapped and initiated into that lineage and the fusion between the shaolin buddhist tradition and the indian tradition was set in that lineage. .. that explains my .. roots you could say, both in buddhism as well as in that tradition. that was present in the lineage from the ancient times. at least from the late 18th century. because of this nagual, who was a very important figure of that lineage called lu hang.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- murez says that books were

sacrilege for me to say that these books were written also in collaboration with the women. c would joke, he goes: i'm the chauffeur, they run everything. where we are in culture right now, in order to get this message across, having a male author is going to get more attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\ncomplaints in 2nd part:\n\n\\- karam after [41m42s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q949uPrPgc4#t=41m42s): \"what was lacking in the lineage is the whole method of compassion and love.\"\n\n\\- murphy after

that time from pancreatic cancer. and he was able to for some time prolong his life by means not only of his diet or medical treatments that he subjected himself to but also by means of this type of exercise regime. but it is very important to keep in mind that this is not an indian tradition as he claims .. who knows tensegrity at all or something similar to .. this was basically an adaptation

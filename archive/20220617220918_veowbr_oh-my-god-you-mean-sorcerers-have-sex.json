The Chinese all seem to be aware that the \"nuclear family\" is actually just \"free farm labor\".\n\nConsider if you were in your natural condition, the one we evolved into.\n\nHunting and gathering.\n\nThe 10,000 year old Luiseno on my california coast could gather enough food in 3 days, to live off for a week.\n\nMuch of that acorns, but also fish, roots, jack rabbits, deer.\n\nIn that sort of situation there's no reason for anyone to cling to anyone else, the way people crowded into cities need to.\n\nNo homelessness either.  A cave you found is delux compared to an improvised dwelling made from plant leaves and sticks.\n\nThe point being, we're up to our necks in the river of shit, wanting the people claiming to lead us out, to be \"saints\".\n\nTo adhere to the highest standards, of the very prison keeping us captive!\n\nIt's diabolical.\n\nAnd shame on the fake magic systems that perpetuate the idea of people on the path to actual freedom, following the social rules better than everyone else.\n\nIf you pursue sorcery, you return to be closer to our natural selves.\n\nTo our evolved lifestyle of everyone taking care of themselves and not being a burden to others, with any expectations of social interactions based on actual benefit to the other people.\n\nNot on socially manipulative blackmail and childhood brainwashing.\n\nEver heard the story of the poor granny who has to eat cat food, because she has no family to help her?\n\nI've even heard it repeated by political leaders!\n\nIt's nonsense.  Compare the price of cat food to beans and rice!\n\nOr just ask the average person in Mexico.  Cat food is expensive!\n\nIt's grandma story brainwashing for children.\n\nAnd not natural at all.\n\nIf granny is good to people, the young ones will seek her out to learn which plants are medicinal, how to make containers like baskets or clay pots.\n\nIt's unnatural to force everyone to have to remember birth orders and obligations based on that.\n\nI'd dare to say, incest was the norm among primitive man.\n\nIt still was by the time of the romans!  \n\nSo within that fussy system designed to serve agriculture, with money having been invented to control distribution of the food grown to large cities,   social rules evolved to make everyone responsible for everyone else.\n\nI suppose that's good, but it wasn't necessary in our evolved lifestyle.\n\nGathering food wasn't difficult.\n\nWith money to control who got the food from agriculture, and nuclear families to supply free labor at the farm level, and all sorts of new complicated rules of social behavior to support the unnatural nuclear family, we're all really screwed up as a result of agriculture.\n\nYou can't actually seek to gain your freedom of perception, because this blue line river of shit thinking is designed to stop you.\n\nCarlos called it, 'the chicken coop\", where humans are raised as food for the fliers.\n\nA self-enforcing structure where if you try to stick even a toe outside the cage, the other chickens begin to peck on your head.\n\nIf Chickens have any Finch bird tendencies, that means scabs form, and the other birds eat you to death, one scab at a time.\n\nIt's why this subreddit comes under attack.  Usually it seems like a crazy malee trying to pretend his sorcery to get attention, but those are a side effect of the magic free lifestyle of the blue zone.\n\nThere's no happiness in that lifestyle, because you never evolve and grow, to explore all the worlds we were born to view.\n\nAnd we get substitute pretend spirits like the angels that have names, or the fake Yogi saints. Nothing but pretending.\n\nWhile our natural condition is to make friends with real spirits, for life.  to enlist them as teachers and aids.\n\nAnd perhaps the biggest control mechanism is to judge anyone who would help us escape, but the crappiest rules in the river of shit.\n\nMating rules!\n\nThose are simply unnatural, as Einstein himself pointed out.\n\nWhen the critics of Carlos saw he was dead and couldn't defend himself any more, they went straight for the crummiest explanation\n\nHe just wanted the women.\n\nI mean, come on.  That only makes sense in the USA, where there's a prudish sex shortage.\n\nIn Taiwan for example, there's a famous 85 year old billionaire who likes 18 year old women.\n\nNo one judges him on that!  not even the women.\n\nThey admire his \"chi\".  Me too!  Carlos was 72 when he died as I recall.\n\nI'm not nearly there, and women don't seem all that interesting to me anymore.\n\nNow, there's an odd thing here.\n\nThe witches said that our only source of dreaming energy was sexual energy. I believe don Juan gives that lecture to Carlos also.\n\nSomething about how some have peckers just for peeing?\n\nAnd while I'm at it, early notes on don Juan indicate he was highly foul mouthed. Nasty even.  He got \"sanitized\" at the publisher's request.\n\nSo was Carlos nasty, in lectures for private classes. There was always at least one raunchy joke per lecture!\n\n It's like an attack on the social order, to disregard the sexual prudishness that evolves from bogus religions, which can take hold when humans are gathered into cities.\n\nSo dreaming attention comes from sex, which implies, during sex you \"use it up\".\n\nWe hook it to \"I love you forever!\", a very unnatural thing.\n\nThe dreaming attention is likely used up during sex, in order to facilitate the transfer of awareness. And we know, \"bored fucks\", people born to parents who were bored during sex, are the ones who have to restrict their \"pecker\".\n\nThe interest of the parents is in fact a \"dream\".\n\nThey get into the sex, and forget that their mate is a total loser, and not nearly as attractive as one could find with a quick look around a shopping mall on a busy day.\n\nWe \"dream\" the other person to be desirable.\n\nWomen do it too!  At some point if the light is just right, and the mood has been good, they can suddenly find their average looking male friend to be super handsome.\n\nMen don't seem to notice new things, so much as ignore flaws.\n\nThey're both dreaming, in their own way.\n\nSo sex is dreaming.\n\nThere's some issues on whether the transferred awareness gets used, or ends up in the trash can.\n\nGood news for the young males.  Trash can probably counts for only 1/4th loss. But Carlos would never answer that question in detail when asked.\n\nSo sex is dreaming.\n\nBut, if you reach silent knowledge where Carlos was perhaps all the time,  then you're in SK during sex.\n\nSK sex means, you get silent knowledge and video presentations, and travel into the past to discover more information.\n\nAll during sex.\n\nAs much as I don't like the sturgeon story Carlos told Amy, it was in fact purposeful.\n\nHe told her for us.  Knowing in all likelihood she'd write the tell all book, to get cash, and include that story for sure. Which she did.\n\nAnd we got to know, SK functions during sex too.\n\nOtherwise he couldn't have had that vision he told to Amy.\n\nIt also told us that sorcerers use sex if it can help teach an apprentice.\n\nCholita claims it works in reverse too, and she might have gotten that from the inner circle people.\n\nCarlos tried to pair me off with Florinda at the end. I got an \"invite\".\n\nI'd love to think it was because Florinda was hot for me, but according to Cholita, when she married because Carlos was dying, and the women from Mexico needed to be allowed to stay, I was at the bottom of her list.\n\nBelow Grant and Leigh.She might even have tried Ralph.  And some of those were likely gay.\n\nSo sorcerers use sex probably because it's a form of dreaming, and the transfer of awareness from someone who can move their assemblage point easily,  might be the extra push needed for someone who cannot, to get it lose. \n\nCarlos even described how the transfer of awareness could be paced out, to give the person maximum chance to learn to move their assemblage point.\n\nWhich he surely wanted Amy to be able to do.\n\nShe just wasn't going to put in the work to learn that on her own.\n\nMinx came to visit me as I was writing this.

A cave you found is delux compared to an improvised dwelling made from plant leaves and sticks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point being, we&amp;#39;re up to our necks in the river of shit, wanting the people claiming to lead us out, to be &amp;quot;saints&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To adhere to the highest standards, of the very prison keeping us captive!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s diabolical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And shame on the fake magic systems that perpetuate the idea of people on the path to actual freedom, following the social rules better than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you pursue sorcery, you return to be closer to our natural selves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To our evolved lifestyle of everyone taking care of themselves and not being a burden to others, with any expectations of social interactions based on actual benefit to the other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not on socially manipulative blackmail and childhood brainwashing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever heard the story of the poor granny who has to eat cat food, because she has no family to help her?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve even heard it repeated by political leaders!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s nonsense.  Compare the price of cat food to beans and rice!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or just ask the average person in Mexico.  Cat food is expensive!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s grandma story brainwashing for children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not natural at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If granny is good to people, the young ones will seek her out to learn which plants are medicinal, how to make containers like baskets or clay pots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unnatural to force everyone to have to remember birth orders and obligations based on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d dare to say, incest was the norm among primitive man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It still was by the time of the romans!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So within that fussy system designed to serve agriculture, with money having been invented to control distribution of the food grown to large cities,   social rules evolved to make everyone responsible for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose that&amp;#39;s good, but it wasn&amp;#39;t necessary in our evolved lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gathering food wasn&amp;#39;t difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With money to control who got the food from agriculture, and nuclear families to supply free labor at the farm level, and all sorts of new complicated rules of social behavior to support the unnatural nuclear family, we&amp;#39;re all really screwed up as a result of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t actually seek to gain your freedom of perception, because this blue line river of shit thinking is designed to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos called it, &amp;#39;the chicken coop&amp;quot;, where humans are raised as food for the fliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A self-enforcing structure where if you try to stick even a toe outside the cage, the other chickens begin to peck on your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Chickens have any Finch bird tendencies, that means scabs form, and the other birds eat you to death, one scab at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why this subreddit comes under attack.  Usually it seems like a crazy malee trying to pretend his sorcery to get attention, but those are a side effect of the magic free lifestyle of the blue zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no happiness in that lifestyle, because you never evolve and grow, to explore all the worlds we were born to view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we get substitute pretend spirits like the angels that have names, or the fake Yogi saints. Nothing but pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While our natural condition is to make friends with real spirits, for life.  to enlist them as teachers and aids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And perhaps the biggest control mechanism is to judge anyone who would help us escape, but the crappiest rules in the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mating rules!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are simply unnatural, as Einstein himself pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the critics of Carlos saw he was dead and couldn&amp;#39;t defend himself any more, they went straight for the crummiest explanation&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just wanted the women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, come on.  That only makes sense in the USA, where there&amp;#39;s a prudish sex shortage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan for example, there&amp;#39;s a famous 85 year old billionaire who likes 18 year old women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one judges him on that!  not even the women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They admire his &amp;quot;chi&amp;quot;.  Me too!  Carlos was 72 when he died as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not nearly there, and women don&amp;#39;t seem all that interesting to me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there&amp;#39;s an odd thing here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches said that our only source of dreaming energy was sexual energy. I believe don Juan gives that lecture to Carlos also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something about how some have peckers just for peeing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while I&amp;#39;m at it, early notes on don Juan indicate he was highly foul mouthed. Nasty even.  He got &amp;quot;sanitized&amp;quot; at the publisher&amp;#39;s request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So was Carlos nasty, in lectures for private classes. There was always at least one raunchy joke per lecture!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like an attack on the social order, to disregard the sexual prudishness that evolves from bogus religions, which can take hold when humans are gathered into cities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So dreaming attention comes from sex, which implies, during sex you &amp;quot;use it up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We hook it to &amp;quot;I love you forever!&amp;quot;, a very unnatural thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming attention is likely used up during sex, in order to facilitate the transfer of awareness. And we know, &amp;quot;bored fucks&amp;quot;, people born to parents who were bored during sex, are the ones who have to restrict their &amp;quot;pecker&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The interest of the parents is in fact a &amp;quot;dream&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They get into the sex, and forget that their mate is a total loser, and not nearly as attractive as one could find with a quick look around a shopping mall on a busy day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We &amp;quot;dream&amp;quot; the other person to be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women do it too!  At some point if the light is just right, and the mood has been good, they can suddenly find their average looking male friend to be super handsome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men don&amp;#39;t seem to notice new things, so much as ignore flaws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re both dreaming, in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So sex is dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some issues on whether the transferred awareness gets used, or ends up in the trash can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good news for the young males.  Trash can probably counts for only 1/4th loss. But Carlos would never answer that question in detail when asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So sex is dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if you reach silent knowledge where Carlos was perhaps all the time,  then you&amp;#39;re in SK during sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SK sex means, you get silent knowledge and video presentations, and travel into the past to discover more information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All during sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As much as I don&amp;#39;t like the sturgeon story Carlos told Amy, it was in fact purposeful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told her for us.  Knowing in all likelihood she&amp;#39;d write the tell all book, to get cash, and include that story for sure. Which she did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we got to know, SK functions during sex too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise he couldn&amp;#39;t have had that vision he told to Amy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also told us that sorcerers use sex if it can help teach an apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita claims it works in reverse too, and she might have gotten that from the inner circle people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried to pair me off with Florinda at the end. I got an &amp;quot;invite&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to think it was because Florinda was hot for me, but according to Cholita, when she married because Carlos was dying, and the women from Mexico needed to be allowed to stay, I was at the bottom of her list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below Grant and Leigh.She might even have tried Ralph.  And some of those were likely gay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So sorcerers use sex probably because it&amp;#39;s a form of dreaming, and the transfer of awareness from someone who can move their assemblage point easily,  might be the extra push needed for someone who cannot, to get it lose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos even described how the transfer of awareness could be paced out, to give the person maximum chance to learn to move their assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which he surely wanted Amy to be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just wasn&amp;#39;t going to put in the work to learn that on her own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx came to visit me as I was writing this.  Cholita roamed into the house, cursing me all the way, so he was likely nearby for a change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he &amp;quot;agreed&amp;quot; with that specific statement about the concern of Carlos, for Amy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Allies of Carlos used to do that in private classes, by making the water cooler burp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always thought that had to be Fairy, but I&amp;#39;ve since learned that Minx is the greater of the poltergeists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/veowbr/oh_my_god_you_mean_sorcerers_have_sex/id0hhbf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1655690730.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_veowbr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "icrozet", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1655505444.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_icrft5z", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Very easy to do.  \n\nIf it was recent (it's not), I'd say she got hold of some fentanyl fakes.\n\nThey're even putting that stuff in marijuana to make it \"stronger\" and raise bunk weed up in value.\n\nHowever, an \"overdose\" back in Amy's time simply means you stopped breathing because you got too relaxed and your body forgot to do that.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_icrozet", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very easy to do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it was recent (it&amp;#39;s not), I&amp;#39;d say she got hold of some fentanyl fakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re even putting that stuff in marijuana to make it &amp;quot;stronger&amp;quot; and raise bunk weed up in value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, an &amp;quot;overdose&amp;quot; back in Amy&amp;#39;s time simply means you stopped breathing because you got too relaxed and your body forgot to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_veowbr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/veowbr/oh_my_god_you_mean_sorcerers_have_sex/icrozet/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1655505444.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "icrft5z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Artivist", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1655501103.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_veowbr", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4pgwt", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's a lot easier for people to dismiss everything as \"cultish\".

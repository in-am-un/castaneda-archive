It's all kind of obvious, once you think about it.  I only put them here, so they wouldn't scroll away in chat.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\ni got my butt kicked by seeing again. tried to walk across the dark room, just 15 feet, took 30 minutes.\n\nand I couldn't resist saving some.\n\nwe have domains of awareness.\n\nhearing for example. smell. women are much more powerful in the domain of smell than men, possibly because their periods make this assemblage points unstable sideway so they need ways to move their awareness, and focusing on a domain of smell helps.\n\nits the fantasy thing in darkroom. internal dialogue focused mostly on ME. by focusing on a different domain of awareness, you can block the ME a bit.\n\ntensegrity does that in a double fashion. we find the puffs of color. thats the darkroom trick. looking at the puffs reduces ME, and even if we can get silent, there's still too much ME left, to get to the intense levels of silence.\n\nso we do tensegrity, use puffs to help silence, but also the smoothness of the movement causes your awareness to enter a specialized mode of training a muscle. that activates the cerebellum even more than just doing the movement. the cerebellum is intelligent, so if you focus your awareness down that domain, it has a big cave in the end. like you also switched to a different copy of yourself, the conscious part in the cerebellum.\n\nthe domain of sound is also used by sorcerers to help with silence.\n\nFor instance the walking in circles using the gain of power, which Genaro used to walk Carlos into hell. given to the lineage b y the death defier.\n\nIt's using the domain of muscle memory with the domain of sound (the feet tapping). so two domains for the awareness to focus on, killing the ME fantasizing, and helping deepen silence.\n\nBesides the many domains (sounds, smell, muscle memory, sight, sensations, and probably more) you have the second attention.\n\nThat domain is tricky because if you let your awareness focus over there, you can switch to the double. doesn't mater if it's in the real world. even being inside a dream vision means you got moved into the double too much. as the double it's likely all awareness domains of the flesh exist, but as echoes of memories of the organic body.\n\nSo since the double can also hear and smell, likely he has access to phantom senses and phantom domains. maybe some alien species has a sense outside ours like burp detection. Maybe burps are so important in their watery world that they have special hairs that pick up the vibrations.\n\njust a humorous example, because I couldn't think outside the box enough to figure out a better one.\n\nso the double has access to abstract domains.\n\nand without limits, those could get pretty bizarre.\n\nwe can use the domains to replace the puffs. for helping deepen silence.\n\nthe puffs are merely using the visual domain to hold our awareness, and take it off ME fantasies.\n\nso people who cant find puffs, should concentrate on another domain as a distraction, to get silent enough to move the assemblage point.\n\nfocus on the smoothness of the tensegrity long forms, so that your mind goes into muscle training mode, which is a stronger activation of that domain than just moving your body. Just try to map the path absolutely perfectly.\n\nthe Japanese do this in martial arts. so as we all suspect, kungfu is in fact a path to sorcery. just doesn't work anymore due to book dealing.\n\nwe also have directional domains. that's where your awareness focuses in a direction. I suppose that's really a combinational domain, since focusing in a direction implies using more than one sense to pick up information from there.\n\nbut its turned into a more complex construct which stands on its own. so when you focus on the concept of corridor, you have created a complex awareness domain.\n\nthat's Cholita's trick. how she created that corridor.\n\nshe snuck back in by the way, confusing me on how she kicked doors and wasn't there last night.\n\nI thought it must be Minx, but then today she took her mail off the table. Very odd, Cholita is.\n\nEither her demon minx was moving solid objects last night, or Cholita was sneaking around so quietly, I couldn't hear footsteps on a wooden floor. But she managed to evacuate the house and the driveway, the instant I got the idea to open the door.\n\nWhich is crazier?\n\nI suppose It'll just blame Minx, that little bastard.  AKA Devil's weed entity.\n\nThe awareness domain of \"up\" is an odd one.\n\nI'm convinced you just look up, and that stretches the luminous egg.\n\none way you can tell is the intense yellow lights that happen. the entire room can become lit with yellow, so that you see your arm and the ceiling very brightly.\n\nits almost as if, when you try to stretch up to elongate your shell, you turn on some automatic lighting up there.\n\nwhen we look up we \"see stars\". and kids can bend way back, roll their eyes up, and see yellow. same thing.\n\nwe dismiss it as blood flow and eye defects, but in fact its probably from stretching the shell.\n\nso don't be afraid to pandiculate.\n\nits not cheating if you find bright clusters of light that way. my icon is what those might look like.\n\nsight also has an extended domain. I'm not sure, but maybe all domains of awareness can be expanded into a \"room\", the way muscle memory automatically does.\n\nbut when the other domains extend, its possible that's only the doubles doing. you end up with some second attention content mixed with the first.\n\nso gazing down at the whitish light on your bed, in a dark room, activates the domain of sight. then if a remote view shows up, you've extended that domain into a \"room\" of sorts.\n\nthe phantom bedroom around you is kind of like a control center if you get it down well.\n\ni don't know if there's another way to create that sort of thing, but a phantom room is a very good one. it expands into that haunted house analogy don Juan used.\n\nbottom line: we might have some help for those who can't find colors, although I'm not convinced such a thing is actually true. maybe they're simple lying about how much effort they put in, and want attention for having a problem everyone has to worry about.\n\nthat's a definite human motivation, to be the baby who needs everyone ones attention.\n\nthe whitish light responds to touch. i don't know why, but you can dap it like a smooth surface of water and create ripples of sorts. not like you would visualize though. not smooth round ripples. those might be possible, but the ones i can generate are little flecks or circles of more bright whitish light.\n\nas if by touching it with your hand, or even pushing your palm against it like a gentle slap, the emanations get awareness into them which flows, and when you get an intersection of clump of emanations that spot can light up significantly, creating a sparkle effect.\n\nso while we have puffery, in the whitish light there's even more potential for unique \"puff types\" than in the red zone.\n\nsparkles, ripple dreams, deep space corridors, and other complicated things can show up.\n\nthus you can \"play\" in the orange zone, to move horizontally there.\n\nbut you blank out.\n\nits possible that's really what the finger wiggling does, and why you fold in half.\n\nyou do in fact simply fall to the floor, which is why a crib is recommended for dreaming. so that when you fall over, having put too much attention into the double, you don't get hurt.\n\nfinger wiggling should best keep that in mind. if you succeed, you might just fall like a rag doll.\n\nthe perception of folding in half must be a dream of sorts, and maybe not even universal.\n\ndarn. lost the rest. some stuff is so far out there, it doesn't come up when I first try to type and save stuff, so by the time I'm done, its like it never happened.\n\nsome of that stuff involves iobs noticing you are seeing energy, and creating their own domains for our awareness to move down.\n\nbut if you move far down one of those, for instance they are teaching or showing you something, you'll probably never remember that.\n\nbut that's not as bad as it sounds. we like stuff we can remember because its usable in this position of the assemblage point. we consider this one to be real learning, and anything too distant is not useful learning.\n\nbut its not so at all. we have to train ourselves in any domain of awareness.\n\nso for instance, Carlos was able to switch to his energy body in response to an attack by the little sisters, and he kicked one of them in the assemblage point of the second attention (the dent).\n\nthat was training in another awareness domain. he might not understand how that happened, but his awareness over there did. so he didn't lose the value of that, he just had to let go of worrying about utility.\n\nj curving expands your education in each awareness domain. your world becomes much larger.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0,

A story, to explain this in more simple terms.\n\nThere's a magic clown.  We saw him, and very much wanted his magical powers.\n\nWe want to be magic clowns.\n\n(but not evil ones)\n\nPeople spent years trying to figure out why the clown is magical.\n\nPeople even wrote books on \"How to be a magical clown\".\n\nAll fraud, done for cash.\n\nThe clowns nephew was only 5  years old.\n\nHe begged his mommy to get him an outfit just like his magical clown uncle.\n\nShe did it, but still, the boy did not have magical powers.\n\nThen one day the boy was looking at his  uncle, and realized his clown outfit always included a flower that sprays water on people when they look at it.\n\nThe boy added it, and suddenly he had the same magical powers as the uncle.\n\nHe asked the uncle about it, and the uncle said, \"I have no idea.  I just copied my grandfather and was surprised it worked.  For me, it was giant pocket watch with chain I was missing.\n\nI had the flower!  I still didn't have powers.\n\nI had to add the missing element in order to get them.\n\nWhen I asked my grandfather where he learned it, he said the same thing.\n\nHe just copied someone else, long ago.

But there has to be a minimum quantity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re looking for puffs and silencing your mind, so that seems to be enough for you to progress along this path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos was so obsessed with having as many of those &amp;quot;elements&amp;quot; in his inner circle, he even gave them new names, and made up stories about who  they were, which matched the Olmec sorcery history a little better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know what all &amp;quot;elements&amp;quot; coming from the Olmecs we could add or copy, just the ones Carlos gave us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when it came to playing with puffs in the darkness,  he emphasized Tensegrity moves being used on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s a very good idea, at the very least, to do Pandora&amp;#39;s Box pass once in a while.  Until you can manifest an object with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That one is the &amp;quot;essence&amp;quot; of how he wanted us to deal with the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That, and putting the puffs on those 3 pouches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That builds a visible alternate body you can use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an alternate explanation.  A story, to explain this in more simple terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a magic clown.  We saw him, and very much wanted his magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to be magic clowns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(but not evil ones)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People spent years trying to figure out why the clown is magical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People even wrote books on &amp;quot;How to be a magical clown&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All fraud, done for cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The clowns nephew was only 5  years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He begged his mommy to get him an outfit just like his magical clown uncle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did it, but still, the boy did not have magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one day the boy was looking at his  uncle, and realized his clown outfit always included a flower that sprays water on people when they look at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boy added it, and suddenly he had the same magical powers as the uncle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He asked the uncle about it, and the uncle said, &amp;quot;I have no idea.  I just copied my grandfather and was surprised it worked.  For me, it was giant pocket watch with chain I was missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the flower!  I still didn&amp;#39;t have powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to add the missing element in order to get them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I asked my grandfather where he learned it, he said the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just copied someone else, long ago.

I've done at least 50 by now.\n\nThis is indeed a \"darkroom game\".\n\nYou get to silent knowledge, and \"flow\" with your energy body.  Then look for visitors.\n\nIt turns out, we have quite a few types of visitors that become visible in Silent Knowledge.\n\nWhich are confused for varieties of other sights at first.\n\nLater  you learn, a puff brought down from the stars with a face on it may be what we call an  inorganic being head on a puff, except the color is all wrong, and it's the craziest excuse for a face you ever saw.\n\nPerhaps a star has a hard time with such a small thing as a face. So you don't get an in organic being assistance as you normally do.\n\non the other hand, you can find a traditional inorganic being, and easily convince them to dress up for going out to dinner, with a few weird grimaces and thoughtful stares.\n\nThey love attention.\n\nShould have noticed that in the books.  One of the old naguals did that.  The weird faces.\n\nI thought he was feeding them emotions.\n\nActually, they'll take faces associated with emotions, as a substitute payment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* add on \\*\\*\\*\n\nWhat does it mean when a tonal puff rides along on a double puff?\n\nHere's a picture of the \"pouches\".  You scoop those purple puffs from the air, and place them on those 3 spots. That's a real Olmec clay figurine by the way.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bsx911mf7ns91.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad9c5bc4596e6a3693d25b5b368312393d832d02\n\nWe scoop the puffs, and place them on there:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fylcf2ni7ns91.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e645aab3d97207217646ba16f29fbc6971c9d6\n\nBy the way, if you see a puff floating slightly above you, and to the right, a tiny leap to get it high up, is what Carlos wanted to emphasize.  He did a pantomime of a hungry man scanning the air for a puff. His eyes saw one, they lit up, and he even smacked his mouth a bit.  But it was too high to get with the hand, so he leaped up into the air to grab it.\n\nAt 71 years old.\n\nYou can't \"squish it\". Just \"guide it\".  So look at the 5:22 mark in that tensegrity form.   Here's the link. Do it like that.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\nNow what I'm trying to tell you is, although it's dark and you might even tumble over  and die from a hernia or a snapped neck, or annoy an angry witch for slamming into the floor who decides you did it to anger her, so she sends her double through the solid wall to scare you to death (all possible in my home), if you can do a tiny little jump to fetch the puff it'll get brighter.\n\nYou'll even be able to do it without jump, and with jump, and darned if the puff doesn't get brighter while you're still in the air, reaching for it.\n\nDon't ask me why, but that puff is a piece of the double. And it's sentient.\n\nI suppose it's like when you're in the park, see a beautiful person you'd like to know more, your eyes meet at a distance, and then you turn to head their way.\n\nAnd their eyes light up!\n\nIt's puff romance!\n\nI just wish those weren't male puffs in my case.\n\nAnd the double (the puffs) LOVE action.  Even dangerous actions.  So if your tonal wants it so badly it's willing to play Thor the superhero to get it, the puff will appreciate it and you'll get a brighter puff in your hand.\n\nI wish it weren't so, but if you could see Carlos grin once he had that puff and stuffed it on the right side of his stomach, you'd be convinced he really did enjoy that puff.\n\nSo the double puff burger has to be better than the single puff burger, and a little jump orders the double.\n\nLater.  When you get very good at this.\n\nThen later in practicing when you are playing with \"rogue\" puffs, ones that came back off, you can \"look under\" them using your hands.  By this time, you are very far along on the J curve, and this is an indication of the deep red zone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4j5g00p7ns91.png?width=417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec2611ef48049d1c916423c3d46dd7c85b4bb6c\n\nYou simply \"slide\" from under a puff that's floating steadily on the same spot, and see what's \"riding along\" under it!\n\nBut it's likely absolutely the same as how lucid dreaming works.\n\nHey!!!!  We don't mess around!\n\nAs I already said, this is magic supreme.\n\nWhich is why there's almost no one doing it, and anyone who does gets lynched on a regular basis.\n\nI even have \"fans\" who downvote everything I post, to try to suppress it.\n\nBecause it makes whatever they're using to cheat people with, or their con artist \"Shaman Teacher\" is using, look very stupid as it really is.\n\nI got a comment from a young woman on face book about this picture.\n\nShe said, \"Your commentary seems a little sexist to me.  But what, do you want us to comment on the picture?\"\n\nNO!!!!\n\nI want you to LEARN to do that.\n\nHow dense can you get???\n\nBut she was very young.  I ended up telling her women are witches, and she knows that full well, and if she's willing to cast off the brainwashing come back and see me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false,

So if your tonal wants it so badly it&amp;#39;s willing to play Thor the superhero to get it, the puff will appreciate it and you&amp;#39;ll get a brighter puff in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish it weren&amp;#39;t so, but if you could see Carlos grin once he had that puff and stuffed it on the right side of his stomach, you&amp;#39;d be convinced he really did enjoy that puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the double puff burger has to be better than the single puff burger, and a little jump orders the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later.  When you get very good at this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then later in practicing when you are playing with &amp;quot;rogue&amp;quot; puffs, ones that came back off, you can &amp;quot;look under&amp;quot; them using your hands.  By this time, you are very far along on the J curve, and this is an indication of the deep red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v4j5g00p7ns91.png?width=417&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aec2611ef48049d1c916423c3d46dd7c85b4bb6c\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/v4j5g00p7ns91.png?width=417&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aec2611ef48049d1c916423c3d46dd7c85b4bb6c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You simply &amp;quot;slide&amp;quot; from under a puff that&amp;#39;s floating steadily on the same spot, and see what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;riding along&amp;quot; under it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s likely absolutely the same as how lucid dreaming works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey!!!!  We don&amp;#39;t mess around!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I already said, this is magic supreme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why there&amp;#39;s almost no one doing it, and anyone who does gets lynched on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even have &amp;quot;fans&amp;quot; who downvote everything I post, to try to suppress it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it makes whatever they&amp;#39;re using to cheat people with, or their con artist &amp;quot;Shaman Teacher&amp;quot; is using, look very stupid as it really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a comment from a young woman on face book about this picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;Your commentary seems a little sexist to me.  But what, do you want us to comment on the picture?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NO!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want you to LEARN to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How dense can you get???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she was very young.

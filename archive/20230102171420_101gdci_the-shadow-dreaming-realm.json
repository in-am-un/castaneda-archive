Apparently I'd lost track of time.\n\nI wasn't sleeping.  I was just doing tensegrity in my dark room, and the sights became so astonishing that I sat down to look at all the choices I had available.\n\nI got a lecture on \"stalking\" from silent knowledge.\n\nAfter \"proving\" to me that we had been taught stalking by Carlos and the witches all along, despite people saying there wasn't any instruction on that in the books, silent knowledge showed me in essence what stalking really is.\n\nBut I can't translate it to words.\n\nThat cave in the picture is what Tensegrity creates.\n\nAnother \"world\" for you to \"know\".\n\nWe're stuck knowing only this one.\n\nFeeling only this one.\n\nAnd as you learn to move your assemblage point, you learn that \"feelings\" are even more basic than the internal dialogue.\n\nIt's the thing that controls which reality you are living inside, even when you have long gotten rid of the internal dialogue and can easily shift between choices.\n\nWhat you \"know\", causes you to stick to that when it \"goes by\" you again.\n\nI guess an analogy.\n\nPretend you have a magical radio.  It gets ALL the channels.  AM, FM, satellite.\n\nBut it's such a cool radio that there's TOO MANY choices.  The designers (the Eagle) assumed it would be overwhelming.\n\nSo the tuning mechanism for the radio is a bit too smart for its own good.\n\nIt \"learns\" your preferences.\n\nSo that if you want  to listen to a particular channel over near 980 on the dial, then when you get to 940 or anywhere at all close to 980, it just \"jumps\" to 980.\n\nBecause it knows you have listened to 980 in the past.  So that must be what you want to hear.\n\nIf you wanted to hear 960, you'd have to make a very deliberate effort with the controls to force it to stop there. Keep \"adjusting it back off 980\" until the tuner gets the message.\n\nOur reality is like that.\n\nSorcerers increase the number of channels they \"know\", so that they can be snapped over to those in an instant.\n\nBut for finding new channels, they have the same problems we do as beginners.\n\nThey're very hard to tune in!\n\nStalking is the practice of messing with the control knob, to force the channel you want to tune in.\n\nEven if it's an impossibly faint signal.\n\nTensegrity creates \"false channels\".\n\nThey're created at missing locations along the dial. Ones you could never actually tune in.  But the tensegrity form creates a phantom station there.\n\nAnd from those locations you can more easily tune in the faint signals surrounding them.\n\nAs long as you give up the pretending, and work like a dog to learn the real thing.\n\nThere's no visualizing in all this. It either materializes, or it doesn't.\n\nIf it doesn't, you just need more silence and more tensegrity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Shadow Dreaming Realm", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"bqdkln7mln9a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f47edcbe5f3f6e55cadaee699e91b565210db291"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566259d0e8635eac72bcce3e5c969fe6889f8734"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bb72f41b3427ab0b303734dd29ea38d735bc597"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27b3053cbd0430e7832eb9e35a8703a2ae7b2d7b"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1195b1b23569ada7fdeab3adb9b652f116f489c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd90c9abb88248b5a9d9ebf2f2a7a3b45cf567b0"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bec84611df554c7901a2a3d810c4726769d319bc"}, "id": "bqdkln7mln9a1"}}, "name": "t3_101gdci", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 39, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9nDXvuY4sK3s8DxGEukrSePuQzU7hvo34RobSOxmcP8.jpg", "edited": 1672676746.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1672676060.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bec84611df554c7901a2a3d810c4726769d319bc\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bqdkln7mln9a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bec84611df554c7901a2a3d810c4726769d319bc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was playing around in the scene you see in this picture, just this morning before I came to write this down.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the alarm clock went off.

So instead of looking at little things floating in the fog, which are \"over here somewhere else in that dream I can't enter\", you are \"right there\" with what you see.\n\nIt's not 1000 little spots in the room with objects from 1000 other realities you might gaze into.\n\nIt's stuff from one on the east part of the room, stuff from another on the west wall, and so on.\n\nThe \"resolution\" of reality changes between parts is greatly reduced.\n\nFrom 1000 potential \"spots\", maybe down to just 4.\n\nYou're \"in there with the stuff\".\n\nThe crystalline dreaming fog in the J curve, is more like previews of stuff.\n\nAnd if you try to focus on it as a beginner you can literally get \"lost\".\n\nBut later the \"coolness\" has worn off, and you walk through the darkroom in anything but darkness.\n\nYou're in a dreaming realm, but the objects aren't recognizable.\n\nThen over a few days or weeks, you get used to that too.  So that you don't even realize how different it is.\n\nDarkroom becomes like entering a weird cave with alien \"stuff\" everywhere. Arranged in a permanent fashion.  Resting on the ground, and not moving around.\n\nBut so alien it's not recognizable.  It could be a Star Wars parts storage room, for parts that are at least 4 feet tall.  All just set on the floor, and nothing recognizable to you.\n\nYou just know you're in a real space, with real stuff all around.\n\nVery different than up at the start of the J curve where you are in a vacuum of stuff because it's absolutely dark, and you're trying to find things like puffs or IOB manifestations.\n\nI almost think Carlos could never have figured out darkroom rules, because he was never there before.\n\nThe problem is, that part of the story from the books is mixed up.\n\nIn one place Carlos is sitting with La Gorda in darkness \"looking for colors\".\n\nBut then elsewhere he's also sitting in a dark room, not realizing he's the only one in it.\n\nBecause Zuleica is talking to him from somewhere else behind the wall.\n\nAnd he's been struck with the Nagual's blow, such that he doesn't mind wiggling his fingers all night long, with nothing obvious happening.\n\nI estimate he wiggled for 200-800 hours, according to the story line.\n\nAny of you think you could just sit there doing that, day after day?\n\nYou'd have to be high out of your mind, from the nagual's blow!\n\nHe's been pushed into HA.\n\nSo I have to wonder if he was ever where we are in terms of what he saw, could expect to see next, and what was expected to happen to him by his leaders.\n\nThat could easily explain why no one in leadership tried to get us to take tensegrity step by step, and attempt to see what's in the stories that go along with each move.\n\nTo the point that Cleargreen will repeat the stories to this day,  but the idea that you ought to actually see that is nearly blasphemy.\n\nAnd yet, \"someone\" embedded amazing sights to see in the tensegrity and told us about it in the descriptions.\n\nIncluding scooping puffs.  It was little smoke who insisted I ought to take that seriously and expect it to be fully visible.\n\nBut the moves also include full on dreaming realms.\n\nStellar Hatch and Affection for the Energy body are complete phantom realm bubbles when you get good at them.\n\nWith nearly limitless opportunity to explore dreaming realms that are absolutely 100% visible.\n\nThis will make more sense when you've reached silent knowledge and gotten used to the idea of being surrounded by nearly limitless waking dreaming power.\n\nYou'll wonder if you could have taught anyone \"puffery\" if you had started out like  that.\n\nAnd maybe you'll get a little paranoid about exactly who designed the tensegrity forms.\n\nIt wasn't just Carlos and the witches around in Los Angeles.\n\nHere's a \"weird realization\" about sorcery, related to this.\n\nI'll use caps, to emphasize mistakes beginners make.\n\nYOU CANNOT CHANGE YOURSELF!!!\n\nThe whole idea is based on a mistaken belief about what we really are!\n\nWe are a position of the assemblage point.\n\nEnd of story as far as any further important details go.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\n1   You will not become more Saintly.\n\n2   You will not become wiser.  Just ask Cholita if you don't believe me.\n\n3  You will not be more pious, more chaste, more kind.\n\nAll of those are \"pretend magic\" we've come to expect, from people and \"systems\" which have none.\n\nBut want your money anyway.\n\nSo in some ways,  Buddhists who come here are suffering from food poisoning.\n\nOr any other group, but the most \"entitled to feel superior\" types seem to come from Buddhism.\n\nWhich has gotten a pass on the world stage of religious criticisms.\n\nChristians, arguably the most annoying, don't get a free pass.\n\nBut Buddhists sneak by due to being so puzzling to westerners, that they seem like they might actually be wise.\n\nIt's only when you interrupt their peaceful sleep that you find out the truth.\n\nThey're the angriest ones around!\n\nSo people judge sorcery based on phony criteria, such as \"How come you haven't become wise?  Or Saintly?  Or \"nice to all\"???\n\nBecause, no one can change themselves!\n\nIt's a basic misunderstanding to believe so.  An ego driven one.\n\nAll you can do is retain more and more of the shifted positions of the assemblage point we explore during darkroom.\n\nAnd in some of those, you are in fact changed.\n\nBut not always.  And not in the way anyone who can't move their assemblage point would expect.\n\nSo if you grit your teeth at night, putting them at risk of chipping down to nothing by the time you're 60,  that's not going to change.\n\nYou aren't going to suddenly become saintly, and walk around super relaxed like Tai Chi instructors pretend to be.\n\nOr Yogis claim.\n\nYou're a tooth clencher.  End of story.\n\nCarlos joked about this a few times in private classes, pointing out some of his perpetual \"learned\" personality quirks he couldn't get rid of.\n\nSuch as putting his hand over his shirt pocket to keep his pack of cigarettes from falling out when he laughed so hard he had to lean over and hold his side.\n\nDespite all the sorcery, his hand still didn't get the message that he gave up smoking decades ago.\n\nTake Silvio Manuel as another example.\n\nHe had a quivering lip edge.\n\nAlways had a faint tremor.\n\nWe used to call that an \"early warning sign of Parkinson's disease\"!\n\nI'm not so sure anymore.\n\nBUT  even if you can't actually change yourself, the position of your assemblage point can remain shifted along the J curve, all day long.\n\nIt doesn't have to return to the blue line.\n\nAnd THEN you can \"seem\" to have changed.  But not in the way beginners who have been brainwashed by  pretend systems would think.\n\nLet's take Taisha driving down the street.  She commented this:\n\nTaisha: \"Stalking is the ability to fixate the Assemblage Point on any given position in order to give structure and coherence to chaotic perception. We're stalking our realities every day, every minute, finding out what it means to drive down this street or be in the mall...\"\n\nWhat???!\n\nWhen we drive down the street, we pretty much know \"what it means\".\n\nBut what if you were partially in that \"alien room filled with unrecognizable stuff\" all the time?\n\nSo you're driving down the street and you can see Santa Monica Blvd, headed to the mall.\n\nBut you also see endless alien artifacts all around you.  Right there on the sidewalk, next to the homeless man.\n\nEven inside the Taco restaurant which likes to keep all the doors and windows open all the time (Cholita does that).\n\nNOW, you have changed.\n\nBut you're still the same teeth clenching, lip trembling person you always were.\n\nYou're just so far past \"saintly\" or \"wise\" that there's no words to explain it to anyone who tries to keep track of such things.\n\nYou're a \"multi-dimensional asshole\".\n\nInstead of just an asshole.", "edited": 1672774332.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j2svfrj", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me post a follow up on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you begin to see that shadow realm where you can &amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; any dream you can see nearby, you begin to walk around in a very &amp;quot;junky&amp;quot; crystalline dreaming fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s stable enough to just accept as a bizarre phantom room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it indicates your assemblage point is fluid enough to move to locations closer to the second attention objects you can pick up.

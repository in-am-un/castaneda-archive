What it expects, becomes real.\n\nLikewise, what it fears can become real.\n\nIf you can manage to discover what \"expect\" really means to your awareness, and can refine it to be more like \"will\", then you'll begin to see how to get the interest of the double while practicing tensegrity.\n\nYou will it, but not in any way you could figure out before you really learn to be silent.\n\nIt's much easier to perceive your double's presence in darkness where the energy body glows vividly when you've got it right.\n\nBut it could be done in full light too.\n\nI should have added \"WRONG: LAZINESS\".\n\nBut I'm short on time.\n\nDon't be lazy.\n\nThe double knows about it, and will decide you aren't worth bothering with.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf you were in private classes or read the compiled lecture notes Techno made, you realize that Carlos tried to maintain this \"serious\" attitude as much as possible in his inner circle.\n\nFor instance, there's the story of how Nyei lost the car keys, and was very afraid Carlos was going to give her hell over it.\n\nAnd there's Reni's claim that Carlos wouldn't tolerate \"sugar eaters\" around him.\n\nOr was it \"cake sniffers\"?\n\nI can't recall.\n\nHe was trying to do something similar to what this picture shows.\n\nKeep things serious so that there was the best chance for people's energy bodies to come around more often, so he could gain access.\n\nHe even employed \"naked not-doings\" at the end, in a special women's class.\n\nHoping to lure their doubles around.  The double also might show up, if your physical body feels threatened.\n\nSomething don Juan took full advantage of, using his Allies to scare apprentices.\n\nCarlos told us about this situation. How there are some people whose energy body simply \"comes around\" often.\n\nYou can see it standing right there!\n\nNext to them.\n\nCholita is one of those.\n\nThat gives sorcerers access to it, so presumably they can do some teaching \"over there\", directly with the double.\n\nThe Nagual's Blow kind of merges the two, or at the least it puts the assemblage point of the physical body right near the assemblage point of the double (energy body).\n\nThe problem Carlos had with his attempts were that it doesn't matter if you PRETEND to be serious.\n\nThat's worse than just being yourself!\n\nBecause you're only doing that out of fear of being caught, violating some seemingly random and petty rules your guru leader has.\n\nIt really needs to come from inside, in order to lure the double back.\n\nIt's \"you\", inside, and how you focus your awareness on the most unpleasant aspects of reality, which drives the double away.\n\nThink of it like a nightmare, but for your double.\n\nHis nightmare is YOU.\n\nLet's be honest... You really suck.\n\nWe all do.\n\nSo having a leader force you to be serious is just not going to do anything.\n\nIt surely would have if Carlos had lived longer.  People might have eventually figured out why he wanted them to be serious and keep their attention focused on the task at hand.\n\nIt was perhaps a good long term plan.\n\nBut Carlos ran out of time.\n\nAnd maybe hadn't yet fully realized how hard it is to get anyone to be serious for real.\n\nBut he did get Kylie.\n\nSo they took her when they left.\n\nAnd the rest of us cake sniffers were simply too hopeless.\n\nThis is a large part of why I tell people not to change anything in their life, until they actually understand why that needs changing.\n\nOtherwise you'll just be like Nyei, trying to hide the fact that you lost the car keys.\n\nCholita has a problem with keys in general.\n\nLosing them.  \n\nI believe I'm up to 6 spare copies now.  I even started to put little ceramic ornament beads on them, such as a duck, so I could figure out which lost copy had turned up and where.\n\nBut the worst key problem she has is locking her car keys in her car.\n\nIt has expensive keys!  \n\nAnd they can't be copied anywhere but at a real locksmith who has an automated key mill.\n\nI tried to fix that by putting a spare copy I had made in a magnetic box hidden somewhere she can get access to on the car, from the outside.\n\nBut she wouldn't allow it.\n\nInstead, she learned to smash the window to get in.\n\nI believe last time, she had the window fixed by herself.\n\nI was surprised.\n\nBut this time she just decided to smash the passenger side instead, and redo it with art restoration materials. To *seem* to have a window.\n\nBut not.\n\nThat way if she locks her keys in the car, it's no big deal.  \n\nThe window is a fake.  \n\nNo need to smash it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Kylie Fierce: But why???", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"cjxsw4829xyb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf0debb9a852589857ea921b07cd974f018fff13"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a2afb6b34d07c34ab1256154a04a12fe11436e9"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=674f7e68029a116b50e16b3f4e427d674d8fbdfe"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6950f25f7ef0f33624ce92ec3bab03f306ee3c24"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a55590ad49efb9fa8978e41e1b53dff4528f2ea8"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0797244a17a1c7f4b079063d21e803806f86aa6"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ddba092fe34a31420aa0601c2c644b0e7c35744"}, "id": "cjxsw4829xyb1"}}, "name": "t3_17pti5m", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/n_IVjbUdD1d8rFnXo2E5-dg6QewkOSSjwxRQ7URfTeQ.jpg", "edited": 1699369698.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1699361193.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4ddba092fe34a31420aa0601c2c644b0e7c35744\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cjxsw4829xyb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4ddba092fe34a31420aa0601c2c644b0e7c35744&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sort of &amp;quot;blackmailed&amp;quot; into making this post, but you&amp;#39;ll have to get to where that can happen, to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose an analogy is, you have a wealthy uncle who likes to bring you candy.

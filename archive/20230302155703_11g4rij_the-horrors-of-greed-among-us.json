Outsiders tried to steal constantly, pretending to be \"the new apprentice of don Juan\". Or \"the real don Juan\".\n\nEndless villain's like Miguel Ruiz, Armando Torres, Ken Eagle Feather, Victor Sanchez, Merilyn Townshend.\n\nCarlos didn't back off from it the way Cleargreen does.  He called it out in classes.  Weekly.\n\nAnd the witches were proactive, going to see for themselves when a workshop was being held by fake Sorcerers trying to steal from the fans of Carlos.\n\nCarlos said they were \"riding on his back\".  Like monkeys.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad if they actually had any sorcery knowledge, but there's absolutely none among all of them.  It's total pretending designed to steal from people, until they figure out it's not working and go off looking for the next con artist.\n\nBut what really angers me is when those types of people take refuge in official organizations Carlos set up.\n\nAnd our own can't police themselves.\n\nHave the \"Cleargreens\" decided this is all make believe, so it doesn't matter who rips off whom anymore?\n\nFortunately Carlos was smarter than that, and created \"factions\".\n\nYou all know the Hollywood faction from the influence of our sorcery on hollywood movies such as Star Wars. Rumor has it, that was the doing of Soledad.  My theory is that the 800 year old lineage was very wealthy,  and when it ended Carlos imported their most valuable art and possessions here, to fund Soledad's activities in hollywood.  The witches said her motto was \"Money for Movies\".\n\nThere was also Faction M in Mexico. I have no idea what happened to those guys.\n\nUp here we had the official \"Cleargreen\", but then Carlos adopted Aerin, giving her power and creating \"Cleargreen #2\", originally an Argentinian faction.\n\nAnd we've identified 4 other \"factions\". One of which is the one Cholita, Jade, and I belong to.\n\n\"The Bad Batch\".   I do love those Star Wars movies!\n\nThe Bad Batch just wants to get things done, play with magic, and bust heads where people attempt to harm those we care about.\n\n The way Patricia seems to be harming those we care about. \n\nI have no idea what Christianaaa is up to.  Could even be an attempt by Carol Tiggs to transfer our knowledge into witchcraft.\n\nBut I don't see any magic yet.\n\nIt looks like greed to me. \n\nNO ONE WITH SORCERY KNOWLEDGE will take money from you.\n\nIt's unthinkable.\n\nCleargreen was designed to preserve and teach Tensegrity. That's different.\n\nBut when they branch out, or when Miles and Aerin create new tensegrity forms without explaining why we should believe those have the magical connection to the old seers, then it's no good.\n\nMiles is even associated with Patricia in some bizarre way.\n\nDO NOT MAKE UP NEW TENSEGRITY FORMS\n\nIt shows an absolute lack of any real sorcery understanding born of moving the assemblage point.\n\nThe Tensegrity forms reach DEEP into the dreaming of the old seers. YOU WILL SEE IT! If you only work to get the magic going.\n\nIt's  unbelievable what Tensegrity can do! \n\nBut the fake stuff only harms you by teaching you, it's all made up anyway. When it's not! \n\nSomething you made up only tries to reach deep into the pockets of those you try to steal from, by teaching it.\n\nYou have to see this with your own eyes to understand how serious it is, to make up fake sorcery and sell it to people.\n\nIt's like selling poisonous food for children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Horrors of Greed Among Us", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"edc98lpmgcla1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=911ba3817c29e796f4a9c24f3d07421781bd0080"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6326faf0d28ae0435efd0fc0f7b44f686a1e935"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=326a74506e7abf4ff952969f73a8091290ebf5be"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=282d81ae8810b91c3cef78135693ccb1a3fa528a"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adb0e424f6ac16afe4717eee6c066f254af6d5e4"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e16c5f8769042e883d00cdb1afe5b0c334ea000"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6620f0a71d4c728094860512f8e86fc2277fb066"}, "id": "edc98lpmgcla1"}}, "name": "t3_11g4rij", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/aea3MXrNhyzEcYHe02qzoooWlIfXv--vlDx7MiGZy-Q.jpg", "edited": 1677772712.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1677769023.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6620f0a71d4c728094860512f8e86fc2277fb066\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/edc98lpmgcla1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6620f0a71d4c728094860512f8e86fc2277fb066&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sorcery of Carlos was nearly lost to laziness while he was with us.

Certainly not Chinese ones, or Japanese ones.\n\nThose are a mix of 4 religions, including some cool shamanism I wish I could learn directly from the old women who practice it.\n\nPlus plenty of ancestor worship.  Which is a complicated ritual with \"seasons\" of some kind.  \n\nBut the Buddhist system has those amazing temples, and they're very good for marriages,  funerals, burning incense to ancestors, festivals, and so on.\n\nWith some charming social customs, like predicting what type of job your crawling aged baby will have when it grows  up.\n\nYou put toys on the floor, and see which one it picks up.\n\nIf it's the spatula, the baby will be a chef.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn Tokyo, the temple keeps underage girls as prostitutes for the wealthy Businessmen.  Under the guise of tea ceremony as I recall.\n\n14 is likely the minimum age in a \"respectable temple\", but in Taiwan they passed a law saying they could maintain 10 prostitutes of grade school age.  And the rest were illegal.\n\nThose were surely for politicians.\n\nYou have to wonder if there isn't some blackmail involved there.\n\nThen there's HUGE corrupt land deals.  They can convince some dying wealthy men that they can have a better next life, if they give them a whole bunch of land.\n\nI don't know how that corrupts things, but it's infamous.  \n\nAnyone in upper business circles knows about it.\n\nI asked what their political leanings are.

Certainly not Chinese ones, or Japanese ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are a mix of 4 religions, including some cool shamanism I wish I could learn directly from the old women who practice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus plenty of ancestor worship.  Which is a complicated ritual with &amp;quot;seasons&amp;quot; of some kind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Buddhist system has those amazing temples, and they&amp;#39;re very good for marriages,  funerals, burning incense to ancestors, festivals, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With some charming social customs, like predicting what type of job your crawling aged baby will have when it grows  up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You put toys on the floor, and see which one it picks up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s the spatula, the baby will be a chef.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, the temple keeps underage girls as prostitutes for the wealthy Businessmen.  Under the guise of tea ceremony as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14 is likely the minimum age in a &amp;quot;respectable temple&amp;quot;, but in Taiwan they passed a law saying they could maintain 10 prostitutes of grade school age.  And the rest were illegal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those were surely for politicians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to wonder if there isn&amp;#39;t some blackmail involved there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s HUGE corrupt land deals.

It's no longer \"Dance Home\".\n\nThe building opposite to the right is where Greg and Gabby hid, to try to video tape classes through those windows.\n\nThe practice room is above the radio shack, which might have been a Real Food Daily restaurant back then.  The Santa Monica one is since gone, so I can't verify the address.\n\nAll of those windows on the second floor are part of the dance hall.  Power Yoga (Hot Yoga) used to come before the class, and the windows were steamy at times.\n\nCarlos spoke to me about his death on those stairs below the \"YOGA\" sign.  The chacmools were parked near where that ambulance is, but on the street. They locked us in to those stairs, alone.\n\nGiven this, you can find your way back in time to view classes.   Look for the water cooler when you get upstairs.   At the top of the stairs, you should see it on the other end of the room, or you didn't find the right time period. It's your typical 5 gallon bottle water cooler.\n\nOne of Carlos' inorganic beings liked it.  It moved the water.  That might serve as a beacon.\n\nI have a student who can do this past event reviewing technique, although it's not as precise as you might hope.  I can't imagine getting good enough to find private classes, but at least you have a shot.\n\nScroll around on google maps in street view, to the right, and find the witchcraft bookstore. It's not quite that anymore, but it's still along the same lines.  Back then it had an entire section for Carlos' books. Now, none.\n\nBack then, Cholita and I sort of kept our distance.  I knew she was grumpy and troublesome.\n\nNow, we live together.\n\nA normal day for me with Cholita around always includes a lot of weirdness.\n\nBut it\u2019s the kind of weirdness you can only have when there are 2 people practicing sorcery, and one is  male, and one female.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mention it today, except that one of the people who writes to me and is currently a little drunk with dreaming power, described a dream he had where he was lucid, still partly awake, but he became a figure like Peter Pan.\n\nHe\u2019s a little violent, so rather than explore dreaming, he conquers it.\n\nHe was fighting and battling inorganic beings all night long.  He\u2019s able to return to dreams almost the instant he\u2019s kicked out. Or he can watch them play out by themselves, while he sits comfortably in his chair.\n\nHe commented to me that the normal world of people is so utterly boring and lifeless, that it\u2019s hard to understand how people tolerate it.\n\nHe also suggested that Peter Pan was a hint of how it\u2019s possible to use the dreaming body. That in fact, Peter Pan was someone\u2019s dreaming double.\n\nHe mentioned the shadow thing as proof.\n\nI don\u2019t know about that, but it made me decide to report something I wouldn\u2019t mention otherwise.\n\nThe real world is boring???\n\nCholita needed to go to Los Angeles to pick up some supplies for her business.\n\nI rushed home, hoping we could make it there in an hour and a half, before her store closed. I heard her cursing me from her bedroom, a typical welcome home, and I hurriedly tried to use the bathroom before she got impatient.\n\nI saw 3 silver rings on the sink. Two had little jewels in them, and were oriented so that the jewels were pointing the same way.\n\nThe 3rd ring was plain. It was clearly part of that set, but it had no jewel and it was blocking the 2 that did.\n\nIt was right in front of their jewels, which were pointing South East. Towards Mexico City, her home.\n\nAbove them on the vanity I saw that her love spell was still in effect. She\u2019d used colored tape to disguise the contents of 2 round bottles, possibly shampoo or lotion. They looked a bit like little people wearing white clothing. Perhaps dressed for a wedding.\n\nShe drew little hearts on each one, at the appropriate location if that had been a person. They were positioned together with the hearts touching.\n\nIf you think I\u2019m finding random things and interpreting them to be a spell, think again.  If I accidentally leave my toothbrush up on that shelf, and it\u2019s pointing the wrong direction, Cholita interprets that as an attack and disposes of it.\n\nI\u2019ve lost several that way, along with all other things I used to keep in the bathroom.\n\nI\u2019m allowed to leave them in the bathroom, but it\u2019s impossible not to make a \u201cmistake\u201d in how they are positioned. So I have to keep them in my bedroom until needed.\n\nShe had also painted her concrete back entry stairs pink, just before Valentine\u2019s day,  and the door there has a romantic scene of an Italian vineyard,  painted carefully all over the door, using oil paints.\n\nCholita is quite the painter. Makes abstract statues too.  And people actually buy them.\n\nThe Traffic was very heavy going into LA, and at one point the impatient Cholita commented, \u201cI can see death at the end of this trip.\u201d\n\nWe made it to LA too late due to heavy traffic.  Her store was closed.\n\nCholita stood banging on the door, and seeing no lights she shouted to me,  \u201cHey Grandpa! Take me to do laundry.\u201d\n\nShe had a huge bed cover that couldn\u2019t fit into an ordinary washer.  We\u2019d stuffed it into the car before leaving.\n\nWe had to go to the special laundromat, where they have 8 load machines.\n\nThe return traffic was heavy also, and Cholita scrolled impatiently through pics on her cell phone.\n\nDead people, ancient places, outdoor desert scenes.\n\nBeing a scout, she\u2019s restless and likes to look at things and places she can explore.\n\nMy skin was itchy. Cholita had filled the car with cobwebs. You could literally feel them everywhere in the air. At times I could even see them.\n\nThe points on my body touched by them didn\u2019t itch, but every other place did as a result.\n\nI didn\u2019t dare to scratch however, Cholita doesn\u2019t like that.\n\nIt\u2019s the OCD side effect of paranoid schizophrenia. They sense all movements of people around them, and get angry if the movement is even slightly out of the ordinary.\n\nShe turned away from her pictures, lay on her side so that she wasn't facing me, and seemed to be going to sleep. If I leaned in,  I could barely see that her eyes were closed.  Her cheeks were covered in gold glitter.\n\nMy hand instinctively waved out an inch or two over the steering wheel, to feel a particularly strong cobweb that was causing my eyebrow to itch.\n\nI wiggled my fingers in it, in a very subtle manner, trying to feel the energy.\n\nThe sensation was that of a very sturdy cobweb, but one covered with dust so that it wasn\u2019t sticky. Every wiggle gave the sensation of dark energy.\n\nCholita, who had seemed to be asleep and was turned away so that she shouldn\u2019t have noticed that, stuck her arm out at high speed. She pushed her hand between mine and her body, to block me from playing with that energy.  But she didn't change her sleeping position.\n\n\u201cAll Hail Jesus, saint of blood, with Satan\u2019s thieves ready for the virgin\u2026\u201d,  she chanted, as if she were a priest giving an invocation at a ceremony.\n\nI chastised her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s energy at that point. You should be able to feel that!\u201d\n\nShe said nothing. She still seemed to be asleep.\n\nShe finally farted and the car filled with a bad smell. It lingered for at least 5 minutes more.\n\nIn Los Angeles I had set my nav system to \u201cgo home\u201d, but I\u2019d long forgotten about that. I was on the last freeway stretch, and didn\u2019t need it anymore.\n\nThe off-ramp for our home is 2 off-ramps before the one for the laundromat.\n\nWhen I was almost there, the nav system noticed we\u2019d passed the off-ramp for \u201chome\u201d, and began to recalculate. I saw a flash on the nav screen, and panicked a tiny bit.\n\nI glanced over to see why it had recalculated, and saw the name of the off-ramp to home on the screen.\n\n\u201cOrange\u2026\u201d\n\nI stopped reading there. The full name is \u201cOrangethorpe\u201d, but I realized almost at the same instant I began to read, that we needed to go 2 more, and that I should have shut the nav system off much earlier.\n\nI didn\u2019t speak aloud. The panic and reading the name of the street had all taken place only in my mind.  Cholita was sleeping, and I didn't want to wake her.\n\nA few second later Cholita jumped up.\n\nShe was awake now. She said, \u201cYou were saying Orange\u2026\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t connected the 2 events.  It\u2019s so outlandish to assume anyone can read your mind, despite several examples in Carlos\u2019 books, that it wasn\u2019t even a thought.\n\nI told her she was wrong.  I insisted I hadn\u2019t said a word.\n\nShe said, \u201cYou just did. You said, Orange...\u201d\n\nI could tell she wanted to finish the rest of the sentence, but couldn\u2019t remember what else was said along with the word, Orange.\n\nI asked her, \u201cDid you *really* HEAR me say that?\u201d\n\nShe had a blank expression on her face, as if to say,  yes you said it.  But I don't remember the actual words.\n\nShe went back to sleep.\n\nThat\u2019s when I put the two events together.\n\nI said, \"Cholita, you read my mind!  That\u2019s impressive!!!\"\n\nShe wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\nWe did laundry, headed home, but at the last left turn we were blocked.\n\nAn Ambulance was in our way, and we had to wait.\n\nI wanted to wake Cholita up to tell her, we found death after all!\n\nBut I realized, she\u2019d take that literally and there would be trouble.\n\nLater that night, around 2AM, I was up looking at colors in the darkness. I hadn\u2019t tried to remotely connect to Cholita for a few days. She\u2019d learned to block me.\n\nThe dreaming fog was intense, but there were no details in the purple light. I glanced towards Cholita\u2019s room, and saw her face vaguely hanging in the air.\n\nWhen I recognized it, it expanded to 4 feet in diameter for just an instant, as if she\u2019d made the \u201cconnection\u201d herself.   This was Cholita in her 30s, but the head shrunk back down and became Cholita in her 50s, as she is now.   It wasn't her entire body, such as I see when she visits in her double.\n\nIt was only her upper torso.  It was the same as I was able to see, when I connected to her remotely, as Ren and Rey did in \"Last Jedi\".  That's where I got the idea, and realized you could actually do that.\n\n\u201cCholita\u2026\u201d  I said out loud.\n\nShe looked into my eyes with a sad, pleading look.  Then she vanished.\n\nThe room was now filled with tiny objects. Toys, pieces of small pipe, cigars, and just about anything you could think of, with a certain shape. I\u2019d say, it was anything shaped like half of a fat cigar.\n\nThey were aligned with the length pointing upwards.\n\nThey didn\u2019t float in the air.\n\nThey didn\u2019t respond to turning my head.\n\nThey were stuck, in the air. If you'd tied invisible threads to them, and tacked them to the ceiling, you could copy that scene.\n\nIf I scanned around the room, each one remained where it was supposed to be.\n\nThey were 100% \"directional\".  Those of you who have to turn your head to scoop colors, just don't worry about it.  It'll change.\n\nI walked around to try to see some up close, maybe even touch them,  at which point the objects vanished and the walls changed.\n\nI was now standing in a wooden building, such as you might find high up in the mountains.\n\nOr in an old ghost town.\n\nThe walls were entirely made of 2 by 4s, nailed close together with skinny side facing in the room.  That's the kind of construction you might use, to get better insulation from the cold.\n\nThe 2 by 4s were finished with a nice pinkish-tan paint.   The grooves were a little darker, as if someone had smeared stain over the painted boards, to give the room a nicer texture.\n\nThere were paintings and little shelves attached to the walls, as if the very long room was a public meeting place.\n\nPerhaps a restaurant with a little shop.\n\nCholita had assembled another world for me.\n\nMy mushroom entity came for a visit, and got excited at seeing the huge room to play in.\n\nEdited three times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cholita The Mind Reader", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"tgyrot0xrxh41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 64, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tgyrot0xrxh41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7878de503fc6b8372177a7ef53387a8e52bb5565"}, {"y": 129, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tgyrot0xrxh41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebfa3384fde134fd0c038ba7a14a6f6f0eb4c023"}, {"y": 191, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tgyrot0xrxh41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df962ac6344f7b8aab06c97ae941b380792b5c55"}, {"y": 383, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tgyrot0xrxh41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=effe10d92fceb5c41c3c6570c7ed91307ca14337"}, {"y": 575, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tgyrot0xrxh41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=185affa6d61df3ce82e0bd8f66ed00fbb31051f3"}, {"y": 647, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tgyrot0xrxh41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a437ef29973c929974ea1c7e9fa96a3f09cd5687"}], "s": {"y": 707, "x": 1180, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tgyrot0xrxh41.jpg?width=1180&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fac65dd2b181218f75c5439a6bd598d5204b32f"}, "id": "tgyrot0xrxh41"}}, "name": "t3_f6efkd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 11, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/H2l-dXLR5jf0Ac4H0XDiK4ztAlv-4r7-yps92_4g70g.jpg", "edited": 1582150716.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1582134820.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tgyrot0xrxh41.jpg?width=1180&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7fac65dd2b181218f75c5439a6bd598d5204b32f\"&gt;Where Cholita and I met.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0176193,-118.4936307,3a,75y,138.3h,103.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stBi1CCfXkbxDLWCUw78h_Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192\"&gt;https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0176193,-118.4936307,3a,75y,138.3h,103.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stBi1CCfXkbxDLWCUw78h_Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was Dance Home in Santa Monica, where most private classes took place.

They sense all movements of people around them, and get angry if the movement is even slightly out of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned away from her pictures, lay on her side so that she wasn&amp;#39;t facing me, and seemed to be going to sleep. If I leaned in,  I could barely see that her eyes were closed.  Her cheeks were covered in gold glitter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hand instinctively waved out an inch or two over the steering wheel, to feel a particularly strong cobweb that was causing my eyebrow to itch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wiggled my fingers in it, in a very subtle manner, trying to feel the energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sensation was that of a very sturdy cobweb, but one covered with dust so that it wasn\u2019t sticky. Every wiggle gave the sensation of dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita, who had seemed to be asleep and was turned away so that she shouldn\u2019t have noticed that, stuck her arm out at high speed. She pushed her hand between mine and her body, to block me from playing with that energy.  But she didn&amp;#39;t change her sleeping position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAll Hail Jesus, saint of blood, with Satan\u2019s thieves ready for the virgin\u2026\u201d,  she chanted, as if she were a priest giving an invocation at a ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I chastised her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere\u2019s energy at that point. You should be able to feel that!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said nothing. She still seemed to be asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She finally farted and the car filled with a bad smell. It lingered for at least 5 minutes more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles I had set my nav system to \u201cgo home\u201d, but I\u2019d long forgotten about that. I was on the last freeway stretch, and didn\u2019t need it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The off-ramp for our home is 2 off-ramps before the one for the laundromat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was almost there, the nav system noticed we\u2019d passed the off-ramp for \u201chome\u201d, and began to recalculate. I saw a flash on the nav screen, and panicked a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced over to see why it had recalculated, and saw the name of the off-ramp to home on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOrange\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped reading there. The full name is \u201cOrangethorpe\u201d, but I realized almost at the same instant I began to read, that we needed to go 2 more, and that I should have shut the nav system off much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t speak aloud. The panic and reading the name of the street had all taken place only in my mind.  Cholita was sleeping, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to wake her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few second later Cholita jumped up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was awake now. She said, \u201cYou were saying Orange\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn\u2019t connected the 2 events.  It\u2019s so outlandish to assume anyone can read your mind, despite several examples in Carlos\u2019 books, that it wasn\u2019t even a thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her she was wrong.  I insisted I hadn\u2019t said a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, \u201cYou just did. You said, Orange...\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could tell she wanted to finish the rest of the sentence, but couldn\u2019t remember what else was said along with the word, Orange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked her, \u201cDid you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; HEAR me say that?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had a blank expression on her face, as if to say,  yes you said it.  But I don&amp;#39;t remember the actual words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She went back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s when I put the two events together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said, &amp;quot;Cholita, you read my mind!  That\u2019s impressive!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn\u2019t impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did laundry, headed home, but at the last left turn we were blocked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An Ambulance was in our way, and we had to wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to wake Cholita up to tell her, we found death after all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I realized, she\u2019d take that literally and there would be trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later that night, around 2AM, I was up looking at colors in the darkness. I hadn\u2019t tried to remotely connect to Cholita for a few days. She\u2019d learned to block me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming fog was intense, but there were no details in the purple light. I glanced towards Cholita\u2019s room, and saw her face vaguely hanging in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I recognized it, it expanded to 4 feet in diameter for just an instant, as if she\u2019d made the \u201cconnection\u201d herself.   This was Cholita in her 30s, but the head shrunk back down and became Cholita in her 50s, as she is now.   It wasn&amp;#39;t her entire body, such as I see when she visits in her double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was only her upper torso.  It was the same as I was able to see, when I connected to her remotely, as Ren and Rey did in &amp;quot;Last Jedi&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s where I got the idea, and realized you could actually do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCholita\u2026\u201d  I said out loud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked into my eyes with a sad, pleading look.  Then she vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room was now filled with tiny objects. Toys, pieces of small pipe, cigars, and just about anything you could think of, with a certain shape. I\u2019d say, it was anything shaped like half of a fat cigar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were aligned with the length pointing upwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn\u2019t float in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn\u2019t respond to turning my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were stuck, in the air. If you&amp;#39;d tied invisible threads to them, and tacked them to the ceiling, you could copy that scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I scanned around the room, each one remained where it was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were 100% &amp;quot;directional&amp;quot;.  Those of you who have to turn your head to scoop colors, just don&amp;#39;t worry about it.  It&amp;#39;ll change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked around to try to see some up close, maybe even touch them,  at which point the objects vanished and the walls changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was now standing in a wooden building, such as you might find high up in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or in an old ghost town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The walls were entirely made of 2 by 4s, nailed close together with skinny side facing in the room.  That&amp;#39;s the kind of construction you might use, to get better insulation from the cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 2 by 4s were finished with a nice pinkish-tan paint.   The grooves were a little darker, as if someone had smeared stain over the painted boards, to give the room a nicer texture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were paintings and little shelves attached to the walls, as if the very long room was a public meeting place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a restaurant with a little shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had assembled another world for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mushroom entity came for a visit, and got excited at seeing the huge room to play in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

Very off-putting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It opens up all sorts of postulations, all of which are little more than mental masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit - August 17, 2021: &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210817145207/http://castaneda-ru.com/viewtopic.php?id=1346\"&gt;Castaneda-ru.com Post With Two Images of Dance Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/f6efkd/cholita_the_mind_reader/fi4e5td/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1582139369.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_f6efkd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fi78ly2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1582216506.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fi67qsy", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;What are the various classifications.\n\nI'm sure there's a way to *see* those, but I can't yet do that.\n\nSo I'd say a dreamer is someone who's good at that.  \n\nSome people just aren't.\n\nA scout is someone driven to go out exploring, like Cholita.\n\nIn dreams, inorganic beings scout us.\n\nCholita is so restless, she's going to run off at least once every couple of weeks.

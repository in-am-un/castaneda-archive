He wanted me to remember this clearly, so I could show you.  Carlos always let me stand just 8 feet away from him in classes, and sometimes as close as 3 feet.

I suppose you aren't old enough to see why he picked that name.  Myself, I thought it was kind of obvious.\n\nThere's a tensegrity dome on a roof in LA. Cholita loves it.\n\nCarlos created \"tensegrity\" as an organized \"system\", in order to teach thousands at once, and in honor of Howard he gave it a martial arts format.  But Taisha was a big Shotokan girl, and so was one of the women in don Juan's group. So it was natural.\n\nIn the books, you'll see individual hand or body movements.  Those are all \"tensegrity\". No reason for don Juan's party to come up with a \"system\", when showing individuals as needed was possible.\n\nDon Juan's back cracking is tensegrity.\n\nThere's undoubtedly HUNDREDS of movements in the books!\n\nThat's because, once you can visibly see energy flow, you can't help but realize you can manipulate it with your body.\n\nYou should read as much as you can in here. There's a wiki on the side.\n\nYou'll be pleased, because eventually you'll gain actual clarity of mind reading in here, which is needed for this path. It'll start to all sound obvious and true, rather than doubtful and dubious.\n\nOvercoming fear will come next, as you realize inorganic beings just LOVE tensegrity. \n\nIt drives them nuts, like baking cookies gets dogs all worked up in the kitchen.\n\nKen Eagle feather is a gigantic fraud, along with Miguel, Armando, Victor, Marilyn, and \"Colorado Carlos\".\n\nEven reading their material harms your chances to learn sorcery.  Carlos complained about them daily, but nothing can be done about dishonest con men.\n\nArmando gets the gentle treatment in the community, as if he's a good man.  I can't figure why.\n\nHe attended a lecture or two, did not share his notes, and Juan convinced him to cash in with a book.\n\nAnd then, another and another.\n\nOthers simply shared what they had with others.\n\nNot Armando.\n\nCarlos couldn't control bad men, exploiting his books.  As I recall, Ken even snuck into a workshop or two, trying to get people to come to his workshops instead.\n\nAll Carlos could do is tell them not to use his terminology, using a letter from his attorney.\n\nBut they did it anyway.\n\nYou won't be able to understand why reading their material is so harmful, until you have an inorganic being of your own and learn that \"intent\" is real.\n\nIt's like rusty old railroad tracks going back in time, to the old sorcerers.\n\nIt's the only path we have, in the dark sea of awareness.  They cut it.\n\nIf you pick up made up outside material, you're screwed.  It's like getting onto the newer railroad tracks, because they're easier to see.\n\nNope.  Has to be only the \"Intent of the Sorcerer's of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nNot Ken's delusions. Ken has the intent of greed and attention seeking.\n\nSorcery is HARD, HARD, HARD, HARD!!!!!\n\nYou can't afford to tie weights on your wrists and legs, the way phony sorcery books do.\n\n&gt;I had one session where I reached inner silence, entered a black space, and the colors formed 'heat-map' imprint of a man (like in Predator, the infrared heat-signature version of a man), and he was doing magical passes. \n\nThat's an inorganic being!\n\nPerhaps you had a \"monster in the closet\" as a child?\n\nThey just LOVE tensegrity.\n\nEven more fun, they will help you make new movements designed just for you.\n\nI discovered that, before Taisha's latest book became available, and mentioned that also.\n\nIt's always good to discover something you didn't read, and then read it later.  Very satisfying!\n\nFor that reason, Carlos banned me from reading the books anymore. I can only get snippets from other people.\n\nThat causes the community to direct my own intent, which I suppose is partly what Carlos had in mind.\n\nI investigate what the practicing people discover as they learn.\n\nAnd the new people learn what works.  Not what Cleargreen told them to do, to get some cash.\n\nIt's not a bad system! If it doesn't work, no one will ask me about the results, so I don't do it either.\n\nLast night, it was the 3rd point I was investigating, because of Juan.\n\nMy IOB went nuts when she discovered me doing that.   I suppose it's what IOBs are after. \n\n&gt;I did think at the time that it was tensegrity, but I didn't make much of it.\n\nSo here you have the reason Buddhist meditation is useless.\n\nHindu too.\n\nIt's because you will certainly discover the path, bu tyou are instructed to ignore it by meditation systems.\n\nThey need your money, with as little effort as possible.\n\nSo they tell you to ignore things.\n\nIn this case, you had an experience which should have become the basis for full sorcery knowledge, but no one told you it was important.\n\nCleargreen also does not tell their students what's important.\n\nI don't know why.", "edited": 1611271226.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gk462oe", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkroom gazing is from Zuleica, in Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But truthfully, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;finding your spot&amp;quot; also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the most important thing you can learn, which is why don Juan taught it to Carlos as the very first thing.

Afterwards, I agree, it was nice and the workshops were enjoyable and I made great friends, but I gotta admit, once I started workshops, even with Carlos around, the dreaming stopped abruptly and never resumed. I kept thinking we needed to learn stuff first before we really got to dreaming. Years later, I appreciate the experience, especially after I moved to LA, but on the other hand, I ain\u2019t lucid dreaming, haven\u2019t for many years, and feel kinda like a rube. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was only challenging you on the tensegrity thing as I really don\u2019t believe CC casually gathered different movements he\u2019d seen and then labeled them and tossed them out there. I experienced it all then (when he was around), and it wasn\u2019t like that, though admittedly it was all watered down after his death and I myself just wanted to cling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_l21ihh", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l21ihh/magical_ashton_avenue/gm0rlw5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1612464979.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1612464979.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "glzrkpa", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gkoyu4u", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l21ihh/magical_ashton_avenue/glzrkpa/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_glzrkpa", "created": 1612450722.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1612450722.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gkoyu4u", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Zazzy-z", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk3z0ie", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_72ilaw5n", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "You do know that Tensegrity and Cleargreen were set up by Carlos, right?

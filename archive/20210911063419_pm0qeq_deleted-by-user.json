And the way Carlos interrupted it and it stopped, is just like Ally behavior.  You never want to interrupt them, if you hope to get the end of that last sentence.\n\nI'm not sure about how the 2 lizards might come to be, with one on each shoulder, but it's not an issue.  \n\nI had Little Smoke and Devil's Weed chase me through several hotel lobbies, as seperate beings.\n\nIn fact, I think it happens in a place or two in the books.  Two allies at once, one of  them surely Little Smoke.\n\nLittle Smoke and Devil's Weed always paired up the first 20 years I ran into them.\n\nCarlos introduced us to them, calling the Allies \"Them\".\n\nAnd once every year or two for the next 15 or 20 years, both of them would show up and scare the hell out of me.  To remind me, I wasn't finished learning sorcery.\n\nPlus, \"Mystery\", the Ally Cholita brought me (there's a post on him) showed up as 5 beings at first.

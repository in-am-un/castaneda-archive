All the others have pretending.  The \"remote-viewing\" subreddit?  They can't remote view at all!  Go look.\n\nThe Dzogchen?  Where's the beef?  No one can tell you.  Go ask them.  Point to a single web page showing their \"Buddha Magic\" being taught.  As it is in here.\n\nThey can't find a single web page.  Google has exposed the fraud of Buddhism.\n\nNaturally the Dzogchen folks banned me from going there.  Very angry, buddhists are.  Dishonest too.\n\nI thought the Demon subreddit would welcome me!\n\nI could actually teach them to summon real demons, visible, semi-solid, who will lead you into hell if you like that sort of thing.\n\nI could have shown them Cholita's technique! She loves the road to hell!  Even gets a free demon escort.\n\nBut I was banned from the Demon subreddit in less than an hour.  The mod must have been in the bathroom, or it would have been sooner.\n\nAt least the Dzogchen mods put up with me for a day, trying to \"reason\" with me.  But it's no good. They don't  have the truth on their side.\n\nIt's all pretend out there.  If you don't realize that, your chances to learn the real thing are slim.  You first have to be able to tell the difference between real, and pretend.  Or there's no game.\n\nSo one thing we don't like to see, is pretend sorcery.\n\nIt's EVERYWHERE.  New Naguals, \"the real Carlos Castaneda\", \"The Real don Juan\",  a dozen \"La Gordas\".\n\nIt's really rather hopeless to try to bring magic to people, because they don't want it.  They want attention and money.\n\nAnd you can get that just by sitting in Yogi diapers on a little throne, pretending to be in \"bliss\" with a giant smile on your face.\n\nLook at how the Buddha has milked that superiority trip!\n\nWe're SUCKERS.\n\nDo yourself a favor and learn to be more discerning?\n\nMeanwhile, while looking through the Tensegrity videos on Cleargreen's website our Jadey picked up this one.\n\nAnd she sent me a link.  We have a subscription.\n\nBetween Jadey, me, and Cholita, we learned ALL of the tensegrity moves.\n\nAnd I can assure you, this goofy pass wasn't one of them.\n\nSo I'm rattling my chains a bit, and featuring it.\n\nBecause the origin is unknown, and it's not one that \"was in the pipeline\" when Carlos died.  Techno has given a \"cutoff date\" for those.  Was it 1999?\n\nAnything past that, and it's either made up or it's from Carol Tiggs.\n\nCarol Tiggs passes are VERY welcome, but out of a sense of responsibility at the very least they should have explained this one better.\n\nThat they didn't, is perhaps the only justifiable criticism.\n\nBecause in fact, this would work.\n\nIn darkroom, you can see the sort of results you'd get.  I added them.\n\nThat's no exaggeration!\n\nExcept maybe Minx sitting on a pile of nuts.\n\nHe wishes...\n\nBut I have seen inorganic beings (\"IOBs\") overdose on energy.\n\nThey can indeed.\n\nIn fact, the witches (Taisha and Florinda, and maybe Carol) have traveled to the edge of new worlds with their allies, only to find the Allies won't enter with them.\n\nBut the witches will!\n\nI tried to travel to the flier's home world, and Mad prophet's ally Ren (Lily) stopped me.\n\nSo the allies have their limits too.\n\nI put some Olmec figurines in this picture, just in case anyone wants to know how I justify the additions to the video stills.\n\nWell, I see that sort of thing at least a dozen times each night!  That's how I justify it.\n\nIt is NOT rare to see such things during darkroom, once you can move your assemblage point to the deep orange zone.\n\nBut you might be a bit offended, since this strays from \"the party line\" of Cleargreen, which seems to be that there's no reason to expect real magic.\n\nWell,  I for one hope you do!!!\n\nBecause otherwise you're in the wrong subreddit.\n\nThis very long movement will work.  It absolutely surely, will work.\n\nHowever, what works is not Tensegrity just because it works.\n\nTensegrity is a link to the old seers, and some movements they liked to do in dreaming, to invigorate themselves.\n\nThe assemblage point can move very far, and not just in one direction.\n\nWay way out there in waking dreaming, you can feel a little tired.\n\nOr have a grumpy feeling, despite being surrounded by amazing Fairies, wanting to please you.\n\nThose are subtle shifts in the assemblage point to the right.\n\nTo the left, you get \"sublime\".    As don Juan said he preferred.\n\nAnd a few simple physical movements, tensegrity, can fine tune your current assemblage point position.\n\nTHAT IS WHAT TENSEGRITY IS FOR.\n\nWhat it was always for.\n\nCarlos simply learned these one by one, without them being considered part of a \"system\".\n\nAnd so he put it into martial arts style forms, because he was a 60s and 70s kind of guy, and back then martial arts were HOT, and exciting, and new. Especially in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd the witches liked them. Taisha was on the collegiate Shotokan team.\n\nCarlos liked martial arts too, being well known in Marshall Ho'o's Tai Chi association.\n\nSo did I!  I studied at 15 different studios, sometimes as long as 6 hours a day. For decades.\n\nI get the appeal.\n\nToo bad all Asian martial arts are fake.  Just ask Brazil.\n\nOr the Wushu master of all of China, who got beat up in 30 seconds by a run of the mill MMA fighter.\n\nWe had an Ueshiba fan recently.\n\nUeshiba got some marginal green line effects from our J curve map, and like Buddhists it went to his head.\n\nHis Aikido was obviously fake, helped by his students.\n\nJust watch it. It's embarrassing to see.\n\nYoshinkan is vastly superior. That was founded by one of the \"other\" Aikido masters when WW2 ended.  The ugly guy. \n\nAikido was originally done in Japanese Armor.\n\nBut back then in Japan, post WW2, anyone who knew some martial art was creating a new system to sell in the GIs returning home to the USA.  Whether the martial art was any good or not.\n\nMost were not.\n\nIt's important to \"be real\", if you want to learn real magic.  No illusions!  If you cling to fake, you will become a fake.\n\nI suspect this form is from Carol Tiggs, or influenced by her.\n\nIt includes loud laughing, stomping, and clapping.  Just the kind of thing Carol does, which drives the book deal oriented men nuts at her workshops.\n\nBlow into a straw?!  They hated that.\n\nBut I found, it works amazingly well. I've been blowing my phantom realms into solidity for many months now.  I always use that technique!\n\nBut wherever the Duende came from, it will work.\n\nJust don't forget.\n\nIt's ok to \"play\"  in darkroom once you move your assemblage point to your goal.\n\nI love playtime!\n\nBut play, is not tensegrity.\n\nWhat works, does not have to have that connection back to the old seers.\n\nThat's what we need, that connection.\n\nThat's why we do Tensegrity in the first place!\n\nThe puffs, the energy body, the inorganic beings?\n\nThose are all real. And you can push them and play with them, using your hands.\n\nBut that doesn't make it \"tensegrity\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What Works Is NOT Always Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"88hujurzqfo91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=111c0cc1b7fbd597945d2c8336ad0dbce6a4c441"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c20521c55c4c7577d1856cb326c5fe08df877450"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba53ce774a2a1e423147e71c729796dadd2e1d3c"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=257563cf2a85762efe94d138e00d926bbfde65b3"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39ba93b4c8c4a57081ff693d9541a9e8f9426371"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6598d9b95ca615a15085b9a14e33519c2d79e0c8"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07d0f2b8bf553cfef45ee2283b182fb853ffd670"}, "id": "88hujurzqfo91"}}, "name": "t3_xgpwjd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WffzpD6QnnMi9rqrUY08r0035oJ8REnLDiCcTVgnThs.jpg", "edited": 1663431042.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1663429603.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=07d0f2b8bf553cfef45ee2283b182fb853ffd670\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/88hujurzqfo91.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=07d0f2b8bf553cfef45ee2283b182fb853ffd670&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, new people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This subreddit has REAL magic.

You'd have to be able to look at them, and then materialize their real body in a dream bubble in front of you, in their actual homeworld.\n\nWhere Fairy for example, looks a bit like a Mexican prayer candle.\n\n\\&gt;what is the difference between a sorcerer and a witch?\n\nOne is super annoying and angry and impossible to put up with, and the other too touchy to easily get along with?\n\nEither way you get your butt kicked.\n\n\\&gt;how do you define it?\n\nDon't need to.

A more technical description perhaps.\n\n\\&gt;a figure called \"the warrior.\"\n\nI don't know, I was banned from reading that book.\n\nAnd I'm not fond of the \"warrior\" thing.  It leads to very poor behavior, and never helps anyone learn real sorcery.\n\nI think it was only supposed to help you conserve energy while another sorcerer was teaching you in secret, in another state of consciousness.\n\nSo it's more like the \"boy scout oath\".\n\nNot really useful, except to keep the kids in line.\n\nBut then I didn't read that  much.  Skimmed it once because someone asked me a question about it.\n\nAs for freedom, do your sorcery awake. Then you'll understand that concept when you can literally walk off into other worlds several times a week.\n\nNot always though.  Leaving the room entirely takes stupendous amounts of energy.\n\nBut you can daily remain in the room, and remote view other worlds on the walls, bed, and floor.  Ceiling too.\n\nAnd in the end, it's your \"self\" you get to be free from.", "edited": 1663447997.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ioubrnu", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m awake, so I don&amp;#39;t have that issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I did stuff asleep, this subreddit would be nearly empty.

You&amp;#39;d have to be able to look at them, and then materialize their real body in a dream bubble in front of you, in their actual homeworld.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where Fairy for example, looks a bit like a Mexican prayer candle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;what is the difference between a sorcerer and a witch?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is super annoying and angry and impossible to put up with, and the other too touchy to easily get along with?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way you get your butt kicked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;how do you define it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t need to. Carlos did in the Silent Knowledge publication, and again in Readers of Infinity, and also in the J curve demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I go there almost nightly.   Though it can take 5 hours to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s exactly what he and don Juan said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, it&amp;#39;s just another name for &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;.  A more technical description perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;a figure called &amp;quot;the warrior.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know, I was banned from reading that book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m not fond of the &amp;quot;warrior&amp;quot; thing.  It leads to very poor behavior, and never helps anyone learn real sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it was only supposed to help you conserve energy while another sorcerer was teaching you in secret, in another state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s more like the &amp;quot;boy scout oath&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not really useful, except to keep the kids in line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I didn&amp;#39;t read that  much.  Skimmed it once because someone asked me a question about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for freedom, do your sorcery awake. Then you&amp;#39;ll understand that concept when you can literally walk off into other worlds several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not always though.  Leaving the room entirely takes stupendous amounts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can daily remain in the room, and remote view other worlds on the walls, bed, and floor.  Ceiling too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the end, it&amp;#39;s your &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; you get to be free from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_xgpwjd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xgpwjd/what_works_is_not_always_tensegrity/ioubrnu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1663447686.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ioty128", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Equal_Fox_5516", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1663441776.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_xgpwjd", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_dboej6d4", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "*I tried to travel to the flier's home world, and Mad prophet's ally Ren (Lily) stopped me.*\n\nHow are you able to recognize someone else's ally within the dream?

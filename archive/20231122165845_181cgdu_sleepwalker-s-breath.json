I could only surmise which was better and which worse by the order in which he gave them, but if you manage to move your assemblage point all the way to silent knowledge the third type of breath is automatic.  \n\n\nNot only that, but for the first time in your memory you won't have to do anything at all to breathe. You'll be the same as asleep. Breathing automatically.  \n\n\nWhich makes total sense, because anything from heightened awareness on, where the assemblage point is on the other side of the body, is technically \"sleep walking\".  \n\n\nCarlos asked don Juan if he were really asleep, and don Juan answered that while he didn't need to be laid out on a bed, he was indeed asleep.  \n\n\nThe goal of sorcerers might rightly be said to be to become sleepwalkers on demand.  \n\n\nDoes this version of Carlos, selected by the real Carlos as acceptable to play him in a movie, look creepy with our \"Talented Girl\" character?  \n\n\nJust imagine if he were 30 years older!  \n\n\nThat's what Carlos constantly looked like with the young women who came to learn sorcery from him.  \n\n\nNot much can be done about that. When there's an age difference like that, just standing too close to a young woman violates all sorts of social rules, mostly designed by women to prevent unfair competition.  \n\n\nTruth is, both men and women don't mind a huge age difference. They just know they can't get away with it.  \n\n\nUnless you're a billionaire. In which case it still looks \"creepy\".  \n\n\nHowever, sorcerers are nowhere near \"politically correct\" or it would be the end of magic forever.  \n\n\nThey use whatever is available, because it's so close to impossible to teach magic to people.  \n\n\nReal magic that is. The fake stuff is easy to teach.  \n\n\nAnd included in teaching real magic is a strong need to gain access to the double of your apprentices. Your double is no idiot, like your flesh (tonal awareness controlled) body.  \n\n\nAnd it turns out, when women are uncomfortable around older men their double comes by once in a while for a \"wellness check\".  \n\n\nCholita used to visit me in her double often, leading to ASTONISHING displays of unbelievable magic. I hope to animate all of them some day.  \n\n\nBut as she got used to living in my home and felt less threatened, the visits reduced to almost none.  \n\n\nIn his final days trying to help us learn, Carlos even implemented \"naked not-doing\" classes, for the women only.  \n\n\nAnd got crucified over it after he died. Mostly by women who weren't invited I suspect.  \n\n\nSo, let's do away with that sort of thing from now on? Otherwise we'll have even more phony bad guy \"Nagual's\" gathering their \"four winds\", from among broken nomadic young women searching for a place to stay.  \n\n\nOur ability to help people learn real magic is only going to come from the sheer numbers of people we can reach on the internet, and the very tiny chance one of them will be serious enough to do real work and reach Silent Knowledge.  \n\n\nOnly 1 in 500 of those who pretend to be interested, by my estimates. The rest are either too lazy to put in a real effort, or didn't fully understand how \"cold\" it is in the actual realms where sorcerers roam. So they go back to their ordinary life where it's horrible, but \"cozy\".  \n\n\nWhich explains why Carlos didn't succeed at teaching anyone while he was alive. He had too few to work with. He was pretty much pre-internet.  \n\n\nThe lineages of course used another method, as you can read about, as did the old seers who only took very young apprentices.  \n\n\nBut we have sheer volume.  \n\n\nSo no need to be excessively creepy anymore.

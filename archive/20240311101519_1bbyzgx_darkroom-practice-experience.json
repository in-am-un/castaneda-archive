Just like the green and red zones.\n\nAnd you might see that stuff if you get a cold and have a high fever, stand up too fast, hyperventilate with Wim Hof breathing, stretch and inhale deeply while looking up high,  or by any other number of things we normally associated with something physical being \"broken\", just because that's how we normally dismiss magic and keep our assemblage point from drifting.\n\nWe've learned to ignore things.  To categorize some as \"broken\", or \"just a dream\".\n\nOne such thing I was observing last night is that  you can easily learn to see your physical body in absolute darkness.  As if it were glowing in dull whitish tan light.\n\nIt's visible as a ghostly version, with all the main details like knees, calves, feet.\n\nMaybe not toes.  But there's enough that the sight of it will shock you, if you can \"find\" it.\n\nIf it were our eyes detecting IR light, from body heat, that would certainly explain it well.\n\nOn seeing it you'll think, \"Hey, I knew that was there!  How long as it been since I saw it?\"\n\nAnd you won't be able to remember.  Despite being certain you did.\n\nBut unfortunately, you have to \"tune it in\" if you notice it.  Or it won't increase until it's very convincing.\n\nAnd that's where the brainwashing by the family which raised us, has harmed us the most.\n\nWe'll ignore that initial sighting of the phantom body, so that it won't continue to \"tune in\".\n\n\"Tuning in\" requires your assemblage point to move just a tiny bit, but we're masters at blocking that movement with guilt, doubt and worry.\n\nBut as for what's usable to make progress in darkroom, we're not looking for \"anything at all\".\n\nWe're looking for \"real\"  things.\n\nNaturally if you can see stuff like \"TV Static\" in the air, stuff we don't classify as \"real\" because it's not quite there yet,  and if it's more visible when your internal dialogue is removed, then it's a good tool.\n\nTo help you learn how to deepen your silence.\n\nAnything which is MORE VISIBLE if you are silent, is a useful tool during darkroom.\n\nBut those ought to lead directly to the  \"real\"  things.\n\nWhich is what we're after.\n\nThe \"real things\" are a movement in depth along the J curve, while the \"phosphenes\" might in fact be a horizontal shift, up near the blue line.\n\nA puff of your energy body for example, is \"real\".\n\nThose are the purple puffs tensegrity is designed to manipulate.  Seeing those indicates that your assemblage point has moved down your back at least 4 inches.\n\nEventually those puffs are so real that I formed a few into a duplicate of myself last night.\n\nAs I watched.  On purpose.\n\nI noticed that they swarm the body, and you can in fact let them form a large \"blue ball of energy\".\n\nVery visibly!\n\nThe \"new seers\" recommend that.\n\nBut we all know those guys were \"stuck in the mud\" types.  Snobby.  Lacking in \"fun\".\n\nBecause you can also form those purple puffs into your \"double\", and then theoretically walk off in it. Or send it to do something on your behalf.\n\nOnce \"formed\", balancing on the difficult tensegrity moves which weren't designed to be done in total darkness, becomes easier.\n\nYou go from stumbling when you raise a leg too high in the dark, to seeing that leg as a glowing white ghost image, which gives you back your balance.\n\nPart of our balance is from visual clues, not from the inner ear.  We visually see that our body is tilted too far, remember that this results in toppling over in that direction, so we correct it.\n\nBut in absolute darkness we're \"too late\" to figure that out.\n\nOnce you can see your energy body as a glowing version of your real body, you have those visual clues back.\n\nAnd even better: You can retrain your muscle memory to look for that sight, when it's too dark to see the regular version of your body.\n\nThe old seers likely went even a step further than simply \"forming\" a phantom copy of their real body.  \n\nThey asked, why does it have to be the same as your tonal version?\n\nI'm pretty sure they even got it to \"form\" while mixed up with their ally in some \"evil\" way we don't know about yet.\n\nIt's a method of \"deliberate shape shifting\".  Like this jade figurine they carved. If that doesn't look \"evil\" I don't know what could be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14zut37p2pnc1.jpeg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c538d1ab60a2e99c9dca0fae16ec50282085390e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotice the man's double, shapeshifted into a WereJaguar, riding on the back of his Ally who makes a more realistic feline than he can.  \n\nHe's using his ally for a \"free ride\"?!\n\nSeems like that ought to piss the Allies off, but the ally is clearly liking it.\n\nLooks like a 3000 year old Pikachu.\n\nThat's what you can do by \"molding\" the puffs, using Silent Knowledge.\n\nThe next \"real\" thing would be an Ally coming to visit, because you are consciously looking at dream images.\n\nA woman's head or a horrible zombie demon ready to bite your head off,  materializing in the darkness.\n\nAll because you are consciously looking at dream images, the way you do in sleeping dreaming when you realize it's a dream and look at your hands. And then look at an object, back to your hands, and repeat.\n\nAt the \"First Gate\" of dreaming.\n\nNoticing the \"real things\" during darkroom is you deliberately looking at the elements of your dreams.\n\nIt signals the Allies that you can play with them, and they can gain enough energy from it to make it a worthwhile partnership.\n\nDoesn't matter if you are asleep or awake.  They don't care as long as you can perceive them.\n\nBesides those two \"real things\" are \"Silent Knowledge Previews\", where infinity itself has noticed you are making a serious effort, and the emanations for some \"magic demonstration\" light up.\n\nSo you get a \"preview\" of magic that's far beyond what you are currently capable of.\n\nThat also counts as something \"real\", except that the problem with that is, mentally ill people make up such experiences.\n\nSilent Knowledge is so seemingly random and vivid, that mental illness mimics it.  Could even be a real relationship there.  \"Leaky Silent Knowledge\" might be a diagnosis for some forms of mental illness.  With the assemblage point displaced to cause the leak, due to some underlying physical condition.\n\nWe see that all the time in here, where schizophrenic people make up experiences people know are FAR beyond their ability.\n\nAnd it's damned hard to tell those from the real thing.\n\nExcept when the people weren't looking specifically for the \"real things\",  and were mentioning other stuff hoping it would substitute.\n\nThat's what makes it so difficult to guide new people.   You really can't tell what's going on with them.\n\nAnd 50% are not actually seriously trying, but merely pretend to be putting in a hard effort, in order to get attention.\n\nMost of the time they're simply misrepresenting laying in bed and seeing something. Or dreaming it up.\n\nThat's how it works in the fake magic subreddits.\n\nIt's all fakery over there.\n\nSo people get insulted when it's NOT, in here.\n\nBut if you just keep trying, it will eventually produce magic so stunning, you'll have tears in your eyes.\n\nAnd no meaningful questions.", "edited": 1710159451.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kucu7mk", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not sure about things like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;ve been trying to figure that out for years now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With no success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some believe that the blue zone on the J curve also has some &amp;quot;stuff that can&amp;#39;t possibly be there&amp;quot; of it&amp;#39;s own.

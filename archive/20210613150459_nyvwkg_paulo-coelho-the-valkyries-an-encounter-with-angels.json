And since they are novels, and he is simply a writer and not an aspiring guru or 'me too nagual,' here are my old notes from his book The Valkyries:\n\n\u00b7 He told me that some things are so important that you have to learn about them on you own.\n\n\u00b7 Sit down, close your eyes, and I will show you what the second mind is. I want to know whether you are thinking about something else, something beyond your control. Think if it like a song that is stuck in your head, that you can\u2019t get rid of, that is the second mind.\n\n\u00b7 You are here. Try to understand that you are here, and that the things that surround you change you- in the same way that you change them. The need to live in the present, in the here and now, is a necessity. In order to live in the present, you have to control your second mind, and look at the horizon.\n\n\u00b7 All of us create a kind of \u201cmagic space\u201d around us. Usually it\u2019s a circle with about a fifteen foot radius, and we pay attention to what goes on within it. It doesn\u2019t matter whether its people, tables, telephones, or windows; we try to maintain control over that small world that we, ourselves, create.\n\n\u00b7 One should try, though, to look much further. To expand that \u201cmagic space\u201d and try to encompass a great many more things. \u00a0We call it \u201clooking at the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Your\u00a0horizon had been expanded, and you were thinking about angels, then an angel appeared.\n\n\u00b7 The exhaustion you felt was death arriving. Most people who die in the desert die with water in their canteens. The dehydration is so rapid that we feel as if we\u2019re drunk an entire bottle of whiskey, or taken and overdose of some tranquilizers. You should drink water periodically, even if you\u2019re not thirsty.\n\n\u00b7 Many people in this desert have already seen or conversed with their angel. So have a lot of people in cities, or at sea, or in the mountains. There was a tone, an impatience in his voice. You must always have a holy place. Mine once was a small apartment, and at another time, a square in the middle of Los Angeles. Now its here. It was here that I was first able to see my angel, although I knew that the angel was everywhere, and that the angel\u2019s face is the face of the desert that I live in, or of the city where I lived for eighteen years.\n\n\u00b7 The disembodied\u00a0spirits are those that wander between one life and another. Some are great masters- but all that they teach us we can learn on earth, because that\u2019s where they learned what they know. Better, then, to let them wander in the direction of their next step, to look out at the horizon, and to take from *here*\u00a0the same wisdom as they did.\n\n\u00b7 Angels are awe in action, they struggle to grow, and they are beyond good and evil. Awe that consumes all, that destroys all. Angels are made of that awe, and are at the same time its messengers. The awe of the angel of death, and the angel of renewal. Awe in action. **There is no awe in peace. Whoever seeks peace is lost.**\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWhy do we need to speak with our angels?\u201d \u201cTo discover through them,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u00b7 When we being to think about our angels, they begin to manifest themselves. Their presence becomes closer and closer, more real. But at the beginning, angels show themselves as they have done throughout our life: through others. You angel used that man who stopped to rescue you from the desert heat. He must have been caused to leave his home early- something must have changed in his routine, altering everything so that he could be there just at the moment that you needed him. That is a miracle. Do not try to regard it as a common event.\n\n\u00b7 Whenever I forget something, I feel that my guardian angel is in action, causing me to lose as few seconds- and this short time interval may signify important things. It may allow me to avoid and accident, or cause me to run into someone I need to see. So after I get what I\u2019ve forgotten, I always sit down and count to twenty. That way the angle had time to take action. An angel uses many instruments.\n\n\u00b7 He concentrated on his second mind. He allowed his thoughts to come to mind- and, as always, they were absurd thoughts for someone who was in \u00a0the middle of the desert. He was told to allow his concerns to flow freely. \u201cDon\u2019t fight your thoughts. They are stronger than you are. If you want to rid yourself of them, accept them. Think about what they want you to think about until they grow tired.\u201d This was the first step: pay attention to the second mind until it grew tired.\n\n\u00b7 Think until you are tired. Then when you are tired, open the channel. Sit in a quiet place and be attentive to the thoughts that emerge from the bottom of one\u2019s mind. If you want to make contact with the infinite, you have to make room in your soul. Every human being knew, subconsciously, that there was a bridge available to the spirit, a bridge one could cross without fear.\n\n\u00b7 At such times when we attempt to make contact, the invisible wall appears: **the second mind. It bares the entrance with its repetitive ideas, its unimportant problems, its melodies, its financial problems, its unresolved passions. Be patient and listen to everything your second mind has to say. Don\u2019t respond. Don\u2019t argue. It will get tired. Then your eyes will open.**\n\n\u00b7 The planet has set aside certain places for itself. It tells us to go away. In those places, without the millions of life forms that walk on its surface, the earth is able to be alone. It also needs its solitude, for it needs to understand itself.\n\n\u00b7 Suddenly he felt fear. Fear of not knowing how to continue. And when he felt the fear, his second mind returned- the concern and shame returned with it.\n\n\u00b7 It\u2019s a strange hour. No one spends much time in the desert at high noon. We learned that, in the worst way possible.\n\n\u00b7 Angels are visible to those who accept the light. And break the pact with the darkness. You say you have no pact with evil. I am talking about your pact with defeat. At some point in our lives we all enter into such an agreement: not to win when victory is possible.\n\n\u00b7 Promise that never again- never again- will you raise your hand against yourself. I said that I was afraid to say that, because I didn\u2019t know how to comply. From that moment on you will still have many problems in your life, but God will be responsible for everything- you will interfere no more.\n\n\u00b7 Follow the dictates of your heart.\u201d Some one in the crowd said \u201cthat\u2019s impossible, people have obligations. People have to earn a living.\u201d They replied \u201cwell, meet your obligations. But obligations never presented anyone from following their dreams. Remember that you are a manifestation of the absolute, and do only those things in your lives that are *worth the effort*. Only those who do that will understand the great transformations that are yet to be seen.\u201d \n\n\u00b7 Pointing to the monument in the middle of the square, he said \u201clets suppose that paradise is there. And every person on earth is here in the plaza. Each of them had their own path for arriving there. That\u2019s why people talk with their angels. Because only the angels know the best path. It does no good to seek advice about it from others.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 We are many, and we are spread over the whole earth. All of us moved by the same (drive). What we are asked is to pay the price for that, for the return to paradise. Sometimes it is a very high price. But there are people who are willing to pay it.\n\n\u00b7 He had been in the darkness long enough. \u201cI will break the pact,\u201d he said to the desert light. \u201cGod has the right to destroy me. I do not.\u201d His angel was listening, and was happy at not having to devote efforts to keeping him from destroying himself.\n\n\u00b7 Everything we do in the daily world is a ritual. Just as a mass is a great ritual, composed of various parts, the everyday experience of any person is, also. A carefully elaborate ritual that\u00a0the person tries to perform precisely, because he or she is afraid that- if any part is left out- everything will go wrong. The name of that ritual is routine. \u00a0When we are young we don\u2019t take anything to seriously. But slowly, this set of daily rituals becomes solidified, and takes over. Once things have begun to go along pretty much as we imagined they would, we don\u2019t dare risk altering the ritual. We like to complain, but we are reassured by the fact that each day is more or less like every other. At least there is no unexpected danger. \u00a0That way we are able to avoid any inner or outer growth, except for the kinds that are provided for within the rituals: so many children, such and such a kind of promotion, this and that kind of financial success. When the ritual becomes consolidated, the person become a slave. \u201cDoes that happen sometimes with those on the path?\u201d Of course. They use the ritual to make contact with the invisible world, to destroy the second mind, and to enter into the extraordinary. But, for us too, the terrain\u00a0we conquer becomes familiar. And we feel the need to seek out new territories. But we are all fearful of changing the ritual. It\u2019s a fear of the unknown, or a fear that other rituals won\u2019t function as well- but it is an irrational fear, a strong one, that never disappears without some effort.\n\n\u00b7 He recalled that once an animal trainer had told him how he was able to keep his elephants under control. The elephants, as infants, were bound by chains to a log. They would try to escape, but could not. They tried throughout their entire infancy, but the log was stronger than they were. So they became accustomed to captivity. And when they were huge and strong, all the trainer had to do was place the chain around one of their legs and anchor it anywhere- even to a twig- and they would not attempt to escape. They were prisoners of their past.\n\n\u00b7 \u201cSomeone once said that the earth produces enough to satisfy needs, but not enough to satisfy greed,\u201d the old women replied.\n\n\u00b7 I said to the old woman that I knew that I was going to die. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. Not like an old person does. For you, it\u2019s a remote idea. It might happen some day. For us, its something that could happen tomorrow. That\u2019s while many elderly people spend the time remaining to them looking only in one direction: the past. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re so fond of their memories, rather they know that in that direction they won\u2019t see anything to be feared. Very few old people look to the future, and I\u2019m one of them. When we look into the future, we see what it holds for us: death.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Some people feel that they are alive only when they are facing challenges. They are the hunters, and for them it is the only way to achieve their power. For others it is the way of the farmer\u00a0(the cultivator), and it is on that path that they find their power.\n\n\u00b7 Paulo took a deep breath. He closed his eyes, and concentrated: His second mind was coming and going, saying no, that it was all in his imagination, that his angel would not show himself. But he dug the nail of his index finger into his thumb until the pain was insupportable; pain always banishes nonsensical thinking.\n\n*\u00b7* *It has already been said*, the voice answered. *It is simply being remembered*.\n\n\u00b7 He was in the presence of another miracle. His angel had responded. He felt the universe stop, the sun, the butterfly, and the desert there before him. And in the next moment the air around him trembled. It wasn\u2019t the wind. It was a shock of air- the same as one feels when a car is passed by a bus at high speed. A shiver of absolute terror ran up his spine. He was not alone.\n\n\u00b7 In this place, the energy of the soul of the world was felt, and it will be felt here forever.

We didn't have a Nagual push us there.\n\nI believe the kind of stability you're after,  happens when you are primarily in the energy body.\n\nCarlos explained this in the Zuleica account.\n\nHe was already in heightened awareness when he came to the door, and Zuleica assaulted him with Zoila's Vagina.\n\nDon Juan put him there.  But he didn't seem to be enjoying himself much.\n\nSo we have to be careful not to think of heightened awareness as the \"blissful destination\".\n\nI suppose that's one risk of darkness gazing.\n\nTo believe that the start,  is actually the goal.\n\nWe're trying to get to the starting gate for learning, the one that a double being produces for his apprentices.\n\nAs don Juan said of heightened awareness, \"real learning takes place there\".\n\nAnd Carlos commented, another benefit is that you forget it all.\n\nIt's just a \"learning state of mind\".\n\nIt happens to be the same as \"Zen\",  or \"Cosmic Consciousness\", but that's just an unhappy coincidence.\n\nBecause when we get there, we drag out our Hindu/Buddhist inventory, and confuse ourselves.\n\nI'm seeing that in some students who only private chat me.\n\nTheir inventory is getting in the way of darkroom gazing.\n\nSo it's probably best not to even pay attention to what state you are in, and concentrate only on what you can \"do\" there.\n\nNot as a goal. But to keep you moving further by holding your attention.\n\nWe have to get to heightened awareness ourselves.\n\nSo that we start learning for real, instead of pretending and making up intellectual understandings.\n\nBut heightened awareness is not the goal.\n\nYou merely got into the right classroom.\n\nAnd you can still confuse yourself in that \"right\" classroom, if you brought along the wrong books for that class.\n\nHeightened awareness  was just the starting point for Carlos.\n\nHe did find his \"restful place\",  like you are now looking for.\n\nHe called it, \"restful vigil\".\n\nBut he found that AFTER he completed the finger wiggling process, folded in half, and ended up in a ditch of the second attention.\n\nHe switched bodies.\n\nLater, because he had \"restful vigil\", he could continue the training.\n\nHe next did Silvio Manuel's \"not-doings\".\n\nI supposed those require you to be primarily in the dreaming body, so you can do such things as sit up with knees against your chest, listening all night.\n\nThat's pretty hard to do, unless you reach the \"no-boredom\" place.\n\nI supposed we should not miss the order in which those seemingly unrelated techniques were taught in the books.\n\nApparently, that's the only order you could teach them in!  The second set requires the skills attained from the first set of techniques.\n\nWe've all read the books, and come to think of the two bodies as separate.\n\nSo it sounds silly that you could switch back and forth without noticing it.\n\nBut we just didn't read carefully.  Carlos switches bodies in Zuleica's account.\n\nAnd then he doesn't even bother to mention it from then on.\n\nOne day he completes Zuleica's training, folds in half, and then he moves on.\n\nWhen he folded in half, he learned to let this dreaming body absorb his tonal body, to ride along.\n\nIt's how you can teleport too.\n\nOr float around over the dirt, the way Genaro did.\n\nDarkness gazing seems to have a strange side effect.\n\nRemember, this is pretty  much Zuleica's technique only.   Nothing has been added, except to do some tensegrity on the colors you see.\n\nBUT, we don't start in heightened awareness.  And so we notice arriving there, but we don't notice switching bodies.\n\nCarlos was already there, so the only thing he was after was to switch bodies by wiggling his fingers on the point of the second attention.\n\nOne last thing, because what I'm proposing here sounds controversial.\n\nI'm proposing that you can smoothly switch between the bodies, and that the idea of switching dramatically, is not necessarily the only way.\n\nI'm even proposing, you could switch just your hand. And not the rest of you!\n\nFirst, about how easy it is to switch, once you learn to do it.\n\nYou just glance down!  That was the final lesson from Silvio Manuel. You can easily switch back and forth!  Just glance at the same place you were wiggling.\n\nBut more evidence comes from Carlos.  Several times in private classes, and at least once at a workshop, talking to the audience, he said that there are a few people in the group who's dreaming double is, \"right there!\".\n\nHe pointed to his right side.\n\nMeaning, you can be talking to that person, and their dreaming double is pressed up almost against them, like a best friend.\n\nIt's certainly not visible to them.\n\nAnd then there's Pablito's second attention hand.\n\nI doubt he grew a new one!\n\nHe just taught his double to reach through his lower shirt, so it could pop up low and attack or scare people.\n\nSummary: You're missing something.  You're doing everything, but possibly fixated on \"enlightenment\".\n\nThe idea that it's permanent.\n\nIt is not.\n\nBut you can get to be so fluid and skilled, that you can switch around as needed.\n\nThat's the permanent part.

You&amp;#39;re doing everything, but possibly fixated on &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea that it&amp;#39;s permanent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can get to be so fluid and skilled, that you can switch around as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the permanent part. That you learned something useful and made other options available.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_iq3hm4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/iq3hm4/the_bliss_train/g4pim17/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1599757121.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1599757121.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g4pu3ne", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g4pm3g6", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;I'm not convinced you'd really want to be in that state all the time.\n\nAt least I want to experience it!!\n\n&gt;Yes, that surely happens.

Am I bored even a tiny bit?\n\nJuan discovered that the assemblage point moves faster, when you are looking at stuff that keeps you very interested.\n\nI wanted to see why that might be, so I could tell people a way to avoid boredom entirely.\n\nI had to admit, I was a very tiny bit bored.\n\nEven surrounded by magic.\n\nMy \"boredom\" was thoughts about watching TV news next, to see what was up with the fires.\n\nThe sky had been so filled with smoke all day that the sun was a dull orange color and you could look right into it.\n\nI remembered many times when I could have asked myself that question, am I bored now, in heightened awareness, after practicing 4 hours straight.\n\nAnd the answer would be obvious.\n\nHow can I get bored in this state of consciousness?

Turns out, as sappy as that sounds it's true.\n\nBut at that particular instant, I was a tiny bit bored.\n\nFancy, my new inorganic being, helped me move my assemblage point a little further by continuing to model for me as a power object  \"ring\".\n\nHer \"ring\" was basically her full sized head stuck to my knuckles.\n\nI had to tell her, \"That's too big Fancy!  It's like a bowling ball on my hand.\"\n\nShe didn't look happy.  I couldn't get her to shrink. She tried fooling me by changing over to a \"hoodie\".  Then she distracted me even more, because when I moved her in the air she created opaque ripples in reality.  It seemed to be the hoodie doing it.  The cloth would ripple, and the ripples would continue into the air.\n\nSame as the first time she showed me that technique, wearing Little Red Riding Hood's costume.\n\nThat did the job.   Watching the edges or waves of a reality ripple.\n\nIt was like an ocean wave on the sand, going over garbage dropped by visitors.

Object after object.\n\nI instantly reached what I call, \"full-on\" heightened awareness.\n\nAll boredom was gone.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nWhy boredom at one position of the assemblage point, and no boredom at what still must be relatively the same position?\n\nPossibly which body is being emphasized.  You pretty much can't grab an object out of a \"reality ripple\", using your physical hand.  It has to be the dreaming hand.\n\nAnd our Tonal is \"made to hurry\" as don Juan put it.  If you're all physical, you're going to want to hurry up.\n\nOur dreaming double seems too intoxicated to get bored.  And I'm not going to give it credit for being superior.\n\nIt's simply drunk, that's all.\n\nPossibly the answer to the finer details of heightened awareness is that we switch back and forth between the two bodies in darkroom gazing.  And the no-boredom body is our dreaming body.\n\nYou (Juan) possibly \"grabbed\" onto it for an instant, from your bliss filled Tonal, reaching out your dreaming hand, and switched to the dreaming double for 2 minutes.\n\nDramatic much????\n\nReminds me of Pablito's invisible third hand.\n\nI wish I could grab a passing train and switch to my dreaming double!\n\nI have to use a demon's hoodie to do that.\n\nBut you got tossed out because it's very difficult to maintain that state, when you're still dragging around both bodies.\n\nDarkness gazing has a strange side effect.  You learn to switch back and forth between bodies, without even noticing it.\n\nIt's what's prevented Fancy from trapping me in her home world. I always insist on bringing both bodies along. And the Tonal is too heavy for her to control.\n\nWe should also remember that recent posts about the wheel of time mentioned that it was accessed through heightened awareness in the \"other self\".\n\nUnfortunately opaque terminology...\n\nBut I'll assume he means the dreaming double, the one Cholita can walk around in, as if it were just normal daily activity.\n\nWe switch back and for between that one and our normal body, while doing darkness gazing.\n\nSometimes what we need to perceive is very difficult, so we \"borrow\" the eyes of that double.\n\nSometimes, such as when entering another world, you have to switch over entirely.\n\nBut the switching is unnoticeable.\n\nI believe you're trying to exist only in the second copy.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1599754837.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g4p6l3s", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently I just work for Little Smoke.

And I&amp;#39;m not going to give it credit for being superior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simply drunk, that&amp;#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly the answer to the finer details of heightened awareness is that we switch back and forth between the two bodies in darkroom gazing.  And the no-boredom body is our dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You (Juan) possibly &amp;quot;grabbed&amp;quot; onto it for an instant, from your bliss filled Tonal, reaching out your dreaming hand, and switched to the dreaming double for 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dramatic much????&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of Pablito&amp;#39;s invisible third hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could grab a passing train and switch to my dreaming double!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to use a demon&amp;#39;s hoodie to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you got tossed out because it&amp;#39;s very difficult to maintain that state, when you&amp;#39;re still dragging around both bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkness gazing has a strange side effect.  You learn to switch back and forth between bodies, without even noticing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s prevented Fancy from trapping me in her home world. I always insist on bringing both bodies along. And the Tonal is too heavy for her to control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should also remember that recent posts about the wheel of time mentioned that it was accessed through heightened awareness in the &amp;quot;other self&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately opaque terminology...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ll assume he means the dreaming double, the one Cholita can walk around in, as if it were just normal daily activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We switch back and for between that one and our normal body, while doing darkness gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes what we need to perceive is very difficult, so we &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; the eyes of that double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, such as when entering another world, you have to switch over entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the switching is unnoticeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe you&amp;#39;re trying to exist only in the second copy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/iq3hm4/the_bliss_train/g4p6l3s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1599752957.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_iq3hm4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}]

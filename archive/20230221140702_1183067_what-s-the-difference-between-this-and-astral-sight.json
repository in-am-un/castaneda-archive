It would just be hundreds or thousands of years ago.  But it was still a scam.\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't actually see those under some circumstances. Just that they aren't more important than any nightmare you might have.\n\n\\&gt;Can this be used for physical well being? Eg healing injuries...obviously this is a form of energy flow so I guess it can be used for balancing energy?\n\nThat's a speciality.  Not anything i'm interested in, but each \"lineage\" of sorcerers likely had a doctor in it.\n\nAnd of course, there's shapeshifting. That can cure any ailment.\n\nBut that also is a \"speciality\".\n\nThere's also \"jumping grooves\" which means, you find your way to a specific \"reality tunnel\" in which you can see all possible timelines.\n\nMight be the same as \"the wheel of time\".\n\nCarlos described it to us, and I've seen it once or twice.\n\nWhile inside that tunnel, of dubious diameter, you can find \"grooves\".\n\nIf you stick your head into a groove, you are peering into a possible alternate reality you can switch to.\n\nBut it takes a LOT of energy to do that.\n\nEnergy you can  use up, trying to help teach others.\n\nIn the end, trying to heal others comes at a price.\n\n\\&gt;Is this similar to what mediums or psychics do? At least the remote viewing part\n\nAbsolutely.  And if you like remote viewing, you hit the jackpot!\n\nWe do that fully awake. Eyes open. Sober.\n\nAnywhere in the universe which you have memory of, or some kind of way to \"locate\" it.\n\nYou can even reach down into the remote views, perhaps on top of your bedspread, and pull stuff out.\n\nOr leap into them in your double, and visit.\n\nWe're the masters of that activity, and we do it eyes open, fully sober, and alert.\n\nAnd can travel there in physical form of some kind.\n\nI once chased my witch friend (enemy?) Cholita across 2 continents using remote viewing.\n\nShe came into my practice room in her \"double\" form, and challenged me to play hide and seek with her.\n\nBut I'm awake, so following a dream double through solid walls is too hard.\n\nI had to give up after she lost me on a forest path.\n\nI still managed to track her down by remote viewing on my bedspread.\n\nIt's in posts from 2 or 3 years ago, you can see the details.\n\n\\&gt;Do you adhere to or encourage any form of \"golden rule\" or karma system\n\nNot like you mean it.  We do believe that actions produce consequences, but witches for example can use  magic for good, or bad.\n\nWith no consequences to themselves, other than they become more powerful witches.\n\nAsk the orange tom cat, which Cholita cursed.  It could tell you, witches are real, and it's not a good idea to piss on them.\n\nExcept it's dead now.\n\nAny resemblance to \"karma\" in our system, has to do with \"intent\".  How reality forms, from the dark sea of awareness.\n\nBut there's no overall \"humanness\" guiding that system. The universe does not favor any particular life form, or make judgements about how they relate to each other.\n\n\\&gt;Is it possible to \"push out\" or hide yourself from someone's remote influence\n\nNot only that, you can \"reverse the charges\".\n\nAfter I saw Ren and Rey remote view themselves in one of  the latest star wars movies (which are based on our magic), my spirit \"Fancy\" taught me to do that with Cholita.\n\nSo I could spy on her wherever she was.\n\nBut she \"noticed me\" one night, and I saw her face turn abruptly to look directly at me, then she pushed her hand and collapsed the tunnel.\n\nI couldn't reach her anymore, without the help of a powerful spirit.\n\nLater I caught her doing the same thing to me. Spying from a distance.\n\nShe didn't like that I was using her spirit \"Minx\" to try to lead witches to my darkroom, or give me passageway to where they were located.\n\nMinx was good at that but Cholita didn't like me \"borrowing\" him.\n\nSo she was watching to try to figure out how to interfere and make it less desirable to try that.", "edited": 1676997580.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j9fraao", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempt #2.

A sister to the north african variety, and one which was preserved in Mexico where they migrated and thrived for thousands of years.\n\nUnfortunately (for me), just daring to say, \"The Buddha was a delusional putz\" raises eyebrows, even among non-Buddhists.  There's a dark force hiding magic from the world.  Only the pretend kind is welcome.\n\nStudy this map, but keep in mind that being a woman you can violate it at any time.\n\nThat's what makes witches so dangerous. They don't have to follow procedures at all.\n\nIn a nice bath, surrounded by nice smelling flowers and candles, any woman can kick the Buddha's lazy butt.\n\nAnd they do!  They've just been oppressed until they don't realize what's going on.\n\nThere's a reason the Jewish Prophets commanded their tribes, \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\".\n\nBecause witches can see through all the pretend \"modern\" male magic.\n\nAnything less than 5000 years old is a total scam (that's when money was invented).\n\nWe got the map because two women skipped the whole path thing and moved all the way to the end.\n\nUnfortunately they couldn't remember after that.  Memory loss is one of the things that keeps all this magic hidden from the world. And as far as I know, they gave up when Carlos died.\n\nThey fell prey to one of the weaknesses of most women.  They want to practice magic in a group.   Not alone.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=415bd8182c8ffc50c1caa5ba586d36d54c89b537](https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=415bd8182c8ffc50c1caa5ba586d36d54c89b537)\n\nBy the way, \"Astral Sight\" sounds like a combination of astral travel and \"second sight\".\n\nIt's surely just another bad man's scam.

Which Carlos gave us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;Astral Travel&amp;quot; comes with serious delusions, and prevents people from going further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for &amp;quot;Buddhist Enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It creates insurmountable delusions in the &amp;quot;masters&amp;quot; who never get anywhere other than to sit on a little throne, and help the Buddhist temple system continue to steal from the population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to actually be able to move to the deep orange &amp;quot;station&amp;quot; on that J curve map, before you see through such phony magical figures as &amp;quot;The Buddha&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Jesus&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Lao Tzu&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to  have stunning magic far beyond anything they ever even thought of, using a more pure form of their very same techniques, before you can fight off the brainwashing we&amp;#39;ve all received.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ours is Proto-Siberian shamanism. A sister to the north african variety, and one which was preserved in Mexico where they migrated and thrived for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately (for me), just daring to say, &amp;quot;The Buddha was a delusional putz&amp;quot; raises eyebrows, even among non-Buddhists.  There&amp;#39;s a dark force hiding magic from the world.  Only the pretend kind is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Study this map, but keep in mind that being a woman you can violate it at any time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what makes witches so dangerous. They don&amp;#39;t have to follow procedures at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a nice bath, surrounded by nice smelling flowers and candles, any woman can kick the Buddha&amp;#39;s lazy butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they do!  They&amp;#39;ve just been oppressed until they don&amp;#39;t realize what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a reason the Jewish Prophets commanded their tribes, &amp;quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because witches can see through all the pretend &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; male magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything less than 5000 years old is a total scam (that&amp;#39;s when money was invented).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got the map because two women skipped the whole path thing and moved all the way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately they couldn&amp;#39;t remember after that.  Memory loss is one of the things that keeps all this magic hidden from the world. And as far as I know, they gave up when Carlos died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They fell prey to one of the weaknesses of most women.  They want to practice magic in a group.   Not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=415bd8182c8ffc50c1caa5ba586d36d54c89b537\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=415bd8182c8ffc50c1caa5ba586d36d54c89b537&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, &amp;quot;Astral Sight&amp;quot; sounds like a combination of astral travel and &amp;quot;second sight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s surely just another bad man&amp;#39;s scam.

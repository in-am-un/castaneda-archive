Not that I have the answers to that odd topic of \"non-linearity\".\n\nWe know that the old seers found at least 600 \"stable\" positions of the assemblage point, which formed full worlds you could live in.\n\nI presume you just move your assemblage point there, and never come back.\n\nKeep in mind, you're still on earth.  If there's such a thing as physical matter, and we're stuck with it for now, that's also still on earth.\n\nIt's not like you left this world entirely, abandoning your physical body.\n\nWhich needs maintenance.\n\nThat situation would be more puzzling.\n\nAnd we do know that the old seers buried themselves, and lived on hundreds of years in an inorganic being like form.\n\nThey were pretty much ghouls here, hiding under huge rocks waiting for people to pass by, so they could feed them to their allies by scaring them to death.\n\nOur very own  Xoxopanxoco (the death defier's female name) was surviving in a similar manner.  Except instead of hiding under a rock and transforming into an inorganic being, he figured out how to return to the world of the living for a while, so he could borrow energy from the next Nagual in our lineage.\n\nHe was still kind of doing the same thing though.  He just wasn't murdering random people who were unfortunate enough to pass by where his body was buried.\n\nAnd there's the whole confusing part about how the inorganic beings' kidnapped him for 7000 years.\n\nSo where his flesh body was hanging out, we just don't know.\n\nBut he was somehow able to survive, and if he still needed food he got some.\n\nJadey and I theorize he was tied to that Church in Tula.  Which is where the Toltec empire ultimately fell.\n\nSo his case was a little different than the 600 stable positions of the assemblage point that the old seers found.\n\nWhich seem to be the same as \"Cyclic Being\" worlds.\n\nThat's part of the whole \"non-linear\" topic.\n\nIn one of the witches books, Taisha is told that she might be an \"old soul\".  Sadly a search just now didn't find it.\n\nBut Taisha misunderstands this as referring to re-incarnation, and is told that all of the lives are happening right now, at the same time.\n\nThose are cyclic being lives.\n\nWe live 600 times, all at once.\n\nHow much influence one alternate life has on this one, is unknown.\n\nBut it's possible that sorcerers pick up the others from time to time, and when they run into a new person there's \"non-linear\" stuff going on.\n\nIt's also possible that a sorcerer might recall something \"seen\" long ago, when they bump into a new situation.\n\nWe've always \"seen\". We just blocked it out of our memory.\n\nSo a very old memory might suddenly seem current, if it's only just now remembered.  You sort of \"relive\" that type  of memory, when it's recalled after so much time.\n\nBecause it releases energy to recall it, and a sorcerer is easily drawn into waking dreaming.\n\nThink of it like a VERY vivid daydream that happens all by itself.\n\nIt's as if you just become your old self for an instant, relive that, and then return to normal.\n\nAdd to that our double. We exist in 2 copies all the time.\n\nIf the double is near you can switch back and forth in perspective, using his eyes and memory for a few seconds, and then returning to your normal body for that point of view.\n\nThus in response to simple curiosity about something you might find yourself in your double for a bit, and a wealth of memories associated with the topic you were curious about flood your mind.\n\nAgain, it's \"non-linear\".\n\nIn that situation, one event you experience is not based on a previous event that you can pinpoint as part of a single time sequence.\n\nI'll add that switching back and forth like that, from tonal to your energy body, makes \"the abstract\" visible.\n\nThat's all the discarded perceptions that are so alien, they make absolutely no sense to your rational self.\n\nMaybe they're even misfirings in the brain, or neural path combinations that are normally useless. But which still exist.\n\nThey're just perceived as too \"abstract\" to be of any real use.\n\nYou can experience them easily!\n\nEven learn during darkroom to seek them out.\n\nAnd you'll learn that those perceptions are perfectly fine while you are experiencing them.\n\nSeem \"normal\".\n\nBut the instant you return to your rational self you realize you can't even find a single word to describe what you were just doing.\n\nI'll try to give an example, but it's pale in comparison to the bizarreness of \"the abstract\".\n\nPerhaps Genaro flying around the eucalyptus trees in his furry animal pajamas, and then taking Carlos along, was such an incident.\n\nSo as an example, you reach a state during darkroom where the air is filled with fun stuff to see, but you want to perceive the \"rejected\" abstract sights.\n\nYou relax so much that you don't use \"reason\" as a filter anymore.\n\nThat requires near perfect silence, before you can identify the \"reason\" in what remains.  You have to remove all the loud noise, to perceive what the DJ is whispering from behind his equipment.\n\nSo one night you'll get lucky, notice \"reason\", and shut if off for a while.\n\nAnd suddenly you're moving around a yellow, blue, and light brown surface, turning in a perfect circle, while a countryside park band plays some repetitive 1950s tune over and over.\n\nIt's nice!  Especially the floating strawberries.\n\nBut when it's over you begin to realize, that made no sense at all!\n\nFor an instant, you can still see that it was perfectly fine.  And you have the same doubts you might have in sleeping dreaming, when you begin to realize it's a dream.\n\nBut reject that idea for a few seconds.\n\nIt's like that, but in reverse. \"The Abstract\" seems perfectly normal for a little while.  And your \"book deal mind\" is a bit disappointed that you were trying to perceive the abstract, but failed and only fell into a normal waking dream.\n\nBut as the seconds tick on you can't even name one thing about what just happened, and you realize it couldn't possibly have made any sense at all.  It WAS the abstract. But while in it, you don't realize that.\n\nAt the time it was just fine.\n\nWe perceive that way always.  We just reject it.\n\nIt's like the background noise of a freeway in the distance.\n\nOr a slight breeze blowing on your bare feet while you are busy with some outdoor gardening task, and not paying attention to your toes.\n\nThe abstract is always there!\n\nAnd it's possible that sorcerers at the level of Carlos and the witches, allow themselves to perceive that too.\n\nFreely.\n\nBut...\n\nIt's still very annoying to have one of them end trying to answer a difficult question by saying, \"It's non-linear\".\n\nCarlos rarely did that, but I'm afraid the witches might have leaned on that excuse more often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rafnzc52b2kb1.jpg?width=2171&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a205aa20ff466065708b8c24a04edfabe0e3ebf", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Refined Text And Speculation On Non-Linear", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Re-runs &amp; Cyclic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 71, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"rafnzc52b2kb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 55, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rafnzc52b2kb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2526f0b955d16bcf671f938303112b21fee558ed"}, {"y": 110, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rafnzc52b2kb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c2f85080ba773f891c8d2456c8ddd4df598d430"}, {"y": 163, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rafnzc52b2kb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17d8c3cc0e0d5ea0722bd2320ed350be0a84f79c"}, {"y": 327, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rafnzc52b2kb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80983294b1eaaf237a00c058adefa9957d482e8a"}, {"y": 491, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rafnzc52b2kb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd42577e77f9f86c4f14cc546740280a069fb35a"}, {"y": 552, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rafnzc52b2kb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4afc1ec6732394330b11f707704384dd7ef5988"}], "s": {"y": 1111, "x": 2171, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rafnzc52b2kb1.jpg?width=2171&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a205aa20ff466065708b8c24a04edfabe0e3ebf"}, "id": "rafnzc52b2kb1"}, "xj4ao4qzonkb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/1602dtk/asset/xj4ao4qzonkb1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718049546%2CYTE2MDAwYzBlZTZjMWJmODAwZGRhZjQ1NzdjZjU5ZjE3MGNiOTM3NDU1NDY5Mzk0YWM2ZWU5ZjFlZDYyMTE0Ng%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/1602dtk/asset/xj4ao4qzonkb1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718049546%2CMjQwN2YzMzU1YWQ0NjlmZDJiNWVkMDNhOGQ4YTA2ZTk3M2QwY2Y1YTg0ZWU2OTcyMThmZTAwMGE1MTgwMGY2Yw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "xj4ao4qzonkb1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_1602dtk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Re-runs &amp; Cyclic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6n-e5RZa5FtrFLvbvVyn1zDxxyMxweXqCz5XN9uyvck.jpg", "edited": 1693143610.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1692884698.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1602dtk/video/xj4ao4qzonkb1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/1602dtk/video/xj4ao4qzonkb1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the results of Athina&amp;#39;s suggestion to include more space between lines, and use as much available screen space as possible, and some research on what&amp;#39;s considered a good font, and font color (cream) for this situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ll speculate on an annoying topic from private classes too, just so there&amp;#39;s something to learn here.

Perhaps 40 lines per paper.\n\n2  As I recapitulated, that list expanded.  Must have quadrupled in size, but I got rid of each sheet when I finished it. So my \"list\" remained in the range of 30 pages for many months, while I recapitulated 2-6 hours a day in a sealed crate with a big comfortable armchair, and a lock on the door to keep track of how I got out.\n\nIn case I accidentally teleported across the house.\n\nYou will! \n\nAnd fortunately, Zuleica warned Taisha about that in her last book. Otherwise it's too far-fetched to believe, even when it happens to you.\n\nThus the lock on the inside of the crate.  Can't fake that.\n\n3  When I finished that list I was worried I missed something. So I went to the grocery store and looked at each item on the shelf very carefully.  Such as \"Cream of Wheat\" cereal.  Anything can trigger more memories.  Cream of wheat = very old relatives with bad teeth.\n\n4  When I didn't find more memories in any store, I traveled to every place I ever lived or went to school, and walked all paths I commonly took in that area.  Even looking at trash on the side of the road.  Found a lot more that way.  Including some \"power spots\" I knew as a child, but had forgotten. Like the specially shaped walls of a small outdoor shopping mall, where little whirlwinds spinning trash into the air formed each time there was a breeze.\n\n5  Still worried I missed some, I got a little english dictionary.  Just a half inch thick one.  I started with the As, and worked my way through reading every word and it's definition, to see if that gave me more topics to recapitulate.\n\nAround \"M\" I noticed my life was in front of my eyes all the time, like a big spider web of visible events.\n\nAnd Carlos had us doing other things, so I stopped there.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jhx2a2c", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recapitulation could be said to be practice in horizontal assemblage point shifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You move your assemblage point (ideally) to every single place it ever occupied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By &amp;quot;remembering&amp;quot; you light up a combination of those &amp;quot;emanations&amp;quot; which can form a dream view of that event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;rerun&amp;quot; of that time period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally a beginner doesn&amp;#39;t achieve true rerun ability, but later on you will!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why the books have such amazing stories about Carlos and La Gorda&amp;#39;s recapitulation feats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just how reality works!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we never see it, up at this level of the assemblage point over the left shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And remembering events mostly from up there, means you&amp;#39;re moving horizontally most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result of that, is the ability to &amp;quot;fine tune&amp;quot; something you are examining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which could be called, &amp;quot;daydreaming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly it&amp;#39;s why I find shapeshifting so easy.

Mad Prophet posted about a power object just today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll learn to make those if you practice darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for who to put on the list?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone you can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s just a trivial encounter, it won&amp;#39;t take more than a couple of seconds to finish with that event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I did the following but it&amp;#39;s been decades so I might be off on the specifics&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1  I made a 32 page list on notebook paper. Perhaps 40 lines per paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2  As I recapitulated, that list expanded.  Must have quadrupled in size, but I got rid of each sheet when I finished it. So my &amp;quot;list&amp;quot; remained in the range of 30 pages for many months, while I recapitulated 2-6 hours a day in a sealed crate with a big comfortable armchair, and a lock on the door to keep track of how I got out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case I accidentally teleported across the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And fortunately, Zuleica warned Taisha about that in her last book. Otherwise it&amp;#39;s too far-fetched to believe, even when it happens to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus the lock on the inside of the crate.  Can&amp;#39;t fake that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3  When I finished that list I was worried I missed something. So I went to the grocery store and looked at each item on the shelf very carefully.  Such as &amp;quot;Cream of Wheat&amp;quot; cereal.  Anything can trigger more memories.  Cream of wheat = very old relatives with bad teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4  When I didn&amp;#39;t find more memories in any store, I traveled to every place I ever lived or went to school, and walked all paths I commonly took in that area.  Even looking at trash on the side of the road.  Found a lot more that way.  Including some &amp;quot;power spots&amp;quot; I knew as a child, but had forgotten. Like the specially shaped walls of a small outdoor shopping mall, where little whirlwinds spinning trash into the air formed each time there was a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5  Still worried I missed some, I got a little english dictionary.  Just a half inch thick one.  I started with the As, and worked my way through reading every word and it&amp;#39;s definition, to see if that gave me more topics to recapitulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; I noticed my life was in front of my eyes all the time, like a big spider web of visible events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carlos had us doing other things, so I stopped there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/130ectb/practical_questions_about_recapitulation_list/jhx2a2c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1682602889.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_130ectb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}], "before": null}}]

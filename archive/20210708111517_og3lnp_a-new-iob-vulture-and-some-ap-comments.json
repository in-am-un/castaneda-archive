This is an account of some of our interactions. I had actually noticed them the previous two days shouting at me in the morning. A very loud voice shouted at me to \"Wake up!\" several times and then made these loud repeated cracking sounds above me. But I also couldn't hear their voice as such, it was internal rather than external. Their voice was masculine and deeper than my ally Ren's voice so I knew it was someone else.\n\nI got some water and went back to bed and the voice said \"There is no such thing as states or transitions \\[of consciousness\\], my friend.\" The brackets are added for context. I thought about it for a moment. Later I surmised that someone had told him to say this because he didn't seem to be particularly knowledgeable himself.\n\nIf I could still hear him my AP must have moved a bit, so I started to do some exercises while awake. Ren had pointed out that the only part of me not in the river of filth were my hands. I realised that by doing things with my dream-hands even if I couldn't see them I could somehow make visuals start and be able to see what I was doing. \n\nThe new IOB asked me to tell them about my ally. I said no. I continued with what I was doing, pretending to flip through my keychain until I could see keys, unwrapping a present until I could see paper, putting rings on my fingers... When I could see the rings the new IOB gave me one. It was silver with a pitted surface like lava stone and a carving of a bird's head.\n\n\"I'm going to call you Vulture,\" I said, \"unless you already have a name?\"\nHe seemed very pleased with his new name.\n\"No, I would like to learn more new words,\" he replied. He mustn't know what a vulture is.\n\nGiven he had brought up my ally first, I decided to ask him if he knew where he was. His first answer was that he 'had to go away for a little while' or something like that. When I pushed for more information at different times over the course of our conversation he seemed uncomfortable and would not answer until he asked me not to make him answer the question. I didn't care so much where Ren was, I more just wanted to see what this new IOB would say.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" he said. What came next was communicated more with thoughts, feelings and images and only a few words but the question was still clear. I saw visions of the inside of some rooms, some had clothes discarded on the floor, others didn't. He asked:\n\"\\[Some houses have many rooms with people in all the rooms and some houses (like yours) have many rooms but people only in one room? Why is this?\\]\" We only use one room as a bedroom.\nI explained to him that the houses with many rooms were built for families (with more people) but now sometimes only a couple of people live in those big houses. He seemed to ponder this for a while. He didn't seem to know a huge amount about humans yet.\n\nI fall asleep and wake up again later and roll over. He shouts at me again, quite loudly.\n\"Esto a guto!\"\nWhat? Is that supposed to be Spanish? I don't know Spanish and I suspect he doesn't know it very well either yet. We talk a little then next thing I know I can see a mirror.\n\nIn the mirror is my reflection. The rest of it is misty. It is Ren. He immediately starts to talk to my clearly through my own image. \n\"Your AP (mine specifically) is normally located slightly to the left and at the height of the top of your shoulders (I am 4'11\"). Our AP (his species I take it) is located the same distance but to the right of centre and in front of us. You need to generate a bit of movement of your AP first before you can move it down \\[the J curve\\].\"\n\nWhen I measure it later he was indicating about 2 inches left from the centre of my spine at the top of my shoulder and then directly out behind me. From what he said, theirs was in a similar place but on the direct opposite side (front and slightly right instead of back and slightly left). This was the first time he'd referred to the J curve to me. I just started a 'ten days of silence' challenge to try to weaken my internal dialogue. Perhaps he was telling me this because of that.\n\nI can't see my cocoon yet, so I can't confirm if my AP is really in that spot. I know the books say it is usually to the right on people but also not everyone's is on exactly the same spot, there's some variation. I remember some talk in here that certain things could push it into a different spot and it would normalise there, which makes sense. I can't confirm if his is where he says it is either.\n\nI'm kind of assuming now that Vulture was actually brought with Ren. Ren likes learning new languages and had previously told me about newcomer IOBs before (they aren't born so I assume he meant they are new to interacting with our world?). Vulture acts like a new hire who just got taken out for some field work and has more questions than answers.

We have 2 or 3 attack each week and they seem to have no common sense in selecting user names.\n\nSchizophrenia is my guess, because they become violent if they don't get what they want.\n\nBut, to answer your question, Mescalito was an inorganic being.\n\nOrganic life is not the only life in the universe.\n\nThere's life that has no organic organism.\n\nBeats me how it lives.  Some hive like crystal structure perhaps.\n\nBut it's not located in our copy of reality. It's to the side.\n\nSo there are at least 3 million different kinds of inorganic life, just as there are around 2-4 million kinds of organics.  Animals, insects, plants, funguses.\n\nThe same exists in the non-organic world.\n\nMescalito was one of those. I assume he belonged to Vicente. The healer, who was a \"peyotera\".\n\nMexican traditional healers come in 3 types.  Peyote, cigars, and one more I can't recall.\n\nIt's because they evolved from shamans, who were typically fond of a particular \"substance\".\n\nMy first teacher was hooked on Devil's Weed Tea, although she didn't use it often enough to be a problem.\n\nIt could also be that Mescalito could only be summoned, and could not be owned by anyone.\n\nOr that he was so alien to humans, we can only interact with him in limited ways, such as that ceremony.\n\nWe don't know much more, because don Juan explained Mescalito to Carlos, before Carlos knew anything about the emanations and luminous shells.\n\nDon Juan couldn't explain it accurately to him yet.  And what he said, didn't make much sense knowing what's in the rest of the books.\n\nCholita, a very powerful witch, was imported from Mexico by Carlos immediately after she used the Peyote fields.\n\nSo there's some value to it.\n\nBut not as much as you think.  I go further than any peyote trip can take you, for hours each day.  With no drugs.\n\nAnd interact with spirits like Mescalito, all night long. Visually.  Full awake.  Eyes open.\n\nIn fact, if you follow instructions in here you can have as many as 3 personal assistants like Mescalito, living in your home.\n\nOr, at least 2.

Some hive like crystal structure perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not located in our copy of reality. It&amp;#39;s to the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there are at least 3 million different kinds of inorganic life, just as there are around 2-4 million kinds of organics.  Animals, insects, plants, funguses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same exists in the non-organic world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mescalito was one of those. I assume he belonged to Vicente. The healer, who was a &amp;quot;peyotera&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mexican traditional healers come in 3 types.  Peyote, cigars, and one more I can&amp;#39;t recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s because they evolved from shamans, who were typically fond of a particular &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first teacher was hooked on Devil&amp;#39;s Weed Tea, although she didn&amp;#39;t use it often enough to be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could also be that Mescalito could only be summoned, and could not be owned by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that he was so alien to humans, we can only interact with him in limited ways, such as that ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know much more, because don Juan explained Mescalito to Carlos, before Carlos knew anything about the emanations and luminous shells.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan couldn&amp;#39;t explain it accurately to him yet.  And what he said, didn&amp;#39;t make much sense knowing what&amp;#39;s in the rest of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita, a very powerful witch, was imported from Mexico by Carlos immediately after she used the Peyote fields.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s some value to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not as much as you think.  I go further than any peyote trip can take you, for hours each day.  With no drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And interact with spirits like Mescalito, all night long. Visually.  Full awake.  Eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you follow instructions in here you can have as many as 3 personal assistants like Mescalito, living in your home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, at least 2.

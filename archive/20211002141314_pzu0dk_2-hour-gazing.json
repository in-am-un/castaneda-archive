These experiences were all very subtle, and I am only recounting them so that I can be given advice on what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong.\n\nI had extreme difficulty creating and holding any sort of silence. There would be music playing in my head very often, and also very often there would be voices of all different kinds of people, young and old male and female, and when I would shift more into the \"waking dream\" state, the voices would be saying gibberish and nonsense, often in a musical way. It was only rarely that there were no voices at all, I would try to hold on to those times but they were usually brief.\n\nMy head nodded off several times, I recognized a sound that comes right before I switch into the dream state, it is like a white noise static sound, it kind of reminded me of a broom swishing over a stone floor. I would hear this sound right as my head dipped and I woke. \n\nAt one point my body was vibrating. From time to time, I would hear a rhythmic tapping sound a few feet away from me that increased in frequency and I wondered if my sink was leaking. But at one point it was tapping so fast and I thought that can't be the sink. It went away abruptly.\n\nI saw the dark figures many times, moving from right to left, converging into the center of my view, sometimes they appeared to spin around almost like a dance, and at one point they were right up in front of my face flying around. That part was scary but I recalled the advice to use this fear and that it is a good thing. They would occasionally change from dark to light, sometimes into 3 dimensional forms that were shaded, but most often they were just shadows darker than the surrounding darkness.\n\nLater, I could see faint points of light, they blossomed and reminded me of dandelions. It was around this point that I was able to see an extremely faint duplicate of my hands extended in front of me, even though my eyes were closed. They were reddish or purplish. I tried very hard to hang on to this vision and to intensify it, to focus on my fingers moving around. I tried to affect the light and darkness and generally I would have no effect, but occasionally my hand would close over a light. I would try to put it on my chest, I don't know if I succeeded in this.\n\nAt one point I had a very unusual experience, I felt the presence of someone and felt like I was in a different place. It was blue, there were stars and an open sky. I couldn't see it but I could sense it. I had a moment of realization that is difficult to describe and I felt thankful.\n\nThe most significant scene involving \"light\" was one where I saw what looked like bluish green water, it was stretching from left to right in my field of vision like a river. I tried to put my hands in it, I don't know if it was successful. This was still faint, however, there were no scenes of bright light.\n\nI definitely felt moments of extreme difficulty. There was often pain in my back and I would shift to try and make myself more comfortable. There were times that it felt like a burden to be in there. It definitely felt like more than 2 hours and I was disappointed when I came out and it was only 2 hours.\n\nI realize that there are some things I might not be doing correctly. I am sitting in my bathroom in the dark and my eyes are closed. I keep them closed mostly because if I open them, there is sometimes the faintest sliver of light that peeks through the door crack. Is it better for me to be sitting with my eyes open? Maybe I can hang a piece of cloth over that crack in the door. Also, I don't know how still I should be and how much I should be moving. That part is uncertain to me.\n\nAll the \"visions\" I listed above may be just imagination, maybe some is fantasy and some is not, I am not making assumptions about any of it. I am just recounting my experiences to get feedback on what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong. The visuals were subtle, the only thing that definitely felt real was the rhythmic tapping that increased in frequency, it definitely felt like a real thing, maybe it was but I have no idea what it could be. When I stepped out of the bathroom, I was in a weird state that continued for a while. I looked at my hand and it felt very weird, like I was off to the side.\n\nThanks for reading this long thing, and I appreciate any insight or assistance you can offer.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "2 hour gazing", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_pzu0dk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_4bh23f1k", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1633176794.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gazed in the dark for 2 hours, I&amp;#39;m going to recount my experiences here.

Even if you have a little gaps here and there, there&amp;#39;s not enough reflected light coming from outside to be noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you could put on a pair of super dark sunglasses, or some comfortable welding goggles if it&amp;#39;s not quite dark yet, or if you live somewhere where it doesn&amp;#39;t get dark until 11:00pm part of the year; ones that don&amp;#39;t have a strap on the back so it&amp;#39;s not so fatiguing to wear them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that I&amp;#39;ve noticed that&amp;#39;s also a problem, and will be more so in the future, is built-in ceiling light fixtures; the ones that have led diodes integrated into them rather than a socket for a light bulb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that even when those things are turned off they sometimes have a low current flowing through the LEDs, because the manufacturer didn&amp;#39;t properly shield the circuits or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result is a noticeable glow in a room which you&amp;#39;ve intentionally darkened; and I&amp;#39;m clueless as to how you&amp;#39;d block that off and still be able to use the ceiling light...which you&amp;#39;d absolutely need after blocking all other light sources.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pzu0dk/2_hour_gazing/hf3k8zs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1633183188.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_pzu0dk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hf3tvng", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1633187752.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_pzu0dk", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt;I had extreme difficulty creating and holding any sort of silence.\n\nThat's the thing I most like to hear from a beginner.\n\nWhen I hear of weird stuff seen, which doesn't agree with what's usually seen first, and no complaints about how much it sucks to force silence, it worries me.\n\nIt's like hearing that someone ran  all the way up a small mountain, but you don't hear any complaints about how horrible that was, and how out of breath they were at the end.\n\nIt makes you worry they were on the wrong hill or something.\n\n\\&gt;At one point my body was vibrating\n\nWe posted some notes about that.

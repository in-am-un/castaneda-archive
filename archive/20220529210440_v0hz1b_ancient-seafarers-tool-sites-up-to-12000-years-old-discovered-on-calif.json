Shamanism is crap.  Modern Shamanism.  Even as practiced by Native Americans.\n\nNo real magic.  Drugs are needed. Spirits not seen as far as I've heard. You have to close your eyes.    \n\nThere's no widespread understanding of breaking the laws of physics, or doing the crazy stuff from the books of Carlos.\n\nAnd yet, all that is true!  We've seen it with our own eyes!  \n\nDaily.\n\nSo what's up?\n\nIt's those \"Men of Knowledge\". The ritual peddlers, who used drugs. From the books of Carlos.\n\nDon Juan taught him about those men, so he could have a different view of the world, and sneak through th emiddle to become what we want to be:  The new seers.\n\nBut those crummy \"Men of Knowledge\" are the ones who gave rise to shamanism in MesoAmerica.\n\nThey never learned to see, according to don  Juan.\n\nOur actual ancestors, the \"old seers\",  hid out for the most part.  The men of knowledge were profiteers, licensed by the Olmec government.\n\nBut our \"old seers\" were just magic scholars. They could \"*see*\", so they could create magic without needing to have someone teach it to them.\n\nThere was some \"out in the open\" activity by both groups eve as late as the time of the Toltecs.\n\nThousand of years later.\n\nBut then the \"seers\" part went into hiding.  Not driven there by the Spanish. Another of my misunderstandings.  \n\n\nIt was other indians, who drove the sorcerers out of the world of the Toltecs and into hiding.\n\nSo I suppose all the shamanism, including actual sorcery, does in fact come from the Olmecs.\n\nAnd the anger at Carlos, supposedly from actual native americans, is obvious disbelief because their shamanism is just old \"Men of Knowledge\" rituals.  And not actually working very well anymore.\n\nCertainly there are real \"seers\" hiding among them, but they aren't out in public cursing Carlos.\n\nHere's the map of Clovis migrations. Notice them heading for the Channel Islands, but also down Mexico with some going where the Olmecs lived on the east coast of Mexico.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2e20skfoog291.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3dc7e55d2b749f61b03b667e235fe4af33cf3a9\n\nOur local Luiseno, who recently won the rights back to some 10,000 year old artifacts dug up without consulting them, lived on the west coast.\n\nIn 3 days in my county, they could collect enough food for 1 week.\n\nNow to the important point.\n\nWe had a new guy who made up his own technique. Then tried to \"audition\" here with it.\n\nIt seemed impossible to get him to  understand that his made up technique, if it actually does what he claims, is junk.\n\nWe aren't trying to impress people with druglike visions!\n\nWe're trying to learn to control that force, which creates reality itself.\n\nWe're practicing 10,000 year old magic which explores the very depths of the entire universe. \n\n Looking beyond solid matter, and utilizing the stored history of everything that man has ever know, in a matrix of viewable lines of light.\n\nThe Olmec created endless magical techniques which REALLY work.  They had no reason to make up stuff.\n\nMeanwhile, everything else on the planet these days is shit.  Or full of shit.  Or as I like to call it, \"Crap Magic\".  Mostly \"Asian Crap Magic\".\n\nThe real thing is very difficult to learn, but it's easy to understand the path.\n\nOnly hard to make yourself practice each day.\n\nAnd the path is WELL KNOWN. Also it leads to astounding destinations, not dreamed of in any religion.\n\nWhy you'd want to jump off ship and go practice what some random guy came up with, is beyond me.\n\nIt's nuts!\n\nIt also fails to understand the nature of reality.  That reality is \"intelligent\" and repeats the past if you give it a chance.\n\nHook yourself to the \"Buddha\", and you'll repeat his ugly past of lying and stealing.  And attention seeking.  Racketeering too, but westerners are ignorant of that.\n\nHook yourself to the Olmec, and you get PURE magic, no greed motivations other than a desire to kick butt with the real thing, and absolutely no reason to deceive anyone.\n\nNot to mention, our techniques allow us to go back in time and see what they were actually doing.\n\nIt works, I've done it too many times to count.\n\n(But not a whole lot too many so far).\n\nOr I suppose you could follow the con artist Robert Monroe, who cashed in on the popularity of Carlos Castaneda, by pretending he could teach something similar.\n\nAnd he either made up, or popularized, the most pathetic practices around.\n\nLucid Dreaming, and Astral Travel.\n\nI'm banned in the lucid dreaming subreddit, because the enemies of Carlos are in there and they hate to hear that Waking Dreaming is possible. Won't even look.  It ruins their fantasy.  And puts  shame to their lie that Carlos was a fake.\n\nAnd I'd surely get lynched in the Astral Travel subreddit, for pointing out the truth. It's a delusional false narrative that has never gotten anyone anywhere.  Because if it actually worked, you'd see  a place like this for that, where an intelligent person can see it's not just crazy men fighting among each other, over exaggerated ordinary dreams.\n\nWE HAVE THE REAL THING.\n\nAnd even better, you can see that with your own eyes!\n\nIt's all right here.\n\nAnd even better than better, NO ONE WANTS YOUR MONEY.\n\nThis has NEVER happened before in human history.\n\nUnless there's those \"lost civilizations\" we always hear about.  I'd love one of their coins!  But the only possible ones I've seen, have molded themselves thoroughly into conglomerate rock, because  they're so old.  Can't tell them from an odd mineral deposit.\n\nSo please, keep your Monroe or \"my new technique\" nonsense out of here!\n\nWhat on earth are you doing?  Stomping on wild daisies just to make yourself feel powerful?\n\nIt's delusional.  And instantly obvious to everyone who's been here  a while, you ought to go away.  You have no real interest in magic.\n\nYou're only looking for attention.\n\nLet me add, once you have REAL magic, you can look for whatever you want.\n\n\"Looking for attention\" is not a Buddhist insult.\n\nThat's what they're doing!\n\nWhile  pretending not to.\n\nWhen it's said in this subreddit it simply means, while you are only thinking about the approval of other humans, there's zero chance you will actually work to learn magic.\n\nSo go away.\n\nBut once you have magic for real, forget about concerns such as being \"Saintly\" in here.\n\nWe don't care! Go ahead and wear a trench coat, and flash people in parks.\n\nIt's irrelevant to the pursuits here.  Magic is the topic. Not \"being ego free\".\n\nYou can even like the \"old seers\" if you like, but just don't cut me or Cholita up into pieces, to eat  us alive.  We don't like that, and Cholita has a long sword.\n\nBut the Olmec \"old seers\" had real magic!  \n\nSo who can complain about their table manners.\n\nFor \"Saintly\", go find a Catholic priest or a Buddhist monk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Ancient Seafarers\u2019 Tool Sites, Up to 12,000

Racketeering too, but westerners are ignorant of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hook yourself to the Olmec, and you get PURE magic, no greed motivations other than a desire to kick butt with the real thing, and absolutely no reason to deceive anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, our techniques allow us to go back in time and see what they were actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works, I&amp;#39;ve done it too many times to count.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(But not a whole lot too many so far).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or I suppose you could follow the con artist Robert Monroe, who cashed in on the popularity of Carlos Castaneda, by pretending he could teach something similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he either made up, or popularized, the most pathetic practices around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucid Dreaming, and Astral Travel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m banned in the lucid dreaming subreddit, because the enemies of Carlos are in there and they hate to hear that Waking Dreaming is possible. Won&amp;#39;t even look.  It ruins their fantasy.  And puts  shame to their lie that Carlos was a fake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;d surely get lynched in the Astral Travel subreddit, for pointing out the truth. It&amp;#39;s a delusional false narrative that has never gotten anyone anywhere.  Because if it actually worked, you&amp;#39;d see  a place like this for that, where an intelligent person can see it&amp;#39;s not just crazy men fighting among each other, over exaggerated ordinary dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WE HAVE THE REAL THING.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even better, you can see that with your own eyes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all right here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even better than better, NO ONE WANTS YOUR MONEY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has NEVER happened before in human history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless there&amp;#39;s those &amp;quot;lost civilizations&amp;quot; we always hear about.  I&amp;#39;d love one of their coins!  But the only possible ones I&amp;#39;ve seen, have molded themselves thoroughly into conglomerate rock, because  they&amp;#39;re so old.  Can&amp;#39;t tell them from an odd mineral deposit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please, keep your Monroe or &amp;quot;my new technique&amp;quot; nonsense out of here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What on earth are you doing?  Stomping on wild daisies just to make yourself feel powerful?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s delusional.  And instantly obvious to everyone who&amp;#39;s been here  a while, you ought to go away.  You have no real interest in magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re only looking for attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me add, once you have REAL magic, you can look for whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Looking for attention&amp;quot; is not a Buddhist insult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While  pretending not to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s said in this subreddit it simply means, while you are only thinking about the approval of other humans, there&amp;#39;s zero chance you will actually work to learn magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you have magic for real, forget about concerns such as being &amp;quot;Saintly&amp;quot; in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t care! Go ahead and wear a trench coat, and flash people in parks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s irrelevant to the pursuits here.  Magic is the topic. Not &amp;quot;being ego free&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even like the &amp;quot;old seers&amp;quot; if you like, but just don&amp;#39;t cut me or Cholita up into pieces, to eat  us alive.  We don&amp;#39;t like that, and Cholita has a long sword.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Olmec &amp;quot;old seers&amp;quot; had real magic!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So who can complain about their table manners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For &amp;quot;Saintly&amp;quot;, go find a Catholic priest or a Buddhist monk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count":

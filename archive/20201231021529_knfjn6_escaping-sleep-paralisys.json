You bring the double right out into your room with you.\n\nAt that point, you can finish the other gates if you like, which are rumored to be, how to use it in the real world.\n\nHowever, don't let me put down lucid dreaming!  It's wonderful!!!\n\nI spend a good 4 hours a night in lucid dreaming now, because of darkroom gazing.\n\nBut doing lucid dreaming as your \"main\" technique has serious drawbacks:\n\n1) It makes you grumpy.  Darkroom gazing makes you deliriously happy (because you reach enlightenment).\n\n2) Anything you learn is of no  use to others. It's all personal.  I suppose there are tips for holding dreams and summoning lucid ones, but there's nothing you're going to discover, which isn't much better explained in the lucid dreaming forum. Where by the way, they despise Carlos.\n\n3)No one ever follows Art of Dreaming!  They get a tiny bit of success, then run around bragging about it, not realizing the whole point is to bring your dreaming double into the real world.  The rest is just logical.  Meaning, obvious. Not hard to understand at all, why those steps exist.\n\nHere's the behind the scenes look at what's really going on:\n\nFirst you find your hands, because if you are not lucid, there's no way to learn.\n\nThen you look at objects consciously, because doing that attracts inorganic beings.  It's as if they are saying, \"You can SEE ME????\"  So they send a scout.  They've been looking for people to play with for millions of years!\n\nThe scout gives you the dark energy you need to move the assemblage point below the shoulder blades. Without dark energy, there's no possibility of sorcery.  And IOBs are the only known place to get it.  \n\nPossibly that's why Carlos wrote that book. An alternate way to get dark energy, since he couldn't share Little Smoke with everyone (I've tried though). \n\nGiven the dark energy, you are ready to dive deep. So at the 3rd gate, you learn to change dreams. Dreams upon dreams.  Each one lowers the assemblage point a bit, and allows you to retain lucidity in the dream.  You can stay down there, \"fully\" lucid for weeks!  I've done it.\n\nBut guess what?  That's not the point of the 3rd gate at all!\n\nThe point of the 3rd gate is panic!  \n\nOutright panic that you will never wake up.\n\nBecause once you learn to go to sleep inside a dream, and then go to sleep inside that one, you are lost in space.\n\nYour body learns to wake up into another dream.\n\nSo on the way out, from staying down there many days, you won't make it.  You'll awake into a dream copy of your room.\n\nA phantom one unfortunately. And when you discover it wasn't real, you'll wake up into another phantom copy.\n\nExpect as many as 10 of those, before you figure out how to wake up for real.\n\nAnd there we had the entire point of 4 gates dreaming. \n\nThat final moment of panic, where you obsess your dreaming body with how to get back to the real world.\n\nIt's pretty much Zuleica's technique for bringing out the double.  But she gave us others too.  Better ones.  You just have to put in a lot of work to dabble in the others, while lucid dreaming is easy for even a 5 year old to try.\n\nThat's the attraction in the angry male community.  Instant attention from others!  Just go to bed, and exaggerate in the morning.\n\n4) Here's the biggest problem with lucid dreaming. It's darned hard to do that every night!  And you won't get anywhere with it, until you can.  \n\nYears will go by.   All wasted.  When in fact, you could have brought that dreaming double out directly from waking, long ago.  Takes only a few weeks if you can manage the 3 hours a night.  More time if not.  But it's faster than anything else we have.\n\nBottom line:  If you get lucid in a dream, USE IT!  Never ignore it.\n\nBut if you believe you are going to learn sorcery that way, you haven't been looking around enough.\n\nI started watching what was going on with Carlos when I was 9 years old. Back in '65.  It's because I had anthropologists surrounding me a lot of the time.  Jealous anthropologists from the same UC system as Carlos.\n\nThat's 55 years of watching.\n\nNO ONE LEARNED SORCERY!\n\nDidn't you notice that?  Few ever seem to notice. They could stand on top of 5 billions years of skulls, the way Dr. Who did when he got trapped in that interrogation machine, and not realize, those are the dead bodies of others who traveled that same path!\n\nThe Castaneda community stands on a mountain of dead (failed) practitioners, and doesn't even notice it.\n\nIt's mostly because of Lucid Dreaming. That's the main culprit.\n\nLucid Dreaming is like the pretty hooker on the street corner, who is always there at a certain time of night.\n\nSexy, somewhat reliable, very attractive.\n\nBut not a real substitute for a relationship.\n\nAnd if you go into the \"relationships\" subreddit, and brag about the hooker on the corner, you're going to look as silly as lucid dreaming braggers look in the Castaneda community.\n\nBut still, if you get lucid in a dream, TAKE ADVANTAGE!", "edited": 1609696675.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ghz1714", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only in Art of Dreaming, which he wrote at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the rest of the books, it&amp;#39;s entirely waking dreaming.

Inventory experts are a depressing topic, since my fate is to have to battle a nasty one every week or two. I'm hoping Techno and I can draft an \"no inventory experts\" rule for the side, so that it's easy to tell them they're in violation of a rule.  But we don't want to stop discussion of the books. \n\nOnly stop modified inventories which mislead people and damage the *intent* of this subreddit.\n\nHere's the unchanged Facebook post.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nOne thing that plagues the Castaneda community are the \"inventory experts\".\n\nThe very nature of the early books creates them. They eagerly read about magic and fun, then try to figure out how to get in on the action.\n\nAnd don Juan gives them a list of ways to modify their behavior in the books, in order to become sorcerers.\n\nErase personal history, accept responsibility, and so on. \n\nAll things you can both do, and pretend to do.\n\nWhat budding sorcerers don't remember is, don Juan did all of the teaching in secret using the Nagual's blow, and without that movement of the assemblage point, learning sorcery is impossible.\n\nTo paraphrase don Juan, real learning takes place in heightened awareness.\n\nNo heightened awareness, no real learning.\n\nIf you want to get to heightened awareness, go to the subreddit.\n\nBut the fact that you can't learn sorcery that way, by simply thinking about it, doesn't deter the inventory experts. And the problem is universal. In several places in the books don Juan refuses to give Carlos more details about things such as the hues of amber that crisscross the 8 great bands, and provide awareness. He mentions that living beings can come in pinkish amber, orangish amber, and pure amber. Insect types have one color, plants another, and so on. Carlos wants to know about the types of inorganic beings, and don Juan refuses to answer because he'll just add it to an inventory.\n\nHe tells him that discovering this will be the most exciting thing he's done. So he has to use the information he has as a map, to guide him. Not treat it like an intellectual destination.\n\nCarlos did the same in private classes. When someone wanted to know more pointless inventory, and it was clear they would use it like a destination, and not a map, he would not answer.\n\nCarol has had to do the same as workshops. Announce she would take no questions on the books, from angry inventory experts.\n\nCarlos told us to stop reading his books, it became so awful with all the pointless questions.\n\nThat's normally how we learn. We go to school, learn the facts, listen to the explanations, and then get tested on whether we can remember them.\n\nSo inventory experts follow that pattern, because actually using the recommendations as a map, instead of a destination, requires more work than they are willing to do.\n\nOr can find the time to do. Married? Wow. I can't imagine where you can get the needed time to learn sorcery.\n\nExcept, if you got interested in basketball, your spouse would let you go play at night. Even 3 hours at a time, which is all you need to learn sorcery.\n\nBut when you ask, \"Honey, can I go stare into the darkness looking for demons tonight?\", she tends to say no.\n\nSo the inventory experts are sort of limited. They can't actually learn any sorcery. Instead, they find a place to chat with like minded people.\n\nAnd we still have those places all over the internet. There's even an inventory expert relic left from the 90s, in the form of \"sustainedaction . org\". It's such a terrible place, I had to break up the link so no one would be mislead over there.\n\nIf you've been in a Castaneda discussion group, you know it's dominated by aggressive men, trying to prove their knowledge is king.\n\nBut lately there are inventory expert women also, and in general the discussion groups have arrived at some kind of rule:\n\nDon't criticize my inventory, and I won't criticize your inventory.\n\nIt's ok to correct an outright mistake, but \"interpretations\" are not to be corrected, especially if the person claims that means they have learned actual sorcery.\n\nWe had a female inventory expert invade the subreddit last week, and it was soon clear she had no interest in learning. She took a look at the obvious stunning magic being practice there, and pretended it was no big deal. Then she proceeded to post her opinion on things, and it was always a little off.\n\nOff enough to harm a new person.\n\nShe decided that stopping the world was going to bed, and any dream you can remember is dreaming, and brings out the double.\n\nBy twisting the inventory around, she declared victory. No need to do actual work.\n\nThat is ultimately what all inventory experts do. Confuse themselves so much, that they believe they have made progress.\n\nAnd in the course of doing that, they develop very nasty alternate personalities.\n\nThe internet is filled with trolls. We all know, once in a while you just have to tell someone they're a jerk.\n\nBut the inventory experts learn this slowly, battling with each other for \"top dog\". They reach some sort of unholy balance where they have rules in their mind on how far you can go correcting someone, before they get to turn nasty.\n\nAnd when they visit the subreddit, they start out sounding like they are interested and have read the books, but soon it's obvious they just want to share their redefined inventory, so that you will give them agreement, they are in fact sorcerers.\n\nThat's especially problematic in that subreddit, where any idiot can see, it's now working. Never worked before! No one ever learned any obviously real sorcery. Until now.\n\nI'm convinced Carlos set this up. He scorched the earth the way Naguals have to do, when they leave. Some even say Amy's book was a setup.\n\nHe planted the idea to go fix the problem in my mind, in the last private conversation we ever had, and then left it up to intent.\n\nEverything blew up, and it was up to someone to put it all back together. To gather the apprentices back.\n\nBut no one wanted to do that. The entire private class gave up and condemned him. And Cleargreen just kept repeating the same old thing over and over, never actually taking the time to learn sorcery.\n\nSo we're left with nothing but inventory experts, and if nothing is done about it Castaneda's knowledge will turn into another pointless, impotent ancient cult. I can name many of those, but you know them too. I'm afraid to say, there are some big names in the defunct cult list.\n\nBut the inventory expert tries to go for the ultimate prize. To get confirmation. He doesn't care if it's impotent. He only cares if he can get attention for himself, so he can feel a tiny bit better at this miserable position of the assemblage point.\n\nIn the process of trying to convince everyone else that he is a powerful sorcerer, he alters, twists, and changes the meaning so much, that he becomes a danger to others.\n\nWhen they pass around bad information, it just can't stand in that subreddit.\n\nIf that were left alone over there, the place would soon lose the magical intent it has built up, and be as destroyed as the workshop community.\n\nEach new inventory expert has to be wrestled to the ground, and doesn't go out without a fight.\n\nIt's awful!\n\nAnd endless. Whoever is stuck taking them on can expect the nastiest attacks the inventory expert can think up. And they have years of listening to such complaints, while they chit-chat in their discussion groups.\n\nPlease cut it out... Learn sorcery. Don't be an inventory expert.\n\nUnfortunately, Cleargreen is now doing the same. Their web pages are deplorable these days.\n\nThey have a few happy quotes from Taisha or one of the original sorcerers on the side, no explanation what it actually means, and then they've altered the course curriculum to make it more pleasing to inventory experts.\n\n*Dreaming*, has become \"Dream your future\".\n\nIt's turning into a prosperity message. Prosperity messages are common in cheap religions. People are unhappy and sad, so you give them pretend mental trips to calm them down.\n\nThat's what the sorcery Carlos taught us in the 90s has decayed into.

He said,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure, it&amp;#39;s easy for Jerome to be such a saint and deny himself sex!  He was 85 years old and talking like he had achieved a big thing rejecting sex.  Try that at 20 years old!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, people accused Carlos of being evil, for having what I estimate to be 16 girlfriends in his last years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What????&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I could manage a single young woman at 72 years old, that would be a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see it now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 72 on the bed, Cholita walks  up and says, &amp;quot;Where is it?

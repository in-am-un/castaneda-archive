Then sat down to recapitulate another morsel of my repetitive past. You know, recapitulation, the shovelwork of Tensegrity.\r  \n\r  \nWell, I had been reading \"The Active Side of Infinity\", and about the Usher. It was described as being an intense recapitulation of a particular moment in your personal history. The Usher is a recapitulation so vivid, so all encompassing and immediate, as to be totally unlike any other recapitulated event.\r  \n\r  \nSo I figured, well, intent is everything, so I declared my intent out loud to recapitulate the Usher. Why not?\r  \n\r  \nThen I sat there, with my internal dialog shut off, for what seemed like a long time. Long enough anyway to consider that ... well ... It might not ...\r  \n\r  \nSuddenly, without warning, I was seated in my high school chemistry class. What had caught my attention was the thick laboratory top on the workbench where I was sitting at a tall stool. It was black stone, and I could clearly feel the rough texture of the underside. I looked at the edge of the rock, close up, and then at the sink, and saw the high chemical spout and the bunsen burner gas fittings.\r  \n\r  \nI looked around. Whatever I looked at was there. It was Mrs. Henniger's class, thank you Mrs. Henniger ... you were good to us ... and I looked, and she was wearing her old-lady sweater, and I thought \"I wonder what her shoes look like\". It seemed like a daring though, they might not be there, and I looked down, and there they were, plain as day, her clunky Mrs. Henniger shoes.\r  \n\r  \nI checked it all out. I looked under the bench in the cupboards, my notebook was on the workbench, it was all there!. I was wearing blue jeans and sneakers, I was small and skinny sitting on the bench. I was amazed at how effortless and all-encompassing the assemblage point shift was. I was there, in Mrs. Henniger's class.\r  \n\r  \nAt about that point I went \"Well, duh, of course it's easy to move my assemblage point to this location ... I've been here before.\" And when I had that insight, I realized I could go anywhere in my recapitulation with that kind of immediacy and intensity.\r  \n\r  \nAnyhow, since then, I have actually for the first time enjoyed doing recapitulation. When I focus my recapitulation on an event, I am immediately taken to that exact time in all its fullness of experience, I can look around and see what's there ... hey, it's easy, I've been there before.\r  \n\r  \nOne unforeseen, and not entirely welcome, outcome is that I found out that the recapitulation that I had done up to that point, while valuable and rich in recaptured energy, had not plumbed the depth of the experience fully. So ... the Dark Sea of Awareness is a well-known practical joker ... I get to start my recapitulation over.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, given how much fun it is to actually relive my life (apart from the nauseating part where I watch the repetition of my ridiculous self-important asininities), that much fun I can take. So, I'm off on my second round of recapitulation with a new, lighter spirit ... recapitulation, not as shovelwork, but as flight school for greater leaps of the assemblage point.\r  \n\r  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\r  \n\r  \nI guess that's all. Just thought I'd let you know.

Then sat down to recapitulate another morsel of my repetitive past. You know, recapitulation, the shovelwork of Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I had been reading &amp;quot;The Active Side of Infinity&amp;quot;, and about the Usher. It was described as being an intense recapitulation of a particular moment in your personal history. The Usher is a recapitulation so vivid, so all encompassing and immediate, as to be totally unlike any other recapitulated event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I figured, well, intent is everything, so I declared my intent out loud to recapitulate the Usher. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I sat there, with my internal dialog shut off, for what seemed like a long time. Long enough anyway to consider that ... well ... It might not ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, without warning, I was seated in my high school chemistry class. What had caught my attention was the thick laboratory top on the workbench where I was sitting at a tall stool. It was black stone, and I could clearly feel the rough texture of the underside. I looked at the edge of the rock, close up, and then at the sink, and saw the high chemical spout and the bunsen burner gas fittings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around. Whatever I looked at was there. It was Mrs. Henniger&amp;#39;s class, thank you Mrs. Henniger ... you were good to us ... and I looked, and she was wearing her old-lady sweater, and I thought &amp;quot;I wonder what her shoes look like&amp;quot;. It seemed like a daring though, they might not be there, and I looked down, and there they were, plain as day, her clunky Mrs. Henniger shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked it all out. I looked under the bench in the cupboards, my notebook was on the workbench, it was all there!. I was wearing blue jeans and sneakers, I was small and skinny sitting on the bench. I was amazed at how effortless and all-encompassing the assemblage point shift was. I was there, in Mrs. Henniger&amp;#39;s class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At about that point I went &amp;quot;Well, duh, of course it&amp;#39;s easy to move my assemblage point to this location ... I&amp;#39;ve been here before.&amp;quot; And when I had that insight, I realized I could go anywhere in my recapitulation with that kind of immediacy and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, since then, I have actually for the first time enjoyed doing recapitulation. When I focus my recapitulation on an event, I am immediately taken to that exact time in all its fullness of experience, I can look around and see what&amp;#39;s there ... hey, it&amp;#39;s easy, I&amp;#39;ve been there before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One unforeseen, and not entirely welcome, outcome is that I found out that the recapitulation that I had done up to that point, while valuable and rich in recaptured energy, had not plumbed the depth of the experience fully. So ... the Dark Sea of Awareness is a well-known practical joker ... I get to start my recapitulation over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, given how much fun it is to actually relive my life (apart from the nauseating part where I watch the repetition of my ridiculous self-important asininities), that much fun I can take. So, I&amp;#39;m off on my second round of recapitulation with a new, lighter spirit ... recapitulation, not as shovelwork, but as flight school for greater leaps of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;________________&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;#39;s all.

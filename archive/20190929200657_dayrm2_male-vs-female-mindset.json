But after each one she said, \u201cThat\u2019s obvious!\u201d, or \u201cOf course,  that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d\n\nIt seemed that because she was in private classes, she had the same view of how to proceed as me.\n\nShe just wasn\u2019t working on it anymore.\n\nAs she said to me months ago,  \u201cThe Nagual is gone, it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nI insisted it wasn\u2019t over if we did something about it.\n\nThen she asked me why I\u2019m doing this.\n\nI explained that people had been living on inspirational quotes all these 20 years since Carlos died, and I didn\u2019t find any understanding in anything written about Carlos on the web.\n\nI feared his knowledge would be lost.\n\nI blamed it on the \u201cimpeccable warrior\u201d thing.\n\nCholita became very angry. \u201c What????\u201d, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main thing!\u201d\n\nI tried to tell her, yes of course. Everyone knows I\u2019m joking when I say to forget about that.\n\nYou have to be as impeccable as you can, and god knows it\u2019s a war.\n\nTo myself, I thought about the Armageddon Cholita had promised me if I didn\u2019t let her flee to Seattle tomorrow. She had said, \u201cYou will start Armageddon with your words if you aren\u2019t careful!\u201d\n\nAt the time, I understood it to be one of her wide conspiracy delusions.  I didn't realize it was a warning of impending doom.\n\nI further explained to her that the mindset of the \u201cwarrior\u2019s way\u201d was pacifying the minds of people interested in Carlos\u2019 books, so that they never took the time to practice.\n\nYou\u2019ll never get anywhere based on that.\n\nShe disagreed completely.\n\nI realized, aside from what Cleargreen 1 and Cleargreen 2 are doing, it\u2019s just Cholita and me from faction #3.\n\nThere are no others so far.\n\nAnd that means Cholita\u2019s knowledge of things is equal to my own. It needs to be shared equally as much, if for nothing else but to balance my male views out.\n\nI asked her to explain.\n\nShe said that impeccability was everything. Once you became impeccable, all of your decisions would be correct.\n\nShe further said, \"You put too much emphasis on silence!  Silence isn't everything!!!\"\n\nI realized, Cholita had been hanging out with the more powerful women in the group, including the witches.  I heard echos of Taisha in her words.\n\nAnd I thought about a witch I'm trying to help by email, who despite not being able to get silent, was manifesting cobra demons in her bedroom.\n\nI had a sudden insight and thought of how I could understand her better.\n\nI asked her, \"What\u2019s more important?  What you do? Or how you live?\"\n\nCholita had spaced out again.   She began to talk.\n\n\u201cThis technology is ***amazing***! The inorganics have spread dust everywhere in the air. You can see anything you like!\u201d\n\nWe hadn\u2019t been talking about technology at any point I can remember. But I had to ask her about it.\n\n\"What color is the dust\", I asked?\n\nShe gave me an angry look and ignored my question.\n\nShe went on, \u201cThe Grand Canyon has turned green.  You can see that from the helicopter tours they give.  You can even have fish swimming in the water!\u201d\n\nI asked again, but what about this dust?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like TV static\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cAnything or anyone can suddenly appear in front of you, as real as can be!\u201d\n\nThen she began to worry what the government was going to do with this ability.  It reminded me that some former Sunday Class members were putting out bogus info on the inorganics, combining it with conspiracy theories to make it more marketable.  Cholita might have seen some of that garbage.\n\nI asked her again, What you do, or how you live?\n\nShe stopped talking and said, \u201cWhat? Huh? Oh. What you do or how you live?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow you live of course!\u201d\n\nI suddenly understood the last 20 years of inspirational quotes. They were motivated by the female mindset.\n\nThe men just went along with the deal.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why.  Because Carlos put women in charge?\n\nA few men broke off and started their own blogs, but they still didn\u2019t put in enough time to know what they were talking about. And they mixed in other things just to make it more marketable.\n\nThe women on the other hand comprise most of the participants at me-too Nagual workshops.\n\nIt\u2019s all about how you live. Not what you do.\n\n\"Be a Goddess\", is the slogan of one me-too Nagual.  A former Chacmool even re-tweeted it for him.\n\nI remembered how Cholita had puzzled me when I picked her up from her hotel suite across from the mall.  She told me, she finally realized how important it was to keep things organized and in place. She lifted a little bundle of clothes she planned to wear tomorrow and sat them gently on the bed, perhaps to make a show for me. I couldn't help but notice she'd made the bed herself, since she hung out the do not disturb sign.   And the little outfit she'd selected was so sexy, I hadn't seen anything like that since she showed up in my garage many months ago, homeless.\n\nIt had my favorite bra on top. Completely see-through black lace, with a light underwire.  Cholita hadn't worn it since she lifted it up at Victoria's Secret, and asked if I liked it?\n\nLater that evening, Armageddon did indeed break out.\n\nCholita, after getting her hair cut perfectly so that it wasn\u2019t out of spec for a Chacmool, did a little shopping at Whole Foods. She bought every little bottle of supplements designed to keep you calm and happy. There were so many that the checkout clerk made a comment about it.\n\nShe also ravaged the makeup section, tossing little lipstick boxes around, finding the brightest red color she would never wear in a million years, tearing the box open,  smearing it heavily on her lips, then finally tossing it into her basket saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll buy **that**!\u201d\n\nShe smeared the red off until there was just a hint of it, and smeared her hand on the edge of the counter, to wipe it off.\n\nAs we finally walked out of Whole Foods, and I worried she was entering her **very** angry phase, she informed me that she\u2019d bought tickets to Seattle, and I had to take her to the train station in Los Angeles at 6AM on Monday.\n\nI said no. Of course I\u2019m not going to help you run away again!\n\nShe became angrier and angrier, shouting loudly even as people walked by.  She made such a fuss that the security guards showed up.\n\nThree of them.\n\nThey asked if everyone was ok. I explained, she suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nShe became furious and explained how I was blocking all of her jobs, had taken all of her money, and was holding her prisoner, for sex trafficking.\n\nI pointed out to them that she was wearing over $1000 in clothes.\n\nThey looked her over, and talked on their radios to someone elsewhere.\n\nShe continued to throw a tirade, saying she was a prisoner and she needed them to take me into custody.\n\nThey asked if she wanted to go to a women\u2019s shelter?\n\n\"Yes!\", she said. Take me away from him.\n\nThey called the police to come pick her up.\n\nThe police took so long that they never arrived. Instead, Cholita started to talk about how she was going to kill herself if she didn\u2019t get her old life back.\n\nI told the security guards, that\u2019s what we need. You\u2019re the witness. The police won\u2019t take her for evaluation, unless she threatens harm to someone or herself.\n\nThey didn\u2019t look like they wanted to be witnesses.\n\nThe security guards talked on their radios, and said the police were almost here.\n\nCholita ran out of energy.  She sighed and exhaled slowly.\n\nThen she said to me sweetly, \"I\u2019m tired. Let\u2019s go.\"\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to do. At some point she had to get evaluated by a doctor, in order to secure social security benefits.  And maybe there's a simple medication that would help her keep her sanity.\n\nI looked at her, trying to figure out if being taken into custody might be too traumatic for her.\n\nBesides, in 20 minutes she\u2019d be happy again.\n\nShe looked up at me and said, \u201cTss, Tss, Sssshhh. It\u2019s ok\u2026\u201d\n\nWe walked away, leaving the police to find out that she wasn\u2019t there to deal with anymore.\n\nBut before we left, one younger security guard, possibly only 20, asked me, \"Why do you help her?\"\n\nI realized, there was no way to explain that, without going into lockup evaluation myself.  The myth that sorcerers live in just isn't compatible with the \"pursuit of happiness\" of normal people.  There was no way I could tell him, I'm protecting a powerful witch, given to me by a famous sorcerer, and it's my job to keep her safe if at all possible.  And there are hundreds of people who know about it, and wish her well.  Not only that, but her amazingly horrible and angry behavior,  combined with personal attacks of the worst kind she can think up, helps me perfect my silence.\n\nAs we drove home on the long dark road, because Cholita had kept me out until all the stores closed again, she sat up on the seat, turned around to get access to the back seat, and rifled through her bag of goodies from Whole Foods.  I couldn't help but notice (as a stormtrooper), that her butt was just 3 inches from my face.\n\n\"Don't do **that** to me!\", I commented.\n\nShe pulled out a bag of plantain chips. She\u2019d told me that they were evil, because she eats the whole bag, and then gets sick later on.\n\nI warned her, didn\u2019t you say those made you sick?\n\nShe turned around, plopped her butt down hard on the seat, used her teeth to open the bag, and began crunching chip after chip.\n\nShe was calmer. I asked her, do you still hate me?\n\nShe crunched through 4 or 5 more chips, then finally said,\n\n\u201cCuddles\u201d.\n\nI felt my heart sink.\n\n\"You mean you want to cuddle with me?\", I asked.\n\n\"Why not?\", she said.\n\nOf course, I knew there weren't any cuddles in my future, but it was pretty nice to get the offer.\n\nShe was trying to make up for Armageddon.\n\nJust for fun, because stormtroopers need to get something out of the chaos once in a while, I asked if they could be naked cuddles, all night long.\n\nI like to escalate her subtle offers (which will never take place) to their final conclusion, making them \"obscene\", as she calls it.\n\n\"Of course\", she said.\n\nLater on she asked me, \"What are you writing about me on the internet???\"\n\nThe next day,  Cholita texted me and said she was wearing the red lipstick, and can we go to the apple store?\n\nEdited: ten times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Male vs Female Mindset", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"g46mcx6hykp31": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 142, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g46mcx6hykp31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23a95916c0365e4e4481576b22bddc06a4e18615"}, {"y": 285, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g46mcx6hykp31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3b653173ef50a97fdadfadd80d79c9c272026b1"}, {"y": 423, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g46mcx6hykp31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8ffbc04e5d7297bf49be12414db513f569f497c"}], "s": {"y": 501, "x": 379, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g46mcx6hykp31.jpg?width=379&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cd74836a81d9a699ef100a77dbcf045cf13c957"}, "id": "g46mcx6hykp31"}}, "name": "t3_dayrm2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ThKodHSFXfaluVAMQw40bWlOB8n9lZWrUhUfYDAsJTI.jpg", "edited": 1569973298.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1569780417.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g46mcx6hykp31.jpg?width=379&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3cd74836a81d9a699ef100a77dbcf045cf13c957\"&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s Garden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While sitting in a Celtic bar sipping wine and eating latkes, Cholita asked me more about the dreaming techniques I use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I explained some to her, thinking they would be new ideas.

It\u2019s ok\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walked away, leaving the police to find out that she wasn\u2019t there to deal with anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before we left, one younger security guard, possibly only 20, asked me, &amp;quot;Why do you help her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, there was no way to explain that, without going into lockup evaluation myself.  The myth that sorcerers live in just isn&amp;#39;t compatible with the &amp;quot;pursuit of happiness&amp;quot; of normal people.  There was no way I could tell him, I&amp;#39;m protecting a powerful witch, given to me by a famous sorcerer, and it&amp;#39;s my job to keep her safe if at all possible.  And there are hundreds of people who know about it, and wish her well.  Not only that, but her amazingly horrible and angry behavior,  combined with personal attacks of the worst kind she can think up, helps me perfect my silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we drove home on the long dark road, because Cholita had kept me out until all the stores closed again, she sat up on the seat, turned around to get access to the back seat, and rifled through her bag of goodies from Whole Foods.  I couldn&amp;#39;t help but notice (as a stormtrooper), that her butt was just 3 inches from my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; to me!&amp;quot;, I commented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She pulled out a bag of plantain chips. She\u2019d told me that they were evil, because she eats the whole bag, and then gets sick later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I warned her, didn\u2019t you say those made you sick?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned around, plopped her butt down hard on the seat, used her teeth to open the bag, and began crunching chip after chip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was calmer. I asked her, do you still hate me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She crunched through 4 or 5 more chips, then finally said,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCuddles\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my heart sink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You mean you want to cuddle with me?&amp;quot;, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why not?&amp;quot;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I knew there weren&amp;#39;t any cuddles in my future, but it was pretty nice to get the offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was trying to make up for Armageddon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, because stormtroopers need to get something out of the chaos once in a while, I asked if they could be naked cuddles, all night long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to escalate her subtle offers (which will never take place) to their final conclusion, making them &amp;quot;obscene&amp;quot;, as she calls it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course&amp;quot;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later on she asked me, &amp;quot;What are you writing about me on the internet???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day,  Cholita texted me and said she was wearing the red lipstick, and can we go to the apple store?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: ten times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "43d4e582-6010-11ea-a748-0ef2a7bb995d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "dayrm2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 74, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/dayrm2/male_vs_female_mindset/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/dayrm2/male_vs_female_mindset/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1569780417.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f1wv8fi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1569789882.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_dayrm2", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I suspect this story ought to put the rumors to bed, that Carlos was mostly gathering himself a harem of sorts.

You get to know the effects, even if you can\u2019t perfectly *see* their configuration.\n\nDon't forget that don Juan misread Carlos. It wasn't until years later, they realized he was something else. He wasn't a double but he produced the same effects on the surface. \n\nI ran into one who could produce those effects, years before I met Jenna.  She was standing in line at a Taiwanese bakery.  I looked over, and all I saw was a glowing luminous ball.  With a big green ribbon on top.\n\nI couldn't do anything about it. I was escorting my mother to get salted caramel coffee.  The nagual is delusion to her and has to be eradicated at all costs.\n\nBut she went to the bathroom, and the double woman came right up to my table. She pretended to need to share my table because she had so many bakery goods, that she had to organize them before she left.\n\nShe put her hands inside the bag to hold it open, tilted it so I could see both her hands, and the contents of the bag. \n\nNo wedding ring, and only 2 items in the bag.\n\nShe was on a job interview!  \n\nI was so dazzled that I didn't think to get her information.  \n\nI returned to that bakery for nearly a year, at the same time and on the same day of the week.\n\nBut I never saw her again.\n\nI vowed I wouldn't make that mistake the next time.  Back then, it hadn't occurred to me to perpetuate Carlos' techniques via the internet. I thought you couldn't have personal contact and help people directly, in that medium.  \n\nNow things are different.\n\nBut then, I had made a vow.

It wasn&amp;#39;t until years later, they realized he was something else. He wasn&amp;#39;t a double but he produced the same effects on the surface. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran into one who could produce those effects, years before I met Jenna.  She was standing in line at a Taiwanese bakery.  I looked over, and all I saw was a glowing luminous ball.  With a big green ribbon on top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything about it. I was escorting my mother to get salted caramel coffee.  The nagual is delusion to her and has to be eradicated at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she went to the bathroom, and the double woman came right up to my table. She pretended to need to share my table because she had so many bakery goods, that she had to organize them before she left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She put her hands inside the bag to hold it open, tilted it so I could see both her hands, and the contents of the bag. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No wedding ring, and only 2 items in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was on a job interview!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so dazzled that I didn&amp;#39;t think to get her information.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I returned to that bakery for nearly a year, at the same time and on the same day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I never saw her again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I vowed I wouldn&amp;#39;t make that mistake the next time.  Back then, it hadn&amp;#39;t occurred to me to perpetuate Carlos&amp;#39; techniques via the internet. I thought you couldn&amp;#39;t have personal contact and help people directly, in that medium.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now things are different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, I had made a vow.

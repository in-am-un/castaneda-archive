I just seek to explore the many realities that makes this existence, we all share. Fear itself is my only obstacle. There is a practise in my culture (Turkish/Islamic) people who have jinn(inorganic beings) as helpers who are called &amp;quot;H\u00fcddams&amp;quot;. Before they are initiated they have to abstain from consuming meat, and have to stay in a dark room for 40days. If I remember correctly there&amp;#39;s also a period of fasting involved. Mainly to overcome fear itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never teach or explain the full progress. Unless a &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; sees you worthy. Wich you guys provide without a requirement. I find that a honesty I can only utmostly respect and appreciate. Secrecy only serves the wicked even if the intentions are good. So, thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_oumvju", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oumvju/dreaming_doubleastral_body_running_upstairs_to/h74hn3p/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1627676138.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1627676138.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iaxi11k", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iavkapo", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Jadey and I are making playgrounds lately.

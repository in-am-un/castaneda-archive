Just don't be an angry, greedy man and you'll do fine here.\n\nThose still entirely on facebook are pretty much doomed until they get off there.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Here's from Facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Benefits of Window Shopping\n\nIf you are a fan of the books of Carlos Castaneda (a cheap appeal to the search engines to index this facebook page), you'll have noticed that some of the lineage members could travel into the second attention as if it were a road leading to many places.\n\nAnd take others with them!\n\nEmilito and Eligio took the little sisters, the Genaros, and even Carlos, out on that road to many places in the second attention.\n\nElias was famous for \"shopping\" all over the universe. While he didn't bring back actual objects (as far as we know), he did study what he saw and recreated it in wood and metal. Apparently he had some blacksmithing and carpenting skills.\n\nTall tale? \n\nNO!!!! \n\nYou can do this yourself. I posted how just a couple of days ago. Did you think I was joking when I told you how to go window shopping 24 hours a day, using your double?\n\nNo Emilito to help you?\n\nYes you do!  Emilito was Zuleica's double.\n\nAnd you have your own double.  He can be your Emilito.  If you like, you can even name him that, to give him the right mood.\n\nBut long before you acquire that sort of sorcery skill, you'll have seen inorganic being manifestations in the darkroom, learned to hold them in your hand, and using the dark energy they provide you'll be familiar with \"dream bubbles\".\n\nSo as they have always done since the time of the Men of Knowledge thousands of years ago, the inorganic beings can give you a \"preview\" of silent knowledge far beyond your skill level.\n\nYou can literally \"insert\" them into a dream bubble, and narrate the scene. In this case, posted more than a year ago, you can see what that's like.\n\nIt's no exaggeration! And oddly, it's pretty much the same \"Olmec Technology\" as the talking lizards, or the moth dust which brings mushroom shapes you summon to represent people.\n\nHey... How many times do I need to nag? This stuff is REAL. Could we please stop acting as if it's not, like all the other crap-magic systems out there which don't actually work?\n\nThis does! But you have to \"work like a dog\" to learn to get silent, and you have to force yourself to be honest, by insisting on being able to visibly see your energy body while doing tensegrity, or you will deceive yourself and never really learn.\n\nSo many among you will claim you can get silent. But can you do this fully awake, eyes open, no drugs?\n\nThen you can't. It's that simple.\n\nIn the course of explaining how to get your double to take you window shopping in an alien world, one of our \"mad\" witches posted this, which I felt was a very clear explanation of what's gone wrong in the community, with so many claiming \"Shamanic Dreaming Skills\" based on mental masturbation around their ordinary dreams. That type of behavior harms us all.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from a witch on reddit \\*\\*\\*\n\n\u201cWindow shopping\u201d is one of the best ways to train your dreaming attention. You\u2019ve got no money, so you can\u2019t commit to anything. All you can do is glance over the objects on display, one by one, maybe pick something up every once in a while. But you can\u2019t linger too long, or the shop assistant comes over and tries to commit you into buying so you have no choice but to leave.\n\nIt\u2019s that \u2018glancing at things without staring\u2019 technique.

Even though you can\u2019t take any home.\n\nReal shops and dreams of shops are both good for this in a very literal way.\n\nI figured something out. Well, I didn\u2019t do anything, I found a link someone posted to some workshop notes from Carlos and the Witches. They say \u2018dreaming\u2019 isn\u2019t lucid dreaming. But you perform dreaming by first building your dreaming attention and you can use your ordinary lucid dreams to help build this attention. Then when your attention threshold has been crossed, you can go into \u2018dreaming\u2019.\n\nI know how to explain the dreaming drills now without getting stuck in a lucid dreaming / 4 gates dreaming topic trap.

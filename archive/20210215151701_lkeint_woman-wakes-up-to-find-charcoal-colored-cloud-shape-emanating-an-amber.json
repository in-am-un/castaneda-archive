It was a long time ago, and it only happened that one time. Other things have happened in that house, but this is the one thing I can\u2019t categorize,\" Jane said in a phone interview with investigator Tobias Wayland. \"It was in the middle of the night. I was woken up. I don\u2019t typically wake up at night. I can\u2019t say that it was a noise or anything that woke me up. I just woke up.\"\n\nI\u2019m a very pragmatic, practical, logical person, and what I saw in the room, I couldn\u2019t put any reason to it. At the foot of the bed, near the ceiling, there\u2019s a corner wall there with built-in dressers and next to the built-in dressers there\u2019s a window that had a window air conditioner in it. There were little cracks of light on both sides of where the window air conditioner fits into the window. \n\nSo, up in that corner, on the ceiling, there was an object that, I would say, was probably four feet wide by two or three feet tall, sitting near the top of the ceiling. It was a charcoal-colored cloud shape, but it wasn\u2019t cloud-like. Cloud-shaped meaning it had puffiness around it, but it looked solid, a solid charcoal color. Inside of it, there looked like there was an amber light, kind of trying to emanate from the inside out. You could see gradations of this amber light from the inside to the outside of the charcoal cloud.\n\nIf I had a shoe or something that I could have thrown at it, I swear it would have bounced off, because that\u2019s how solid it looked. But the amber light from the inside, that\u2019s what got me. \n\nImmediately I thought, \"I\u2019m dreaming. I must have woken up during a dream and that\u2019s still part of my dream. Okay, I\u2019ll just close my eyes and when I wake up it will be gone.\"\n\nI closed my eyes and I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. I peeked up and it was still there.

It\u2019s not moving. There\u2019s nothing about it that\u2019s mobile or foggy or anything.

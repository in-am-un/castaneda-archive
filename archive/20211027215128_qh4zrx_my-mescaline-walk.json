Drinking it took about a minute or two. I\u2019m pretty sure it was the powdered cactus, it was a bit green and the taste wasn\u2019t necessarily bad \u2013 but my friend tells me it takes him five minutes to ingest the same dose and he has to have apple cider vinegar with it just to mask the taste. It could be something very subjective.  As a taste bud reference:  I have my coffee black and, while I don\u2019t love the taste, it doesn\u2019t bother me enough to add anything to it to improve it.  I then had a bit more water as I wanted to make sure I ingested all the powder. The main ingredient of San Pedro powder is Mescaline.  This powder came from Peru, via a friend who gave it to me.  He has been taking it once a week now for a month or four. \n\nWithin half an hour my heart rate went from my normal of 70/72, while awake and inactive, to 90 \u2013 94 and it remained there for the next four hours or so. It got down into the 80s and remained between the 80s and 70s for the rest of the evening which is about 20% higher than average.  I felt I had to lie down as I just didn\u2019t trust my sense of balance. \n\nFor the first four hours or so it was unpleasant. There was just enough nausea to notice but not enough for me to throw up. My sense of time dilated \u2013 it was moving significantly slower than normal by a factor of two or three.  I felt I had to breathe consciously or I\u2019d stop. I didn\u2019t test it by not breathing.  My bladder felt the size of a walnut: I had to urinate every five minutes or so. And my body temperature fluctuated by area; the feet felt warm while the legs felt cold as well as the head and arms.  It may not have been quite horrible but it was close enough for me to feel \u201cI\u2019m never doing this again!\u201d  I wanted to crawl into a cave and be grounded by the dirt. That\u2019s just not going to happen while living in an apartment in NYC \u2013 no dirt vagina to crawl into for me. \n\nAfter four hours or so, about nine thirty pm, I felt a bit better physically but the time dilation was still there. My attention to the details of my surroundings was greater than normal. I felt as if my eyesight had improved. No way to test that though. The heart rate got down into the 80s and the nausea abated enough for me to begin to feel comfortable. \n\nFrom about nine thirty to eleven PM I read, talked to the Anchor Vagina and took a few cognitive tests: My IQ was normal \u2013 within 3% at the high end of my normal \u2013 and my memory was also normal.  I also updated my friend on Wassup on how I felt.  I did not feel like continuing to read, it felt a bit of a waste of time so I stopped.  At this time I felt very sleepy, in a good way.  There was a tiny bit of anxiety and a greater awareness of my feelings/mental state. I\u2019d say this may be the reason some people feel paranoid when taking it. It felt strange that the vagina wasn\u2019t obviously aware of what was happening. But that train of thought only lasted for five or ten minutes.  There was heart rate variability \u2013 the heart rate was all over the place from the 70s to the mid 80s. At one point I looked at my watch, which has \u201creal time\u201d heart rate measurements, and tried to lower my heart rate and it worked. I\u2019m happy about having an autonomous nervous system and don\u2019t want to take over the job so being able to lower my heart rate by staring at my watch is not something that interests me. \n\nAt about midnight I decided to write down some ideas. I typed nine pages, 2836 words and still had more to go but it was 2AM and I felt too sleepy to continue.  Noooo, not a book about sorcery!  Not at all. \n\nSo, of course, I decided to put on my mask and practice quietude with my eyes open. As soon as I put on the mask, before getting anywhere near being quiet I saw speeding purple blobs flying from right to left \u2013 a few of them, like four or five. This abated almost as soon as it started. Silence would just not show up for the first forty minutes or so and then I went down a notch, so a bit of silence but no more than normal. I did grab a couple of purple blobs I saw and put it on my torso. Nothing else odd happened. \n\nI lay down to bed around 3AM but could not sleep for much beyond 20-30 minutes at a time, if that. I got up at seven in the morning, still feeling it but with no need to go back to sleep at all even though I do feel sleepy. I don\u2019t, however, feel like talking. While talking to my Anchor Vagina and my Mescaline Friend today I felt both conversations where, mostly, a waste of time other than a bit of personal bonding. \n\nThis is not something I would bother buying to improve silence or my perception of IOBs which is my main goal. I feel I can do an equal or better job just doing the work necessary practicing silence and tensegrity in the dark. I wouldn\u2019t be against taking it once or twice more just to see the difference in cognition now that I\u2019ve taken it once but that\u2019s it.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "My Mescaline Walk", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_qh4zrx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_765tt7", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1635364288.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I took about 15 grams of San Pedro powder in some 16 ounces of water around 5:15pm.

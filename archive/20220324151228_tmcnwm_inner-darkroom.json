Pretend you climb a mountain and run into a little gang of strange people sitting in a group in a clearing, and you notice they seem to be discussing topics of sorcery.\n\nAnd have advanced knowledge you aren't in possession of.  Just spying on their conversation is a fascinating mini-revelation flow, one after the other.\n\nOne of them notices you're listening, and tells you to just come over and don't be so shy.\n\nBut when you do they stand up and start shoving you all around, like it was a game.\n\nOne shoves you unpleasantly at the other guy, and when you crash into him, he whispers  more of those mini-revelations into your ear.\n\nAfter a few minutes of that you run away, back down the mountain, and have all night to think about it.  You inevitably conclude, the bullying is worth it as long as you can learn to accept that part.\n\nBut it is in fact a little traumatic.  Makes you feel odd the next day.  Disturbed.\n\nContinuing the analogy, you go up there the next day and can't find them.  You wander around for hours, and then when you are almost out of time, you see a glow around a group of huge boulders, and wonder if they've moved in there.\n\nAs you approach, you start to hear them talking and catch a few mini-revelations.  You did find them again!  But it took so long to find them, you're out of time have to go back down the mountain.\n\nEventually you learn you can find them by looking for that glow.\n\nBut with more experience, you realize that glow isn't coming from them.  It's coming from your eyes.  When you are \"looking the right direction\", your eyes shine.\n\nThat's as much clue as I dare give out because beginners can really screw themselves up.  Instead of looking for shortcuts that help them force silence, they look for results that get them attention.\n\nAnd never learn the \"tips\" you need to be good at darkroom.  They don't want to learn how to work, they want to learn how to convince themselves they were successful.\n\nAvoid work, get reward.\n\nIf you learn to get to silent knowledge, you'll have to decide how fast to approach i, once you realize it's like being bullied continuously.  The problem is we are linear beings, and once you enter silent knowledge that aspect of us is weaker, and we have to work hard to convert non-linear stuff into linear knowledge so we can \"take it back with us\".\n\nI work with Chinese folks, and they think in the obscure variant of Hokkien. Chinese with a southern drawl.  In their language, my name means \"electric\". Which is a good marketing ploy!\n\nIf you walk up to ask something  you need to see what they are doing.  If it has their Hokkien internal dialogue going, they won't hear you.  You'll have to ask again and again until you stop the flow of that in their mind, at which point they'll be a tiny bit angry.\n\nIn a multi-language situation it's a lot harder for humans to tolerate interruptions.  Whereas if both are speaking the same language, being interrupted  is not nearly so disruptive.  Of course, ability to tolerate interruptions varies by the person.\n\nThe pain of being interrupted is very similar to the pain silent knowledge can produce.  I suppose \"annoyance\" is a better description.  You're \"mode of thought\" is interrupted.\n\nIt's dreadful enough that on approaching silent knowledge in the dark room you might deliberately want to slow down and learn more about how to approach that assemblage point position smoothly without having to get \"sucked in\".\n\nThe first few times likely you get \"sucked in\" without having expected it.\n\nThe power plant rituals don Juan showed Carlos, like the lizards and the moth dust, is a good example of getting \"sucked in\".  Those rituals were designed to summon the intent of the final goal, the \"divining\" part (super cool), by forcing the apprentice to do very long, complicated, pointless endeavors, like grow 1 yard long devil's weed roots, or gather up plants that go into powdered shroom smoking mixture but have no actual value.\n\nDoing all that activates the emanations associated with that activity in the past, when it was successful.\n\nThe drugs move the assemblage point, and then if you have an Ally it can finish the rest of  the distance and insure the same result.\n\nI don't know if the ritual is for the Ally, or for the apprentice.  But the combination of them works.\n\nIt's a \"magical doing\" someone invented.  Like a container.  If  you get out that container in the presence of your ally, she knows what to fill that with.\n\nSo silent knowledge is available at all levels of apprenticeship, but should not be mistaken with other \"technologies\" we have.\n\nSilent knowledge makes the puffs crystalline.\n\nBut the puffs are not of that technology.  The puffs are of the double.  So they are \"double technology\".\n\nAnd there's \"intent technology\".   A different topic.  Intent technology is pretty much like Tensegrity.  A bunch of ritual behavior designed to stir specific emanations, to summon a specific result.\n\nBut as in the darkroom,  tensegrity,  which is \"intent technology\",  won't work well if \"reskimming\" of emanations isn't possible.\n\nIf you have that internal dialogue ranting in your head.  That prevents intent technology from working, because it's \"counter-intent\".\n\nSo darkroom has \"double technology\", \"Silent knowledge technology\", and \"intent technology\".\n\nEach is a separate thing of itself.  They flow together and we confuse what's what, but those are in fact different things.\n\nAnd there's more.  \"Ally Technology\".   And \"Abstract Technology\".\n\nAbstract technology was beyond the Men of Knowledge,  but a good one of those has rituals which  uses all 4 of the \"simple\" technologies together, to produce the stunning result.\n\nIf you can manage to do that in darkroom you'll have that type of spectacular result.\n\nBut \"intent\" is the form into which you fit those technologies.\n\nFortunately any one of those is enough to produce noticeable \"cool stuff\", as long as you can get rid of that internal dialogue.  The assemblage point moves as a result of any of the 4 technologies, so it's sort of like you have to shut off the parking brakes if you expect something to happen.\n\nSome things that manifest in the darkroom contain more of one thing than the other.\n\nA purple puff is 90% \"double technology\".\n\nUnless it's crystalline, meaning, you look inside the edges and see fun things. There's \"stuff\" in the \"puffs\".\n\nThat's silent knowledge technology, accessed faster than your ability using the double.\n\nIt's like a mini-lizard trick, or a mini-shroom shape moth dust trick.\n\nThe men of knowledge, if they had stumbled on crystalline puffs, would have seen it as an opportunity to design another \"man of knowledge trick\".\n\nSomething you can sell.\n\nBut a seer isn't interested in selling.  And the ones who are won't go far.\n\nA very interesting thing you can see is a \"floating disturbance\".\n\nThose can move your assemblage point because they \"come from somewhere else\".  From another position of the assemblage point.\n\nThe puffs come from the double.  So playing with those  brings the double near.\n\nBut a floating dream is a different thing.  It can be floating, on the wall, even on the floor.\n\nA translocation is pretty much the same thing, but with 30% silent knowledge mixed in.\n\nIn \"dream bubble\" form, that's \"double technology\".  A dream the double is having.  Don't ask me why our tonal body can now perceive it, that's a different topic related to \"using 60% double\".  Something that gets mentioned in posts a lot.\n\nA \"floating woman's head\" is not \"double technology\".  That's \"inorganic being' technology.\n\nAnd probably the easiest way to learn that stuff around you is not all the same.\n\nAnd it's good to learn to be more discerning.\n\nThen there's a subset of \"double technology\".  And that's, \"Someone else's double\" technology.\n\nA visit from Cholita.  Not the same as a dream bubble at all.\n\nA dream bubble is ordinarily linear and \"flat\".\n\nIt's true that you can \"zip\" into any floating dream you see, if you have 80% double.  You have to be able to switch over to him to zip into a dream.  Don't ask me what happens to the tonal.  That comes up over and over in the books, and the answer seems to always be, when you are done  you are back where you started from.\n\nA dream bubble can actually look more like an \"object\".  In that case,  you have an actual weird object floating in the air.  It's not a dream, because it's not a scene.  And you couldn't really \"enter it\".  If you gaze at such an object, you find that it's not only 3 dimensional, but that if you try to follow the \"depth\" of a detail, you kind of get \"sucked down\" that detail.\n\nMaybe it's a weird machine which has a tube on one part. If you try to look to see what's inside the tube, you zoom up closer to the inside of the tube.  And then when you \"feel\" that, you spring back, and are looking at the object again.\n\nThat's a \"Silent Knowledge\" object.   You just \"know\" it's there, so it is. Each detail is created, when you \"know\" about it.\n\nThis is where things get tricky.  A silent knowledge object is the means to a drastic assemblage point position change.  It's unpredictable.\n\nSo forgetting what those monstrosities are \"good for\", you might just observe them from a distance to learn about them.  To learn how they \"feel\".\n\nAnd then, you can use that feeling to attain deeper silence.\n\nKeep in mind, a \"puff\" is a great silence aid.  In fact, that is the whole reason they are emphasized.\n\nIt's a piece of your double so getting closer gives you more super powers.\n\nBut it's also \"proof of silence\".  And also it,  \"pulls your assemblage point along\".\n\nYou can also use silent knowledge objects to do that.\n\nBut the pull of a silent knowledge object rips linearity to pieces.  They're like a nuclear bomb, compared to a firecracker (the dream bubbles).\n\nSo if you try to \"keep to a safe distance\", while using them to \"tune in\" better silence, you are likely to succeed in diverting the nuclear blast into a safe location.  To attack your internal dialogue, instead of your linearity.\n\nAnd then you discover the \"coolest\" object I've seen so far, in the darkroom.\n\nI can't even name it.  I suppose you could say it's a \"silent knowledge object\" **outside** the realm of objects.\n\nIt's there, but not as an object.    Trying to perceive it  yanks you into another timeline.  Another \"space\".\n\nIts as if this object is a \"history object\".  Perceiving it brings up its history.\n\nThe ones you see at first will likely yank your assemblage point so far horizontally that they'll be perceived mostly as a \"pressure\".   One might describe it as 'unpleasant', perhaps like a feverish dream object.  Or something a women would notice on her period.\n\nI forgot to mention. There are no spoilers for women.\n\nOnly men get \"spoiled\" by knowing more.\n\nBummer...\n\nBut the women are never really \"all in\".   Possibly one reason for all the sexual \"shenanigans\" with some in sorcery groups.  It's the only way to get some women \"all in\"?\n\nThey're always looking for an advantage from \"another angle\",   \"another option\".\n\nSo its ok to talk about spoilers as if they were a universal problem, when in fact only men get \"spoiled\".\n\nNot to say women can't have the \"book deal mind\".\n\nSo this specific type of \"history object\", a full on silent knowledge object but not confined to being  simple, can be mostly feelings.\n\nFeelings that are self-contained as a \"thing\", and when felt summon a memory of the circumstances around which the feeling was felt.\n\nThe \"feeling object\" can be felt under many new circumstances, once it's been felt in the initial one, and children are famous for finding those other places. \n\nThey detect the special \"feeling\" in their routine. Such as, a 3rd visit to a specific beach as a 5 year old.  The combination of the nice breeze, the sunshine on the side of their face at 5PM,  ocean water still cooling parts of their body, and then perhaps the peaceful walk up the beach to go home, generates a feeling that's unique enough to become a \"thing'.\n\nIt's no longer linear and pulls the assemblage point to somewhere you can \"feel\" as \"a thing\", so children notice these far more than adults.\n\nThe child might detect the same feeling when standing in a certain spot at the mall, outside in the amazing landscaping and planter boxes and benches.  If no one is around a sort of familiarity comes over them, and that \"history object\" from the beach gets associated with the shopping mall.\n\nIt's energy which got mixed up in a complex array of events,  and thus \"dispersed\".\n\nRecapitulation works with those \"history objects\".\n\nIn fact, it's designed to seek those out.\n\nThe head sweep is designed to activate the one pre-requisite for reaching silent knowledge in the dark room.\n\nThat final \"transition\" from deep orange zone, into full on silent knowledge.\n\nIt's an actual change that can be felt as a \"pop\", or something extreme that happens to  your vision for just an instant.\n\nThat glow you detect before finding the silent knowledge \"gang\" up in the hills.\n\nThe sweep of recapitulation generates it.\n\nRecapitulation makes heavy use of  \"silent knowledge\" technology.  And from experience I can tell you, inorganic beings show up so it also makes use of their form also.  And your double gets involved, even transporting you across your home to find yourself standing in the wrong place.\n\nThat's double technology.\n\nAll of the darkroom technologies are used in recapitulation too, making it \"Inner Darkroom\".\n\nBut like ordinary darkroom, if you don't learn to let  the assemblage point drift it will just be a boring exercise that isn't enough to motivate you to learn to \"navigate\" for real.  To actually find a path to magic, and follow it inch by inch daily.\n\nInch by inch is what's been missing in the community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\"Inner Darkroom\"", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_tmcnwm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1648139534.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1648131148.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting the hang of how to approach the final distance to silent knowledge, and discovered stuff that seems useful, without being harmful to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forgive the  typing errors, I&amp;#39;ll have to fix it in the morning, or lose stuff to second attention memory difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent knowledge is in fact a little traumatic at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could think of it as &amp;quot;magical bullies&amp;quot;.

If you gaze at such an object, you find that it&amp;#39;s not only 3 dimensional, but that if you try to follow the &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; of a detail, you kind of get &amp;quot;sucked down&amp;quot; that detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s a weird machine which has a tube on one part. If you try to look to see what&amp;#39;s inside the tube, you zoom up closer to the inside of the tube.  And then when you &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; that, you spring back, and are looking at the object again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; object.   You just &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s there, so it is. Each detail is created, when you &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where things get tricky.  A silent knowledge object is the means to a drastic assemblage point position change.  It&amp;#39;s unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So forgetting what those monstrosities are &amp;quot;good for&amp;quot;, you might just observe them from a distance to learn about them.  To learn how they &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, you can use that feeling to attain deeper silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, a &amp;quot;puff&amp;quot; is a great silence aid.  In fact, that is the whole reason they are emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a piece of your double so getting closer gives you more super powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s also &amp;quot;proof of silence&amp;quot;.  And also it,  &amp;quot;pulls your assemblage point along&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also use silent knowledge objects to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the pull of a silent knowledge object rips linearity to pieces.  They&amp;#39;re like a nuclear bomb, compared to a firecracker (the dream bubbles).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you try to &amp;quot;keep to a safe distance&amp;quot;, while using them to &amp;quot;tune in&amp;quot; better silence, you are likely to succeed in diverting the nuclear blast into a safe location.  To attack your internal dialogue, instead of your linearity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you discover the &amp;quot;coolest&amp;quot; object I&amp;#39;ve seen so far, in the darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even name it.  I suppose you could say it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;silent knowledge object&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;outside&lt;/strong&gt; the realm of objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s there, but not as an object.    Trying to perceive it  yanks you into another timeline.  Another &amp;quot;space&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its as if this object is a &amp;quot;history object&amp;quot;.  Perceiving it brings up its history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ones you see at first will likely yank your assemblage point so far horizontally that they&amp;#39;ll be perceived mostly as a &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot;.   One might describe it as &amp;#39;unpleasant&amp;#39;, perhaps like a feverish dream object.  Or something a women would notice on her period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention. There are no spoilers for women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only men get &amp;quot;spoiled&amp;quot; by knowing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bummer...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the women are never really &amp;quot;all in&amp;quot;.   Possibly one reason for all the sexual &amp;quot;shenanigans&amp;quot; with some in sorcery groups.  It&amp;#39;s the only way to get some women &amp;quot;all in&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re always looking for an advantage from &amp;quot;another angle&amp;quot;,   &amp;quot;another option&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So its ok to talk about spoilers as if they were a universal problem, when in fact only men get &amp;quot;spoiled&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to say women can&amp;#39;t have the &amp;quot;book deal mind&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this specific type of &amp;quot;history object&amp;quot;, a full on silent knowledge object but not confined to being  simple, can be mostly feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feelings that are self-contained as a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;, and when felt summon a memory of the circumstances around which the feeling was felt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;feeling object&amp;quot; can be felt under many new circumstances, once it&amp;#39;s been felt in the initial one, and children are famous for finding those other places. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They detect the special &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; in their routine. Such as, a 3rd visit to a specific beach as a 5 year old.  The combination of the nice breeze, the sunshine on the side of their face at 5PM,  ocean water still cooling parts of their body, and then perhaps the peaceful walk up the beach to go home, generates a feeling that&amp;#39;s unique enough to become a &amp;quot;thing&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no longer linear and pulls the assemblage point to somewhere you can &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;a thing&amp;quot;, so children notice these far more than adults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The child might detect the same feeling when standing in a certain spot at the mall, outside in the amazing landscaping and planter boxes and benches.  If no one is around a sort of familiarity comes over them, and that &amp;quot;history object&amp;quot; from the beach gets associated with the shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s energy which got mixed up in a complex array of events,  and thus &amp;quot;dispersed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recapitulation works with those &amp;quot;history objects&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s designed to seek those out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The head sweep is designed to activate the one pre-requisite for reaching silent knowledge in the dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That final &amp;quot;transition&amp;quot; from deep orange zone, into full on silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an actual change that can be felt as a &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot;, or something extreme that happens to  your vision for just an instant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That glow you detect before finding the silent knowledge &amp;quot;gang&amp;quot; up in the hills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sweep of recapitulation generates it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recapitulation makes heavy use of  &amp;quot;silent knowledge&amp;quot; technology.  And from experience I can tell you, inorganic beings show up so it also makes use of their form also.  And your double gets involved, even transporting you across your home to find yourself standing in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s double technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the darkroom technologies are used in recapitulation too, making it &amp;quot;Inner Darkroom&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But like ordinary darkroom, if you don&amp;#39;t learn to let  the assemblage point drift it will just be a boring exercise that isn&amp;#39;t enough to motivate you to learn to &amp;quot;navigate&amp;quot; for real.  To actually find a path to magic, and follow it inch by inch daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inch by inch is what&amp;#39;s been missing in the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b5a42f16-6005-11ea-af1f-0e3247926003", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "tmcnwm", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tmcnwm/inner_darkroom/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/tmcnwm/inner_darkroom/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1648131148.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i1y17v1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1648137602.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_tmcnwm", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I lost 4 hours doing this last night!  \n\nIt's just gone.\n\nI do remember getting into a discussion with phantom subreddit subscribers.\n\nI'm afraid, this entire subreddit might not only be duplicated, but the audience too.\n\nSo one of us might be in there and say, \"Hey, is that glimpee?\"\n\nAnd another say, \"No, he's still a glimpee phantom.

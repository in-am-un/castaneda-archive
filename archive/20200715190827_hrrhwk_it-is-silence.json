Most importantly, the follower must never anticipate and get ahead of the leader. That\u2019s a mess in the making. However, back-leading is allowed and encouraged, meaning the follower can subtly let the leader know which way she\u2019s wanting to go. \n\nMaybe this stuff doesn\u2019t make sense if you haven\u2019t danced ballroom or whatever, but to me it\u2019s a perfect analogy for dancing with the spirit.

The follower is equal to the leader, but her job is to be very sensitive to his \u2018lead\u2019 as it can be subtle (and should be; nobody wants to be dragged around the dance floor). So the follower has chosen to do this dance, but the leader is calling the shots. It\u2019s quite wonderful, I think, as the follower doesn\u2019t have to figure out how everything is going to go (she can\u2019t anyway; she\u2019s dancing backwards, mostly). However, she must always keep her wits about her, as the leader (that would be the spirit or intent) is constantly guiding her. If she gets lost in her head, there will be an accident of some kind. Most importantly, the follower must never anticipate and get ahead of the leader. That\u2019s a mess in the making. However, back-leading is allowed and encouraged, meaning the follower can subtly let the leader know which way she\u2019s wanting to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this stuff doesn\u2019t make sense if you haven\u2019t danced ballroom or whatever, but to me it\u2019s a perfect analogy for dancing with the spirit. It leads. I follow. I also backlead (intend). And I try not to get too in my head and think everything is on my shoulders. It\u2019s not. \n Do I have stars in my eyes?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_hrrhwk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hrrhwk/it_is_silence/fy7o59y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1594866471.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fy63jer", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1594837137.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_hrrhwk", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I encountered those, around 20 years ago.\n\nI found that you can change your internal dialogue into a mode where you just \"go along with it\", and can move the assemblage point.\n\nI believe, it's the same as my technique to \"take a rest in heaven\".

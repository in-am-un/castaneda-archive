I was able to do 2.5 yesterday without interuption but at any given point I can be interupted by my family.\n\nI've noticed that it takes me about 1 hour to get \"first silent\" which is silent enough to see puffs. \"second silent\" allows the vague, grayish-purple puffs to appear with a light internal dialogue/ear worm. \n\n\"third silent\" always comes when I am aware that it is close to the time that my family wakes up. The grayish-purple puffs turn into full blown sparkly purple puffs that pulsate and stick to the torso when I place them on my stomach. I also begin seeing faces in the blobs. If I gaze down at my torso I see a swirling world of purple that can be gazed into. \n\nI have only gotten to \"fourth silent\" a few times where I can see a world forming on the purple puff. I also begin to see the whole room illuminated with purple fog. At that point my mind is almost completely silent aside from the song \"let it go\" from Frozen playing quietly in the background (I am cursed by earworms since I am music teacher). \n\nMost of the time by the time I am \"fourth silent\" I have an invincible desire to lay down on my left side with eyes open. Most of the time I can go directly into a lucid dream from that point or I start to see a world forming in front of me that is more real than the other worlds that I experience during \"third silent\".  I don't lay down because I want to have a lucid dream.

I was completely awake but not in my room anymore. These moments only last a minute for me before I black out momentarily. \n\nSo far I need at least 2 hours to get to \"fourth silent\" and I have not found the ability to push past \"4th silent\" yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Joel", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Practice Update Day 26", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

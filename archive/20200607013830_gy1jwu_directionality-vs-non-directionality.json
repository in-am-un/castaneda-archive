The whole of sorcery.\n\nIn the process of getting silent, you'll move from perceiving with your first attention only, to allowing some of the second attention to come in.\n\nMerge the two.\n\nIf the first attention predominates, you get non-directionality.  If the second attention predominates, you get directional things happening.\n\nNon-directionality means, after a horrible amount of effort to learn to see colors in darkness you find that they simply follow your eyes and your head.\n\nThey're like after images burned into your retina.\n\nIt's as if you stared at the light bulb in the dark basement, then shut it off.\n\nEverywhere you turn your head, the light bulb is still visible!\n\nFor a while.\n\nAnd no one takes those seriously!  If your mom caught you staring at light bulbs, and you said, \"It's ok Mom.  I'm learning to be a wizard...\"\n\nWell.  You know what would happen.  You'd be getting a checkup at the \"doctor\".\n\nWait...   The Fire Kasina people do that with candles.\n\nAnd they're the only others who can do this, as far as I know.\n\nIt's that Dzogchen!\n\nYou know. Those magical Tibetan guys way up in the Himalayas.\n\nIf you need a fixed regimen, and a steadier path, consider joining up with Daniel Ingram.\n\nIf not, then war it is!\n\nI've already gone over a battle plan for you.  And over it and over it.\n\nOthers are possible.\n\nBut this one is super fun!\n\nI left out the inorganic beings in this picture, but last night Fairy sure was fun.\n\nMaybe next time.\n\nAt first, and of course once you find some puffs of color in the darkness, you need to play with them.  You aren't trying to \"do something\"!\n\nGet that out of your mind.\n\nYou don't know how to move your assemblage point, or you wouldn't be looking at this at all.\n\nYou'd probably curse me as a rank beginner.\n\nSo you have to use a tool to move it.\n\nPlay with the colors. That's what you need to do.\n\nIf you see a hypnogogic face on some puffs, go for that.\n\nOtherwise, just scoop them into your hands and move them around as much as possible.\n\nAt first you have to \"fake it\", but as you keep playing they'll turn into a solid object.\n\nAnd you'll be able to compress and rip them apart.\n\nI've heard some can explode, but for me, they behave like soft serve ice cream.\n\nAnd rather than moving with your  head and eyes, you'll be pleasantly surprised to get a blob stuck on your hand, and be unable to shake it off.\n\nDon't worry.  Just smoosh it into your body at the places Tensegrity teaches you.\n\nIt's good to saturate yourself with Tensegrity, so that on the spur of the moment you can figure out what to do in an unusual situation.\n\nI'd forgotten some of the moves I learned, and came across \"Cracking a nugget of energy\".\n\nSince Carlos named them (maybe with help), I'd be very surprised if that technique did not indeed crack a nugget of energy!\n\nNow for the inventory collectors, yes, you're supposed to learn about non-directionality with the wall of fog.\n\nBut we don't have Emilio or Eligio around handy.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that's what happens when you have someone else introducing you to the second attention.\n\nWhen you have to do all the work yourself, you slowly wake it up by yourself.\n\nSo the fog materializes all around you.\n\nYou're already on the other side!\n\nAnd to prove that, you can assemble another world.  Travel to another world using the fog, which seems to be what Carlos' teachers were doing.\n\nBut in this case, you still have to overcome non-directionality.    The other world will recede from you, and you won't be able to enter.\n\nThere's where IOBs can help. If they feel like it, they can lead you in.\n\nThey can make \"the wall\" stop receding from you.\n\nI'm not really happy with the ice cream look here in this picture.\n\nThe purple is WAY MORE INTENSE!   And it leans towards blue.\n\nIt's a little like the highest quality Tanzanite, lit up super bright.\n\nIt's as bright as the brightest thing you ever saw, except that it doesn't hurt the eyes.\n\nIn order to do this, you have to escape the river of filth.  The one you're standing in right now, up to your neck in crap.\n\nIn honor of Cholita, here's her depiction of a river of filth.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=2327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b705a87bf9d30fd06b7e6877466448b9b466b3](https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=2327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b705a87bf9d30fd06b7e6877466448b9b466b3)\n\nCholita's in a bad way lately.\n\nWhen I got home last night she ran to her room, and started shouting from behind the door.\n\n\"Oh, you were really GOOD with the BUBBLY this morning.

It&amp;#39;s a waste of power to go in there, and stick around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because if you turn your head &amp;quot;back&amp;quot;, you can zip out again, into the darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Verify that you went in, and returned where you came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOW, you&amp;#39;ve added 2 times more &amp;quot;realness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s become a place you can visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you zip back, you&amp;#39;ll surely be able to find more dream bubbles to try out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for the &amp;quot;key object&amp;quot; in the dream.  Something that feels &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; to you, or which gives you a familiar feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could just be a painting on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, you switched to your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, you can also &amp;quot;merge&amp;quot; your double with your tonal, and shrink away the influence of the physical matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do that by &amp;quot;doing something&amp;quot; with the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grab them, stretch them, mold them into a shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flatten them any way you can, and then use the surface to manufacture a road or freeway overpass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, you brought the dream into your darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t go into it.  You pulled it out, where you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you ask if you relive them in the red zone, that&amp;#39;s actually not what happens there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There, you &amp;quot;use them&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at all the same as what happens in silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you cease to be human.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_15b20fj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15b20fj/the_potential_of_recapitulation/jto8el8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1690470670.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jto6cru", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "GoatFiend99", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1690469890.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_15b20fj", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_sxkm0fh1", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I just had a heat stroke yesterday \n\nMostly insufferable humidity \n\nMy head is still ringing\n\nI do find humidity \"loosens\" things up during practice\n\nIs actually reliving a memeroy red or pink zone?\n\nI've had almost real visions of the memory I'm recapping which I'm pretty sure is the green zone", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jto6cru", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just had a heat stroke yesterday &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly insufferable humidity &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My head is still ringing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do find humidity &amp;quot;loosens&amp;quot; things up during practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is actually reliving a memeroy red or pink zone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had almost real visions of the memory I&amp;#39;m recapping which I&amp;#39;m pretty sure is the green zone&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15b20fj/the_potential_of_recapitulation/jto6cru/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1690469890.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_15b20fj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

influence of Florinda Matus on my life. She guided me to focus this time on don Juan's teacher, the nagual Julian. Both Florinda and my detailed focusing on the man revealed to me that the nagual Julian Osorio had been an actor of some merit- but more than an actor, he had been a licentious \\[\\* licentious- lacking moral discipline; especially sexually unrestrained\\] man, concerned exclusively with the seduction of women; women of any kind with whom he came in contact during his theatrical presentations. He was so extremely licentious that ultimately, his health failed, and he became infected with tuberculosis.\n\nHis teacher, the nagual Elias, found him one afternoon in an open field on the outskirts of the city of Durango, seducing the daughter of a wealthy landowner. Due to the exertion, the actor began to hemorrhage, and the hemorrhage became so heavy that he was on the brink of dying. Florinda said that the nagual Elias saw that there was no way for him to help him. To cure the actor was an impossibility, and the only thing that he could do as a nagual was to arrest the bleeding, which he did. He saw fit to make then a proposition to the actor.\n\n\"I'm leaving at five in the morning for the mountains,\" he said. \"Be at the entrance of the town. Don't fail. If you fail to come, you will die, sooner than you think. Your only recourse is to go with me. I'll never be able to cure you, but I will be able to deviate your inexorable walk to the abyss that marks the end of life. All of us human beings go inexorably into that abyss sooner or later. I will head you off to walk the enormous extent of that crack, either to the left or to the right of it. As long as you don't fall, you will live. You'll never be well, but you'll live.\"\n\nThe nagual Elias didn't have great expectations about the actor, who was lazy, slovenly, \\[\\* slovenly- negligent of neatness especially in dress and person; habitually dirty and unkempt\\] self-indulgent, and perhaps even a coward. The nagual was quite surprised when the next day at five in the morning he found the actor waiting for him at the edge of the town. He took him to the mountains, and in time, the actor became the nagual Julian- a tubercular man who was never cured, but who lived to be perhaps one hundred and seven years old, always walking along the edge of the abyss.\n\n\"Of course, it is of supreme importance to you,\" Florinda said to me once, \"that you examine the walk of the nagual Julian along the edge of the abyss. The nagual Juan Matus didn't care to know anything about it. To him, all of that was superfluous. You're not as talented as the nagual Juan Matus. Nothing can be superfluous for you as a warrior. You must allow the thoughts, the feelings, and the ideas of the shamans of ancient Mexico to come to you freely.\"\n\nFlorinda was right. I don't have the splendor of the nagual Juan Matus. Just as she had said, nothing could be superfluous to me. I needed every prop; every twist. I could not afford to bypass any of the views or ideas of the shamans of ancient Mexico no matter how far-fetched they might have seemed to me.\n\nTo examine the walk of the nagual Julian on the edge of the abyss meant that the ability to focus my recollection could be extended to the feelings that the nagual Julian had about his most extraordinary struggle to remain alive. I was shocked to the marrow of my bones to find out that the struggle of that man was a second-to-second fight; with his terrifying habits of indulging and his extraordinary sensuality pitted against his rigid adherence to survival.\n\nHis fight was not sporadic. It was a most sustained, disciplined struggle to remain balanced. 'Walking on the edge of the abyss' meant the battle of a warrior enhanced to such a degree that every second counted. One single moment of weakness would have thrown the nagual Julian into that abyss.\n\nHowever, he kept his view, his emphasis, and his concern focused on what Florinda called the edge of the abyss, and the pressure eased. Whatever he was viewing was not as desperate as what he was viewing when his old habits began to take hold of him. It seemed to me that when I looked at the nagual Julian at those moments, I was recapitulating a different man; a man more peaceful, more detached, and more collected.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j8a01pw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshots 8-11:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Commentary on &amp;quot;The Fire from Within&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fire from Within as a book was another of the end results of the influence of Florinda Matus on my life.

For don Juan Matus, to recapitulate meant to relive and rearrange everything of one's life in one single sweep. He never bothered with the minutiae of elaborate variations of that ancient technique. Florinda, on the other hand, had an entirely different meticulousness. She spent months coaching me to enter into aspects of recapitulating that I am to this day at a loss to explain.\n\n\"It is the vastness of the warrior which you are experiencing,\" she explained. \"The techniques are there. Big deal.

Although Florinda was the closest person to the nagual Juan Matus, they were astoundingly different. One thing that they both shared was the emptiness of their persons. They were no longer people. Don Juan Matus did not exist as a person. But what existed instead of his person was a collection of stories, each of them apropos to the situation he was discussing; didactic stories and jokes that bore the mark of his sobriety and his frugality.\n\nFlorinda was the same. She had stories upon stories. But her stories were about people. They were like a high form of gossip, or gossip elevated, due to her impersonality, to inconceivable heights of effectiveness and enjoyment.\n\n\"I want you to examine one man who bears a tremendous resemblance to you,\" she said one day to me. \"I want you to recapitulate him as if you had known him all your life.

I call him 'the nagual who lost heaven.'\n\n\"The story is that the nagual Elias was reared by a Jesuit priest who taught him to read and write and to play the harpsichord. He taught him Latin. The nagual Elias could read the scriptures in Latin as fluently as any scholar could. His destiny was to be a priest, but he was an Indian, and Indians in those days did not fit into clerical hierarchies. They were too awesome-looking, too dark, too Indian. Priests were from the upper social classes; descendants of Spaniards, with white skin, blue eyes. They were handsome; presentable. The nagual Elias was a bear in comparison. But he struggled long, kindled by his mentor's promise that God would see that he was accepted into the priesthood.\n\n\"He was the sexton \\[\\* sexton- an officer of the church who is in charge of sacred objects\\] of the church where his mentor was the parish priest, and one day, an actual witch walked in. Her name was Amalia. They say that she was a wild card. Be that as it may, she ended up seducing the poor sexton, who fell so deeply, so hopelessly in love with Amalia that he ended up in the hut of a nagual man. In time, he became the nagual Elias, a figure to reckon with, cultured, well-read. It seemed that the niche of nagual was made for him.

He called them &amp;#39;inventions.&amp;#39; He had a whole collection of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want you to focus your recapitulation attention on those inventions,&amp;quot; Florinda commanded me. &amp;quot;I want you to end up sniffing them, and feeling them with your hands, although you have never seen them except through what I am telling you now. To do this focusing means to establish a point of reference, as in an algebraic equation in which something is calculated by playing on a third element. You&amp;#39;ll be able to see the nagual Juan Matus with infinite clarity, using someone else as a point of corroboration.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The corpus of the book The Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift is a review in depth of what don Juan had done to me while he was in the world. The views that I had of don Juan due to my new recapitulation skills- using the nagual Elias as a point of corroboration- were infinitely more intense than any views that I had of him while he was alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recapitulation views I was engaged in lacked the warmth of the living, but they had instead the precision and the accuracy of inanimate objects that one can examine to one&amp;#39;s hearts content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/110nw12/the_wheel_of_time_commentary_and_advanced_recap/j89zfph/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1676230656.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_110nw12", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j8abqxs", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1676235685.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j8a09nb", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "\"The Abstract\" is just another thing you'll notice, if you keep doing DRG.

My title had been Inner Silence.\n\nAt the time that I was working on the book, the views of the shamans of ancient Mexico had become extremely abstract for me. Florinda tried her best to deviate me from my absorption in the abstract. She attempted to redirect my attention to different aspects of old shamanistic techniques, or she tried to divert me by shocking me with her scandalous behavior. But nothing was sufficient to deviate me from my seemingly inexorable drive.\n\nThe Power of Silence is an intellectual review of the thoughts of the shamans of ancient Mexico in their most abstract guise. As I worked alone on the book, I was contaminated by the mood of those men; by their desire to know more in a quasi-rational way. Florinda explained that in the end, those shamans had become extremely cold and detached. Nothing warm existed for them anymore. They were set in their quest: Their coldness as men was an effort to match the coldness of infinity. They had succeeded in changing their human eyes to match the cold eyes of the unknown.\n\nI sensed this in myself, and tried desperately to turn the tide. I haven't succeeded yet. My thoughts have become more and more like the thoughts of those men at the end of their quest. It is not that I don't laugh. Quite the contrary, my life is an endless joy. But at the same time, it is an endless, merciless quest.\n\nInfinity will swallow me, and I want to be prepared for it. I don't want infinity to dissolve me into nothing because I hold human desires, warm affection, and attachments, no matter how vague. More than anything else in this world, I want to be like those men. I never knew them. The only shamans I knew were don Juan and his cohorts, and what they expressed was the furthest thing from the coldness that I intuit in those unknown men.\n\nDue to the influence that Florinda had on my life, I succeeded brilliantly in learning to focus my unwavering attention on the mood of people I never knew. But as I focused my recapitulation attention on the mood of those shamans, I got trapped by it without hope of ever extricating myself from their pull.\n\nFlorinda didn't believe in the finality of my state.

You might refuse his being.\n\n\"You'll see. The warrior has no limits. His sense of improvisation is so acute that he will make constructs out of nothing- not just mere empty constructs, but rather, something workable, and pragmatic.\n\n\"You'll see.

But it was suggested that it was post-worthy.\n\nA few days ago a member of Cleargreen's forum (source link withheld since it isn't an entirely public discussion group)  made a post about a Catholic Nun named  [Bernadette Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernadette_Roberts).\n\n[Bernadette Roberts](https://preview.redd.it/6qyqovyl5rz91.jpg?width=385&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ef4f65c9c7e7113b20f4f8206a3692678106afc)\n\nShe was an especially dedicated sister, who pushed her prayer and meditation so hard (for years) that she lost all sense of self...permanently (as I read it). She also experienced the voice of *seeing*, or an auditory version of The Eagle's (Maker's) command to take an inventory:\n\n\"Is anyone here familiar with the author Bernadette Roberts?...Her book, published in 1982, titled  *The Experience of No-Self,* has affected me so intensely, and it feels so relevant to this path, that I feel I must share my thoughts on it here.\n\nBernadette Roberts was a Catholic nun, who I suppose by chance, and as a part of her faith, was regularly and almost unintentionally practicing inner silence. And that inner silence overtook her at a certain point and she lost all sense of self which intensified and expanded to the point where it becomes pretty obvious to me that she experiences:\n\nTotal silence\n\nA complete loss of self-reflection\n\nSeeing (initially she describes it as seeing with 3D glasses, a place of viewing her surroundings from outside of her body from a point above the head)\n\nLosing the human form (seriously)\n\nThe voice of seeing (she calls it \u201cthe taskmaster\u201d)\n\nShe so beautifully describes these experiences in such great and descriptive detail, it\u2019s absolutely awe-inspiring. The funny thing, as well as seemingly her greatest challenge, was that this all happened to her without her having any frame of reference, nor, obviously, the infrastructure that the seers have given us. And so she is wandering around in confusion as she goes through each new level of deepening silence and loss of self-reflection. However she does manage and describes it all beautifully. Though she does reference Christianity here and there, the majority of it has little to do with Christianity at all.\n\nHere are a few examples from her book:\n\n'Because my mind could focus on nothing, nor hang on to anything knowable, it soon felt as if my brain was on fire or that some terrible pressure behind the eyes was forcing me to go blind; and this relentless pressure in my head was like a terrible taskmaster constantly commanding me to \"See! You MUST see! You CAN see! Look and see!\" It pounded away day after day, week after week, month after month until I knew I would never be released from this horrible condition, nor escape the terrible taskmaster unless I did, eventually, \"see.\" But see what? What was I supposed to be looking for? And how could I ever see when I no longer had eyes to see? Constantly before me there was only emptiness and nothingness.\n\nEventually it became clear that this Passageway was beyond despair, and even beyond insanity; for \"who\" is left to go insane or \"what\" remains to experience despair? If self had been alive, it would have gone mad on the spot; and if nothing else, I would have jumped at any chance to throw in the towel and back out. But our psychological notions of despair and anxiety are mere toys of self-defense compared to the burden-of-unknowing, against which there isn't a single defense; nor is there, for that matter, anything or anyone left to defend. To have had a self would have been most compensating, for self is man's compensation for a state of unknowing\u2014or so I was now convinced.\n\nNevertheless, the true mechanism of surviving the Passageway is not known to me. Self was dead, immovably silent. The taskmaster (merely a pressure on my brain) kept demanding that my mind be still and \"See!\"\n\nOne day I walked down and sat on the river's edge, watching the dead wood in its speedy descent to the sea. With neither reason nor provocation, a smile emerged on my face, and in the split second of recognition I \"saw\" \u2014 finally I saw, and knew I had seen. I knew: the smile itself, that which smiled, and that at which it smiled, were One \u2014 as indistinguishably one as a trinity without division. And what I saw was merely how this was so. There was no insight, no vision, no movement of anything, but a seeing that was as natural and spontaneous as a smile on a face \u2014 not another thing more. In my journal I called this \"the grin-of-recognition.\"\n\nWhat I learned was that the unknown object (of the smile) was identical with the subject, and not only that, but the smile itself was identical with these. And what is the smile? It is that which remains when there is no self. The smile is neither the unknown subject or object, yet it is identical with it. It is that aspect of the Unknown which is manifest. The implications of this seeing are tremendous and yet, they cannot be grasped by the mind.\n\nThe silent mind seems to be a mind that no longer has a self-reflecting type of consciousness, even though all other functions of the mind remain as usual. The reason self cannot come upon this silence by its own efforts is because this silence is what remains when all self-reflection or self-awareness comes to an end. This is why I had no knowledge of this type of silence prior to taking the journey, and only recognized it for what it was, at the very end. What I also discovered at the end, was how doing actually takes the place of thinking, and thus leaves the ordinary mind silent.\n\nBy the end of the Passageway I was certain my memory had been impaired for life. It was not a failure in recall however, but seemed more like time-lapses, as if whole chunks of time were missing from the ordinary flow of life.'\"\n\nResponses:\n\n\u2026\n\n\"This just reinforces the simple fact that there is nothing to learn or teach, we have everything we need.

Such as you just turn at the waist. Then the arm lifts but the waist movement is over. Then your hand twists when your arm is in position. But at any given moment, only a single muscle moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if your &amp;quot;robot battery&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t have enough juice to move all of your motors (muscles) at once.&amp;quot; (...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So I tried the &amp;quot;robotic version&amp;quot; of tensegrity, where somehow you isolate just the single muscle being used at the moment, and all others are completely inactive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s possible with all of the tensegrity movements, but it produced results beyond my ability to explain them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movement itself began to &amp;quot;present knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the length of that comment and if it&amp;#39;s not related at all with your latest reply here but i could not help asking taking the risk of falling into the attention seeker type but i confess that the borderline is still a little blurry for me.

One had risen it to calf height, but he was a subordinate to an older Nepalese monk, who was obviously just some guy involved in that scam.\n\nThe Nepalese even make fake videos suing their \"masters\" going stage magic, to get more recruits.\n\nPainfully contrived camera angles, a selected \"random audience\".\n\nOnly an idiot would sign up based on that.  And no one is learning to do what the \"master\" demonstrates.\n\nSame old shit.  Yogananda had that scam down with his book. Then also never taught anyone anything noteworthy.\n\nBut there was that monk, who had managed to rise his energy up.\n\nHe would have been important to his monk boss, dure to that level of energy, and thus he got to ride around on planes with him.\n\nThe other had either risen his energy all the way up, or he was a double being.\n\nI think the latter.\n\nI was observing people go by on the airport people mover conveyor belt. \n\ni could sit with my eyes closed so it looked like I was sleeping, and people just glided by, one after the other.\n\nSparsely, but it was cool to even be able to tell when a new one went by, with my eyes closed as they were.\n\nI wanted to see those \"worms\" in women.\n\nAnd one point, I saw a BLAST of intense golden light. So bright, I was certain the notoriously dangerous Thai police hand decided I needed looking into, and had shone a bright spotlight in my face.\n\nBut there was nothing there.  I looked to the right, and there was an older man in a saffron robe, finishing the journey down the ramp.\n\nSome monks, also in saffron robes, went to greet him when he reached the terminal. They surrounded him, and it was obvious he was their leader.\n\nThat doesn't mean he reached that state with delusional Buddhism.\n\nThat's just not possible.  And it's so obvious it only produces green line effects, that the only 2 Buddhists we've found on google, who have any magic at all, exhibit ONLY green line experiences.\n\nAnd both seem to have decided that's, \"enlightenment\".\n\nIngram has even become confused and believes his own misunderstandings f what he's experiencing, and is now trying to \"map out\" all sacred scroll \"higher states and activities\".\n\nIt's very obvious if you look at either mean's youtube feed, that they reached the green zone and stopped.

One had risen it to calf height, but he was a subordinate to an older Nepalese monk, who was obviously just some guy involved in that scam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Nepalese even make fake videos suing their &amp;quot;masters&amp;quot; going stage magic, to get more recruits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Painfully contrived camera angles, a selected &amp;quot;random audience&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only an idiot would sign up based on that.  And no one is learning to do what the &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; demonstrates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same old shit.  Yogananda had that scam down with his book. Then also never taught anyone anything noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there was that monk, who had managed to rise his energy up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would have been important to his monk boss, dure to that level of energy, and thus he got to ride around on planes with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other had either risen his energy all the way up, or he was a double being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the latter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was observing people go by on the airport people mover conveyor belt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i could sit with my eyes closed so it looked like I was sleeping, and people just glided by, one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sparsely, but it was cool to even be able to tell when a new one went by, with my eyes closed as they were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see those &amp;quot;worms&amp;quot; in women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one point, I saw a BLAST of intense golden light. So bright, I was certain the notoriously dangerous Thai police hand decided I needed looking into, and had shone a bright spotlight in my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there was nothing there.  I looked to the right, and there was an older man in a saffron robe, finishing the journey down the ramp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some monks, also in saffron robes, went to greet him when he reached the terminal. They surrounded him, and it was obvious he was their leader.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t mean he reached that state with delusional Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just not possible.  And it&amp;#39;s so obvious it only produces green line effects, that the only 2 Buddhists we&amp;#39;ve found on google, who have any magic at all, exhibit ONLY green line experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And both seem to have decided that&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ingram has even become confused and believes his own misunderstandings f what he&amp;#39;s experiencing, and is now trying to &amp;quot;map out&amp;quot; all sacred scroll &amp;quot;higher states and activities&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very obvious if you look at either mean&amp;#39;s youtube feed, that they reached the green zone and stopped. Thinking they were done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s none others out there to listen to, to try to understand why Buddhists are so sure they&amp;#39;re on a useful path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zero more...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this man, a buddhist official, and in fact either done someting significant onhis won, or he was a double bing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Tony.

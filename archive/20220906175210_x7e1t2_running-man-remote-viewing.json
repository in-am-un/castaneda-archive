I can't afford the time to write a different version for reddit.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nI have an ugly story to tell, which comes with a happy ending!\n\nAs Carlos became sicker from his cancer he still came to teach us, but once he had to sit down on the wooden floor at Dance Home. Around the same time he taught us these \"Running Man\" magical passes.\n\nSome of the gossip oriented private class people said, \"He's too ill to stand, so he's created these. He even has to wear socks to bed.\"\n\nHEY!!! I highly recommend socks when doing tensegrity! Try it. You'll like it. Especially on wooden floors.\n\nCarlos even had women doing these specific passes naked in a group, which contributed even more to the negative gossip. He told one \"women only\" class that the \"not-doings\" he designed were his last chance. He'd given up on the men, looking out at his private class and exclaiming, \"They're all masturbators!\"\n\nIn case you didn't know, the double is more likely to come out to help when a person is naked (embarrassed), or frightened.\n\nPlus Carlos was staging a huge blow up for after he was gone, which is part of \"the rule\". He even nagged Amy over and over to write that \"tell all\" book. To make sure there was a huge scandal after he left.\n\nTo give everyone a real \"choice\" to continue or go back to their normal lives. It's in second ring of power and Eagle's Gift if you want to look it up. A lineage always ends in disaster.\n\nSome poor bastard has to pick up the pieces later on.\n\nCarlos had run out of time and needed someone to understand what sorcery really is, and pick up at least a tiny bit of perceivable magic.\n\nSo he tried hard to get energetic momentum at the end. Perhaps he could even have healed himself, if enough had suddenly \"gotten it\".\n\nBut he got none, because mostly he only had groupies around him.\n\nGroupies are not what you want if you are trying to teach sorcery. If you're a grinning fraud college professor turned Yogi, trying to convince people you are \"enlightened\" because you look happier than they do, then groupies are what you want!\n\nThey'll make up stories about your amazing telepathic powers, usually involving them.\n\nThe Guru, using his amazing psychic powers, to know about that specific groupie. Which makes them special.\n\nThat's groupies! They make you look good, so they can look good to their friends! It's an excellent situation for crappy Asian pretend magic peddlers.\n\nBut the groupies will turn on you just as quickly as they will praise you.\n\nI even have my own groupies now! I have to beat them down with sticks.\n\nCarlos gave us these magical passes because they work! They work in amazing ways, especially if you like to \"remote view\". The point is, they produce lower body activity which simulates moving, while letting the upper body \"rest\" enough to produce sustained Silent Knowledge visions that are stable. Carlos even placed a \"resting period\" at the end, an \"official\" part of this movement. So you could feel the results.\n\nBut you can also SEE them!!! With a little help from darkness, and removal of that internal dialogue for at least 2 hours.\n\nYou'll have to learn to do that yourself to understand, but in darkroom practice (tensegrity in the dark while forcing silence), when the assemblage point moves to the front of the body and aligns with the second assemblage point, the one belonging to the energy body, remote viewing becomes easy.\n\nBy the way, you can learn to see that assemblage point... Don't think we make up stuff we read on a \"sacred scroll\". Those are all nonsense.\n\nWe do. Or we don't do. There's no theorizing.\n\nDon Juan recommended that we should learn to read text instead of viewing visions as the ancient Olmecs did.\n\nHe argued that Carlos wouldn't understand his visions right away, but being the \"readers\" that modern men are we could simply read text and have no confusion over how to interpret it.\n\nCarlos gave that recommendation to us in his \"Readers of Infinity\" publication.\n\nAnd yes, I suppose I'll have to learn that. I always did what Carlos told me to do, even when it was inconvenient. And it's paid off big time!\n\nSo I'll learn to read the text coming from infinity. Seen it 4 times at least by now, but I can't summon it on demand yet.\n\nIn the meantime, it's ok to have fun isn't it?\n\nBut what are those nasty inorganic beings doing in there?\n\nIf you feel that way, you won't be able to learn sorcery.

It &amp;quot;dreams a new version of you&amp;quot;, as you do those movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to think about this less like you want badly to get that brown belt at the KungFu studio, and need to learn enough moves for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried to trick us with that idea, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he didn&amp;#39;t live long enough for anyone to even reach green belt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t the best strategy, looking back with what we know now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_x7e1t2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/x7e1t2/running_man_remote_viewing/inluv1a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1662654349.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1662654349.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "inlnwcf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Sacateca", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_inlg7fo", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_2x2e0mp1", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I can't recall in which post or comment you mentioned magical passes designed by the nagual Elias and wondered if they were created when he was dancing in his very peculiar way and seeing even though if i recall correctly he could dance without moving at all so maybe what don Elias was doing as Sacateca was not tensegrity movements ?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_inlnwcf", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t recall in which post or comment you mentioned magical passes designed by the nagual Elias and wondered if they were created when he was dancing in his very peculiar way and seeing even though if i recall correctly he could dance without moving at all so maybe what don Elias was doing as Sacateca was not tensegrity movements ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_x7e1t2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/x7e1t2/running_man_remote_viewing/inlnwcf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1662651728.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1662651728.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "inlg7fo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1662648752.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_injmy1t", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Sacateca is obscure enough to be ok.\n\nThe worst types imply they're going to do something to harm you, if you don't let them say what they like.\n\nNot merely that they might break out into a deer dance.\n\nIsn't that what he did, dance?\n\nI used to think that was lame, but in fact you can travel from world to world by dancing.\n\nLiterally!

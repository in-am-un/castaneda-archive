Or if they didn't wake up, at least start to sleep walk and stumble around in the second attention so he could show them which way to go.\n\nBut the desire to write a book, become famous, find a spiritual mate, or get plenty of attention from famous people, was just too great.\n\nThe blue scout knew. She threatened to \"spin around\" and leave, if Carlos kept the classes going.\n\nAs the person who lives with Cholita, I can tell you that this kind of threat is only going to turn you into a worthy opponent. Make you all the more interesting to a sorcerer.\n\nSo Carlos kept the classes going, and even \"doubled down\". Some weeks we had as many as 3 of the Dance Home style meetings, at least twice in a large parking garage rumored to be associated with Bruce.\n\nAside from the criticism of the running man series, which turn out to be MAGIC SUPREME, Carlos got criticized for pushing Carol Tiggs onto stage to give magic demonstrations.\n\n\"That's what stage magicians do!\", was the most common complaint.\n\nExcept that when Carol leaned me back on the wooden floor of Dance Home, I fell 30 feet through the second story floor, through the floor of the bottom story, and into a tunnel obviously owned by inorganic beings.\n\nIt was cut so perfectly in the hard soil that I didn't even have time to be afraid.\n\nI tried to see the end of it, but it went so far that was impossible.\n\nSo what's the connection between the two? Between running man, and Carol Tigg's demonstration of what \"energy\" can do.\n\nThe \"happy ending\"!\n\nRunning man ends with a rest in the results of the passes. I suppose it's a lot like the resting period after doing yoga, where your assemblage point is flexible enough to move you down to the green line on the J curve.\n\nYou get to rest in \"bliss\" and if you are lucky, you have minor dreamlike visions.\n\nBut someone who's moved their assemblage point all the way along the J curve is not limited to weak green effects, as are Yogis, Buddhists, and Daoists.\n\nHeck! You can get those with shamanic drumming. Nothing to get excited about.\n\nSorcerers on the other hand have access to \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nThat's a good 6 times as far of a movement of the assemblage point, and something no other system can manage. They don't even know what's happening.\n\nWhen the assemblage point moves that far, \"reality\" is up for grabs. You are no longer limited to this one.\n\nIn silent knowledge if you think to \"rest\", then you might end up in the most restful place you can imagine.\n\nSuch as laying on a hill of flowers in heaven.\n\nI tried to find that Robin Williams movie scene, but all I found was the messy paint versions.\n\nI couldn't capture the beauty of the field of flowers and grass you can rest in, at the end of the Running Man Series.\n\nBut before that will happen, it's possible you need to experience the stream of water you are splashing around with your feet.\n\nIf you do the Running Man Tensegrity series laying down on a bed, in near perfect internal silence, the bed is likely to flood with several inches of pinkish water covering your legs. You can splash that around using the movements.\n\nI prefer to see the flow of that water as a stream on the floor of my darkroom. To do that I need to sit on the edge of the bed and lean back at an angle, using my arms to support myself on the edge of the bad, to simulate laying down with my feet in the water. My body dangles out to the floor at a 45 degree angle.\n\nYou can watch the pink water splash and ripple on the floor of your darkroom, with each foot movement.\n\nAnd if you look closely you'll realize it's the flow of a stream barely the thickness of cardboard, compared to the vast dark sea of awareness below it.\n\nEach splash of the second attention water creates a ripple in the Eagle's Emanations of that dark sea below you, potentially lighting up bundles never activated by man before.\n\nWhen you lay back to rest after having done the passes sitting on the edge of a bed, reality opens gently like a curtain so you can fall through, and land in the most restful phantom world you can imagine. Don't be surprised if you fall very far. You're changing realities.\n\nIn my case, since I have people to help, I got a \"Silent Knowledge Entity\" visitor who explained what I was looking at.\n\nA \"sales pitch\" if you like.\n\n\"This version has been designed to appeal to women. You fall through a crack in reality and land on the grass of a gentle hill, surrounded by fields of flowers and pinkish fog that smells heavenly. That's where you should rest, at the end of the running man passes. In a peaceful phantom reality of your choosing. It comes because the ripples disturbed the vast blackness below.\"\n\nYea...\n\nBut designed by whom???\n\nHere's your chance to \"get help\".  Don't blow it.\n\nNo one seriously trying to learn sorcery ever has to do it alone.\n\nBut there is one \"cost\" to the help.\n\nYou have to stop being a greedy, attention seeking bastard.\n\nThat's blue line phantom worlds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Running Man Series (How To Fall Through A Crack in Reality)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"a1t3kifjfka91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1t3kifjfka91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c19ee65e003966d0d381c419ae60723a88a81e"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1t3kifjfka91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580e0828bc2b4b0c0a5f65aa1cc77944bd07b520"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1t3kifjfka91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d3aff6357ce2d1545bd2595bbf6bd4fac15d0f"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1t3kifjfka91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541dc6ee77a8c9fb2a10b76276369481817dd638"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1t3kifjfka91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ab072021571dbe4bf0307b0f5658f5f77361b5a"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a1t3kifjfka91.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adcf2a0280fdac6edeb4e25aac8c5cd37168b586"}, "id": "a1t3kifjfka91"}}, "name": "t3_vv4umm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jCx5PmwpKtZheX0gdb6qu2C_xb8zTm4t7rxnblhA3g0.jpg", "edited": 1657384338.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657382568.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a1t3kifjfka91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=adcf2a0280fdac6edeb4e25aac8c5cd37168b586\"&gt;Yep.

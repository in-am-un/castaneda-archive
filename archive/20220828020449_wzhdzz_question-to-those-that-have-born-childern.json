Teachers don't matter, lineages don't matter, \"Nagual's\" don't matter.\n\nYou just need you practicing correctly, and something or someone will come along to help.\n\nBut in practice, \"unbending intent\" simply means you practice!!!  Nothing mysterious about it.\n\nYou don't let anything stand in the way. That's the \"unbending\" part.\n\nThe \"intent\" part is to be so crazy as to expect you can succeed at something everyone else will tell you is impossible.  You don't care, you'll do it anyway.\n\nAnd practice everyday, unless you want to lose most of your gains from days before.\n\nIt gets very entertaining.\n\nWithout naming names, I was trying to figure out how to teleport last night.\n\nI just got rid of cable TV, which it turns out only old people watch.\n\nI got a smart TV for $300, and netflix, disney+, and Youtube.\n\nI was flabbergasted!  So many programs I never saw. For half the price of cable.\n\nOne was \"Umbrella Academy\", where the teenager named \"#5\" can teleport short distances when battling someone.\n\nAnything like that you see on TV or in Movies, \"taints\" your awareness.\n\nIt's one reason I want to make animations. To take advantage of media.\n\nIf it's possible to do magic you see in a TV show, you might be \"gifted\" to see how by \"intent\".\n\nEspecially if you have an inorganic being assistant.\n\nI knew the technique last night, but could not find the teleport \"surface\". It's purple/red blotches with around 6 intense blue dots over it, but it's completely stable unlike other sights in darkroom.\n\nNot ethereal or temporary at all.   You just gaze into it and you end up in a new location.\n\nIt's a very pretty thing,  but I couldn't locate it.\n\nMy inorganic being \"Fancy\" showed up with her companion \"Bob\".  Right where the teleport had taken me before.   In that part of the room.\n\nOriginally when I found the \"surface\", she was also there with Bob clinging to her. On a  power spot she helped create, along with \"Fairy\", one of the allies Carlos let us.  Who's in Argentina now.\n\nFancy is impressive, and thus the name.  She probably attacked me as a tall scary cartoon style demon when I was 5 years old, and has been hanging around since.\n\nChildhood spirits likely never give up on a human they met. Even if they grow up and become old.\n\nBut instead of demon costumes to scare me, she now wears big 90's hair, prom dresses, and costumes like \"Little Red Riding Hood\" in a miniskirt.\n\nBob is her \"echo\". Inorganic beings often have one.\n\nFor Taisha and Florinda, it's Phoebus and Globus.\n\nFor Carlos, Little Smoke and Devil's weed.\n\nSo I was searching for a substance that can be used to skip 12 feet in space instantly, so I could cheat and get water from the table on the north wall without having to walk over there in the darkness.\n\n\"Practical magic\".\n\nAnd I saw Fancy with Bob clinging to her.\n\nWhen both show up, it's bound to be very fun.  Alone I suppose they don't have the energy to do the \"best\" stuff.\n\nBut as I glanced at Fancy waiting to see what she was going to do,  a little blue/green demon dog, or blobby creature near the shape of an overweight Corgi, fat but cute, ran across the wall I was leaning against.  He kept going through the solid bed, running just under it, and out the north wall of my darkroom.  Obviously wanting me to follow.  I could see him the whole time, but I could also feel the solid bed pressing against my legs.  No way I could follow him.  And if I ran around the bed to the north wall, that would no longer be invisible. I wouldn't be able to pass through it to chase him.\n\nI got the idea it was \"Globus\".  The ally from the witches.\n\nNo reason I should have thought that, except we've been searching for the Allies of the witches for a week or two now.\n\nI looked over to Fancy who seemed to be saying, \"Well, follow him you idiot.  I showed you how yesterday!\"\n\nBut I could not.  The solid matter bed was in the way.\n\nI can't pass through solid matter in my Tonal body (yet).\n\nThe next day I found out that some creature was trying to kidnap a witch I know.\n\nThat's the sort of fun you can have and it's all fully visible, and all \"kicks the ass\" of any prophet or guru written about in modern times.\n\nIt's real magic!\n\nNot \"close your eyes and grin so you look good for the cameras\" meditation nonsense.\n\nI add the \"kicks the ass\" part because there's so much fake Asian magic out there, confusing people into thinking nothing is supposed to happen and you're just supposed to keep meditating and giving donations for several lifetimes, before you have a right to any results.\n\nWe don't have that problem because our magic is ancient shamanism, from before money, cities, and scam artists like \"The Buddha\", \"Lao Tsu\", or Yogananda.\n\nOurs actually works because the people who discovered it, had no reason at all to make up things.  There was no one so stupid back before agriculture and cities, to fall for pretend magic the way we do now.\n\nAnd if it doesn't work, it's just because you didn't put in enough effort.\n\nStarts out hard, gets easy.", "edited": 1661708941.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_im5hcz9", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never worry about what you&amp;#39;re lacking if you want to learn sorcery.

To take advantage of media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s possible to do magic you see in a TV show, you might be &amp;quot;gifted&amp;quot; to see how by &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially if you have an inorganic being assistant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew the technique last night, but could not find the teleport &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s purple/red blotches with around 6 intense blue dots over it, but it&amp;#39;s completely stable unlike other sights in darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not ethereal or temporary at all.   You just gaze into it and you end up in a new location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very pretty thing,  but I couldn&amp;#39;t locate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My inorganic being &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; showed up with her companion &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;.  Right where the teleport had taken me before.   In that part of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originally when I found the &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot;, she was also there with Bob clinging to her. On a  power spot she helped create, along with &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot;, one of the allies Carlos let us.  Who&amp;#39;s in Argentina now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy is impressive, and thus the name.  She probably attacked me as a tall scary cartoon style demon when I was 5 years old, and has been hanging around since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Childhood spirits likely never give up on a human they met. Even if they grow up and become old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead of demon costumes to scare me, she now wears big 90&amp;#39;s hair, prom dresses, and costumes like &amp;quot;Little Red Riding Hood&amp;quot; in a miniskirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bob is her &amp;quot;echo&amp;quot;. Inorganic beings often have one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Taisha and Florinda, it&amp;#39;s Phoebus and Globus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Carlos, Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was searching for a substance that can be used to skip 12 feet in space instantly, so I could cheat and get water from the table on the north wall without having to walk over there in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Practical magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I saw Fancy with Bob clinging to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When both show up, it&amp;#39;s bound to be very fun.  Alone I suppose they don&amp;#39;t have the energy to do the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I glanced at Fancy waiting to see what she was going to do,  a little blue/green demon dog, or blobby creature near the shape of an overweight Corgi, fat but cute, ran across the wall I was leaning against.  He kept going through the solid bed, running just under it, and out the north wall of my darkroom.  Obviously wanting me to follow.  I could see him the whole time, but I could also feel the solid bed pressing against my legs.  No way I could follow him.  And if I ran around the bed to the north wall, that would no longer be invisible. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to pass through it to chase him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the idea it was &amp;quot;Globus&amp;quot;.  The ally from the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No reason I should have thought that, except we&amp;#39;ve been searching for the Allies of the witches for a week or two now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked over to Fancy who seemed to be saying, &amp;quot;Well, follow him you idiot.  I showed you how yesterday!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I could not.  The solid matter bed was in the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t pass through solid matter in my Tonal body (yet).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I found out that some creature was trying to kidnap a witch I know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the sort of fun you can have and it&amp;#39;s all fully visible, and all &amp;quot;kicks the ass&amp;quot; of any prophet or guru written about in modern times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s real magic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not &amp;quot;close your eyes and grin so you look good for the cameras&amp;quot; meditation nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I add the &amp;quot;kicks the ass&amp;quot; part because there&amp;#39;s so much fake Asian magic out there, confusing people into thinking nothing is supposed to happen and you&amp;#39;re just supposed to keep meditating and giving donations for several lifetimes, before you have a right to any results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have that problem because our magic is ancient shamanism, from before money, cities, and scam artists like &amp;quot;The Buddha&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lao Tsu&amp;quot;, or Yogananda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ours actually works because the people who discovered it, had no reason at all to make up things.  There was no one so stupid back before agriculture and cities, to fall for pretend magic the way we do now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if it doesn&amp;#39;t work, it&amp;#39;s just because you didn&amp;#39;t put in enough effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starts out hard, gets easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_wzhdzz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wzhdzz/question_to_those_that_have_born_childern/im5hcz9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1661707971.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1661707971.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "im4yrjb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "pennyjaneisinmybrain", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1661700427.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_im4l979", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_7u6lm6tn", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thanks, i think you just gave me a very good idea of where to start!

And lots of \"bumps\".\n\nBut you can find out for yourself!\n\nJust try the type of dreaming women do, and see if you can sneak into the second attention!\n\nIn a week you could answer this yourself if you tried hard.\n\nAsk the women about it. I never paid attention to how it's done.  But there are some very talented female dreamers in here.\n\nI've seen inorganic beings run back and forth to some,  beckoning me to follow.  With me being unable to pass through solid matter as needed to keep up with them.\n\nAnd some of our witches have come to visit me in my dark room.  One even accidentally lent me her Ally for a few months.\n\nAs far as the medical questions, I suppose there's reason to believe our \"energetic situation\" greatly affects our health.\n\nCarlos died from too many students.  He made the clear over and over, as he was dying.\n\nPeople just ignored it!  Then later accused him of \"going bad\", so they could steal from the community and pretend to be a replacement.\n\nFelix even tried that nonsense!  I hope he's given up on that ambition now.\n\nBut a few nights ago in Silent Knowledge, where everything that can be known to man is available if you can just \"find it\", I got an explanation for why Carlos was always ill.\n\nHe was ill throughout the books, and it even mentions that.\n\nLong before he had \"cancer\".\n\nThat's how he came to be associated with Howard Lee, who was a healer besides being a martial artist.\n\nIt's why La Gorda called him, \"The Nagual who got sick\".  I never noticed that in the books before, but it's there in Second Ring, or Eagle's Gift.\n\nSo I have the answer for why Carlos had health problems.\n\nAnd it's not what you suggest, or worry about.\n\nBut darned if I can remember it.\n\nThat's the problem with sorcery.\n\nDeep in the second attention, where you are mostly in your dreaming double, there's no \"connection\" to events that happen, meaning to your \"brain\" back in your physical body.\n\nNo way to search out those memories later on!\n\nAll you can do most of the time is bring back the \"conclusion\".\n\nSo I saw why Carlos was ill so often, some info indicating it might not be quite accurate, and then after understanding it all for 5 seconds, I had an opinion on what I ought to \"conclude\".\n\nThat I have.\n\nIt's nothing that likely applies to us.\n\nAnd about practicing sorcery making you ill, it can certainly make you afraid.\n\nAnd uncomfortable. It's not \"cozy\" at all.\n\nAnd that fear or worry can keep festering, unless you face it each time and ignore it.\n\nFocus on the amazing magic, you get nowhere else, and just figure the other stuff will pass. Which it does.\n\nSorcery won't make you Superman, as bad Castaneda fans imagine.\n\nBut it can give you insight into what's going on in your body.\n\nSo that you use the power of \"unbending intent\" to fix it.\n\nUnbending intent includes new routines designed to \"fix\" some health concern.\n\nYou have the patience of a sorcerer and \"fix them\" a tiny bit at a time.  Using \"Sustained Action\".\n\nI can't leap over the block walls at work.  When younger I could grab the top, even if it was 6 feet up, and pull up to sit on it and then jump over.\n\nI noticed a month ago, that was completely impossible for me now at my age.\n\nThe huge Japanese business next door had dug up their parking lot to build something, which had removed all the plants and decorations around it, and a large population of lizards who liked to sun on that block wall, became homeless due to lack of nearby food.\n\nA few hung on instead of finding a new area to populate, and I became curious how many plants were left from their tractors and bulldozers.\n\nBut I couldn't look over the wall the way I could have 40 years ago.\n\nSo each time I walk by, I jump and pull myself up as far as I can, just twice, and over months I'll eventually be able to leap up on a 6 foot high block wall again.\n\nSorcery gives you patience to repair long term problems.\n\nIt's probably why the sorcerers in don Juan's lineage seemed to be so fit.\n\nThey did what was needed to remain that way.\n\nLet me go a step further here, about the \"missing womb\".\n\nHalf of your total awareness has been trapped in the physical body all of your life.\n\nThe remainder is the energy body, which floats all around you and is visible in darkness.\n\nThat energy \"copies\" our physical body in dreaming.\n\nIt's \"learned that pattern\".\n\nDoesn't have to use it, but it does.\n\nSo your tonal awareness got used to a \"womb\".\n\nAnd so did your double.\n\nIf it's removed, the \"intent of a storage for dark energy\" still remains.\n\nSo maybe, you have an advantage. Not a disadvantage.\n\nYou have a \"second attention womb\".  \n\nWho's to say that's not even better?\n\nFind out for us!", "edited": 1661874026.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_imec6d6", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t matter, according to the witches Taisha and Florinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if you can find that in lecture notes, but I heard them say so in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know the details of why it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, but I can tell you that the way our physical body looks, is NOT the way the double sees it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He perceives that tentacle body thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those come in &amp;quot;different types&amp;quot;, with those of women being different from those of men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s possible that the &amp;quot;dark energy storage&amp;quot; is actually in that alternate body realm, where we look like a starving yellowish octopus with far too many fibrous legs.  And lots of &amp;quot;bumps&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can find out for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just try the type of dreaming women do, and see if you can sneak into the second attention!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a week you could answer this yourself if you tried hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask the women about it. I never paid attention to how it&amp;#39;s done.  But there are some very talented female dreamers in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen inorganic beings run back and forth to some,  beckoning me to follow.  With me being unable to pass through solid matter as needed to keep up with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some of our witches have come to visit me in my dark room.  One even accidentally lent me her Ally for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as the medical questions, I suppose there&amp;#39;s reason to believe our &amp;quot;energetic situation&amp;quot; greatly affects our health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos died from too many students.  He made the clear over and over, as he was dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People just ignored it!  Then later accused him of &amp;quot;going bad&amp;quot;, so they could steal from the community and pretend to be a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Felix even tried that nonsense!  I hope he&amp;#39;s given up on that ambition now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a few nights ago in Silent Knowledge, where everything that can be known to man is available if you can just &amp;quot;find it&amp;quot;, I got an explanation for why Carlos was always ill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was ill throughout the books, and it even mentions that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long before he had &amp;quot;cancer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how he came to be associated with Howard Lee, who was a healer besides being a martial artist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why La Gorda called him, &amp;quot;The Nagual who got sick&amp;quot;.  I never noticed that in the books before, but it&amp;#39;s there in Second Ring, or Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I have the answer for why Carlos had health problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not what you suggest, or worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But darned if I can remember it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the problem with sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deep in the second attention, where you are mostly in your dreaming double, there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;connection&amp;quot; to events that happen, meaning to your &amp;quot;brain&amp;quot; back in your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No way to search out those memories later on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you can do most of the time is bring back the &amp;quot;conclusion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I saw why Carlos was ill so often, some info indicating it might not be quite accurate, and then after understanding it all for 5 seconds, I had an opinion on what I ought to &amp;quot;conclude&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s nothing that likely applies to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And about practicing sorcery making you ill, it can certainly make you afraid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And uncomfortable. It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that fear or worry can keep festering, unless you face it each time and ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Focus on the amazing magic, you get nowhere else, and just figure the other stuff will pass. Which it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery won&amp;#39;t make you Superman, as bad Castaneda fans imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it can give you insight into what&amp;#39;s going on in your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you use the power of &amp;quot;unbending intent&amp;quot; to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unbending intent includes new routines designed to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; some health concern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have the patience of a sorcerer and &amp;quot;fix them&amp;quot; a tiny bit at a time.  Using &amp;quot;Sustained Action&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t leap over the block walls at work.

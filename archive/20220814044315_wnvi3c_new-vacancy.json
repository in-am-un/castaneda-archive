To your left, the grand canyon.\n\nTo the right, the moon.\n\nHe can do that!\n\nBut if you can get him to remain stable during darkroom so you can compare what \"his eyes\" see, to what your tonal's eyes see, you can learn to \"feel\" his view.\n\nNormally for a beginner the two \"merge\" so that as you gaze at the puffs and they get more intense, you don't realize that you've borrowed the double's eye sight.\n\nIt's why we scoop the puffs onto the pouches on the torso.\n\nTo \"turbo charge\" our awareness with his.\n\nOurs might look yellow to white if you learn to see it.\n\nHis looks purple or blue.\n\nBut you can see either of those in other colors.  We don't have enough who can see them yet, to make rules about the colors.\n\nHis purple awareness can stick to our yellow awareness.\n\nThey're blobs of \"you\"!  So if the tonal awareness isn't fussing and grieving and worrying, then the awareness of the double won't flee from it. Run to the outside of the room.\n\nYou scoop it to the middle and eventually you'll see it stick.\n\nBut now, if you want to separate yourself from him but keep both present, you need to see the next level.\n\nNot the \"puff body\". That's the puffs stuck to your torso.\n\nThe ones you used tensegrity to move.\n\nThose can come lose and swarm, and that's still a \"puff body\".\n\nThey can even form a ball around you.\n\nBut the Affection for the Energy Body Pass, \"forms\" the double, in front of you.\n\nIf you do that more and more, until you can even step inside that body at the end (stand close to the bed or even lean a leg on it when you try that so you don't fall over when you switch bodies),   you learn to \"separate the two\".\n\nThen you'll be better able to perceive the tentacle body.\n\nThe double's vision is needed to see that.\n\nIn that state sit up on the bed on pillows and look left, then right.  Look for sparkles.\n\nIt's the left energy, and the right energy.\n\nIf you don't see endless \"sparkles\" and line fragments, you're out of luck. Go back to tensegrity and puffery.\n\nBut if the air is filled to the brink with tiny things to see, will you see a difference between the left, and the right?\n\nProbably not, but if you gaze in perfect silence and then \"drop rationality\" as best you can (don't get excited or expect anything), you'll start to notice the \"fragments\" of the double's vision.\n\nTrying to see the \"difference\" between your energy on the left, and the right, is largely a trick just to get you to look more discerningly.  That can result in his dream taking better form.\n\nHis vision is almost like you took a nice poster picture of a room or a forest, and then ripped it into 2 inch square pieces, and tossed them into an antigravity environment.\n\nAll the little pieces of the picture automatically face towards you in the proper order, giving the illusion of a scene in your darkroom.  Your scene is there, but if you punched you fist through it, you'd disturb it temporarily.\n\nIt's a full on dream, don't be fooled.  It even comes with audio at times.  I had a crying baby two days ago.\n\nNow is where you can play with it a little, to learn the nature of the double's vision.\n\nIf you identify one of those picture pieces floating in the air, as distinct from the rest of it, it will \"sparkle\".   A corner of the 2x2 piece of picture paper, will sparkle.\n\nJust a tiny golden sparkle, like a tiny fireworks burst.  Because you focused your tonal awareness on it.\n\nYou can literally gaze around them and make them sparkle one after the other, like they were all \"echoing\" your awareness.\n\nIt's a little more complicated than that, because each piece can not only have audio, but it comes with \"knowledge\" of the context of the dream.\n\nSo if you gain the ability to find the double's dream in your darkroom, and hopefully you figure out how to confine it to only one half, you will find the \"context\" of his dream, amidst all the fragments floating in the air.\n\nThere's what blocks us from learning to do this on our own.\n\nWhy an outside entity is needed, to point sorcery out to people.\n\nCarlos was our Nagual, that's their job.  Without the Nagual, there is no game.\n\nBut you don't need him in person.  Just his \"pointing things out\".\n\nAn analogy:  Sorcery is like a vast haunted antique mall.\n\nInside it are ghosts with \"memory removing spray\".\n\nLike Batman had in the original TV series.  He could spray you, and you didn't remember the last few minutes.\n\nThat happens at higher levels of gazing into the double's vision.  Each time you \"know the context\" of the dream,  it seems to you like you ARE living that dream, you lose the lucidity of the Tonal, and when you come back from it, it seems as if you just messed up and started your internal dialogue again.\n\nSo never ignore \"weird memories\" or \"flashes of a dream that couldn't have happened\".\n\nThose are the ghost in the haunted antique mall, spraying you in the head so you'll forget you were just roaming around in the mall.\n\nAnd go home.", "edited": 1660487670.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ik98uxo", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You forgot to mention that the vacancy comes with a roommate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one will mind their own double as a roommate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point you can realize, the double&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;vision&amp;quot; is fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like the tonal&amp;#39;s vision, which is tied to a single set of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double &amp;quot;has eyes all over&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He can even split locations!

That&amp;#39;s the puffs stuck to your torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ones you used tensegrity to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those can come lose and swarm, and that&amp;#39;s still a &amp;quot;puff body&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can even form a ball around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Affection for the Energy Body Pass, &amp;quot;forms&amp;quot; the double, in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do that more and more, until you can even step inside that body at the end (stand close to the bed or even lean a leg on it when you try that so you don&amp;#39;t fall over when you switch bodies),   you learn to &amp;quot;separate the two&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you&amp;#39;ll be better able to perceive the tentacle body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double&amp;#39;s vision is needed to see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that state sit up on the bed on pillows and look left, then right.  Look for sparkles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the left energy, and the right energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t see endless &amp;quot;sparkles&amp;quot; and line fragments, you&amp;#39;re out of luck. Go back to tensegrity and puffery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if the air is filled to the brink with tiny things to see, will you see a difference between the left, and the right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably not, but if you gaze in perfect silence and then &amp;quot;drop rationality&amp;quot; as best you can (don&amp;#39;t get excited or expect anything), you&amp;#39;ll start to notice the &amp;quot;fragments&amp;quot; of the double&amp;#39;s vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to see the &amp;quot;difference&amp;quot; between your energy on the left, and the right, is largely a trick just to get you to look more discerningly.  That can result in his dream taking better form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His vision is almost like you took a nice poster picture of a room or a forest, and then ripped it into 2 inch square pieces, and tossed them into an antigravity environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the little pieces of the picture automatically face towards you in the proper order, giving the illusion of a scene in your darkroom.  Your scene is there, but if you punched you fist through it, you&amp;#39;d disturb it temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a full on dream, don&amp;#39;t be fooled.  It even comes with audio at times.  I had a crying baby two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now is where you can play with it a little, to learn the nature of the double&amp;#39;s vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you identify one of those picture pieces floating in the air, as distinct from the rest of it, it will &amp;quot;sparkle&amp;quot;.   A corner of the 2x2 piece of picture paper, will sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a tiny golden sparkle, like a tiny fireworks burst.  Because you focused your tonal awareness on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally gaze around them and make them sparkle one after the other, like they were all &amp;quot;echoing&amp;quot; your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a little more complicated than that, because each piece can not only have audio, but it comes with &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; of the context of the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you gain the ability to find the double&amp;#39;s dream in your darkroom, and hopefully you figure out how to confine it to only one half, you will find the &amp;quot;context&amp;quot; of his dream, amidst all the fragments floating in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s what blocks us from learning to do this on our own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why an outside entity is needed, to point sorcery out to people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was our Nagual, that&amp;#39;s their job.  Without the Nagual, there is no game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t need him in person.  Just his &amp;quot;pointing things out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An analogy:  Sorcery is like a vast haunted antique mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside it are ghosts with &amp;quot;memory removing spray&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Batman had in the original TV series.  He could spray you, and you didn&amp;#39;t remember the last few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That happens at higher levels of gazing into the double&amp;#39;s vision.  Each time you &amp;quot;know the context&amp;quot; of the dream,  it seems to you like you ARE living that dream, you lose the lucidity of the Tonal, and when you come back from it, it seems as if you just messed up and started your internal dialogue again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So never ignore &amp;quot;weird memories&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;flashes of a dream that couldn&amp;#39;t have happened&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the ghost in the haunted antique mall, spraying you in the head so you&amp;#39;ll forget you were just roaming around in the mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And go home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wnvi3c/new_vacancy/ik98uxo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660487223.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wnvi3c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ik85kkw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660460263.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ik7uj3g", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "We've read the books, where the lineages had a lot of secret teaching going on.\n\nBut we aren't like that.\n\nYou read around, but did you follow any of the advice we give?\n\nDid you find the puffs, and scooped them in your abdomen?\n\nDid you find IOBs between the dreaming objects that become visible in the red zone?\n\nMaybe you were expecting that we could give you a power demostration.\n\nThat's up to you.\n\nI put in that comment, we are not the ones who hire!\n\nWe just can help you to fix your CV.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ik85kkw", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve read the books, where the lineages had a lot of secret teaching going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we aren&amp;#39;t like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You read around, but did you follow any of the advice we give?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you find the puffs, and scooped them in your abdomen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you find IOBs between the dreaming objects that become visible in the red zone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you were expecting that we could give you a power demostration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put in that comment, we are not the ones who hire!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just can help you to fix your CV.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_wnvi3c", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wnvi3c/new_vacancy/ik85kkw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660460263.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ik7uj3g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "DisastrousPepper7985", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660452514.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wnvi3c", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_7c3npldv", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I'm slightly surprised to see an attempt to find interested parties.

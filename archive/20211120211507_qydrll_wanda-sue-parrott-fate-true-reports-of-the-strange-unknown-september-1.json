over.  He can be anything.\n\nYou don't notice that, which is what makes it so cool.   There's no \"transition\".\n\nAnd you can go out of your home in the new form, with nothing weird going on.  You just shapeshift, and leave your home.\n\nLet me redefine shapeshifting:  \"Directed waking dreaming utilizing horizontal shifts of the assemblage point\".\n\nSee.  It's actually quite \"scientific\".\n\nI'll let someone else come up with an acronym...\n\nFeels perfectly normal, your feet can get cold, hurt by sharp stones, and if you touch wet grass, your hand gets wet, and stays wet the appropriate amount of time.\n\nBut the world is strangely empty.  No one's around.\n\nI believe another way to look at it is, the double has available 10,000 slightly \"wrong\" copies of reality at any level of the assemblage point.\n\nCarlos gave us a number on this, but didn't like doing it, so he wasn't quite \"straight forward\".  But I heard the 10,000 at some point.\n\nIf no one else is sharing that copy, there aren't any people in there.\n\nGood thing too!  If you shapeshifted into an empty world and a man walked up to say hello, you'd nearly drop dead from a heart attack. In shapeshifted form, that might get ugly.\n\nBy the way, probably women shapeshift during their period, but it's at the blue line so it only manifests as moods.\n\nGreen line shapeshifting is likely possible.\n\nAnd orange zone shapeshifting is  the rule.  You're simply \"seeing\" at that point, and no one would think to call it shapeshifting once you can *see*.\n\nThe \"empty world\" effect is somehow like Carlos and La Gorda on the bridge, where everyone stopped crossing the bridge while they were engaged in weirdness.\n\nAnd like the \"flying\" technique where La Gorda carried Carlos into the air (after peeing in her hands and flicking it up), and it seemed real.\n\nExcept when they landed he found he had fallen onto  the ground without remembering that.\n\nI've gotten the finger wiggling to switch me over a few times, and I always fall to the ground.\n\nWhen Carlos \"folded in half\", he fell to the ground also.\n\nAnd  they practiced in little cribs.  For protection when you switch to the double and your tonal body goes limp?\n\nShapeshifting is book deal obsessed in our culture.\n\nIt's how you \"punish\" those who doubt you. It's delusional, but the feeling is, \"Oh yea!  With sorcery, you can shapeshift into a crow, so there!!!\"\n\nBest if people who can't get to the red zone, don't think about it much.\n\nIt's like Buddhist magical wonders.  They use claims of those to sell stuff, and steal money from lazy people.\n\nSame as \"shamans\" do with shapeshifting I suspect!\n\nBut the truth is it's really not a big deal.\n\nSeemed to be a  household thing in the Olmec culture, if you google Olmec werejaguar figurines.\n\nShape shifting can cause harm.  You start to make yourself a new \"blue zone\" down at the bottom. A place where you have too many emanations trapped, the same way recapitulation is designed to free you from blue zone trapped emanation.\n\nIt was hard enough to escape the one at the top, but escaping a new one you built in the red zone, is going to be even harder.\n\nIt's like trying leaving a Harim, so you can go back to hunting women in bars.\n\nVery hard call, that would be.\n\nHow to shapeshift (the only method I've tried myself more than once):\n\nIn the deep red zone, grab a brilliant puff.\n\nIt should be so ample, it fills a space between your hands at least a full foot wide.\n\nA nice big AMPLE, squishy puff.\n\nWait...  Got carried away by that Harim thing.  Sorry.\n\nSmash it down a bit (in the darkroom, not in a Harim) until it's only 4 inches tall, and is wider.\n\nGrab each end.\n\nIf should be seeing intense jet black swirling all around the puff. Amazing actually!\n\nIf not, shame on you... Why are you pretending your magic?  Go back to where you are in darkroom process, and don't try to skip ahead so you can get out of forcing silence!\n\nStretch the flattened \"puff\" out to around 2 or 3 feet long, horizontally, or whatever is comfortable for bending it around your torso at the level of the lower 2 pouches.\n\nPull it out, so that your hands are gripping each side, and when it stretches it flattens out so that the flat part is facing your stomach.\n\nSo that it can bend properly when placed against your torso, as the hands move around the side of the torso, following the half circle curve.\n\nIt should now be curved too, an impression of your torso.\n\nBut more importantly, it was stuck on top of  the energy you stored in the pouches, with is heavily \"double\" connected.\n\nIn fact, that IS the double.  At some point.\n\nNow stretch the puff into a \"road\" around stomach height. Stretch that across your room as far as you can.\n\nIf your arms can't stretch to 10 feet long, you'll have to \"smooth it\" with your palm.  But again, shame on you.  If your arms don't stretch, it was dubious for you to try this.\n\nA foot is enough so you don't have to feel shame, but you should be able to stretch it to the entire width of your room, at a diagonal.\n\n(Also shapeshifting, so if you stretched an arm in darkroom, you can now officially say you have shapeshifted!)\n\nUse the diagonal in  the room (corner to corner) to get more \"resolution\" when you use it for shapeshifting. If you can.\n\nDon't worry about walking along the road, and bumping into your bed.\n\nIt'll be gone by the time you can do that.\n\nThat's part of the coolness!  At no point do you \"fall asleep\" or in any way seem to be doing anything other than  you were, when you started.\n\nYou could walk right over to the light switch, and end it all on the spot.\n\nThe road is the range of shapeshifting available to you.  As if someone had buried little boxes in the dirt along the road, right in the middle.  \n\nUse your hand to dig down into it. It's a dirt road.  If you got an asphalt one, you're on your own.  Just feel around in here.  You don't know how to turn into something specific, because that takes an \"usher\" to show you.\n\nNow, go exploring on the far right. Wait...\n\nGo to the left first, then the right.\n\nKylie said the left energy was more useful to the old seers. So you need to soak up a little.\n\nBut we don't want you turning into an insect, so when the time comes go to the far right.\n\nYou'll also be so strong and massive over there, you'll have no risk of getting smashed like a mosquito.\n\nAt every point along that road you'll be shapeshifting, so it's not like you're going to \"transform\". That would take focusing your attention on the specific animal you want to become.\n\nWe don't know how to do that.  Maybe never will.  The death defier taught that to the lineage, but we didn't get the instruction.\n\nDepending on which direction you \"play\" on that road, you'll pick up attributes.\n\nIf you went far right, you'll likely turn into one of these:\n\n[https://www.art-prints-on-demand.com/a/dore/educationofgargantuaillus.html](https://www.art-prints-on-demand.com/a/dore/educationofgargantuaillus.html)\n\nIt's just a huge human with super strength, and who knows what other attributes.\n\nTurns out to be consistent with the lecture Carlos gave on the J curve.\n\nBut what use if no one else can see you?\n\nThey can, but they have to be shifted enough to see inorganic beings and the double.\n\nOtherwise, we block that stuff out so well, it doesn't even seem to exist.\n\nBut as I pointed out, this topic is heavily tainted with book deal greed.\n\nSo if anyone insists on turning into a skunk and scaring their best friend, it is possible to get someone else to see it.\n\nFright, embarrassment, or any other thing that can shift their assemblage point down a bit, would do the trick.\n\nHow is all over the books.  One time don Juan told Carlos his fly was open, to embarrass him enough to loosen it, and then since he wanted him all the way in HA, he tapped him on the back repeatedly.\n\nBut just telling his dick was hanging out with an erection, moved his assemblage point enough, that he might have been \"skunk enabled\".", "edited": 1637510880.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hlipr2i", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shapeshifting is inevitable with darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not really a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems as if it&amp;#39;s more about the double taking over.

You&amp;#39;re simply &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; at that point, and no one would think to call it shapeshifting once you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;empty world&amp;quot; effect is somehow like Carlos and La Gorda on the bridge, where everyone stopped crossing the bridge while they were engaged in weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And like the &amp;quot;flying&amp;quot; technique where La Gorda carried Carlos into the air (after peeing in her hands and flicking it up), and it seemed real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except when they landed he found he had fallen onto  the ground without remembering that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gotten the finger wiggling to switch me over a few times, and I always fall to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Carlos &amp;quot;folded in half&amp;quot;, he fell to the ground also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  they practiced in little cribs.  For protection when you switch to the double and your tonal body goes limp?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shapeshifting is book deal obsessed in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how you &amp;quot;punish&amp;quot; those who doubt you. It&amp;#39;s delusional, but the feeling is, &amp;quot;Oh yea!  With sorcery, you can shapeshift into a crow, so there!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best if people who can&amp;#39;t get to the red zone, don&amp;#39;t think about it much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like Buddhist magical wonders.  They use claims of those to sell stuff, and steal money from lazy people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as &amp;quot;shamans&amp;quot; do with shapeshifting I suspect!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is it&amp;#39;s really not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seemed to be a  household thing in the Olmec culture, if you google Olmec werejaguar figurines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shape shifting can cause harm.  You start to make yourself a new &amp;quot;blue zone&amp;quot; down at the bottom. A place where you have too many emanations trapped, the same way recapitulation is designed to free you from blue zone trapped emanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was hard enough to escape the one at the top, but escaping a new one you built in the red zone, is going to be even harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like trying leaving a Harim, so you can go back to hunting women in bars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very hard call, that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to shapeshift (the only method I&amp;#39;ve tried myself more than once):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the deep red zone, grab a brilliant puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It should be so ample, it fills a space between your hands at least a full foot wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A nice big AMPLE, squishy puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait...  Got carried away by that Harim thing.  Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smash it down a bit (in the darkroom, not in a Harim) until it&amp;#39;s only 4 inches tall, and is wider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grab each end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If should be seeing intense jet black swirling all around the puff. Amazing actually!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, shame on you... Why are you pretending your magic?  Go back to where you are in darkroom process, and don&amp;#39;t try to skip ahead so you can get out of forcing silence!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stretch the flattened &amp;quot;puff&amp;quot; out to around 2 or 3 feet long, horizontally, or whatever is comfortable for bending it around your torso at the level of the lower 2 pouches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pull it out, so that your hands are gripping each side, and when it stretches it flattens out so that the flat part is facing your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that it can bend properly when placed against your torso, as the hands move around the side of the torso, following the half circle curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It should now be curved too, an impression of your torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, it was stuck on top of  the energy you stored in the pouches, with is heavily &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; connected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, that IS the double.  At some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now stretch the puff into a &amp;quot;road&amp;quot; around stomach height. Stretch that across your room as far as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your arms can&amp;#39;t stretch to 10 feet long, you&amp;#39;ll have to &amp;quot;smooth it&amp;quot; with your palm.  But again, shame on you.  If your arms don&amp;#39;t stretch, it was dubious for you to try this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A foot is enough so you don&amp;#39;t have to feel shame, but you should be able to stretch it to the entire width of your room, at a diagonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Also shapeshifting, so if you stretched an arm in darkroom, you can now officially say you have shapeshifted!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use the diagonal in  the room (corner to corner) to get more &amp;quot;resolution&amp;quot; when you use it for shapeshifting. If you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry about walking along the road, and bumping into your bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll be gone by the time you can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s part of the coolness!  At no point do you &amp;quot;fall asleep&amp;quot; or in any way seem to be doing anything other than  you were, when you started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could walk right over to the light switch, and end it all on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The road is the range of shapeshifting available to you.  As if someone had buried little boxes in the dirt along the road, right in the middle.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use your hand to dig down into it. It&amp;#39;s a dirt road.  If you got an asphalt one, you&amp;#39;re on your own.  Just feel around in here.  You don&amp;#39;t know how to turn into something specific, because that takes an &amp;quot;usher&amp;quot; to show you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, go exploring on the far right. Wait...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to the left first, then the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kylie said the left energy was more useful to the old seers. So you need to soak up a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t want you turning into an insect, so when the time comes go to the far right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll also be so strong and massive over there, you&amp;#39;ll have no risk of getting smashed like a mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At every point along that road you&amp;#39;ll be shapeshifting, so it&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;re going to &amp;quot;transform&amp;quot;. That would take focusing your attention on the specific animal you want to become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know how to do that.  Maybe never will.  The death defier taught that to the lineage, but we didn&amp;#39;t get the instruction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on which direction you &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; on that road, you&amp;#39;ll pick up attributes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you went far right, you&amp;#39;ll likely turn into one of these:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.art-prints-on-demand.com/a/dore/educationofgargantuaillus.html\"&gt;https://www.art-prints-on-demand.com/a/dore/educationofgargantuaillus.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a huge human with super strength, and who knows what other attributes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out to be consistent with the lecture Carlos gave on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what use if no one else can see you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can, but they have to be shifted enough to see inorganic beings and the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we block that stuff out so well, it doesn&amp;#39;t even seem to exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I pointed out, this topic is heavily tainted with book deal greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if anyone insists on turning into a skunk and scaring their best friend, it is possible to get someone else to see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fright, embarrassment, or any other thing that can shift their assemblage point down a bit, would do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is all over the books.  One time don Juan told Carlos his fly was open, to embarrass him enough to loosen it, and then since he wanted him all the way in HA, he tapped him on the back repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just telling his dick was hanging out with an erection, moved his assemblage point enough, that he might have been &amp;quot;skunk enabled&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qydrll/wanda_sue_parrott_fate_true_reports_of_the/hlipr2i/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1637509242.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_qydrll", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hlfar14", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1637439365.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_qydrll", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\"**Shapeshifting - American Style**\"\n\n[OCR text of the article.](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/magazine_interviews/fate_sep_1991) Reviewed and formatted.\n\n[PDF of scans from the original pages, with photographs](https://archive.org/details/fate-sep.-1991-pgs.-78-83-96-101)\n\n(should add that this was bought off of eBay, not my name/address)", "edited": 1637596645.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hlfar14", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Shapeshifting - American Style&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/magazine_interviews/fate_sep_1991\"&gt;OCR text of the article.&lt;/a&gt;

Don Juan's right in that case, in as far as the process of getting silent is often hampered by the expectation of rewards.\n\nIt's a deeply embedded part of our Tonal, to expect rewards. It's almost like a wind-up key for lots of horrible behavior.  And it's so strongly attached to our personalities, we can't even see it clearly.\n\nAs they ponder getting silent and all the work that will take, people worry they've been tricked, and all that horrible effort won't result in anything.\n\nThey expect rewards, and aren't sure there are any.\n\nAnd even after you get rewards from silence, for instance gazing at darkness produces hypnogogic images, each new session starts out the same way for a very long time.\n\nYou worry \"nothing\" is going to happen this time.  No rewards.\n\nAnd that's a big mistake, because while gazing you'll be looking for something cool to happen, and ignore the minor stuff.\n\nBut the minor stuff, puffs of colors no matter how vague, are what can move your assemblage point.   Silence only allows it to move.\n\nSilence doesn't actually move it.  It needs some outside stimulation to break free.\n\nEveryone (maybe not the women) should be clear on this:  The cool things happen after the assemblage point moves. You can't seek the cool things, to get it to move.  \n\nYou have to accept whatever you have. If you have nothing, then just keep intending for there to be something, while silent.  \n\nAs don Juan explained, the old sorcerers became desperate for ways to move the assemblage point.  They knew that's where the magic starts, and that at times it's very hard to get it to move.\n\nOne way to get it to move, is to observe anything coming from the second attention, while silent.\n\nYou need to pay attention to those vague effects of light, while silent.  And of course, you can do this sitting in a chair with eyes closed.  It's just that, you'll fall asleep if you can't walk around.\n\nEventually the assemblage point moves, and the rewards come big time.  The colors take on a life of their own, and exit the realm of \"eye junk\" or \"visual defects\".\n\nSo in those 2 cases, expecting rewards is bad.\n\nBut it's also a good thing, to keep people honest.\n\nSome people create their own rewards.  Book deals.  Fame.  Selling classes.  Sex.\n\nAnd yet, they're inept as far as sorcery goes. They have  no real understanding.  They're just repeating what someone else said, and adding some dubious new information on to it.\n\nThey have what they wanted; attention and money.  They'll go on like that as long as people are gullible enough to take their classes or pay them for special services.\n\nNote: There's nothing wrong with me-too naguals if  they motivate you to work hard. It's when they keep you distracted so that you don't actually learn anything, that they're bad.\n\nThey contribute to the impression that sorcery and witchcraft are nonsense.  That hurts anyone who wants to learn.\n\nIf one of their \"students\" asks when the magical stuff is coming, the phony sorcerers tell them not to expect rewards.\n\nOr, they tell them that comes in special workshop #5, after they pay for #1, #2, #3, and #4.\n\nOr they set up a multi-level marketing scheme, to give the reward of earning money, in place of the reward of magic.\n\nPeople want to believe they haven't been tricked, so it's very easy to silence impatient apprentices.\n\nAt least, for 10 or 20 years.\n\nThere's where not expecting rewards is very bad.\n\nIn fact,  in part it did in all of Carlos' more than 100 apprentices. \n\nAll gone.\n\nThey didn't insist on rewards!  If they had, they'd have picked something Carlos showed them, and made it work until the effects were undeniable, and dazzling.\n\nMany things happened in private classes.  People had very cool experiences.\n\nAnd that was all Carlos was supposed to have done for us. Give us each a glimpse.\n\nWith that glimpse, we had a start. But we had to do the followup ourselves, because he was dying.\n\nAnd not following up was fatal. As with all sorcery effects, as time goes on it seems like it never happened, and you imagined the whole thing.\n\nExpecting rewards would have made them try to get that again, so that too much time didn't pass and it didn't fade into a lost dream.\n\nEdited four times", "edited": 1581791015.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fhp9tje", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this post belongs under the experiences section in the wiki?

You CAN'T try to \"skip ahead\".\n\nSorcery is not like anything else you ever did.\n\nIt's a gift, for your efforts.\n\nNot something you can learn.\n\nIf your efforts are all designed to \"skip ahead\", \"save time\", and \"get lots of attention for yourself\", you get NOTHING.\n\nSee  the little squirrel in the outcome #1 picture? \n\nThat's Minx.\n\nHe's one of the ways you get \"gifts\" for hard work.  He'll simply bring them to you!  \n\nLike a real squirrel, sharing his \"nut stash\".\n\nDon't ask where he stashes his nuts.  You just don't want to know that!\n\nHe tried to rummage through my magical closet two nights ago.   So he's liable to stash stuff all over the place.\n\nYou remember Minx as the \"Talking Lizards\".\n\nAnd yes, Minx can do that too.  But it's as creepy as Carlos described. His lizard toenails are 1 inch long!  Maybe even 2.\n\nIf you see him running across your wooden floors you won't think to get out the ruler and measure those god awful nails.\n\nHe likes to drag them, like a kid scraping a chalk board to make his teacher cringe.\n\nDid any of you read that \"genius\" DeMille's complaint about Minx?\n\nIn his scientologist's book to \"expose Carlos Castaneda\".\n\nWe had our own scientologist lurking around workshops.  He's the one who filmed Carlos, and got a picture of our own Jadey.\n\nSo DeMille thinks he's so clever, explaining that you can't sew a lizards eyes shut.\n\nSay what?\n\nYou mean, you can't sew the eyes shut on talking lizards???\n\nSomething was seriously wrong with that guy. Maybe it's those scientology electrodes, designed by our very own Carlos stalker. Must have been some brain damage.\n\nBut just to \"clear up the mystery\", that was Minx!  Not an actual lizard.\n\nMinx is AKA \"The Devil's Weed Entity\".\n\nMinx will let you do anything at all to his body.  He just likes the attention.\n\nLately he's teaching me to \"make him solid\".\n\nNow... \n\nI know that sounds like a very bad idea.\n\nLet's make the evil demon squirrel solid!!!\n\nBut it's just too hard to resist.\n\nDoing that sort of thing requires Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt's like darkroom practices, on steroids.\n\nYou'll get there!\n\nBut you can't cheat.\n\nSorcery just DOES NOT work that way.\n\nNow, it is in fact possible to \"bribe\" Minx.\n\nSo there are \"shortcuts\".\n\nBut before you can bribe Minx, you have to catch him!\n\nSomeone posted nonsense about oobershadows or maybe, \"OpeyBodies\".\n\nI can't recall.  Some crazy Russian priest came up with it.\n\nBut it was all mental masturbations.\n\nThen I'm told, he asked me to send him Minx!!!\n\nI didn't see that part.  Others were horrified.\n\nAnd my reaction is, \"What the hell?\"\n\nFirst, Minx belongs to Cholita.  I'm lucky to even see him at all.\n\nAnd I wonder if that man would like to send his little sister?\n\nOr his grandma?\n\nAs collateral.\n\nIf he wants to do that I'll bring them to Cholita and tell her she can keep them for a while, if she sends Minx to visit the random attention seeking guy on reddit. So he can experiment.   Maybe write a book.\n\nHonestly, I don't think she's going to go for it.\n\n\"Fairy\" has volunteered to visit people, but you have to move your assemblage point at least to the middle of your back.\n\nAnd even then, she seems to be picky.\n\nBut give it a try. Just do her pass once in a while.\n\nNot over and over!  Just once a month will do the job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Affection for the Energy Body, Outcomes", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ozc2aj1941991": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ozc2aj1941991.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d4d3575a7f98bfeb65f9bc696f79ad6516cf210"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ozc2aj1941991.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=058678f1acb00231276137856e4b8287a1a49c09"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ozc2aj1941991.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67894b4232c78ed954491e45a9793aba5717c36b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ozc2aj1941991.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07a3684d094632ae6f8e2994838575a52da25455"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ozc2aj1941991.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afac9dd448222589c47153d79dcc1234a55e8dea"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ozc2aj1941991.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e0a1cdf8f9873c4df7a96c1eabd9e1aec15e14"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ozc2aj1941991.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10c2a0289adb8bc933086aafb461eb39df127d82"}, "id": "ozc2aj1941991"}}, "name": "t3_vpclpv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yIDd5QJYl0c549yrd8xgkZswssqJNMGxZ5Nphch_Yso.jpg", "edited": 1656714258.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1656713872.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ozc2aj1941991.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=10c2a0289adb8bc933086aafb461eb39df127d82\"&gt;Just when I though I had this pass figured out.

After about the 4th or 5th cycle of this, I finally snapped out of it and felt wide awake when I got up to do more tensegrity. \n\nThe next 1.5 hours was so much fun! Here I was quickly met with a fog of reddish purple clouds and assorted puffs after finishing doing the a set of 3 affection passes (I was doing this pass the whole night, my favorite tensegrity pass so far). A puff immediately started rendering the \"treeline\" and canyon view I had a few days earlier, only it was not very high definition and seemed to be stuck in \"rendering\" mode. I took your advice and minimized my gaze, just doing overall \"noticing\" vs the intense staring. Pretty soon the whole room filled up with thick clouds which only increased with time in the darkroom. The air was \"dense\"! The \"fog\" would modulate between a reddish purple color and a brilliant blue with white highlights. The brightest spots seemed to be in the periphery. I had bright blue/whitish light orbs from the sides shoot \"beams\" of light into my eyeballs like some kind of laser. Almost annoying at times. Eventually I did notice a lattice-like almost geometric patterned thing behind the blue clouds. It was much more textured and had star-like points that would twinkle. Could this be the crystalline fog? Or is that something else entirely?\n\nI was repeatedly met with the view of the rendering treelines in nearly every puff and cloud thing I looked at while I walked around exploring my darkroom.  At this point, the whole room filled up with stars on every surface, floors, cieling, walls, etc. I pushed a cloud to the ceiling and it expanded to cover the whole ceiling, covering the blue star-like points. Then the tree line rendering scene played on that surface aswell! Again, not very high definition and not quite stable but it was only slightly dimmer than the same view from a few days ago. I now could also clearly perceive my arms and body, sometimes in black with a purple cloud as the background, other times as white outlines against the blue/white clouds. The details of my darkroom like the lone large cabinet and the closet sliding doors became \"visible\" aswell. \n\nHere's where things got goofy. Earlier in the late afternoon, I noticed a blue sky towards sundown so I posted up in my yard to do some skygazing. I noticed some sparkles relatively quickly and a single dim green puff eventually became visible. The most interesting thing was the rainbows! I saw two rainbows bisecting each other perpendicularly among some other thin rainbows. Didn't stay outside too long because my neck was getting sore so I went in to prepare for darkroom instead. So back to the darkroom: towards the tail-end of my session, I started seeing the same rainbows I saw earlier while skygazing. They appeared everywhere! They would appear in the puffs with the rendering treelines as a thin band rainbow, then later overtake the background of the scene to become full rainbow sunset skies. At one point, I simply grabbed a thin band rainbow and it stretched like a laffy taffy candy. It snapped back in place like some kind of cartoon animation! It then occurred to me tug on a rainbow with both hands so I pulled it back, let go and watched it snap back like a rubber band as it interacted with the red/purple clouds, pushing them around. I was also able to play with the puffs in new ways and it then occurred to me that I'll need to come up with some new personal darkroom hobbies!\n\nI get the feeling that recapping some old childhood memories might help a lot.

Now I know better to not get caught up the \"meaning\" of these coincidences and thinking I'm some kind of super special Tony Lama chosen boy or something, that's just more blue zone fodder. \n\nAnyway, I'll describe what happened in my darkroom session following my last post. To preface this, I'll say that I had to fight the decision to do darkroom because I had worked like a dog all day and was exhausted from barely sleeping the night before. I was also fighting the tonal mind's relentless thought-form assaults like \"what's the point (in doing darkroom tonight)? You're tired and sleepy. Also you just had such a badass session the night before, you're sure to have a mediocre one tonight. You don't have enough energy. Just go to sleep\". \n\nWell, I did have a very good reason to do darkroom you see. I had a dental appointment earlier in the afternoon; thought it was just a routine cleaning but my dentist actually discovered 3 cavities. I haven't gotten a single cavity in years! My dentist asked me if I had any recent dietary changes. Hmm oh yes, the only one I can think of is that I had gotten into a bad habit of indulging in those damn Ricola throat drop things. I'd have 1-3 everyday, especially in the darkroom as a way to measure time as it takes me roughly 30 mins to go through one of them; also functions as a nice darkroom treat. I learned my lesson, don't eat those damn things, they have plenty of sugar and they'll rot your teeth! Anyway, I ended up having to sit in the dental chair for nearly 3 hours and I definitely wasn't going to miss a golden opportunity to hoard as much glitter as possible from those bright dental LEDs. \n\nSo while I was really tired and it was past midnight, I took a shower to wake myself up and pushed ahead into the darkroom anyway. I really did not want to waste my precious 3+ hours of glitter collecting on simply turbocharging useless sleeping dreams. I entered my darkroom again in a neutral (almost transactional?) state. I could also say that I was in a \"not-caring\" mood like you described. I thought \"okay, let's just do 1 hour but make the most of the limited time tonight\". \n\nHow wrong was I to think my darkroom session was going to be mediocre - my room lit up in bright clouds, puffs and other things within 30 seconds! I was astonished; it's that damn glitter! (and also probably my \"not-caring\" mood going into darkroom). It usually takes me up to 2 hours to get to this point but here I was seeing this stuff in seconds. Damn! After my initial tensegrity long forms, I was looking at a bright purple puff and asked the puff to create a scene for me; I had read about another poster requesting something of a puff earlier in the day. The puff actually did oblige after a brief intent delay. The puff expanded into a monitor sized view and I could see some stuff beginning to take shape. Only the puff didn't stop there, it kept expanding and I was under the impression that it had enveloped my whole head like the Iron Man helmet thing. It didn't do that but instead stretched out vertically from floor to ceiling and laterally across my darkroom like some kind of barrier. \n\nThis barrier was like an energy forcefield or something and through it, I was viewing my double's view of the darkroom! How did I know this? No clue, but I was sure of it! I could walk around the barrier, turn my head and look at my view of the darkroom, then turn to look at the \"barrier\" and into my double's view. His view was much more magical than mine of course. I then stuck both of my arms through the forcefield barrier thing and noticed that I could clearly see my arms represented as blue protruding energy things in the rough shapes of arms from my double's point of view. I intended shooting laser beams out of my hands and they really did do that! I could also interact with objects in his view although they were not quite clear yet and were rather vague masses. Probably just needed more silence! \n\nI can't remember what happened next but I think I may have tried to walk through the barrier? There's a memory gap but at some point the barrier disappeared and I went back to doing the affection pass and other long forms in the darkroom. The timer went off, an hour flew by like nothing so I added another 1.5 hours cuz to hell with sleep! Things were going well in the darkroom until I did one affection pass a little too carelessly and scrapped my hand hard into the wall. Felt like just a minor scratch, nothing to be worried about. Wrong, a few moments later I touched the scratched spot, I was bleeding a small puddle! Had to turn on the lights to clean up the scratch which was actually a huge scrape despite feeling like nothing. When I got back in the darkroom, I was not able to continue on rather seamlessly as if I had just taken a quick bathroom break. I realized I was no longer in that \"not-caring\", neutral state. The annoyance of having to run out to clean my wound, turn on all the lights and the thought of having to deal with it the next day dirtied my link somewhat. My darkroom was now rather dim and things did not improve despite my now desperate efforts to get back into the flow/\"feel\" of the darkroom. I didn't deal with and process the slightly annoyed mood going back into the darkroom and now found myself frustrated. The frustration implied expectation, that's a dirty link!! This frustration reinforced the internal dialogue which lead to even more frustration, like a truly insidious feedback loop. I ended my darkroom session there and just went to sleep. Goes to show how \"not-caring\" really is of vital importance going into darkroom!\n\nedit: I'll add that I clearly did have plenty of dreaming energy left over as I went on to have several vividly weird, almost nightmarish dreams. Too bad that glitter had to go to waste. So the poor results towards the end of my darkroom session wasn't due to lack of physical or dreaming energy, I was plenty awake and ready for more.

After that, her link to intent would likely be too messed up to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx was the talking lizards in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for him an &amp;quot;introduction&amp;quot; is to show up on the rocks, and be taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t sew his eyes shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_vpclpv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vpclpv/affection_for_the_energy_body_outcomes/ifv1sgo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1657636901.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ifu3ead", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "eoscris", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1657617013.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vpclpv", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8zf8uqa7", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Dan tell me how do you use the darkroom and IB games in your everyday life?  \n  Because for me as a woman, what you do is not very attractive.

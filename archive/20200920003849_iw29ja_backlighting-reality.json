I don\u2019t know what got into her, but she was quite energized.\n\nI took the time to follow my own advice and talked to her as if she were real person.\n\nShe liked that, and brought me her favorite toy. It\u2019s a power object made entirely from the second attention.\n\nIt looks like fun. You find them floating high up to your left or right, and the dazzling sparkles of light draw you in.\n\nWhile you gaze into them, you barely realize the truth. It\u2019s a cage!\n\nBut by the time you notice there\u2019s some metal bars stuck on top, the trap is sprung.\n\nYou\u2019re sucked into a full-on waking dream.\n\nI don\u2019t mean the fun kind where you can turn on the lights and leave.\n\nI mean, a sleeping dream. And yet, you\u2019re awake with eyes open.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to call that, but you can do the same thing if you accidentally walk through the wall of your bedroom, into someone else\u2019s dream. Cholita has a second copy of the house to play in at night. Walking into there doesn\u2019t feel like anything unusual. It\u2019s all as real as the best and clearest dream you ever had.  And in fact, you can start out in your physical body, obviously in your own room, open the door, and walk into there. It all seems perfectly normal, until you realize there's a large rodent walking across your living room floor.\n\nWeird stuff happens in Cholita's copy of the house.\n\nFancy\u2019s dream cage isn\u2019t that complicated. It falls, and you suddenly find that Fancy is as solid as a real person, and can move smoothly.\n\nIf that isn\u2019t surprising enough, she seems to bring along a box to keep her accessories in.\n\nFancy is big into accessorizing.  I suppose, once she's in a dream, she gets to have posessions like a real person.\n\nWhat this means is, all the rules I had in my mind about inorganic beings can be changed.\n\nYes, they\u2019re barely there, can\u2019t actually do anything to you, and only change pictures once or twice a second.\n\nAnd if you want a more interactive \u201cscout\u201d, you have to go to sleep and find one.\n\nExcept with Fancy. She can bend reality around herself, for at least 12 feet square.\n\nInside there, she\u2019s real.\n\nFortunately, the realization of what\u2019s going on seems to make it end.\n\nUnfortunately, you probably won\u2019t realize when it ended.\n\nYou come back from a gap in memory.\n\nLast night, Fancy didn\u2019t manage to spring the trap. She only showed it to me.\n\nActually, she modeled it for me, complete with model posing on chair, just as you see in that image.  Except Fancy's chair was more like a judge's chair, or a throne.\n\nI believe she knew I was looking at the palms of my hands, so I could draw it more accurately the next day.\n\nShe decided to toss in her favorite toy, and let me study it.\n\nMaybe she has a book deal in mind for herself?\n\nIf she brings it to me, I\u2019ll get it published. Armando's publisher seems like he'll print anything.\n\nMeanwhile, two women practicing dark room gazing right now,  have seen \u201cthe wall\u201d.\n\nOf course that means, they think they saw it, but don\u2019t want to \u201cjump to conclusions\u201d.\n\nGo ahead and Jump!\n\nThe wall is no big deal.\n\nIf you can see the walls of your perfectly dark room, that\u2019s seeing energy on a horizon.\n\n\u201cThe wall\u201d is just a way of referring to looking only one direction at it, on a defined object.\n\nCarlos could see it on his palm. I can see it on the bed, ceiling, all the walls, and on the floor.\n\nWhen Carlos was taught to \u201cfind his spot\u201d, that\u2019s what don Juan was up to. Introducing him to \u201cseeing energy on a horizon\u201d.\n\nThe \"horizon\" just happened to be the dirt patio outside his shack.\n\nThe energy you see on a horizon can be smooth, ruled (made from lines), or chunky.\n\nI\u2019ll be interested to see if any of you discover \u201cchunky\u201d.\n\nIt was a gift from Fancy. Before her, I hadn\u2019t see that.\n\nYes, the inorganic beings give gifts!\n\nBut \u201cruled\u201d is the most likely form you\u2019ll see.\n\nThe \u201cruled\u201d energy is waiting to become something. If you gaze at it in general, while trying to increase your silence even more, you\u2019ll start to recognize things. Trees, bamboo, sand stretches. Even rocks and buildings.\n\nDon't worry about the spacing of those lines. I supposed it depends on how much it's started to \"form\".  In it's unformed state, it's lines. But not perfect ones, and not with any fixed spacing.  Fairly close together is all I can say.\n\nA very common view that can form from that is of an ancient city, dissolving over millions of years.\n\nIt\u2019s a rather sad sight, because there\u2019s nothing that can be done about time.  The sight makes you feel sorrow for all of reality.\n\nReality won't last.\n\nIf you get chunky, learn to reach in there. Depending on your *intent*, you\u2019ll either pull out an object, or pull out a \u201cblob\u201d of *feelings*.\n\nIt could be possible to use that for recapitulation, but that would be a very advanced practitioner.\n\nThe most practical form is \u201csmooth\u201d.\n\nYou can look through smooth if it\u2019s inside your eye lids.\n\nYes, the wall can form on any flat surface, even the inside of your eyelids!\n\nIn Ireland, they call this, \"the Second Sight\".\n\nThe Jews called it, \"The Light of God\".\n\nI call it, lots of fun!  And let's leave the religiosity out of sorcery.  \n\nWhat's the goal of the Toltec way?\n\nWho fucking cares???  That's the king of thing you think about, when you can't actually do any magic.\n\nCarlos used to say that word a lot, so don't blame me. Anyone who went ot private classes likely had an increase in \"foul mouth\" for a few years.\n\nDon Juan was the same way.\n\nIf you get lucky enough to see it when you close your eyes, it\u2019s likely to take on a semi-permanent look.\n\nCheesy kitchen wall paper. A badly poured concrete retainer wall. Wood grain. Burlap.\n\nAnd you'll have a bliss buzz.  It's unmistakable.  You see the light, and the more you look at it the more  your \"bliss buzz\" is noticeable.\n\nThanks to the \"bliss buzz\", you don't have to worry if it doesn't have details.\n\nYou'll ***know*** you're looking at energy.\n\nExcept, you must be in heightened awareness or I can\u2019t guarantee this will work.\n\nCocaine, THC,  or DMT isn't going to do it. Sorry.  That's obvious. If anything like that worked, we'd all know about it.\n\nBecause it's too cool!\n\nSo everyone, give up your hope for an unknown baldness cure.\n\nYou know the kind. Like you see on TV.\n\nRemember this one rule: If it worked, we'd all know about it!!! The nightly news would remind you nearly every week.\n\nSame for drugs.  Or \"imagining\".  You can't imagine sorcery, as our friend from sustained action claimed.  \n\nYou have to get silent.  Then, reality can change.\n\nAnd once you can, and you get into heightened awareness, and you close your eyes and see energy, you're in business!\n\nGo to the airport. Sit on the bench next to the gigantic conveyor belt.  The people mover.\n\nSit with eyes closed, as if you were tired from traveling, and watch people go by.\n\nYou\u2019ll be seeing their energy.\n\nIf you're in a very busy Asian airport, you have a chance to catch a sorcerer going by.\n\nI recommend Bangkok airport. Bangkok is filled with magic shops, selling fetus bone amulets and dark spells you can use for youth, or for revenge.\n\nBut a more  useful use of \"the wall\", is to look **on** it. \n\nI mean, when in the dark room. Not when it's behind your eyes.\n\nMore useful, because you can be a lazy slob like me, stumble out of bed in the middle of the night, and try it out.\n\nFlying to Asia is a bit of work.\n\nWhen in your room, don't look through it, as if watching for a world to form, \"out there\".\n\nOnce you see a world assemble for you, on the walls of your bedroom, it's easy to get into the bad habit of looking **through** the wall.\n\nJust look at the surface instead.  Pretend that you swatted a fly on that wall, and want to verify it didn't get away.\n\nLook for any details on the perfectly smooth surface.  Fly spots I suppose.\n\nIf you got chunky, you\u2019re out of luck for looking \u201con\u201d it. The potential objects will spill out and fill the room, and you\u2019ll be experiencing the crystalline dreaming fog.\n\nI made that mistake last night, and the room was overrun with junk. It was like you wuold see if the entire wall were stuffed with weird toys, held back by clear plastic.\n\nAnd you took a knife and cut a line horizontally across the entire wall.\n\nThe objects spill out and fill the room.\n\nIn another form, I call it, \"crystalline dreaming fog\".  It happens when your gaze becomes pinpoint but you haven't learned to control your awareness (interest).\n\nCrystalline dreaming fog is one of the barriers you have to cross some day if you want to physically walk into the second attention.  \n\nIt's the second attention, \"in your face\".\n\nYou overcome it with, \"So what...\"\n\nBut the smooth variety works well with this technique.\n\nYou can speed it up by stretching your palm towards it, to give your eyes focus. Scan the palm, look to the side that\u2019s just about to be overrun by your palm. If there\u2019s a detail there, it seems to realize your hand is about to crush it, and it pops out and becomes what it wants to be.\n\nI often get little old Mexican Indian men.  Possibly when poking around in the second attention, echoes of the old sorcerers can be found hanging out there.\n\nThe most frightening thing you can do is to look \u201cin front\u201d of it.\n\nIt\u2019s called, \u201cBacklighting\u201d in the digital camera world. That\u2019s when there\u2019s a bright light behind the subject of the picture, but insufficient light on them.\n\nDigital cameras have to detect this, and usually have backlight settings.\n\nAll they do is brighten up the darker things, and reduce the lighter things.\n\nThe hard to see becomes visible.\n\nThat\u2019s what happens in your darkroom also, when you use this technique.\n\nWhat you see in that image is Fancy.  As she looks in daylight.\n\nJust a waft of smoke.\n\nExcept, Fancy kind of chubby in that form. \n\nShe \"cheats\" when she takes human form.\n\nEdited twice\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Backlighting Reality", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "link_ids": ["t3_ifu1bv", "t3_if5koq", "t3_ienqgj", "t3_ie01zd", "t3_idn0fa", "t3_idh7ju", "t3_iczlw5", "t3_icv2ot", "t3_irms6p", "t3_irglig", "t3_iqzit7", "t3_iq7jdg", "t3_iof5ib", "t3_invu3w", "t3_imlozg", "t3_ilzfhg", "t3_ildkri", "t3_ijgd33", "t3_iixdqk", "t3_ihms98", "t3_ih21eh", "t3_ih44uo", "t3_igh7ta", "t3_igday4", "t3_jcxlwj", "t3_hp41du", "t3_kdsew2", "t3_kz7y8a", "t3_kz75ql", "t3_kw4lpr", "t3_kvqj52", "t3_knpzzc", "t3_km2pzf", "t3_kj29l8", "t3_kd0b1h", "t3_k641wo", "t3_k4jrfq", "t3_k2paj7", "t3_k2dn7a", "t3_k1fwwj", "t3_jqlctf", "t3_jq09jk", "t3_jp4g2x", "t3_jng0bx", "t3_jmu5w3", "t3_jmsrw3", "t3_jm1fxl", "t3_jkklgr", "t3_jikxdd", "t3_jhb6f9", "t3_jh8142", "t3_jglh8m", "t3_jgb5mx", "t3_jg53re", "t3_jfoaai", "t3_jf4c1u", "t3_je4gyw", "t3_jdlcth", "t3_jby6ff", "t3_jadwdo", "t3_j9fkih", "t3_j96xwg", "t3_j8rmcm", "t3_j7c8fa", "t3_j65s10", "t3_j61w6p", "t3_j43yai", "t3_j40bem", "t3_j3eykq", "t3_j2jxyx", "t3_j261xv", "t3_j1vngl", "t3_j0g2nl", "t3_izm9cx", "t3_iyhkny", "t3_ix9ipe", "t3_ix5a4g", "t3_iw29ja", "t3_iverkv", "t3_iu3yxd", "t3_isv81g", "t3_isnn0y", "t3_ic1ppo", "t3_i9fbj8", "t3_i8kcue", "t3_i795h6", "t3_i5o2m4", "t3_i4tqjj", "t3_i3o4mq", "t3_i2ha3h", "t3_i1ch4u", "t3_i0s7jm", "t3_hzfk4m", "t3_hx8xej", "t3_iyz5md", "t3_ljjdbn", "t3_lfo0wa", "t3_lgzmsv"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 1", "created_at_utc": 1598295005.319, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1620558726.961, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 59, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ww0p0kbjm6o51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 45, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ww0p0kbjm6o51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d942038537abd003d7d2c88f800d0daa7f160d9"}, {"y": 91, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ww0p0kbjm6o51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9faf6346e3e72fd8546449c83a13bc3361c896d8"}, {"y": 135, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ww0p0kbjm6o51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27606d0195c5cea14ae39658cfe1181561df2ecb"}, {"y": 270, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ww0p0kbjm6o51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5a019b4694d050b524563e5567700f965ca764d"}, {"y": 405, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ww0p0kbjm6o51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c32d20ea81cd4a548bf9290ea49f647665057d7"}, {"y": 455, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ww0p0kbjm6o51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da26a0533e531854fa0cbd6041cdd8ec0c032c44"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 2560, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ww0p0kbjm6o51.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a32437e6fda16aae35f898f66a23f2579d905f89"}, "id": "ww0p0kbjm6o51"}}, "name": "t3_iw29ja", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kaX7Up8Flx0fFv9jzqu47u1MOs_j8dVSZsuKaa-0GXw.jpg", "edited": 1600560475.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1600555129.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ww0p0kbjm6o51.jpg?width=2560&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a32437e6fda16aae35f898f66a23f2579d905f89\"&gt;What I did last night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy was on a roll last night.

Depending on your &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, you\u2019ll either pull out an object, or pull out a \u201cblob\u201d of &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could be possible to use that for recapitulation, but that would be a very advanced practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most practical form is \u201csmooth\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can look through smooth if it\u2019s inside your eye lids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, the wall can form on any flat surface, even the inside of your eyelids!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Ireland, they call this, &amp;quot;the Second Sight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jews called it, &amp;quot;The Light of God&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I call it, lots of fun!  And let&amp;#39;s leave the religiosity out of sorcery.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the goal of the Toltec way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who fucking cares???  That&amp;#39;s the king of thing you think about, when you can&amp;#39;t actually do any magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used to say that word a lot, so don&amp;#39;t blame me. Anyone who went ot private classes likely had an increase in &amp;quot;foul mouth&amp;quot; for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan was the same way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get lucky enough to see it when you close your eyes, it\u2019s likely to take on a semi-permanent look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheesy kitchen wall paper. A badly poured concrete retainer wall. Wood grain. Burlap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll have a bliss buzz.  It&amp;#39;s unmistakable.  You see the light, and the more you look at it the more  your &amp;quot;bliss buzz&amp;quot; is noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &amp;quot;bliss buzz&amp;quot;, you don&amp;#39;t have to worry if it doesn&amp;#39;t have details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;#39;re looking at energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, you must be in heightened awareness or I can\u2019t guarantee this will work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cocaine, THC,  or DMT isn&amp;#39;t going to do it. Sorry.  That&amp;#39;s obvious. If anything like that worked, we&amp;#39;d all know about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s too cool!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So everyone, give up your hope for an unknown baldness cure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know the kind. Like you see on TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember this one rule: If it worked, we&amp;#39;d all know about it!!! The nightly news would remind you nearly every week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for drugs.  Or &amp;quot;imagining&amp;quot;.  You can&amp;#39;t imagine sorcery, as our friend from sustained action claimed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get silent.  Then, reality can change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And once you can, and you get into heightened awareness, and you close your eyes and see energy, you&amp;#39;re in business!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to the airport. Sit on the bench next to the gigantic conveyor belt.  The people mover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sit with eyes closed, as if you were tired from traveling, and watch people go by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll be seeing their energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in a very busy Asian airport, you have a chance to catch a sorcerer going by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recommend Bangkok airport. Bangkok is filled with magic shops, selling fetus bone amulets and dark spells you can use for youth, or for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a more  useful use of &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;, is to look &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt; it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, when in the dark room. Not when it&amp;#39;s behind your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More useful, because you can be a lazy slob like me, stumble out of bed in the middle of the night, and try it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flying to Asia is a bit of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in your room, don&amp;#39;t look through it, as if watching for a world to form, &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you see a world assemble for you, on the walls of your bedroom, it&amp;#39;s easy to get into the bad habit of looking &lt;strong&gt;through&lt;/strong&gt; the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just look at the surface instead.  Pretend that you swatted a fly on that wall, and want to verify it didn&amp;#39;t get away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for any details on the perfectly smooth surface.  Fly spots I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you got chunky, you\u2019re out of luck for looking \u201con\u201d it. The potential objects will spill out and fill the room, and you\u2019ll be experiencing the crystalline dreaming fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made that mistake last night, and the room was overrun with junk. It was like you wuold see if the entire wall were stuffed with weird toys, held back by clear plastic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you took a knife and cut a line horizontally across the entire wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The objects spill out and fill the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In another form, I call it, &amp;quot;crystalline dreaming fog&amp;quot;.  It happens when your gaze becomes pinpoint but you haven&amp;#39;t learned to control your awareness (interest).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crystalline dreaming fog is one of the barriers you have to cross some day if you want to physically walk into the second attention.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the second attention, &amp;quot;in your face&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You overcome it with, &amp;quot;So what...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the smooth variety works well with this technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can speed it up by stretching your palm towards it, to give your eyes focus. Scan the palm, look to the side that\u2019s just about to be overrun by your palm. If there\u2019s a detail there, it seems to realize your hand is about to crush it, and it pops out and becomes what it wants to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often get little old Mexican Indian men.  Possibly when poking around in the second attention, echoes of the old sorcerers can be found hanging out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most frightening thing you can do is to look \u201cin front\u201d of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s called, \u201cBacklighting\u201d in the digital camera world. That\u2019s when there\u2019s a bright light behind the subject of the picture, but insufficient light on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Digital cameras have to detect this, and usually have backlight settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All they do is brighten up the darker things, and reduce the lighter things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard to see becomes visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what happens in your darkroom also, when you use this technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you see in that image is Fancy.  As she looks in daylight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a waft of smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, Fancy kind of chubby in that form. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She &amp;quot;cheats&amp;quot; when she takes human form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "iw29ja", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/iw29ja/backlighting_reality/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/iw29ja/backlighting_reality/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1600555129.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g5zqcg4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1600617194.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g5ylp9e", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;  So, cutting off the internal dialogue is definitely a way of saving up energy like Daniel has brought up before.\n\nJust keep in mind, it's blissful, but not \"cozy\".\n\nSo there is a dark side to sorcery.

Probably the blue scout.\n\nHe handed those posters out at the next workshop.\n\nIt showed a purple, blue, and red horizon, with a small city entirely of white, forming or melting. \n\nI was puzzled it was a city, and not writing. I thought, \"the wall\" is only for writing.\n\nThat's because he'd banned me from reading his materials. The answer was in \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nWhich means, he'd already told us about \"reading off the wall\" when I saw that poster.\n\nI supposed you could better trace the \"when\" by figuring out when that \"Silent Knowledge\" publication was started.  He usually told us about things that were in his consciousness, and if he was writing a book we got that day's best explanation of something, as he'd worked it out for his book.\n\nNo, flat doesn't matter.  Palm of hand is not flat.\n\nJuann skipped right to \"the wall\" as soon as he could see dreaming fog.\n\nNow he's worried about whether he's seeing, \"the right thing\", I suppose.\n\nIt's all \"the right thing\", as long as it can't possibly be there.\n\nAnd in fact, if you have women who can see it, I urge them to learn to see it inside a crystal ball.\n\nThat would be SOOOO cool!\n\nYou're confusing \"the wall\" with, \"the whorl\".\n\nThe whorl is an ornament on the wall.\n\nThe wall isn't a simple thing.  Inorganic beings will form structures on it, and sit there managing your use of the wall.\n\nDoors or windows can appear. Ones you can step through!  Chances are, if you can step through, there's a weird being sitting above.  We need their energy I suppose.\n\nThe whorl, if you are lucky enough to get it to form, seems to sit at a fixed location.\n\nI won't tell. I'd like to see where you guys find it.\n\nThe whorl is jet black with some color being eaten up by the black. I see purple, but I would imagine pink or red is also common.\n\nAt the most intense part, where the thickest yin/yang black is burning up the light, a pomegranate dot can form, and spin off text.\n\nHowever, once you can see, \"the wall\", it's perfectly normal for a whole page of text to materialize on it.\n\nYou could probably even hack into Joe Biden's teleprompter, if you were a good enough sorcerer.\n\nIn fact, you could pretend to be one of my customers, who has his own \"weather channel\". His room is covered in monitors of live web cams all around the world.\n\nYou could see that!\n\nI have!  9 \"monitors\" at once.\n\nOr just take a look at the cover of \"Wheel of Time\".\n\nThat's \"the wall\".  In the sky.\n\nI don't understand #4.\n\nIt usually starts when you realize, you can see your hand!\n\nOr your leg!!!\n\nYou look around for leaks.  Unexpected light.\n\nWhen you don't find any, let's hope you think, \"So that's why Dan said it was much better to have a perfectly dark room! What a clever guy Dan is...\"\n\nThat's why you need pitch black.\n\nSo you don't waste your time looking for leaks.\n\nHowever, in the process of looking for leaks, which are obvious because there's a much brighter spot, you notice that the light is everywhere.\n\nMaybe not as bright as where you first found it, but you realize there's a general glow on everything.\n\nIf you didn't know any better, you'd ignore it.\n\nThat's the trouble with sorcery.\n\nWe needed Carlos to warn us, or we'd ignore it for sure.\n\nTo your last point, yes, the wall is important.\n\nIt went like this.  At least, this is what I think.\n\nTeaching sorcery is difficult, especially if you have plans as grand as Carlos had.\n\nWhat if he did what I'm doing in here, from the very start?\n\nThe risk is huge!  \n\nSomeone is going to freak out.\n\nThe word would get out to the workshop circuit, that sorcery is dangerous. And maybe Carlos knew, and didn't give a damn.\n\nSo he had to let people work on themselves.  Recap and Tensegrity, and hopefully some silence practice.\n\nAnd let them prove themselves by doing that for years.  Let the scary stuff happen slowly.\n\nIt's not all that dissimilar to what don Juan did.\n\nPower plants are expected to have crazy results.

Probably the blue scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He handed those posters out at the next workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It showed a purple, blue, and red horizon, with a small city entirely of white, forming or melting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was puzzled it was a city, and not writing. I thought, &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; is only for writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because he&amp;#39;d banned me from reading his materials. The answer was in &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, he&amp;#39;d already told us about &amp;quot;reading off the wall&amp;quot; when I saw that poster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed you could better trace the &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; by figuring out when that &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; publication was started.  He usually told us about things that were in his consciousness, and if he was writing a book we got that day&amp;#39;s best explanation of something, as he&amp;#39;d worked it out for his book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, flat doesn&amp;#39;t matter.  Palm of hand is not flat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juann skipped right to &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; as soon as he could see dreaming fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now he&amp;#39;s worried about whether he&amp;#39;s seeing, &amp;quot;the right thing&amp;quot;, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;the right thing&amp;quot;, as long as it can&amp;#39;t possibly be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, if you have women who can see it, I urge them to learn to see it inside a crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would be SOOOO cool!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re confusing &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; with, &amp;quot;the whorl&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whorl is an ornament on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wall isn&amp;#39;t a simple thing.  Inorganic beings will form structures on it, and sit there managing your use of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doors or windows can appear. Ones you can step through!  Chances are, if you can step through, there&amp;#39;s a weird being sitting above.  We need their energy I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whorl, if you are lucky enough to get it to form, seems to sit at a fixed location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t tell. I&amp;#39;d like to see where you guys find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whorl is jet black with some color being eaten up by the black. I see purple, but I would imagine pink or red is also common.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the most intense part, where the thickest yin/yang black is burning up the light, a pomegranate dot can form, and spin off text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, once you can see, &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s perfectly normal for a whole page of text to materialize on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could probably even hack into Joe Biden&amp;#39;s teleprompter, if you were a good enough sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, you could pretend to be one of my customers, who has his own &amp;quot;weather channel&amp;quot;. His room is covered in monitors of live web cams all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could see that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have!  9 &amp;quot;monitors&amp;quot; at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or just take a look at the cover of &amp;quot;Wheel of Time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;.  In the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand #4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It usually starts when you realize, you can see your hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or your leg!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You look around for leaks.  Unexpected light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;#39;t find any, let&amp;#39;s hope you think, &amp;quot;So that&amp;#39;s why Dan said it was much better to have a perfectly dark room! What a clever guy Dan is...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why you need pitch black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you don&amp;#39;t waste your time looking for leaks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, in the process of looking for leaks, which are obvious because there&amp;#39;s a much brighter spot, you notice that the light is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe not as bright as where you first found it, but you realize there&amp;#39;s a general glow on everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t know any better, you&amp;#39;d ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the trouble with sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We needed Carlos to warn us, or we&amp;#39;d ignore it for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To your last point, yes, the wall is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It went like this.  At least, this is what I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teaching sorcery is difficult, especially if you have plans as grand as Carlos had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if he did what I&amp;#39;m doing in here, from the very start?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The risk is huge!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone is going to freak out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word would get out to the workshop circuit, that sorcery is dangerous. And maybe Carlos knew, and didn&amp;#39;t give a damn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he had to let people work on themselves.  Recap and Tensegrity, and hopefully some silence practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And let them prove themselves by doing that for years.  Let the scary stuff happen slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not all that dissimilar to what don Juan did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Power plants are expected to have crazy results.  And everyone knows, the power plant wears off, and eventually you&amp;#39;re normal again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when done with &amp;quot;no excuses&amp;quot;, for real, it can be scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a hippy on LSD for the first time, panicking that he&amp;#39;s never coming down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a druggy, you&amp;#39;ve seen that before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how much worse, if it&amp;#39;s sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos did most of his &amp;quot;non-drug&amp;quot; learning in heightened awareness, so he&amp;#39;d forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But his plan to stretch things out was not going to work, because he was dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So at the end, he introduced the &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot; techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing here.

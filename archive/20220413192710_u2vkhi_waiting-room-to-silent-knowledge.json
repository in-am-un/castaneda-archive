But the rewards are immense!\n\nYou're gullible.  You fell for it up until now.  You got cheated, hoodwinked, tricked.\n\nThey saw you coming!\n\nBecause if you show this picture to a Buddhist, and after they call you a liar and  you show them this subreddit, and some other photos, and other people doing it, and after the tears in their poor little Buddha boy eyes dry up, they'll condemn  you.\n\n\"That's bad for your dharma!\", they'll suggest.  Or, \"Demons like that are evil!  They'll mislead you.\"\n\nWhat???   You mean like that putz the Buddha mislead everyone, with his \"book deal hinduism\"?\n\nFact is, they don't like real magic.  Just pretend magic, which no  one ever gets.  But they've set up an amazing hazing system, asian style, and they somehow managed to blind everyone to the fact that, Buddhism doesn't work worth crap!\n\nWorse, they manage to brainwash people into feeling guilty for even expecting magic.\n\nOnly the \"sacred Buddha\" is worthy of that!  You lesser people are lucky to have chance to survive endless rebirths.\n\nBut wait...  That's a lie too.  In fact, the entire thing is a lie.  It's just asian \"wise sayings\"!  They know how to create those all day long, and westerners fall for it every time.\n\nThe wise sayings are actually appeals to your greed, mixed with lies taken from other systems.\n\n\"Thank goodness you're a Yogi!\", you say?\n\nWait...  Those guys also never come up with the goods.  Yogananda, Maharishi, Muktananda, Meher Baba, Osho.\n\nNone ever taught even a tiny bit of magic, to anyone.  But they didn't have google back then, so they could lie all day long, and no one could catch them.\n\nAnd they also would look at these pics, and tell you it's \"evil\".\n\nYea, evil because it exposes their lie.\n\nBut this is nothing new!  Don Juan told us all this.   The world of man is nothing but \"endless folly\".\n\nCarlos told us too.  When don Juan left, he went looking for magic elsewhere, for many years.\n\nAnd trust me, Carlos had entry ANYWHERE.  it was like having the goose that lays golden eggs show up at your door, and ask to come in.\n\nHe always got in!\n\nHe even made a little home movie with Bruce Lee and Howard.  He was the bartender.\n\nCarlos had some fun stories about his search for actual magic.\n\nThe famous guru who greeted him at the top of some long stairs, and on the way down fell and died.\n\nOr the famous female spiritual leader, who only wanted to fuck  him.\n\nThe stories were endless, but came to the same thing.\n\nThere's nothing out there.\n\nNow, the exception is witches.\n\nYes, they can do shit.\n\nBut usually it's not impressive, or certainly not as impressive as Cholita.\n\nBecause there's nothing out there!  So the witches around were learning \"crap magic\", like european enochian nonsense.\n\nBad guidance, weak witches.\n\nBut with the men it's worse.  Bad systems, more bad player con artists.\n\nWith no need to actually have magic, they made thousands of evil little cults, for every asian magical system you can think of.\n\nReally, this is what you signed up for, reading the books.\n\nDon't try to change them now.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing out there.\n\nIf you had your heart set to \"teach\" some crap, like Taoism, then FIX IT!\n\nGo ahead and teach that pretend stuff.  But learn sorcery, and then \"tinker\" with it, so that it actually works.\n\nIf you must cheat people, at least provide them an actual benefit.\n\nI'd love to see someone \"fix\" shamanism.  You can't imagine the amazing rituals we could design.  Stuff that would make even the \"Men of Knowledge\" drool.\n\nThey were ritual peddlers, who used drugs to summon magic.  Mostly \"Silent Knowledge\" from what we've read in the books.  \"Divining\" is silent knowledge.\n\nBut if you want to be a crazy Daoist living on morning dew on leaves and sunlight, on Mt. Ali, leaping from cliff to cliff without need of a bridge, then REALLY learn to do that.\n\nI've been up there.  Lots of wonderful places to jump half a mile and end up in a beautiful tea farm.\n\nI won't go into Hindus and their delusional \"magic\" system, except to say, that ain't no \"astral plane\" in that picture in this post.\n\nIt's my bedroom.\n\nI wasn't sitting with my eyes closed, meditating. I didn't fall asleep and then lie about what happened.\n\nI was literally walking around,  eyes open, completely sober, wondering if I could see through my western wall and find Cholita, or if I could gaze south east, and pick up Jadey in Argentina.\n\nMeanwhile, I had a very helpful inorganic being show up.\n\nShe knew I was taking too long to get to silent knowledge, so she tried to teach me (again), what Carlos had written so many books to teach.\n\nI have the full conversations with her in the advanced subreddit, but we get evil men in here looking for some way to make themselves a fake sorcery book deal.\n\nHad to kick one out just last week!\n\nSo you guys get the shaft in here.\n\nGet yourself to the red zone, for real, not lying, and you'll get to go over there, to the advanced subreddit.\n\nLying is obvious, so don't even try it.  You'll never recover your reputation, if you lie about experiences in here.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll just explain what the inorganic being told me.\n\nIntent loves rituals!  Intent is the super intelligent force that comes from the interactions of the glowing emanations.\n\nWhen you focus your awareness on some intent scans it, and finds other similarly related to those, and produces a visible world for you.  It \"skims\" the zillions of emanations, and finds those perfect to build you a new reality.\n\nAll of your life is produced that way.  I suppose \"all\" might have some exceptions, but I don't know them.\n\nNow, I have a tendency to take things apart, to try to understand them.\n\nSo I was trying to learn to reach \"Silent Knowledge\", the main goal of sorcerers.   Bit by bit.\n\nIf you don't know about that topic, read the \"Silent Knowledge\" publication.  But once you understand what it is you'll see it everywhere, in all of the books.\n\nI wanted to \"take it apart\", and figure out how to get there, as fast as possible.  And then also, to find alternate ways to get there, in case some of you couldn't use mine.\n\nThe inorganic being told me. \"Cut that out!  Just use a ritual.  Everyone else does!  Don't you want to learn faster? \"\n\nSo she took what I had, and \"enhanced it\".\n\nI had discovered:\n\nYou must move your assemblage point, using silence.\n\nIt has to move to where you are \"seeing energy\".  That's the whitish light.\n\nThen, that whitish energy has to form a phantom room.  That \"anchors\" you in the second attention, so you don't keep drifting back to your blue line reality.\n\nThe room sort of \"protects you in the second attention\".\n\nNext, Silent Knowledge can be presented to you in many ways.  The old Olmec seers liked to view videos on walls, or in the sky.\n\nDon Juan suggested we should view text, in pages, scrolling lines, single words.\n\nWhatever \"the spirit\" wanted us to know, could be typed or printed and we could read it when needed.\n\nCarlos used the palm of his hand at times, but often he gazed south east, towards Mexico City.\n\nHowever, there's one method of viewing it that is so overwhelming, it represents all the \"abilities\" you will need under whatever circumstances you choose to use, to view it.\n\nI wrote about that in the post about the Wuwonians.  That was \"full on silent knowledge\".\n\nToo much.\n\nIt requires that you can perceive floating dream bubbles.  Hold magical objects. Enter dream realms on demand.  And remain so silent, you don't break the \"flow\".\n\nViews, objects, portal entry.\n\nI guess that covers the most basic elements, unless you want to use other senses.\n\nSo I discovered how to \"fake that up\".  Summon those \"abilities\" one at a time.\n\nI made a picture of that.  A path you can copy.  And I even warned there's no shortcut from the whitish light, directly to silent knowledge.\n\nYou need the steps in between.\n\nGaze at your translocated room (phantom reality) in perfect silence, until dream bubbles show up.\n\nYou should feel like you can \"look into them\", and if you choose go inside.\n\nBut that's a different post.  Just look for my entity Fancy, dressed like a demon from hell raiser. It's in here.  This is the picture to find:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Yea, that's Carlos in that last dream bubble...](https://preview.redd.it/rqqziy9p2ct81.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f468f71fe2d2bc8ba708ca78bac47edd25b7e0f5)\n\nNext you need to be able to play with magical objects. Fancy taught me about that also, but I didn't understand at the time. And this pic won't help you much, but that's what magical objects are about.  There in the picture. It's \"sliding dreaming\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Magical objects are available in abundance once your assemblage point moves far](https://preview.redd.it/6pwqfu0a3ct81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aae1c4f7394c4fdf8fe0395aa9db664e6e76d88)\n\nSo you need a magical object to materialize in the room BY ITSELF, and be extremely vivid.  And you should be able to reach up, and bring it down to hold in your hand.\n\nYou don't go \"find it\", as Fancy was teaching me here. It has to \"come by itself\". The way Silent Knowledge makes things happen.\n\nOnce you have that, you're good to go.  Silent Knowledge (SK) will be felt in the air.\n\nBut you'll be out of energy by then, and only get to play with it a short time.\n\nThe inorganic being pointed out it's ok to use a ritual, and suggested I simply build a silent knowledge structure.   Once inside, I could sustain it longer. And once I learned to make it, I could get there faster.\n\nHaving done it in the past, would make it happen in the future.\n\nIt's like \"advanced tensegrity\".\n\nRoom building tensegrity.\n\nI had some questions, like how does a dream bubble be part of a room?\n\n\"Make a window out of it\".\n\nBut what about that magical object floating in the air?\n\n\"One of those old fashioned butler tassels you pull, to call your servant to your room.\"\n\nYou can use it to announce to the storyteller, you are coming up the stairs for a visit to his mansion.\n\nWhen she was done, I had built this phantom room you see.\n\nYou can to.\n\nWe don't mess around.  You haven't been tricked this time. It all works.\n\nNo one wants your money. No one is faking up interviews on youtube to get more people interested. No one has a book.\n\nThere are no meetings.  No religion.  Nothing to believe.\n\nIt's all just \"hard work\", and nothing else.  But with the promised rewards.\n\nThe problem is, you actually have to do work, yourself.\n\nYou can't pay some fat guru to lecture you night and day, and expect to \"absorb it\".\n\nYou can't \"hang out with your buddies and live the lifestyle\".\n\nThat's pointless.\n\nAnd if you insist on step by step instructions, please go away.\n\nYou'll never learn.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false,

You can&amp;#39;t imagine the amazing rituals we could design.  Stuff that would make even the &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; drool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were ritual peddlers, who used drugs to summon magic.  Mostly &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; from what we&amp;#39;ve read in the books.  &amp;quot;Divining&amp;quot; is silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you want to be a crazy Daoist living on morning dew on leaves and sunlight, on Mt. Ali, leaping from cliff to cliff without need of a bridge, then REALLY learn to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been up there.  Lots of wonderful places to jump half a mile and end up in a beautiful tea farm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into Hindus and their delusional &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; system, except to say, that ain&amp;#39;t no &amp;quot;astral plane&amp;quot; in that picture in this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t sitting with my eyes closed, meditating. I didn&amp;#39;t fall asleep and then lie about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was literally walking around,  eyes open, completely sober, wondering if I could see through my western wall and find Cholita, or if I could gaze south east, and pick up Jadey in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I had a very helpful inorganic being show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She knew I was taking too long to get to silent knowledge, so she tried to teach me (again), what Carlos had written so many books to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the full conversations with her in the advanced subreddit, but we get evil men in here looking for some way to make themselves a fake sorcery book deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had to kick one out just last week!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you guys get the shaft in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get yourself to the red zone, for real, not lying, and you&amp;#39;ll get to go over there, to the advanced subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lying is obvious, so don&amp;#39;t even try it.  You&amp;#39;ll never recover your reputation, if you lie about experiences in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I&amp;#39;ll just explain what the inorganic being told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent loves rituals!  Intent is the super intelligent force that comes from the interactions of the glowing emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you focus your awareness on some intent scans it, and finds other similarly related to those, and produces a visible world for you.  It &amp;quot;skims&amp;quot; the zillions of emanations, and finds those perfect to build you a new reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of your life is produced that way.  I suppose &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; might have some exceptions, but I don&amp;#39;t know them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a tendency to take things apart, to try to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was trying to learn to reach &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;, the main goal of sorcerers.   Bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know about that topic, read the &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; publication.  But once you understand what it is you&amp;#39;ll see it everywhere, in all of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to &amp;quot;take it apart&amp;quot;, and figure out how to get there, as fast as possible.  And then also, to find alternate ways to get there, in case some of you couldn&amp;#39;t use mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic being told me. &amp;quot;Cut that out!  Just use a ritual.  Everyone else does!  Don&amp;#39;t you want to learn faster? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she took what I had, and &amp;quot;enhanced it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had discovered:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must move your assemblage point, using silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to move to where you are &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s the whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, that whitish energy has to form a phantom room.  That &amp;quot;anchors&amp;quot; you in the second attention, so you don&amp;#39;t keep drifting back to your blue line reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room sort of &amp;quot;protects you in the second attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, Silent Knowledge can be presented to you in many ways.  The old Olmec seers liked to view videos on walls, or in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan suggested we should view text, in pages, scrolling lines, single words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; wanted us to know, could be typed or printed and we could read it when needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used the palm of his hand at times, but often he gazed south east, towards Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s one method of viewing it that is so overwhelming, it represents all the &amp;quot;abilities&amp;quot; you will need under whatever circumstances you choose to use, to view it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote about that in the post about the Wuwonians.  That was &amp;quot;full on silent knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It requires that you can perceive floating dream bubbles.  Hold magical objects. Enter dream realms on demand.  And remain so silent, you don&amp;#39;t break the &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Views, objects, portal entry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess that covers the most basic elements, unless you want to use other senses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I discovered how to &amp;quot;fake that up&amp;quot;.  Summon those &amp;quot;abilities&amp;quot; one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a picture of that.  A path you can copy.  And I even warned there&amp;#39;s no shortcut from the whitish light, directly to silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need the steps in between.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gaze at your translocated room (phantom reality) in perfect silence, until dream bubbles show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should feel like you can &amp;quot;look into them&amp;quot;, and if you choose go inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s a different post.  Just look for my entity Fancy, dressed like a demon from hell raiser. It&amp;#39;s in here.  This is the picture to find:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rqqziy9p2ct81.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f468f71fe2d2bc8ba708ca78bac47edd25b7e0f5\"&gt;Yea, that&amp;#39;s Carlos in that last dream bubble...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next you need to be able to play with magical objects. Fancy taught me about that also, but I didn&amp;#39;t understand at the time. And this pic won&amp;#39;t help you much, but that&amp;#39;s what magical objects are about.  There in the picture. It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;sliding dreaming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6pwqfu0a3ct81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7aae1c4f7394c4fdf8fe0395aa9db664e6e76d88\"&gt;Magical objects are available in abundance once your assemblage point moves far&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you need a magical object to materialize in the room BY ITSELF, and be extremely vivid.  And you should be able to reach up, and bring it down to hold in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t go &amp;quot;find it&amp;quot;, as Fancy was teaching me here. It has to &amp;quot;come by itself&amp;quot;. The way Silent Knowledge makes things happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have that, you&amp;#39;re good to go.  Silent Knowledge (SK) will be felt in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll be out of energy by then, and only get to play with it a short time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic being pointed out it&amp;#39;s ok to use a ritual, and suggested I simply build a silent knowledge structure.   Once inside, I could sustain it longer. And once I learned to make it, I could get there faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having done it in the past, would make it happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;advanced tensegrity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Room building tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had some questions, like how does a dream bubble be part of a room?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Make a window out of it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about that magical object floating in the air?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One of those old fashioned butler tassels you pull, to call your servant to your room.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use it to announce to the storyteller, you are coming up the stairs for a visit to his mansion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she was done, I had built this phantom room you see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t mess around.  You haven&amp;#39;t been tricked this time. It all works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one wants your money. No one is faking up interviews on youtube to get more people interested. No one has a book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are no meetings.  No religion.  Nothing to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all just &amp;quot;hard work&amp;quot;, and nothing else.  But with the promised rewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, you actually have to do work, yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t pay some fat guru to lecture you night and day, and expect to &amp;quot;absorb it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;hang out with your buddies and live the lifestyle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you insist on step by step instructions, please go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll never learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "u2vkhi", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/u2vkhi/waiting_room_to_silent_knowledge/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/u2vkhi/waiting_room_to_silent_knowledge/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1649870830.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i4lhsgc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1649873807.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_u2vkhi", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "As it turns out, anyone can gain a magical teacher like this.\n\nLook up \"Porfirio\" and how Nestor went to learn from him after they all jumped off that cliff, when don  Juan left.\n\nMystery solved now?\n\nI have a little of it here.  \n\nThe Second Ring of Power, page 212.

I really wish I practice some before I die.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/u2vkhi/waiting_room_to_silent_knowledge/i4m2yn0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1649882267.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_u2vkhi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i4mhioz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "KrazyTayl", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1649888050.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_u2vkhi", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3i08j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's just too good.

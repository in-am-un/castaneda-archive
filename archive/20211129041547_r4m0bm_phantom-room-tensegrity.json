It seems more  likely he just noticed what they would tend to make, and if he didn't like part of it, he tinkered.\n\nHere's what it's like when you can *see* that.\n\nYou have to have moved your assemblage point all the way to the bottom in the red zone, and built up your energy body until you can at least see the puffs of color lingering on your torso where you put them.\n\nIf you bypass luring your double with a body it can borrow,  your *seeing* will be weak.\n\nIn fact, I don't know this to be  a fact other than each time I succeeded in leaving my locked dark room, was when I could perceive a phantom room around me, and was further into a dream than I was paying attention to the \"real\" room.\n\nWhich leads me to believe, if we want to learn to switch to the double, we should look past the account we have in Eagle's Gift.  Sure, do the finger wiggling  It makes the energy body fully visible over time.\n\nBut we have the impression we'll fold in half, or fall to the floor, or something dramatic, and then we'll be in our energy body, ready to learn to move it.\n\nWhat if we simply walk from the darkroom into one of our phantom rooms, as a full on dream?\n\nWe just sort of gave waking dreaming more attention than usual, and fell into very deep sleep walking, where we're physically inside the dream.\n\nThen we dropped they physical part in favor of believing the dreaming character we normally experience in dreams, is now us.  Smoothly, with no transition.\n\nYou *dream* the double out.\n\nDon't worry about what happens to your \"real\" body. It just never comes up!\n\nI can say with authority that works, because I've done it dozens of times.  Usually I blame Cholita for it, but really all she does is go off into the phantom room I currently have, so that the only way to keep her around is to follow her.  I forget the \"but that's impossible!\" part, and walk right through the solid wall to catch up with her.\n\nIf you don't have a Cholita handy, your inorganic being can do that part for you.  In fact, if you visit their world it'll be very much like that.\n\nSo, if you build up y our energy body in the red zone, then keep clearing out puffs, you move AUTOMATICALLY into the orange zone.\n\nThat's where the whitish light shows up, replacing the colorful puffs (mostly), and then you can end up with phantom rooms.\n\nThe whitish light doesn't like to remain wihtout form, so it's always trying to figure out what to turn into.  Standing up and facing it, you can tickle it with your fingers to watch it respond by forming \"things\" there in the air for you.  There's even a tensegrity movement to \"tickle\" it.\n\nAnd so if you are standing in the middle of the whitish light, and  start a tensegrity long form, you are then pushing \"feelings\" and memories in specific directoins, moving specific distances.\n\nYou are tickling the whitish light in 3 dimensions!\n\nIf intent was short on enough info to reskim that whitish light to make it into something, you just added a ton of information!\n\nIf you are perfectly silent, that information will override all other influences coming from you.\n\nBut keep in mind, that information on what phantom room will be produced, is stored at several levels.  Your memory of what \"just happened\" and where, the feeling in your muscles after each part of the movement, and where it took place, the sensations on your feet as they slide around or step.\n\nThere's a LOT of spatial and temporal information in there.\n\nFar more for example, than someone telling a beginner to watch out for clowns, and so during darkroom an evil clown shows up.\n\nThis is plenty of information for producing an actual room that's somewhat stable.\n\nAnd they do in fact do that!  I just did.\n\nIf you stop at the end and look around in absolute silence, the walls are glowing with the whitish light far more than is needed to see details.  It's like being in a ghost house that's mostly transparent.\n\nA VERY striking sight.  I just left one in order to write this before I forgot most of it.\n\nNow, you're certainly wondering how you can get in on the action.\n\nJust keep putting in the effort, that's how.\n\nBut if you could get an inoranic being to \"zap\" you, and fix the specific things that need fixing for you to see it right now, it really boils down to silence.\n\nThe room only forms because the trace sensations and memories of the tensegrity cause the emanations to reskim into that form.\n\nAn internal dialogue would be like a lawn mower, tearing all the information down.  Let's face it, during the day with our internal dialogue raging, we don't even pay attention to what all the parts of our body feel like or were just doing.\n\nSo you need near perfect silence to check out what sort of phantom room  you get, from specific long forms.\n\nThey aren't going to match what a different person gets though.  At least, not when done alone.\n\nLet's say you have short Carlos doing one, versus tall Miles.\n\nAt the very least, Carlos is going to have a low ceiling relative to Miles.\n\nBut eventually, as groups, you could do nighttime Tensegrity and let everyone contribute to the phantom room.\n\nWhen it gets really stable because a group keeps summoning it, they can walk right off into that dream.\n\nWe just need more people to really want magic, instead of book deal attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Phantom Room Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 104, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"j23afkqfdg281": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 80, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j23afkqfdg281.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=817048ee99c4deb81aad91a288f25fa33f587f47"}, {"y": 161, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j23afkqfdg281.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c116c54d206c4f38e2d96b77f996cbe0c2b8a273"}, {"y": 239, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j23afkqfdg281.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11108d7f48aa5bad8c3c42dc6bce1c58e79300cf"}], "s": {"y": 412, "x": 550, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j23afkqfdg281.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=343457365e0a8beee2b55435c36c23b59e7f3b43"}, "id": "j23afkqfdg281"}}, "name": "t3_r4m0bm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/I_fHn17mrgK6eNXZ4p2ldskDh3HgoB8z9oxO3R5Qdzk.jpg", "edited": 1638156813.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1638155747.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j23afkqfdg281.png?width=550&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=343457365e0a8beee2b55435c36c23b59e7f3b43\"&gt;Imagine this but only 1/10th as solid looking at first, fully solid if you enter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out, doing a long form creates a phantom room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it was kind of obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether Carlos hid speific room types in there, I have no idea.

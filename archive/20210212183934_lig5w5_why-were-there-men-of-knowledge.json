At least, it's worth pondering. Here it is from Facebook, unchanged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the Castaneda community today, we have various levels of people who practice. We have the sincere ones who follow instructions from Cleargreen, believe themselves to be following the books of Carlos, and generally want to \"do the right thing\".\n\nBut we also have angry men who try to dominate and control others, using severe bullying and social threats so that they can pretend everyone believes them. They make such pests of themselves, people shy away. That gives them the false impression they have won, and are now sorcerers.\n\nAnd now, we have a new breed. People who are actually doing magic. And because it's very alluring, when compared to pretending, the angry men come over to the subreddit, to try to dominate it.\n\nBut even in the very distant past, like 10,000 years ago, this must have been the case! We have accounts of the old seers using sharp little knives to consume the flesh of people they were stealing energy from.\n\nAnd we know those people were real seers, because we have to copy them until the very end, if we want to learn ourselves. Their \"intent\" is the only viable intent we have. Without it, there's no sorcery.\n\nAnd then we have the mysterious \"Men of Knowledge\" from the past. Despite what the angry men think, it's not a very admirable title. Men of Knowledge were merely sorcery guild members, probably from the great Olmec government, the first government in the Americas. They covered the duties of rituals such as dancing, curing, mask making, even baking. As we've seen a while back, perhaps paper making too.\n\nIt's not so odd. The same thing happens in Buddhism, where there are people pursuing enlightenment, but most Buddhist duties are for rituals such as burials or blessings.\n\nReligious rituals there will always be. And a need for people to practice that profession. The people who, \"know how to talk to God\", the way some believe Bishops and Popes can do. But as we all know, really they can't. And that's ok too.\n\nWe have to keep in mind, the \"Men of Knowledge\" could not *see*. Don Juan explains this in the books.\n\nSo they were not the \"old *seers*\".\n\nHow can this be? Here's my theory: The old seers were not at battle with other old seers. They were at battle with fake seers. As it is now with us, that's almost surely how it was back then. Sorcery repeats itself.\n\nPerhaps over time the old seers got tired of the dangerous fake sorcerers, and came up with a better solution than eating them.\n\nThe sorcery guild. To be a sorcerer, you had to join. And then, a specialty was found for you, based on what you could do. Everyone has something they might be good at. Even a crazy guy might be a great painter.\n\nTo be a guild member, you just needed to learn the inventory of your specialty. You didn't actually have to do the work needed, to \"see\".\n\nThat way the fake sorcerers could get all the attention they wanted, without actually hurting anyone. Get their \"facilitator certificate\", so to speak.\n\nAnd the seers who only wanted to explore infinity, were free to do so. No reason to join any \"guild\". They faded from sight to some extent, so that the angry men didn't even think about them anymore.\n\nAdd on not on Facebook:\n\nI suspect that \"sorcery guild\" idea satisfies all levels of interest.\n\nThe fake sorcery school guys so common in the Eastern Bloc,  who really just don't want to get a real job, could be a \"man of knowledge\" type who teaches rituals.\n\nDon't ask me what rituals are actually useful. That's Cholita's thing.\n\nBut those types want both money, and status.  Not so much actual sorcery as I've come to know, because they condemn what we're doing in the subreddit as, \"evil\".  Or to be more precise, they say it's like \"the old seers\", not realizing that's precisely how we are suppose to behave at first.  They'll offer that they are \"men of knowledge\", not dirty old seers who do real magic and play with demons.\n\nThe angry men who want to be thought of as powerful, where it's not so much about earning money,  can get their certificate and be less pesky to others.\n\nThey'll have what they want: Attention.\n\nOddly, the path to achieve this, if it's even possible, is through Cleargreen doing even more \"franchising\".\n\nSell more certificates.  Make specialty certificates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why were there \"Men of Knowledge\"?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Lineage"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"c9ibex3v83h61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c9ibex3v83h61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2bc40630778bc23bcd99eb6dc9d26617161e58"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c9ibex3v83h61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8b005a97f3d56610ed2b093544ec2753d2c1e56"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c9ibex3v83h61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1461c44c6168bc43490a04d2939cbb4a4532cb99"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c9ibex3v83h61.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=083b6678448ba2a955c3f3c72f7f1ca11f1bc7d2"}], "s": {"y": 752, "x": 752, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c9ibex3v83h61.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c215e350d4084a88903cbf19a98e8759dd48bd90"}, "id": "c9ibex3v83h61"}}, "name": "t3_lig5w5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Lineage", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/h4KoUaWHh9U0U6huWeFeOVRgs778qigD_SfD6oQ9gQs.jpg", "edited": 1613156486.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1613151574.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c9ibex3v83h61.png?width=752&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c215e350d4084a88903cbf19a98e8759dd48bd90\"&gt;How the old seers took care of pretend sorcerers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan put this idea in my head, and after writing it up as a sort of joke on Facebook, I realized it&amp;#39;s almost surely true.

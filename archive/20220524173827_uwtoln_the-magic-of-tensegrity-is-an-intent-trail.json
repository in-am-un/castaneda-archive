You can't \"take a shortcut\".\n\nIt almost seems like there's nothing you can do.\n\nAnd yet, a good team beats a crummy one every time.\n\nThey understand how to lean this way or that, move to a slightly different part of the fixed path, and achieve the fastest pace without wiping out.\n\nAnd if they can practice the same track over and over, it all becomes \"automatic\".  The slight ways you can influence your speed along the track become like a dance you know well.  So you can start to add some \"flare\" and get even better results.  \"Spike the ball\" at just the right moments.\n\nSo what has that to do with Tensegrity?\n\nI *saw* that last night.  Got a whole presentation on \"tensegrity routines\" as being a \"dirty link to intent\" that you DO NOT want to clean off fully.\n\nHow your tensegrity routine can become like a racing course.\n\nRacing to heightened awareness.  By creating your own \"intent trail\" to speed you along.\n\nAnd I also saw that tricky Carlos figuring this out. As a strategy to move assemblage points in groups.\n\nOr alone too.\n\nIt's not that the Tensegrity moves are full of \"Chi Gungy\" goodness.\n\nThey aren't some Asian crap magic delusion of being \"superior\" if you only do them daily.\n\nTensegrity is not like a box of \"Count Chocula\" breakfast puffs, all full of \"Chocolatey Vitamin Goodness\".\n\nThey don't \"stir up your chi energy\".\n\nThey aren't specifically designed to make you \"a little stronger each day\".\n\nUnfortunately, there's an entire community of sincere and loyal Tensegrity practitioners who believe this.\n\nSo they get nowhere and will eventually quit.\n\nEven if they did give you a little of that \"chocolatey goodness\", you'd fuss it off during the day.\n\nGive the average person \"more energy\", and they only get into more trouble.\n\nDouble Women are famous for this.  Imagine a 21 year old woman hitting the bar scene with a double dose of energy and the ability to lead (manipulate) others by moving their assemblage points slightly.\n\nFun to watch from several tables away!\n\nBut a disaster for the double woman.  With her \"posse\" around she'll surely crash and burn each bar hopping night, but they'll \"prop her up\" longer than they should and the results will be literally harmful to the woman.\n\nI actually saved one of those from death by drugs and car accidents, according to her friends.\n\nMyself, I just wanted to have a double woman around to see if there was any way to start a new lineage.  Took a year of stalking all over the world, to capture her.\n\nBut I learned, no one can teach sorcery to individuals.\n\nNO ONE.  Not even Carlos.\n\nNot even don Juan.\n\nYou need a lineage behind you.\n\nOr thousands of \"apprentices\", so the talented ones can teach themselves and all you have to do is cheerlead.\n\nBut teaching one specific person you found?\n\nImpossible.  Even the Olmecs took child apprentices if they could get them.\n\nAs Yoda said, \"Too old to begin the training he is.\"\n\nThat's all of us.\n\nSo if you find a man selling sorcery workshops, you are guaranteed to have found a con artist who knows nothing about sorcery.\n\nI tried to teach many individuals over the 20 years following the death of Carlos. All failed, and only drained me of my own energy.\n\nBut that was before I discovered the internet was the best way to fix the horrible problem the Castaneda community has now.\n\nThat subreddit alone has seen 5000 people flow through it, since I started helping there 2 or 3 years ago.  Before that, in a period twice that long, it had only accumulated 600 or so.\n\nPeople see real magic, and want to try it out.\n\nAnd out of 500 of those, you can get one who makes it all the way to the end of the course.\n\nWhich might be a way to fix our situation and get away from sorcery obviously not working,  with everyone in denial and hundreds of bad men selling fake versions of the sorcery of Carlos.\n\nAt any rate just because you have more \"awareness energy\" doesn't mean you'll put it to good use.  So the idea of just doing tensegrity and recap daily, is NOT going to work.\n\nYou might manage to \"dart past the eagle\" if you sincerely practice those two.\n\nBut you won't find out until it's too late.\n\nSo maybe pretending you are doing chi gung and \"gaining chi energy\" is not a useful way to look at things.\n\nBecause the opposite tends to be true.\n\nThen what does the Tensegrity actually do, if it's not just \"weird chi gung\"?\n\nIt forms intent trails!\n\nKeep in mind there's just the emanations, our awareness flowing on them, and the force of intent which takes what it finds glowing, and \"tops it off to make it real\".\n\nBut which adds a touch of \"past history\" in its decisions on how to manufacture reality.\n\nOur goal as sorcerers is to \"clean our link to intent\" so that when we focus our attention on a specific goal, we aren't accidentally focusing it on 10,000 other things.\n\nOur daily awareness is like that.  Scattered all over the place!\n\nIt's why we recapitulate.\n\nBut that's another story.\n\nAssuming you can find colors in darkness, you are now on the \"Tensegrity Bobsled Track\".\n\nIt's a fixed path to Silent Knowledge!  One which you can learn to speed up.\n\nAnd for new people, \"Heightened Awareness\" is our goal. On that picture of the J curve bobsled track, it's the purple zone.\n\nNormally a double male, a \"Nagual\",  teaches apprentices by striking them on the left shoulder blade, to knock their assemblage point all the way through the middle to that purple line on the J curve.\n\nAnywhere there is wonderful for learning!  All knowledge known to man, or ever known, is available to them. Erratically.   More reliably if they make serious efforts.\n\nA perfect place to learn the real thing.\n\nBut the last part of that J curve track is where you become your own teacher.\n\nYou acquire full on \"Silent Knowledge\".  A continuous  flow of answers to all of your questions.\n\n\"*Seeing*\".\n\nWhich I had last night.\n\nAnd I got a lesson on how Tensegrity is pure GENIUS.\n\nYou can design your own custom \"bobsled track\" using all the Tensegrity forms Carlos gave us, and then use it daily in silence while observing your dark room for signs of progress.\n\nOver time you'll modify your ability to rock your little tensegrity bobsled slightly this way or that during a sequence of moves, and speed along faster.\n\nAt first you'll just see colors in the darkness. The way Zuleica instructed all of the apprentices of don Juan to do.\n\nBut then you'll see \"puffs\" when things inside you calm down enough for them to leave the outer walls of your luminous egg shell, to check out what you are doing in the middle.\n\nThose are your energy body!  Normally pushed to the o utside of the egg, by worry and grief.\n\nDoing the tensegrity is enough reduction in grief, to get your double's energy to come closer for a look.\n\nAnd you'll learn to scoop those \"puffs\" of colored light with your hands while doing the tensegrity moves, to gather them onto the energy pouches in the center.\n\nAs you get faster and faster moving along that J curve, you'll collect your energy body so well that your double will emerge to help you out.\n\nYou'll have another rider in your bobsled, helping you tilt it even a bit more, and with the expert skill only a supernatural entity like a double can bring.\n\nIf you're lucky you'll get  a Pikachu like spirit riding on the tail fins.   Suggesting moves to try to go even faster.  An inorganic being,  or \"Ally\" as they likely are once you can manage an image of Pikachu.\n\nI still can't get that one right...  Pikachu.\n\nBut I'm happy to have a scary female demon riding on my cart.  In a miniskirt if possible.\n\nWhat does this mean, from a practical point of view?\n\nIt means, instead of taking 3 hours to finish the bobsled course to Silent Knowledge, our desired destination if we hope to win this sorcery race, you can do it in 20 minutes.\n\nYou start your daily series of Tensegrity moves up at the blue line, in absolute darkness.\n\nAnd because you \"*know*\" this track, the way Carlos said he \"*knew*\" eggs from working as a cook in a diner in the desert as \"Joe Cordoba\", to perfect his silence, your whole body will understand the fastest way to travel along the J curve path.  And hopefully you've also been remembering to perfect your silence while doing the moves.\n\nWhen you finish your tensegrity forms you'll be standing in a realm of absolute magic, surrounding you all around.  Stuff no asian magic system follower even dares to dream of for real.\n\nIt comes from \"memorizing the course\" and adding a little Kylie style fierceness and flair to your moves.  \"Feeling the track\".\n\nThe *unbending intent* you can really ONLY HAVE, once you actually see it working and can test why.\n\nYou'll get to see why what worked did work, and add that to your \"feelings\" about doing Tensegrity.\n\nIf you become a good racer \"The Spirit\" itself will become a fan and cheer you on.\n\nBut I'd still like a Pikachu riding on the fins...\n\nI have a request of you.\n\nUntil you understand this post, could you cut back on the lust for Count Chocula Cereal?\n\nThat stuff makes you fat.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The \"Magic\" of Tensegrity Is An Intent Trail", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"w6cdsfagyf191": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40b0822962c4882836cfe0a0fc06ac40443d503a"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d94688d0fa3778b9cc6cb9952855b34a575f3b8"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f267e8ed2a039b5e55ae522758752bf0a09fabe8"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a98a2fc1bb3b861611ac83f5698ebddbd845685a"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6130014275e7a1b7f5d73903271e47cf5a66d8f8"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caf99ab664b553e4e092ddad99b8e4e24cce9de3"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e0ac251fa3b95150e618510ccbd7b65f9fe1de9"}, "id": "w6cdsfagyf191"}}, "name": "t3_uwtoln", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/e6lvizd4o__ODLXHPXQvRwP2_Wh9R6S9AWYIA9PzdaA.jpg", "edited": 1653415227.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1653406707.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e0ac251fa3b95150e618510ccbd7b65f9fe1de9\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/w6cdsfagyf191.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e0ac251fa3b95150e618510ccbd7b65f9fe1de9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever watched those bobsled races at the Olympics?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a fixed track.

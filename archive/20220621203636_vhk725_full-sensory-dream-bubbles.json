And unknown to me, on both sides of the tunnel.  With me, but also with the witch who lives through the tunnel, 6000 miles away.\n\nI honestly can't recall him doing that.  I figured he did that with Cholita, because I could hear them sometimes when Cholita didn't realize I was around.\n\nBut for me, Minx was never helpful.\n\nWe had a feud going for years, over Cholita.  He told me to my face, while pretending to be a little Irish boy, that he only listens to Cholita.\n\nAn interesting remark, seeing as how La Gorda told Carlos that don Juan had left some strands of his own awareness with him, which is why the allies obey him.\n\nThe very same allies Cholita and I play with now, since Carlos introduced his private class to them.\n\nAnd Carlos knew full well I had married Cholita.  Even nodded his agreement before I did it.\n\nSo he knew we'd end up interacting together for a long time.  He could easily have tinkered with Cholita a bit, to make her attractive to his allies.\n\nWhich are the same as the ones that pushed me into this subreddit!\n\nGood thing La Gorda mentioned that naguals can leave energy with apprentices when they leave this world, or I would have thought it too far fetched that Carlos gave Cholita some ability to control the allies.\n\nFairy, the other of the Allies of Carlos, was always more helpful to me.\n\nBut now, with Fairy in Argentina, I suppose Minx decided to help too.\n\nBy stealing 8 hours of my time...\n\nAll gone.  I got up in what I thought was early evening, and saw that the sun hadn't gone down yet.  Didn't seem possible, but there it was.   Sunlight leaking through a crack in the window.\n\nSo I got up to practice, thinking it would be an \"early night\", instead of realizing the truth.  It was morning and the night was gone.\n\nI did my passes, the ones taught to me by the Witch of the Tunnel. To make Bubble Station vivid as fast as possible.\n\nMinx materialized in a dream bubble, as some kind of weird evil Fairy.\n\nOr I assume it was Minx.\n\nThe strange thing was, I could feel the heat of his world radiating onto my face.\n\nI checked the room for the telltale signs of \"Silent Knowledge\".  That's where you reach the end of the J curve, and anywhere you look you can extract \"knowledge\".  That's what \"*seeing*\" is, in it's strongest form.  Silent Knowledge.  Something the old Men of Knowledge never reached.  It's what makes a \"seer\", a *seer*.\n\nI realized the amazing possibility of remaining in that mode all the time!\n\nMinx said, \"Dream bubbles are AMAZING in Silent Knowledge.  Look around!\"\n\nSo I did.  For a full hour.  It was utterly fascinating.\n\nOne I found of a kitchen, just some random view of the side of an oven,  came with smells.  When I first realized I could smell a pastry in the oven, Minx said \"It's silent knowledge.  It flows.  Don't stop now!\"\n\nI kept smelling.\n\nI detected some glue.  Not a horrible smell, but very obviously someone glued something recently.\n\nI tried to stick my head into the dream bubble to see what got glued.\n\n\"Stop it!\", Minx said.  \"You don't have that kind of dreaming energy.\"\n\nSo I kept smelling.   Perfume?  No, maybe some lotion?\"\n\n\"Look west!\", said Minx.\n\nI walked over and sat on the bed facing the west, and saw  a brass bell on the side of what must have been a ship made of high quality wood.  I could feel the salty sea air gently drifting in from the dream bubble. I could see over the finely finished wood, into the sky above the ship where the breeze must have been coming from.  A bell rang in the distance.  Absolutely clearly. I would have gone outside to see what caused it, but I was looking right at a bell that second.  Didn't occur to me it could be anywhere else.\n\nAnd yet, it was obviously a nautical bell on the shore.  I looked carefully to see if the bell I was viewing was ringing, or vibrating,  but it was clearly off in the distance. Quite distant away.\n\nMinx said, \"You think that's cool, just crawl in over there!\"\n\nWhere??  I looked where Minx had indicated, and saw a patch of antique objects.  Mostly smooth, nothing threatening.  There was \"space\" between the objects.\n\n\"You've been in there, remember?  Cholita's flat world of sheets on an endless mattress.\"\n\nMinx was right.  I did see how that \"world of random objects\" could be crawled into, the same as the one Cholita had shown me several times.\n\n\"Go in!\", Minx said.\n\nI complained, \"You said I don't have enough dreaming energy for that!\"\n\nHe explained, I had tried to physically stick my head into a dream bubble.  For that, I didn't have enough energy.  But my double could surely crawl into this object bubble, as long as my Tonal body remained standing in my darkroom.  I could be in 2 places at once if I liked.\n\nI found myself inside that dream bubble, feeling the smoothness of the objects. They moved aside as I pushed.\n\nThat dream bubble also contained \"objects\" that were themselves dream bubbles.  I could see them as my head moved deeper.  A bubble of someone's lost dream to the right, then a pepper grinder, then a wooden spoon, and to the left another lost dream.\n\nMinx said, \"It all comes together here.  Via the *abstract*.  Millions of dream bubbles, and random objects from exotic locations and alien worlds.\"\n\nI tried to back up and crawl back out, but Minx said, \"You're still standing in the room silly.\"\n\nHe was right. I was.  And hadn't lost my balance either.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Full Sensory Dream Bubbles", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"akcbk500o0791": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/akcbk500o0791.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f53dbffa5f8d1ba99f33f8c47636d6db1e1bf965"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/akcbk500o0791.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1ee6451f483619539a3e2563f1aee7d61efa035"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/akcbk500o0791.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54f335e8712662abbfeb3138c1e35eff2f7dd338"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/akcbk500o0791.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e59f1264bfe5a10f22880243404dcd04ee6a9f8"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/akcbk500o0791.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18771cc21158d3145ef483fa0cea200cf33234c0"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/akcbk500o0791.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcc8277c4754dd0a986cfdc475ebe2f1a7e2700"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/akcbk500o0791.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d1f30e8e14ec8518810bdcaf0042be3ea37a204"}, "id": "akcbk500o0791"}}, "name": "t3_vhk725", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/hW3hi-OaFIcTyH7IlEbGy22r1DNC00-bwDhc4kdGqGA.jpg", "edited": 1655837767.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1655836596.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/akcbk500o0791.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7d1f30e8e14ec8518810bdcaf0042be3ea37a204\"&gt;Smell, Touch, Heat and Cold are all possible in dream bubbles perceived in SK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx got lose last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decided to play &amp;quot;Dreaming Emissary&amp;quot;.

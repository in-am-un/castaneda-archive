He had earlier denied any allegations of impropriety in over-the-board chess, though he confessed to cheating on two occasions in online games. Niemann chalked those up as youthful errors, but Chess.com saw fit to ban him from the platform.  \nChess.com this month also indicated Niemann wasn\u2019t being forthright about the breadth of his cheating, saying in a statement that it had shared evidence with Niemann about his ban that \u201ccontradicts his statement regarding the amount and seriousness of his cheating on Chess.com.\u201d  \nIn Carlsen\u2019s statement, he said he considered withdrawing from the Sinquefield Cup when Niemann was invited to participate, but he chose to play anyway. Carlsen later resigned a game against Niemann in another event after making just a single move. \u201cSo far I have only been able to speak with my actions, and those actions have stated clearly that I am not willing to play chess with Niemann,\u201d he said.\n\nI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to eliminate cheating from online gaming. I first noticed the problem when playing VASL by email; my record in face-to-face and live online games was significantly better than in play-by-email (PBEM) games. I even did a statistical analysis that confirmed my suspicions; while my average dice rolls were the same in my live online games and my PBEM games and in line with statistical norms, my opponent\u2019s average rolls were a full point lower in PBEM games than in live online games and than statistical norms would indicate.\n\nWhat these cheaters were doing was playing the saved game, recording the play, then stopping when they got a result they didn\u2019t like, reloading the game, and replaying it. While most of their moves were honest, enough key rolls just happened to go their way to give them enough of an edge to win.\n\nIn like manner, it wasn\u2019t hard to tell the cheaters with targeting programs in online shooters. One rapid and improbable headshot is credible, five in a row are not. Unfortunately, while there has been some progress on this front over the last 10 years, most game developers are unwilling to ruthlessly apply statistical models to determine which players are cheating and punish them accordingly.\n\nSo, it\u2019s good that champion players like Carlsen are not only willing to refuse to play the cheaters, but are willing to call them out for their cheating. And what a flex on the part of the champion, to walk away from the game, give up the points, and go on to win the tournament anyhow.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cheaters Are Everywhere", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"u27zg5fpoeq91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u27zg5fpoeq91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b3d9a02c8a38302c806a2d68a11c06fb28b5186"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u27zg5fpoeq91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e508bf0972b1a8eee19957fd3eb80095f5d66cc"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u27zg5fpoeq91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66e8e91deb7ae7575977c0cc7a086e03c63ae36b"}], "s": {"y": 300, "x": 400, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u27zg5fpoeq91.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17a3cf2c3977967346c4ac0eed82af0912787719"}, "id": "u27zg5fpoeq91"}}, "name": "t3_xphbw2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/CtNgFUQ28M4rl1Sj6PX3BBiiJjs74lpQx72BFMfKAB8.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1664286605.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u27zg5fpoeq91.png?width=400&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=17a3cf2c3977967346c4ac0eed82af0912787719\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/u27zg5fpoeq91.png?width=400&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=17a3cf2c3977967346c4ac0eed82af0912787719&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out the world of chess is plagued by the same problems we have.

There was a round window (about 30 degrees to the right) in the fog if fromt of me. In the window i saw the perspective of someone waking into a store on the outskirts of town and there was a woman waving at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked for a second until a part of my rationality hit and i got hit with slight shock, so i pulled out of there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But right after that i immediately trying to go back, but instead i felt as of something was gaining speed, and as the dreaming window opened again i could see warm colors that where orange hills that seemed to be flying past me. They looked very weird and pixelated and &amp;quot;round&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then in a instant it all just zoomed passed me at i felt as if i had burned out my dreaming energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question i wouldn&amp;#39;t say it was a &amp;quot;solid window with borders&amp;quot; but more like a random opening with no clear borders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_xphbw2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xphbw2/cheaters_are_everywhere/iq6f2lv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1664326085.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1664326085.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iq5t47f", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1664316000.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iq5km75", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Making a phantom chess board more than twice is a huge project, but to succeed you'd have to clean your link to intent.\n\nSo it's as good of a choice as any.\n\nWhere was the dreaming window?\n\nAwake, right?

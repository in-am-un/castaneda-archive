Some call them \"demons\".\n\nA famous Tibetan saint is said to have gone to live with them.  It was posted recently.\n\nIn Jewish literature, demons bring on moods.  A demon of jealousy, a demon of greed, and so on.\n\nIOBs sort of feed off emotions, so it's consistent with what we know about them, if not book dealed a little too far.\n\nIt's the book dealing that kills magic.   Hides it in plain sight!\n\nSo cut that out guys.\n\nShame on you!\n\nWriting books isn't helpful.  It's why we have no magic anymore.\n\nNeither are delusional web pages or YouTube lectures on the Toltecs.\n\nGreed.  That's what that is.\n\nGreed is not sorcery.  Sorcery is not cozy.\n\nGreed is 100% about making yourself cozy.  It's the exact opposite of learning sorcery.\n\nHave you noticed, these days everyone tries to make their \"sorcery\" workshops cozy?\n\nCarlos tried to make them alien.  He even lectured on it a couple of times.\n\nHad 2 women with sunglasses in black spandex as I recall.\n\n(Don't ask.)\n\nHere's a description of an army of Rakshasas:\n\nIn the Maha Samaya Sutta, the defeated antagonist of the Buddha, Mara also known as Namuci or the \"Dark One\" is described as a corrupted Asura whose army consisted of \"Sensual passions, Discontent, Hunger and Thirst, Craving, Sloth and Drowsiness, Terror, Uncertainty, Hypocrisy and Stubbornness, Gains, Offerings, Fame and Status wrongly gained, and whoever would praise self and disparage others\" (Sn 3.2 Padhana Sutta). The Asuras try to capture the devas and bind them. However, not all Asuras are Rakshasas.\n\nIn Asia, the roofs have little curves on them, to catch the demons as they slide down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Supposedly IOBs get caught trying to slide down the roof](https://preview.redd.it/x4yu28sdn0161.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8de6c96f31daef95ba217e3c17681d5f3f6b3925)\n\nAnd little bells are put on doorways, to frighten them away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If you know people raised in China, look for stuff like this](https://preview.redd.it/yfn2exznn0161.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763d15e4ee3c87a762a7aa0f4b57e0c11718fdf2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[But usually they're more ornamental while still serving the same purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/xfn79yr1o0161.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d360ca927eb9cfec981abca9fbc280b2629e0aa)\n\nYogis are convinced Rakshasas hang out at bars, looking for weak people to attach themselves to. They ride on their back as they leave.\n\nWhich reminds me of when Carlos was explaining how the inorganic beings try to find any weakness, which they can pull on like a thread of yarn on a sweater. They'll keep pulling until they unravel it.\n\n\"Fancy\" has tried that with me a couple of times, but I told her to just go ahead.  And then she stopped.\n\nIt wasn't the reaction she was after.\n\nIn Taiwan, if you see a corner shrine, where people burn incense for their ancestors (and sometimes store their ashes like it was a mailbox rental business), you might be able to locate the exorcists shrine.\n\nIt's on a distant corner of that block of buildings.  A small thing, tucked away in a corner.  Shamans place exorcised spirits (IOBs?) in that box.\n\nIn  Thailand, there's a whole business around building spirit houses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The last Thai spirit house factory \\(taken over by China\\)?](https://preview.redd.it/he6u0thzp0161.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a200eadbc10885bf4949901c319865ce9a3a93d5)\n\nIf you visit, look at the apartments on the main road leading from the airport into Bangkok.  Most will have shiny golden houses hanging in the windows.\n\nThose are to give the \"good spirits\" a place to live.\n\nI'm a little confused on what they expect to show up. Buddha, God?\n\nBut they do believe in spirits.  There are black magic shops all over Bangkok.\n\nBut you can't go in there.  You need a Thai guide to get into the interesting ones.\n\nThey have creepy dolls with aborted fetus bones inside.  You love the doll like a child, and it's obligated to bring you good luck, in order to fulfill it's lack of Karma. It's trapped between incarnations until it has something of this world.\n\nAnd it can get that by helping the family that adopts it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some call them \\\\\"Haunted Dolls\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/ry4ga9krq0161.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14f839fa27a9e669f1c9dc5b2b5391aa7361751c)\n\nJackie Chan wears an amulet with the dust of dead children.  I couldn't find a picture of his. It's one of those topics that doesn't sit well in the west, so it's kind of secret.\n\nBut here's one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Is it real?  As real as you'd like it to be!](https://preview.redd.it/8bqpw1wjr0161.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76a435ad945cd3c2bb8a6506826e7fe0bd6af533)\n\nSome classify this as necromancing.  I've become a fan of that practice, since Cholita materialized a dead person for me, and I was able to do it myself.  Such activities are common in Thailand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If you google it, it will appear!](https://preview.redd.it/95ad1emcs0161.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4f72c556eae5f25d7bb2c9c32794b384d89e06d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[One of those black magic shops you'll have a hard time finding](https://preview.redd.it/3scig9fks0161.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e6f4616fcaf7ce7f66a010bcc671012cc892983)\n\nIf you like Asian black magic, keep in mind the Boxer Rebellion.  It caused sorcerers from China to flee to the following countries:  Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and one other I won't mention, just so you can have hope no matter where you go in Asia. But if you don't find a black magic shop, the bars are always open.  The girls can tell you about it. Just don't expect them to joke about it.  It's serious business over there.\n\nEdited to add more lovely pictures\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved":

Some call them &amp;quot;demons&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A famous Tibetan saint is said to have gone to live with them.  It was posted recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Jewish literature, demons bring on moods.  A demon of jealousy, a demon of greed, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs sort of feed off emotions, so it&amp;#39;s consistent with what we know about them, if not book dealed a little too far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the book dealing that kills magic.   Hides it in plain sight!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So cut that out guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shame on you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Writing books isn&amp;#39;t helpful.  It&amp;#39;s why we have no magic anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither are delusional web pages or YouTube lectures on the Toltecs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greed.  That&amp;#39;s what that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greed is not sorcery.  Sorcery is not cozy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greed is 100% about making yourself cozy.  It&amp;#39;s the exact opposite of learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed, these days everyone tries to make their &amp;quot;sorcery&amp;quot; workshops cozy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried to make them alien.  He even lectured on it a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had 2 women with sunglasses in black spandex as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Don&amp;#39;t ask.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a description of an army of Rakshasas:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the Maha Samaya Sutta, the defeated antagonist of the Buddha, Mara also known as Namuci or the &amp;quot;Dark One&amp;quot; is described as a corrupted Asura whose army consisted of &amp;quot;Sensual passions, Discontent, Hunger and Thirst, Craving, Sloth and Drowsiness, Terror, Uncertainty, Hypocrisy and Stubbornness, Gains, Offerings, Fame and Status wrongly gained, and whoever would praise self and disparage others&amp;quot; (Sn 3.2 Padhana Sutta). The Asuras try to capture the devas and bind them. However, not all Asuras are Rakshasas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Asia, the roofs have little curves on them, to catch the demons as they slide down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x4yu28sdn0161.png?width=825&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8de6c96f31daef95ba217e3c17681d5f3f6b3925\"&gt;Supposedly IOBs get caught trying to slide down the roof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And little bells are put on doorways, to frighten them away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yfn2exznn0161.png?width=312&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=763d15e4ee3c87a762a7aa0f4b57e0c11718fdf2\"&gt;If you know people raised in China, look for stuff like this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xfn79yr1o0161.png?width=1238&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9d360ca927eb9cfec981abca9fbc280b2629e0aa\"&gt;But usually they&amp;#39;re more ornamental while still serving the same purpose.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yogis are convinced Rakshasas hang out at bars, looking for weak people to attach themselves to. They ride on their back as they leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which reminds me of when Carlos was explaining how the inorganic beings try to find any weakness, which they can pull on like a thread of yarn on a sweater. They&amp;#39;ll keep pulling until they unravel it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; has tried that with me a couple of times, but I told her to just go ahead.  And then she stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t the reaction she was after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, if you see a corner shrine, where people burn incense for their ancestors (and sometimes store their ashes like it was a mailbox rental business), you might be able to locate the exorcists shrine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s on a distant corner of that block of buildings.  A small thing, tucked away in a corner.  Shamans place exorcised spirits (IOBs?) in that box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In  Thailand, there&amp;#39;s a whole business around building spirit houses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/he6u0thzp0161.png?width=900&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a200eadbc10885bf4949901c319865ce9a3a93d5\"&gt;The last Thai spirit house factory (taken over by China)?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you visit, look at the apartments on the main road leading from the airport into Bangkok.  Most will have shiny golden houses hanging in the windows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are to give the &amp;quot;good spirits&amp;quot; a place to live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little confused on what they expect to show up. Buddha, God?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do believe in spirits.  There are black magic shops all over Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t go in there.  You need a Thai guide to get into the interesting ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have creepy dolls with aborted fetus bones inside.  You love the doll like a child, and it&amp;#39;s obligated to bring you good luck, in order to fulfill it&amp;#39;s lack of Karma. It&amp;#39;s trapped between incarnations until it has something of this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it can get that by helping the family that adopts it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ry4ga9krq0161.png?width=782&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=14f839fa27a9e669f1c9dc5b2b5391aa7361751c\"&gt;Some call them \\&amp;quot;Haunted Dolls\\&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackie Chan wears an amulet with the dust of dead children.  I couldn&amp;#39;t find a picture of his. It&amp;#39;s one of those topics that doesn&amp;#39;t sit well in the west, so it&amp;#39;s kind of secret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8bqpw1wjr0161.png?width=1000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=76a435ad945cd3c2bb8a6506826e7fe0bd6af533\"&gt;Is it real?  As real as you&amp;#39;d like it to be!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some classify this as necromancing.  I&amp;#39;ve become a fan of that practice, since Cholita materialized a dead person for me, and I was able to do it myself.  Such activities are common in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/95ad1emcs0161.png?width=770&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e4f72c556eae5f25d7bb2c9c32794b384d89e06d\"&gt;If you google it, it will appear!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3scig9fks0161.png?width=854&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1e6f4616fcaf7ce7f66a010bcc671012cc892983\"&gt;One of those black magic shops you&amp;#39;ll have a hard time finding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you like Asian black magic, keep in mind the Boxer Rebellion.  It caused sorcerers from China to flee to the following countries:  Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and one other I won&amp;#39;t mention, just so you can have hope no matter where you go in Asia. But if you don&amp;#39;t find a black magic shop, the bars are always open.  The girls can tell you about it. Just don&amp;#39;t expect them to joke about it.  It&amp;#39;s serious business over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited to add more lovely pictures&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

The six realms are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The God Realm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demi-God Realm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Human Realm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Animal Realm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hungry Ghost Realm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hell Realm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demi-God, Desire, or Realm of the Asuras (jealous demigods\u00a0or titans. they are described as having three heads with three faces each and either four or six arms) wherein we experience the fruits of wholesome karma while engaging in unwholesome karma.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Realm_of_asuras\"&gt;Absurdly Complicated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the\u00a0Verses on the Structure of the\u00a0Eight Consciousnesses reads: &amp;quot;to birth in saints the last body temperature in top of head, to deva in eyes, to human in heart, to hungry ghosts in belly, to animals in knee cap, to the hells-realm in sole of feet.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems directly analogous to &amp;quot;up from our toes!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_realm\"&gt;Desire Realm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;The\u00a0Deva domain\u00a0(also known as the\u00a0God domain\u00a0or\u00a0Blissful State) is the domain of bliss. The disadvantage of this domain is that things are so very comfortable there, that these beings completely neglect to work towards enlightenment. Instead they gradually use up the good karma they had previously accumulated, and so they subsequently fall to a lower rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Deva domain is sometimes also referred to as the\u00a0gods&amp;#39; domain, because its inhabitants are so powerful within their own domain, that compared to humans, they resemble the\u00a0gods\u00a0of\u00a0Greek\u00a0or\u00a0Roman mythology. However, while the\u00a0Devas\u00a0may be referred to as gods, they are not immortal, omniscient, nor omnipotent, and they do not act as creators or judges at death.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the realm of the Saints is above those I listed, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Land_Buddhism\"&gt;Pure Land&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A Buddhist saint is one who has escaped samsara or existence all together and gone beyond what is possible in the heavenly realms. A Buddhist saint would live in the Dharma realms or wherever he chooses to be to help living beings. A saint in Buddhism is one who, like the Buddha, has become enlightened, possessing some of the skills and wisdom of a Buddha. They have gained control over life and death and are thus liberated...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://xuanfa.net/introduction-to-buddhism/holy-beings/\"&gt;Holy Beings (Saints)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jzkvw4/rakshasas/gdcxnsh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1606158828.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_jzkvw4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gdd2b4h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1606160996.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gdcy01x", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "If you took just 5 of them, and spread them apart a few inches, that's like what I saw 2 nights ago.\n\nI made the mistake of inviting them to come visit whenever they liked, and then Cholita threw a party for them.\n\nExcept she didn't show up while I was there.

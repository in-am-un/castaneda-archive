And then you want to do that again the next night, so you try to cause it by doing what you were doing the night before.\n\nEXCEPT, the night before you were not trying to do that.  So you now have a major force going on in your brain, scrambling intent.  Not going to work!\n\nThere's no way you can duplicate that situation, by \"trying\". You just add your nasty self's idea of how to \"try\", to the mix.\n\nFrankly, the best policy is to give up on ever trying to do anything, or expect anything, and just be grateful for what you get.\n\nI do that lately.  I get so silent that things \"offer\" themselves to me.\n\nBut then there's the perplexing case of \"practical magic\".\n\nSomething you figure out how to do every time.\n\nI guess that's there to keep us honest.\n\nYou could get a fat head just waiting around for intent to bring you a nice big gift.  Sitting on your throne of silence, looking at stuff floating in the air, saying, \"No, I had some of that last week.  I'll wait for the next one.\"\n\nYou can literally do that. I do.\n\nBut since practical magic exists, and is super fun, you still have to worry you missed something if you turn into King Merlin and just wait around for infinity to serve you.\n\nAnd, you're ignoring the main point in your questions!\n\nSilence.\n\nEveryone tends to do that.  \n\nLooking for a way to get out of work?\n\nCan I abstain?  Give up smoking?  Be a better person?\n\nDonate to charity?\n\nNo.  \n\nYou have to suffer, suffer, suffer.\n\nInstead of giving to the church, think Jesus on the cross, suffering.\n\nThat's what you have to do.\n\nThere's no shortcut.\n\nNo silence, no magic.\n\nThe tensegrity merely moves energy around, but without the silence it's not going to do anything noticeable.\n\nCarlos was desperate to get us to practice silence.  He had sticks, rocks, crystals, paper weights, pressure points.\n\nHe finally made longer and longer tensegrity forms, hoping we'd be so preoccupied trying to remember, we'd stop fantasizing in our mind, and our assemblage point would move.\n\nBut everyone spent their time looking at the next person's butt, while doing the tensegrity.\n\nSo that failed too.\n\nDaily he encouraged us, and asked about progress in learning silence.\n\nHe finally had us do it in class, because he figured we weren't doing it at all outside.\n\nBut when Cleargreen took over completely, they forgot that part.\n\nAnd gave people the impression Tensegrity was enough.\n\nYes, it could be...\n\nBut won't.  \n\nWhen you get silent, you'll both realize why it could be, and why it never will.\n\nLook...\n\nKungfu is not inferior to Tensegrity.\n\nBut kungfu temples produce no one who can do magic. Just a lot of people wanting to wear the bad ass robes or belts, only \"masters\" can wear.\n\nIt doesn't work there anymore either.\n\nSmoking?  Smoking is ok.  Helpful even, except that you'll die coughing your lungs out.\n\nDon't over eat. I stop eating at 5PM.  \n\nBut if you don't have an acid stomach problem, just don't stuff yourself like a freight train.\n\nSex, I can't answer that.

But not impossible at all.\n\nTHC is an issue over 50mg.  It dulls you drastically.\n\nUnder 50mg, just let it wear off.  Or skip the edibles and smoke it only, and you should be unable to exceed the 50, unless you have dreadlocks you didn't mention.\n\nOr even, don't let it wear off.  It's not a barrier in and of itself. It's the \"hangover\" that dulls you.\n\nTrouble with not waiting for it to wear off is, it's like being robbed if you do something amazing.  You don't know if you would have, without the THC.\n\nAnswer: you would have.  But still, don't do it high.\n\nYou can't increase impeccable behavior. You have no way to know what that is,  until you can do some real magic.\n\nYou'll just puff yourself up like the entire Castaneda crowd, and never get anywhere.\n\nYou'll turn angry and violent if you pretend to be impeccable.\n\nHow to get to the point that you can control the world?\n\nI can describe it for you.\n\nYou become so silent that you can say, \"Spatula!\" and then one materializes in front of you.\n\nYou don't keep saying, \"Spatula!\" over and over, to \"practice it\".\n\nYou can't practice it!

It's your dreaming double.\n\nOnce you learn to do that, building an entire village is just a matter of intending each object, and that it should remain, and gazing at them so they get burned into reality.\n\nYou can also produce your own reality by \"pulling\" it from somewhere else, using your hands.\n\nBut that's really weird.

And then you want to do that again the next night, so you try to cause it by doing what you were doing the night before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EXCEPT, the night before you were not trying to do that.  So you now have a major force going on in your brain, scrambling intent.  Not going to work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way you can duplicate that situation, by &amp;quot;trying&amp;quot;. You just add your nasty self&amp;#39;s idea of how to &amp;quot;try&amp;quot;, to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the best policy is to give up on ever trying to do anything, or expect anything, and just be grateful for what you get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do that lately.  I get so silent that things &amp;quot;offer&amp;quot; themselves to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then there&amp;#39;s the perplexing case of &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something you figure out how to do every time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;#39;s there to keep us honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could get a fat head just waiting around for intent to bring you a nice big gift.  Sitting on your throne of silence, looking at stuff floating in the air, saying, &amp;quot;No, I had some of that last week.  I&amp;#39;ll wait for the next one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally do that. I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since practical magic exists, and is super fun, you still have to worry you missed something if you turn into King Merlin and just wait around for infinity to serve you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, you&amp;#39;re ignoring the main point in your questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone tends to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for a way to get out of work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can I abstain?  Give up smoking?  Be a better person?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donate to charity?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to suffer, suffer, suffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving to the church, think Jesus on the cross, suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No silence, no magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity merely moves energy around, but without the silence it&amp;#39;s not going to do anything noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was desperate to get us to practice silence.  He had sticks, rocks, crystals, paper weights, pressure points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He finally made longer and longer tensegrity forms, hoping we&amp;#39;d be so preoccupied trying to remember, we&amp;#39;d stop fantasizing in our mind, and our assemblage point would move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But everyone spent their time looking at the next person&amp;#39;s butt, while doing the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that failed too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daily he encouraged us, and asked about progress in learning silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He finally had us do it in class, because he figured we weren&amp;#39;t doing it at all outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when Cleargreen took over completely, they forgot that part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And gave people the impression Tensegrity was enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it could be...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But won&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get silent, you&amp;#39;ll both realize why it could be, and why it never will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kungfu is not inferior to Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But kungfu temples produce no one who can do magic. Just a lot of people wanting to wear the bad ass robes or belts, only &amp;quot;masters&amp;quot; can wear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t work there anymore either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smoking?  Smoking is ok.  Helpful even, except that you&amp;#39;ll die coughing your lungs out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t over eat. I stop eating at 5PM.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you don&amp;#39;t have an acid stomach problem, just don&amp;#39;t stuff yourself like a freight train.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sex, I can&amp;#39;t answer that. I&amp;#39;m celibate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suspect Juan has women after him, and Lidotska surely has men available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they noticed a problem, they would have mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t let someone control you with the sex, to stop you from practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is ok, just don&amp;#39;t exceed 3 drinks a day, or it&amp;#39;ll be harder.

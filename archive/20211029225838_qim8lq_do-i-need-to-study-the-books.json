The super powers are inevitable once you do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one would be interested in &amp;quot;learn to move your assemblage point&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a laxative...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like the summary of all of sorcery, which Carlos gave in that last interview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His most advanced explanation of what we&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If people only heard that, there wouldn&amp;#39;t be any Castaneda fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: In the context of your cognitive system, what does it mean to be free?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CC: In the context of my cognitive system ... it is not my cognitive system ... in the cognitive system of the shamans of ancient Mexico, to be free means to free oneself from the bonds of socialization and syntax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please notice his relentless attempts to keep pointing back to the source of the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; we follow, to prevent people from changing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the witches said, the private classes failed because people only succeeded in turning Carlos into a guru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never learned to follow the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to move their assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_qim8lq", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qim8lq/do_i_need_to_study_the_books/hio1x8j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1635616046.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1635616046.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hinwl56", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hins6lw", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "&gt;Something else I saw last night.

That's a real barrier, although I'm not sure everyone will hit it.\n\nThis is the \"Silent Knowledge Swarm\".\n\nRevenge of the \"answers\".\n\nIt happens right on the edge of my limits of sorcery ability.\n\nJust when I want to push another inch forward, and see what amazing magic is now possible.\n\nIf I give in and rush to write all the \"knowledge\" down, I don't push that limit.    My assemblage point has to move back, in order to write it down.\n\nWhich is probably why don Juan told Carlos to just write with his finger in the air.\n\nIf I give in and go write it down, it takes 2 or 3 days to return there.  To that assemblage point position.\n\nEssentially, the gist of what I *saw* is, our darkroom needs improving.   But, it can't be improved without risk.\n\nIt isn't specific enough.\n\nThere are in fact fixed things you could \"look for\" to move yourself along faster.\n\nAnd some that should clearly be ignored because they're prone to abuse by the book deal mind.\n\nAll we currently \"look for\" is the puffs, because that's all Carlos emphasized in private classes.\n\nAnd when we clear those out and get to the orange zone, we have no more instructions. It's assumed people will find things on their own out there.\n\nBut that's a mistake...  You need even MORE instruction in the orange zone.  There's just too much magic over there, and some is more useful than others.\n\nThe puffs seem to be emphasized in the Tensegrity.  Scooping puffs to rebuild your energy body.\n\nBut there's far more crazy stuff in the tensegrity.  Poking holes in \"membranes\" for example.  Pouring stuff over your head after scooping it from the floor.\n\nLast night I started to mentally list the items I *saw*.  Hoping I would remember them the next day.\n\nWhile trying to keep track of \"Tell them to see this first, then that, then that...\" I wondered if I could describe them adequately, and do they vary a little so that the description will be too wrong to be useful?\n\nAnd I got another \"presentation\" on the horrors of beginners.\n\nI'd use some specific examples, but the people who did that would recognize them.\n\nSo let's say, you're telling someone to look for a little doll floating in the pink vapors.\n\nAnd a beginner instantly thinks, \"Like the Chucky movie, where the doll comes to life and murders everyone!\"\n\nIt catches his fancy, and he starts telling lies about his practices.  The mood changes to a horror film mood, and he can't seem to get out of it, once he starts lying.\n\nAnd he never learns.\n\nWe see that sort of problem with OBE and Astral Travel People.\n\nThey're \"tainted\" with false narratives, and have been taught to seek attention from those, in discussions.\n\nSo they come here expecting it's normal to misrepresent things, to get attention.\n\nBut we can't have that.  That can happen in other places, because they have no magic at all.\n\nIt's all made up magic over there.\n\nBut social pressures there make it rude or \"you are not inclusive\" to point out lies and deceptions which harm beginners.\n\nWhen you try to give too many specifics on how to do darkroom, you hook into the false narratives people have picked up in the phony magic discussion groups.\n\nSo you might speed up talented people, but you'll be bombarded by the semi-bad players reverting to their made up experience sharing.\n\nWhich harms the *intent* of this place.\n\nYou help the ones who didn't need help, and harm the ones who need it most.\n\nI suspect it's why when asked for specifics, Carlos looked around a bit and smiled, and didn't give them.\n\nHe'd nudge his head to Taisha or Florinda, and see if they felt like answering.\n\nWhich they did not.  But they gave in to pressure and answered.\n\nWe need some guidance.  Some instructions.\n\nBut only enough to insure the person is standing in front of the right path through the forest.\n\nIf you start telling them to look for the yellow tree, and don't go behind the big boulders along the path,  you give them the sense they know what's going on.\n\nSome are so far gone, they'll decide to go behind the big boulders anyway, so they can \"defeat\" whatever you think is a problem, and get fast attention for themselves.\n\nBut the bad players are easy to predict. They want attention.\n\nIf you give them the feeling they \"understand\", they behave badly.\n\nIf you leave them in the dark, they aren't sure enough of themselves to try to use something to get attention.\n\nYou leave them in doubt, so that they're afraid of being \"wrong\" when they relate their experiences, and they behave better.  \n\nMore cautiously.\n\nOf course, you only need to get a nasty beginner to some actual magic, and their attitude changes.  They go from seeking fake attention, to realizing there's real magic out there, and they won't get more of it, if they keep behaving badly.\n\nAnd that's the best \"map\".  One that doesn't describe more than it needs to.\n\nAnd lets the explorer discover things for themselves.\n\nBut if the map is too bare, you won't motivate anyone.\n\nYou'll be like boring old Cleargreen. They're such \"purists\" they turned everyone off, and nearly lost it all.\n\nThat's the problem...  Balancing motivation, against encouraging bad behavior.\n\nLast night I got some AMAZING specifics you could tell people as darkroom instructions.\n\nAll of which could make the situation worse at a time it seems to work well enough to help a good 1/4th of people who decide to try.", "edited": 1635611272.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hino1nj", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll make a picture showing it all.

I thought it was so obvious, and if you read all the posts, you get what you need.\n\nBut that's a lot of posts!\n\nAnd you should know, we only have a certain amount of \"energy\".\n\nThink of it like an old lady, compared to when she was 15.\n\nHow vibrant and observant she was at 15, and how dull and out of it she is now.\n\nThat's the energy of awareness.\n\nIf that old lady tried darkroom techniques, she'd fall asleep.\n\nIf she slept for 24 hours to make sure she wasn't sleepy, she'd be lucky to see any colors at all.\n\nAnd she wouldn't be able to keep her attention on looking for them.\n\nIn her younger self, she might easily have found brilliant colors from the start.\n\nThat's \"energy\".\n\nIf you read the books, you might have picked up tips for saving energy.\n\nSo you'd start out with better experiences, without really knowing why.\n\nAll of the techniques from the books help you \"save energy\".\n\nBUT, people did that for decades!\n\nNO ONE LEARNED ANY SORCERY!\n\n10,000 or more people went to workshops, millions read his books avidly, and not a single person managed to learn enough to be worth telling anyone about.\n\nMost didn't even get far enough to realize that!  They get really angry when they read me write that.\n\nHow dare he???\n\nBut it's the absolute truth.\n\nSo, the MOST important thing actually is, SEE SOME MAGIC AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!!!!\n\nBefore you move on, get distracted, get a new lover, hit the lottery, or develop some cancer that leaves you in too much pain to practice.\n\n\"Get over the Hump\"!\n\nThat means, the best way to learn is get into that darkroom tonight.  Don't put it off!\n\nBut in the darkroom, you MUST follow the rules. If not, it will work very poorly.\n\n**# 1 rule.  You CANNOT learn this.**\n\nIt just doesn't work that way!  Everything in your life has convinced you,  you would be learning to do this.  By your own cleverness, or hard work, or vitamin regimen.\n\nSomething you believe makes you \"special\".\n\nIt doesn't work that way!\n\nThere's an outside force that's conscious, and which makes your reality.\n\nNOTHING in your reality, comes from anything but that force of intent.\n\nIt's not like, \"Well, of course donuts aren't made by intent!\"\n\nOr \"Particle physics can't possibly be caused by intent!\"\n\nI'm afraid, it is. Both come from intent.\n\nWe are in fact merely learning to \"clean our link to intent\".\n\nIt's like we have a very rich uncle.\n\nWe can get our little news paper delivery route, and earn $200 a month.\n\nAnd tell ourselves, we're learning to be wealthy like our uncle.\n\nForget it.\n\nJust please the old bastard, so he hands you the cash.\n\nThe magic.\n\nSo you MUST summon *intent*.  You'll have to read around in here to figure out how to do that.\n\nHere's a possibly better analogy I never used before.\n\nWe live in a virtual reality.  We're the only one in there, but we got bumped on the head and forgot it was not real.\n\nThere's only one way to \"win\" this game.  You MUST stick to the rules.\n\nI'm giving them to you here.\n\n**# 2 rule: You MUST pass though all of those colored stages on the J curve diagram.**\n\nTHIS ONE:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even\\_better\\_j\\_curve\\_diagram/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/)\n\nIf you go into the darkroom thinking you're so clever  you'll start copying the experiences someone has in the orange zone, before you even get to the green, you are doomed.\n\nYou're seeking attention, and will NEVER please that wealthy uncle.\n\nIf he knows you're faking him out, he won't give you the cash.\n\nSo don't go up to the uncle and tell him, \"Guess what uncle!  I found a gold mine just like the one you have!\"\n\nYou'll just piss him off.\n\nFollow the J curve map!    Print one out even, buy some \"stick on gold stars\" at the stationary store, and when you do a new picture give yourself a gold star right next to it.\n\nIf you skipped ahead, go ahead and put a \"conditional gold star\" there,  leaving it only half stuck on so you can pull it off when you realize your mistake, and look into it later when you've gotten a little further on the normal path.\n\nPast the middle between green and red, the order of cool stuff can vary wildly.\n\nIt's your wealthy uncle.  He might give you more than you ought to get that night, because you pleased him with hard work.\n\n**# 3 rule:  You MUST emphasize silence above all else.** If you stop doing that, you're screwed.\n\nYou CANNOT get to our destination, the orange zone, with anything other than absolute silence.  Not the audio kind.  Mental silence.  And mind free of fantasies.\n\nWhen you get to the orange zone and have a Fairy opening a portal to another planet, assuring you it's safe to leap in there,  you might get a little cocky.\n\nThink you're so cool, you can just go with the flow.\n\nWrong!!!  You STILL have to emphasize silence above anything else. Or you will slowly move back to where you came from.\n\nSilence should change the further you move, until one day you're right up against the purple zone at the end, and realize you have NEVER been silent before.\n\nIt was all a lie.\n\nAnd now, you can see it.\n\nYou take a step across the threshold, whatever it seems to be, and the world disintegrates.\n\nInstantly.\n\nSo you jump back over the line and realize, it's true.  You were never silent all along.\n\nIt's why Carlos, after possibly 20 years of constantly forcing himself silent, decided to give it all up, become a fry cook, change his name, and move to a cheap apartment in the desert.\n\nCooking eggs.\n\nBecause he finally realized, he needed to work even harder on silence.\n\nWe don't have to do that...\n\nI don't know why.  I suspect our rich uncle cuts us some slack, because we're doing all the work ourselves and don't have a real teacher.\n\nThat force of intent is super intelligent.\n\n**# 4 rule:  You MUST build your energy body by using Tensegrity to redeploy energy.**  You must mash it, stir it around, and scoop it onto your torso.\n\nIf you don't do that, you won't have a body for your \"double\" to use.\n\nIt'll just float around \"out there\", unable to come help you much.\n\nYou have to build it a snowman.\n\nOr build one of those Golem statues.\n\nSo that the spirit can take over the clay body.\n\nBut in our case, the body is the puffs of color, carefully applied to our torso in the right spots.\n\nYou'll have to read around to find those.  The comic book page 2 or 3 shows the places.\n\nIt's in here.\n\nWhile building that energy body, you MUST wiggle your fingers in it once in a while. The spot is 18 inches out from your stomach, at the point 2 inches below the actual stomach inside your body, and 4 inches to the right.  You need to wiggle there daily, so that you eventually create a \"dent\".  The puffs of light build that body, the wiggling finishes it so you can switch over.\n\n**# 5 rule:  you MUST find an inorganic being and  get some dark energy.**  OR, you must find an angry witch, and get her to kick your ass.\n\nIf you don't, likely you'll be stuck somewhere between the green line, and the bottom.\n\nIt takes \"dark energy\" to move the assemblage point the way sorcerers do.\n\nYou can move it the way Buddhists and Yogis do, and that will get you to the red zone.\n\nBut not further.\n\nYou need to seek out spirits in the puffs.\n\n**#6 rule:  You MUST compress the puffs with your hands, and scoop them, until you can play with them like they were real**.  They should behave like purple shaving cream, and not move when your eyes move.\n\nThey MUST get \"real\".\n\nThis is the only way you will hook yourself to the correct *intent*.\n\nYou have to please THE wealthy uncle.\n\nYou can't please any old wealthy uncle.\n\nHas to be the one that Carlos knew.\n\nAnd that guy needs you to play with the puffs using your hands, and the Tensegrity moves.\n\n**#7 rule:  If you add ANYTHING to this you only make it more difficult.**\n\nIf you sign off your posts with \"Light and Love\", you are screwed.\n\nThat's another mood.   A mood where people and attention seeking is king, and magic isn't real.\n\nIf you worry \"what would Jesus do?\", you are in pretty bad shape.\n\nIf you think you are \"escaping the cycle of birth and death\", hang it up.  You'll never make it.\n\nReligion should be kept at church, if you must  have some.\n\nNot in the darkroom.\n\nIf you think you have some technical advantage because you read about the Dantian, or Zen in the art of archery, or you used to love that psychic on the Art Bell show, you've tied a 20 pound weight around each ankle.\n\nYou might run a little, but not very far.\n\nNow, if you are a woman, forget everything I just said.\n\nCopy someone.\n\nBUT, you'll be better off if you still follow those instructions.", "edited": 1635546251.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hikf518", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More important is that you understand the technique we are using, so you don&amp;#39;t eliminate critical elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really need to draw up some instructions.

They get really angry when they read me write that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How dare he???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s the absolute truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the MOST important thing actually is, SEE SOME MAGIC AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you move on, get distracted, get a new lover, hit the lottery, or develop some cancer that leaves you in too much pain to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get over the Hump&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, the best way to learn is get into that darkroom tonight.  Don&amp;#39;t put it off!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the darkroom, you MUST follow the rules. If not, it will work very poorly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;# 1 rule.  You CANNOT learn this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just doesn&amp;#39;t work that way!  Everything in your life has convinced you,  you would be learning to do this.  By your own cleverness, or hard work, or vitamin regimen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something you believe makes you &amp;quot;special&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an outside force that&amp;#39;s conscious, and which makes your reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOTHING in your reality, comes from anything but that force of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like, &amp;quot;Well, of course donuts aren&amp;#39;t made by intent!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;Particle physics can&amp;#39;t possibly be caused by intent!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, it is. Both come from intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are in fact merely learning to &amp;quot;clean our link to intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like we have a very rich uncle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can get our little news paper delivery route, and earn $200 a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And tell ourselves, we&amp;#39;re learning to be wealthy like our uncle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just please the old bastard, so he hands you the cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you MUST summon &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.  You&amp;#39;ll have to read around in here to figure out how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a possibly better analogy I never used before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We live in a virtual reality.  We&amp;#39;re the only one in there, but we got bumped on the head and forgot it was not real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s only one way to &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; this game.  You MUST stick to the rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m giving them to you here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;# 2 rule: You MUST pass though all of those colored stages on the J curve diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THIS ONE:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you go into the darkroom thinking you&amp;#39;re so clever  you&amp;#39;ll start copying the experiences someone has in the orange zone, before you even get to the green, you are doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re seeking attention, and will NEVER please that wealthy uncle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he knows you&amp;#39;re faking him out, he won&amp;#39;t give you the cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t go up to the uncle and tell him, &amp;quot;Guess what uncle!  I found a gold mine just like the one you have!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll just piss him off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Follow the J curve map!    Print one out even, buy some &amp;quot;stick on gold stars&amp;quot; at the stationary store, and when you do a new picture give yourself a gold star right next to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you skipped ahead, go ahead and put a &amp;quot;conditional gold star&amp;quot; there,  leaving it only half stuck on so you can pull it off when you realize your mistake, and look into it later when you&amp;#39;ve gotten a little further on the normal path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Past the middle between green and red, the order of cool stuff can vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s your wealthy uncle.  He might give you more than you ought to get that night, because you pleased him with hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;# 3 rule:  You MUST emphasize silence above all else.&lt;/strong&gt; If you stop doing that, you&amp;#39;re screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You CANNOT get to our destination, the orange zone, with anything other than absolute silence.  Not the audio kind.  Mental silence.  And mind free of fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get to the orange zone and have a Fairy opening a portal to another planet, assuring you it&amp;#39;s safe to leap in there,  you might get a little cocky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think you&amp;#39;re so cool, you can just go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wrong!!!  You STILL have to emphasize silence above anything else. Or you will slowly move back to where you came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence should change the further you move, until one day you&amp;#39;re right up against the purple zone at the end, and realize you have NEVER been silent before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was all a lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You take a step across the threshold, whatever it seems to be, and the world disintegrates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you jump back over the line and realize, it&amp;#39;s true.

It might suddenly leap in front of him, in the most horrendous appearance, or it might grab the man from the back and not turn him loose and keep him pinned down for hours. It might also topple a tree on him. Don Juan said that those were truly dangerous forces, and although they could not kill a man hand to hand, they could cause his death by fright, or by actually letting objects fall on him, or by appearing suddenly and causing him to stumble, lose his footing, and go over a precipice.\"\n\nTurns out, this explanation is literal!\n\nTrue.\n\nBut how can an IOB push hard enough to topple a tree?\n\nOr for that matter, how could an IOB toss a bunch of metal parts on the floor, and make a huge clanking sound?\n\nThat's what I heard just an hour or two ago, while working in my warehouse.\n\nAnswer: they're a LOT smarter than we are.  They can find something to manipulate, which doesn't take much force.\n\nWhen I heard the crashing sound of metal just a while ago, at first I thought it was an electrical pipe that got pushed over.\n\nWe have 8 foot pipes leaning against the walls here and there, from installing electrical wiring.\n\nGalvanized steel makes a unique sound, and it sounded like it had to be very long, to account for the amount of tinkling and rattling.\n\nThe sound wasn't instant. It lasted a few seconds.\n\nI thought a pipe must have bounced a bit.  So I went looking for it in the warehouse.\n\nAnother \"leap of faith\" regarding inorganic beings.\n\nI highly recommend those.\n\nYou'll be rewarded when it turns out not to be as silly as it seems.\n\n\"Fancy\" agrees. She just flew overhead.\n\nLast night I was playing with a new entity I found on a puff of purple color.\n\nShe was a strange one.  Not expressive like \"Fairy\". At least, not in her face.\n\nBut she's expressive with her clothing and changes to other beings.\n\nI suppose you could say, she likes shopping!\n\nI found her a few days ago, and after an initial attempt to scare me she quickly decided I like ladies fashions better.\n\nOddly, some of the stuff looks Cholita suitable.\n\nI decided to name her, \"Fancy\", because it's easier to deal with IOBs if you give them a name.\n\nAnd just so you don't worry your name is silly or inappropriate, don't forget Phoebus and Globus.\n\nIf those aren't dubious names, I don't know what is.\n\nThanks witches!\n\nThey always think of helping us out.  Teach by example I suppose.\n\n\"Fancy\" selected clothing like Cholita might wear, when going to Beverly Hills.  Little tufts, tassels, and lace, where none was really needed.\n\nPuffy, expensive clothes.\n\nShop owners, watch out when Cholita comes knocking!\n\nIf I'm there, it'll be the biggest sale that month!\n\nIf not, the inventory might come up a little short.\n\nIt's Cholita. She's a \"scout\".  She goes out, and brings back things to show me.\n\nBut if you find a new inorganic being, you need to give them some energy or they aren't very useful.\n\nMy strategy was to play a game with her.\n\nFind the energy.\n\nI sweep my hand around all over, 360 degrees, looking for brighter colors I can pull down.  If she's in the path, I put it on her.\n\nIf she's not around, I put it on my torso.\n\nShe quickly understood that game.  Within a half hour she was always there where the brightness was, the instant I made up my mind to scoop over there.\n\nI was expecting her to get more and more solid with each \"feeding\", but it just doesn't work that way.\n\nThere seems to be no cause and effect. Except that, over time, she did in fact start showing more of herself.\n\nFirst the upper half of her body, instead of just her head.\n\nThen I saw a full body, but at an angle, hidden behind purple mists.\n\nI never got her fully solid last night, but she did walk across the floor for me.  Missing her feet.\n\nAnd then I decided I'm not going far enough each night, on that J curve. I keep telling you guys to move it as far as  you can every day, and then I don't take my own advice.\n\nI knew I needed to force silence until my breathing changed.\n\nI had been playing with Fancy too much.\n\nHeightened awareness is easy to detect, aside from the magic floating in the air.\n\nUntil the breathing changes, as described by Carlos for the Nagual's blow, you aren't in heightened awareness.\n\nOnce it does, and remains changed for at least 30 seconds, you're there.\n\nAnd it'll remain the next day!\n\nThe instant my breath changed, I found myself looking at a curved surface, made from soil.\n\nIt was vague.  Transparent.\n\nBut it had a weird feeling.\n\nI wondered, could it be an inorganic beings realm?\n\nI saw 3 entities stuck in the wall, and reached in to grab the closest one.\n\nIt was still very vague.  Like pushing your hand into a projection of a movie, onto very light smoke.\n\nI pulled the entity towards me, and it stretched like taffy.\n\nThen I pushed it back, trying not to have to actually touch it.\n\nIt got the hang of it, and I managed to wave it towards me, no contact, then wave it back.\n\nContact is a bad idea.  The perspective is all wrong.\n\nBut waving the hand, and letting the being do the moving, makes it easier to comprehend.\n\nAfter all, you're not supposed to be able to make your hand stretch 8 feet into another world!\n\nSo I cut out the middle man and just used gestures.\n\nAs if my palm and fingers could tell it what to do.\n\nAfter pushing and pulling a few times, and despite having told myself the next chance I got I was going to do that as long as possible, I gave up.\n\nIt was too transparent and vague. I doubted that little amount could produce an inorganic being capable of pushing objects for me, the way Cholita can get Fairy to push on dim sum plates.\n\nThe next day, I was still in heightened awareness as expected.\n\nAt work, I saw a black dot dart past me, when I wrote on Reddit. They tend to do that.  This sub has an energy they like. Even reading it moves assemblage points a bit.\n\nI suppose you could say, this subreddit is infested with inorganic beings.\n\nI just like saying that, to tease the \"impeccable warriors\" out there!\n\nIt's a joke, although it is in fact, almost surely true.\n\nI also saw a larger white cloud go by.  Larger than he golf ball sized puff of smoke, which Fairy uses to travel.\n\nThis large one floated away and disappeared.\n\nBut it had a color to it. A distinct color.\n\nAnd it was not pink, like Fairy.\n\nI called out to it:\n\n\"Hey Fancy!  Just show yourself.  Don't hide.\"\n\nNothing happened.\n\nBut 10 minutes or so later, I heard a loud crash in the dark warehouse.\n\nI was up in the front offices.\n\nI doubted that was possible.\n\nIt must have been just outside our warehouse, near the back door.\n\nThere was no reason for anything to fall.  Everything had been there a very long time, and was quite stable.\n\nRemembering the good results that came from believing Fairy when she put me up to drawing and posting \"Fairy's Pass\", I decided to investigate.\n\nBesides, I had a vague memory don Juan told Carlos, you need to go verify if a branch had really broken, when you hear that sound while hunting inorganic beings.\n\nFirst I opened the back door and looked outside. To make sure the sound really did come from inside.\n\nNo cars, no trucks, no people. Nothing.\n\nIt's Sunday.  There's no reason for anyone to be out there in our back parking lot.\n\nI closed the door.  It was quite dark in that warehouse, but I clearly saw the white cloud flying into the next half of the warehouse.\n\nI didn't think to follow it, because the last time it disappeared.\n\nSo searched until I found what you see in that picture.\n\nTurns out, it was on the other side of the door the white cloud had just flown into.\n\nIt tried to get me to look over there.\n\nFortunately, I did it on my own, after searching everywhere else.\n\nI reached down, picked one up and dropped it.\n\nIt was the same sound!  Unmistakable due to the unusual shape.\n\nI'd heard all of those fall to the floor.\n\nBut where had they come from?  And how did that piece of paper get on top, if they had just then fallen?\n\nTurns out, a bag rotted after 17 years.  It was just an ordinary thin plastic grocery bag, but 17 years is just too long to hang there when filled with \"Joist Hang\" parts.\n\nThe bag burst, the parts fell to the ground, and the receipt floated down and landed gently on top of one.\n\nAnd when I say, \"burst\", boy did it!  Just look at that bag.\n\nThere's a lot of activity in that part of the warehouse. That receipt would have blown away long ago, if it hadn't just landed there.  You can see how only a tiny bit of it is on top of one of the Joist parts.\n\nIf it had been there more than a day someone would have breezed by it (Taiwanese people walk quickly at work),  or opened the door and it would have blown away.\n\nIt gets windy back there, if someone opens the door. And they always do, daily.\n\nIt had to have just landed there.\n\nThe receipt verifies how old the bag is.\n\nSo if you want a poltergeist, you can have one.\n\nThey live in a forest of purple and pink blobs of light, which you can find in darkness when the assemblage point moves just below the liver.\n\nIn fact, it seems to be easy to obtain one!\n\nI suspect, Fancy wanted in on this subreddit thing too.\n\nShe got it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to Get a Poltergeist", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 88, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"7xjj9ml6ngg51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 143, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7xjj9ml6ngg51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90fa1a2949fcd982f40538a0ff6dbfd1642636bc"}, {"y": 287, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7xjj9ml6ngg51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b80f650e0aedd5bc4f3457fcc58b2c08c9199adf"}, {"y": 426, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7xjj9ml6ngg51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bfefc13c1b8978178a36058761c05be466a2464"}], "s": {"y": 641, "x": 481, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7xjj9ml6ngg51.jpg?width=481&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2566b3ef24ecac05c935944a7975fe676eb8a47"}, "id": "7xjj9ml6ngg51"}, "3k66nr6wq1g51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 68, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3k66nr6wq1g51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da2134065d9e74b54976814f6bf29a4f204106d"}, {"y": 136, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3k66nr6wq1g51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bccbea669cb7aac8807c133ad19ba61bb575b8c7"}, {"y": 201, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3k66nr6wq1g51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8a52f3bc4cf7ec6df09d94d2aa01f4995933076"}, {"y": 403, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3k66nr6wq1g51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7efe7705e8cd04894b93601b3f1bf2b05dec91b0"}, {"y": 605, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3k66nr6wq1g51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3df8751347224a430b906791e5c11c9f9e22d22b"}], "s": {"y": 653, "x": 1035, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3k66nr6wq1g51.jpg?width=1035&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e936a3cae4f0260b58dc99803632b50d9f4a05e9"}, "id": "3k66nr6wq1g51"}}, "name": "t3_i6s6nm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5DB6Ec_tQlEJW51te9Kqif_iXaYnkpnDKbXx1vGXaXM.jpg", "edited": 1597189662.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1597010609.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3k66nr6wq1g51.jpg?width=1035&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e936a3cae4f0260b58dc99803632b50d9f4a05e9\"&gt;\\&amp;quot;Fancy\\&amp;quot; the IOB, trying to get attention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7xjj9ml6ngg51.jpg?width=481&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e2566b3ef24ecac05c935944a7975fe676eb8a47\"&gt;How the Bag \\&amp;quot;Broke\\&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part 1: Introducing &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From don Juan regarding inorganic beings and the threat to Carlos:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There were many ways in which such a being put a warrior to the test.

Everything had been there a very long time, and was quite stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remembering the good results that came from believing Fairy when she put me up to drawing and posting &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;#39;s Pass&amp;quot;, I decided to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, I had a vague memory don Juan told Carlos, you need to go verify if a branch had really broken, when you hear that sound while hunting inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First I opened the back door and looked outside. To make sure the sound really did come from inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No cars, no trucks, no people. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Sunday.  There&amp;#39;s no reason for anyone to be out there in our back parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I closed the door.  It was quite dark in that warehouse, but I clearly saw the white cloud flying into the next half of the warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think to follow it, because the last time it disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So searched until I found what you see in that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it was on the other side of the door the white cloud had just flown into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It tried to get me to look over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I did it on my own, after searching everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reached down, picked one up and dropped it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the same sound!  Unmistakable due to the unusual shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d heard all of those fall to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But where had they come from?  And how did that piece of paper get on top, if they had just then fallen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, a bag rotted after 17 years.  It was just an ordinary thin plastic grocery bag, but 17 years is just too long to hang there when filled with &amp;quot;Joist Hang&amp;quot; parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bag burst, the parts fell to the ground, and the receipt floated down and landed gently on top of one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when I say, &amp;quot;burst&amp;quot;, boy did it!  Just look at that bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of activity in that part of the warehouse. That receipt would have blown away long ago, if it hadn&amp;#39;t just landed there.  You can see how only a tiny bit of it is on top of one of the Joist parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it had been there more than a day someone would have breezed by it (Taiwanese people walk quickly at work),  or opened the door and it would have blown away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets windy back there, if someone opens the door. And they always do, daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had to have just landed there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The receipt verifies how old the bag is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want a poltergeist, you can have one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They live in a forest of purple and pink blobs of light, which you can find in darkness when the assemblage point moves just below the liver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems to be easy to obtain one!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect, Fancy wanted in on this subreddit thing too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "25c96bb2-6006-11ea-a318-0e7b3e95c21d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "i6s6nm", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 15, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/i6s6nm/how_to_get_a_poltergeist/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/i6s6nm/how_to_get_a_poltergeist/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1597010609.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g149oiz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1597165097.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_i6s6nm", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Part 2: Fancy takes over\n\nLast night I continued to try to make Fancy solid, by playing \u201cFind the energy\u201d with her.\n\nAfter a half hour, Fancy decided to scare me.\n\nShe was floating as a head and shoulders in puffs of purple, and her eyes had become hollow and sunken. She had a threatening sneer on her face.\n\nI looked at her and said, \u201cGo ahead! Scare me! I love it.\u201d\n\nHer face changed back to pretty. She had big blond curls at the top of her head, held down by a thick headband. I could see that her blouse had lace trim all over it, and the shoulders were puffy, with obvious padding.\n\nShe began to rot. Specks of flesh were falling from her perfect skin, and it started to glow in the brightest blue and white you would want to see.\n\nThe \u201cGhost\u201d face started to move forward, from the beautiful blond version of Fancy.\n\nIt moved towards me around 6 inches, as if it were about to possess me. It was intensely bright, but only bits and specs of light, forming an easy to recognize angry face.  It wasn\u2019t solid, it seemed to be made only from the flesh that was rotting off.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize it, but it was actually my gaze, the shine in my eyes focused too closely on her, that was pulling the \u201cghost\u201d forward.\n\nI did indeed experience a sudden rush of fright!\n\nI even started to get ready to run, remembering that Fancy can move solid objects. Who knows what she could do if she felt like it.\n\nBut then I realized, the fear was such a lovely sensation!  It was in fact refreshing.\n\nAnd the lights were so bright, it was in to goosebumps territory.\n\nI commented, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful Fancy.\u201d\n\nShe returned to normal, with a little disappointed frown.\n\nNext she had a woman\u2019s head to her right, and they seemed to be rubbing cheeks.\n\n\u201cHow many of you are there Fancy?\u201d, I asked her.\n\nI looked deeply to see if there was a background, or it was just 2 people pressed together.\n\nI noticed Fancy had changed outfits. I can\u2019t recall the new one, but the surprising thing was, her head was pressed against the chest of a man in a tuxedo.\n\nShe was like a young woman on a  date to the prom.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see his face. But I was thinking, \u201cA man??? I don\u2019t want any of that!\u201d\n\nI can't recall the exact word used in spanish, but Cholita told me, Carlos was not always politically correct.\n\nOf the men in our private class he once said, \"They're all bandiho!\"\n\nGay,  but google translate is censored for those words to Spanish, so I couldn't find the one he used.\n\nThe man kneeled down, or at least, his head moved down and I could see that he was also blond, and fair skinned.\n\nI started to wonder if IOBs can be found in pairs?\n\nAs I recall, the first time I saw Little Smoke he was with Devil\u2019s weed, and the two were clinging together.\n\nFancy flew off and I got the idea to play other games with her. I wanted her to take me to her world again, so I could make her more able to move objects. Maybe I could get back my ability to move small objects by looking at them, which Cholita had stolen.\n\nFancy brought her world, and I reached in to grab an entity.\n\nBut I was thinking about something.\n\nIt caused the world to vanish.\n\nI was wondering if I could use Monkey guy or Michael, to figure out how the assemblage point moves in lucid dreaming.\n\nBoth can get lucid dreaming many times a week.\n\nAll I needed was for them to wake up from a lucid dream, in a perfectly dark room, don\u2019t move, and tell me what they see.\n\nPuffs of color? Streaks? Lines of light on the walls?\n\nDepending on what they saw, I believed I could estimate how far down the J curve they had been dreaming.\n\nLucid dreaming is about anchoring yourself, and that means lateral shifts.\n\nDon Juan taught us how to do those lateral shifts, when he taught Carlos to turn into a crow.\n\nHe instructed him to feel that a beak was emerging, wings were coming out, and so on.\n\nI saw Nyei do the same, with her \"bat tensegrity\" demonstration, pretending to have bat ears by using her hand.\n\nA tip for Reni and Nyei:  That really looks silly, unless you have done real magic and people know about it.\n\nIt looks like you're selling a load of garbage for emotionally disturbed people.\n\nIt certainly works, I have no doubt.\n\nBut please do some actual magic before you show how to extend your \"bat ears\".\n\nPeople might take it more seriously.\n\nThis isn't about pride or stuffiness or being flexible.\n\nIt's about the reputation of Carlos. And the possible loss of his knowledge, if we don't make things right.\n\nBoth, bat ears and crow beaks,  are like playing with puffs of color.\n\nThat moves the assemblage point downwards, because you're gazing at energy and trying to interact with it.\n\nWith crows wings or bat ears you move laterally, but the technique is still the same.\n\nDirected focus of your attention.\n\nThe implication in those is that all you need to do is power plant the person's assemblage point very deep on the J curve (down near the waist), and then \"talk them through\" the lateral move needed  for shape-shifting.\n\nIn lucid dreaming, pursuing seemingly real physical things causes you to remain in a virtual phantom world, shifting laterally.\n\nI had the idea to figure out how far it had moved downward using either of those two posters to this subreddit.\n\nBut also to see if we could find a \u201cpassage\u201d.\n\nA place somewhere in the human positions of the assemblage point, where you could simply walk from one to the other, without blanking out.\n\nI'd already done that in one direction. Why not either direction?\n\nA basement trapdoor between waking and sleeping dreaming.\n\nIf we could find that, all of us could become both kinds of dreamers!\n\nFancy noticed what I was thinking.\n\nAnd because I\u2019d taken her seriously the day before, and had searched to see what she did in the real world when she made the bag burst, I suppose she had \u201cpermission\u201d to be more aggressive.\n\nPerhaps, when you take them seriously and act according to what you saw during practice, but in the \u201cnormal\u201d world, they have permission to do more there.\n\nFairy certainly seems to have taken over, after I trusted her and made \"Fairy's Pass\" post.\n\nIn fact, I often feel like I'm working for Fairy now.\n\nFancy moved my assemblage point all the way to heightened awareness while we played more, and since I needed to help Cholita early in the morning I went to bed a little earlier than I\u2019d like to have.\n\nAlmost the instant I lay down, I saw Fancy\u2019s face next to mine.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long it took to wake up again, but I found myself in an ordinary dream, in the kitchen.\n\nAlthough not fully lucid, I realized, if you play with IOBs before sleep, they almost surely enter your dreams and continue the play.  And I was in such a dream.\n\nIt was a house I hadn\u2019t lived in for 45 years.\n\nDisoriented, I looked around. A cloud of white smoke the size of a short human, was floating into the garage.\n\nIt was Fancy, traveling in the same cloud I\u2019d seen more than twice, when she cast those metal parts to the ground.\n\nI entered the garage and the \u201cghost\u201d was there. But the smoke evaporated.\n\nA fat short man entered through the same door I\u2019d entered that dark garage.\n\n\u201cWell\u201d, he said. But there were no words.\n\nI began to explain to him that I used darkness like that to manifest spirits, and I\u2019d be very interested to see if he could see one.\n\nIt was another concern of mine, which Fancy had picked up while we were playing with colors. Can other people see inorganic being manifestations?\n\nI looked towards the middle of the garage, at around 8 feet high.\n\nNothing was happening.\n\nThe man became angry, and I got the feeling he was going to punch me.\n\nHe shook his head as if to say, \u201cDemons are not ok to play with!!!\u201d\n\nHe left.  I was thinking, he must be catholic.\n\nAn agreeable woman came in his place. She entered the room as if she knew I wanted to give someone a demon demo.\n\nI looked to the center of the room and started to explain it to her. I \u201cknew\u201d her responses, but in fact, she never uttered a word.\n\nThe ghost figure appeared in the center, startling me.\n\nI was tossed out of dreaming.\n\nI found myself lying in bed, in total bliss.  An indication of the position of the assemblage point.\n\nWithout moving, I carefully opened my eyes.\n\nI was surrounded by those white lines used to assemble another world.\n\nThey were strangely curved, like the inside of Fancy\u2019s own world.\n\nBut I was still in my bedroom, and my assemblage point was not too far from where it had been when I went to sleep.\n\nI had a series of realizations. Lucid dreaming takes place wherever you normally keep your assemblage point on the J curve.\n\nIt\u2019s lateral shifts.  Left and right, but mostly not in depth (down the back).\n\nBut it can in fact move up or down from there.\n\nLeft or right, it can move the length of that slice of cheese from the cheese ball diagram Carlos drew on paper.\n\nAn inch or two at most, either horizontal direction.\n\nIn this specific case, mine had moved back around 1 foot,  along the very long J curve.\n\nStill very deep on it!\n\nThen without any actual evidence or reason to conclude this, I realized that playing with puffs of color can cause a \u201clateral shift\u201d. In order to \u201cuse\u201d the colors at that position in the J curve, a fine adjustment left or right can be needed.\n\nThose are likely responsible for the common complaint of nausea.\n\nAnd it explains why sometimes it's directional, sometimes it isn't, and why on rare occasions it actually has palpable mass.\n\nRather quietly so as not to disturb Cholita, who was probably sleeping in the next room,  I thanked Fancy.\n\nOddly, I turned my head to the right, back into the dark dream garage, and stated it in there.\n\nI didn't realize that place and this place are not connected. I just felt that Fancy was still in that garage.\n\nBut I added, almost shouting it this time,  \u201cWhat about that trapdoor????\u201d\n\nI didn't notice, I'd just passed through it.", "edited": 1597184031.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g149oiz", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Fancy takes over&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I continued to try to make Fancy solid, by playing \u201cFind the energy\u201d with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a half hour, Fancy decided to scare me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was floating as a head and shoulders in puffs of purple, and her eyes had become hollow and sunken.

And I was in such a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a house I hadn\u2019t lived in for 45 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disoriented, I looked around. A cloud of white smoke the size of a short human, was floating into the garage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was Fancy, traveling in the same cloud I\u2019d seen more than twice, when she cast those metal parts to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I entered the garage and the \u201cghost\u201d was there. But the smoke evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A fat short man entered through the same door I\u2019d entered that dark garage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell\u201d, he said. But there were no words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to explain to him that I used darkness like that to manifest spirits, and I\u2019d be very interested to see if he could see one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was another concern of mine, which Fancy had picked up while we were playing with colors. Can other people see inorganic being manifestations?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked towards the middle of the garage, at around 8 feet high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man became angry, and I got the feeling he was going to punch me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shook his head as if to say, \u201cDemons are not ok to play with!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He left.  I was thinking, he must be catholic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An agreeable woman came in his place. She entered the room as if she knew I wanted to give someone a demon demo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked to the center of the room and started to explain it to her. I \u201cknew\u201d her responses, but in fact, she never uttered a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ghost figure appeared in the center, startling me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was tossed out of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found myself lying in bed, in total bliss.  An indication of the position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without moving, I carefully opened my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surrounded by those white lines used to assemble another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were strangely curved, like the inside of Fancy\u2019s own world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was still in my bedroom, and my assemblage point was not too far from where it had been when I went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a series of realizations. Lucid dreaming takes place wherever you normally keep your assemblage point on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s lateral shifts.  Left and right, but mostly not in depth (down the back).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it can in fact move up or down from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Left or right, it can move the length of that slice of cheese from the cheese ball diagram Carlos drew on paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An inch or two at most, either horizontal direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this specific case, mine had moved back around 1 foot,  along the very long J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still very deep on it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then without any actual evidence or reason to conclude this, I realized that playing with puffs of color can cause a \u201clateral shift\u201d. In order to \u201cuse\u201d the colors at that position in the J curve, a fine adjustment left or right can be needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are likely responsible for the common complaint of nausea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it explains why sometimes it&amp;#39;s directional, sometimes it isn&amp;#39;t, and why on rare occasions it actually has palpable mass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather quietly so as not to disturb Cholita, who was probably sleeping in the next room,  I thanked Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, I turned my head to the right, back into the dark dream garage, and stated it in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize that place and this place are not connected. I just felt that Fancy was still in that garage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I added, almost shouting it this time,  \u201cWhat about that trapdoor????\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t notice, I&amp;#39;d just passed through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/i6s6nm/how_to_get_a_poltergeist/g149oiz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1597165097.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_i6s6nm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g10d2ej", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g0zmbxp", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I'd love to hear about it.\n\nI believe the early books were the doing of the death defier.

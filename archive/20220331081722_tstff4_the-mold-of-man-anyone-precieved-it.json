All of those power plant rituals in the early books, were nothing more than ritual and drug based ways to reach SK.\n\nOf course, the old seers didn't need the drugs.  That was the men of knowledge.  They wanted stuff they could sell.\n\nBut even right away in his apprenticeship, don Juan and Silvio showed Carlos SK.\n\nWe read in the books that they took Carlos to a restaurant to see if he could eat in Heightened awareness.\n\nDon Juan mentioned something about answers pouring out of him, instead of his usual questions.\n\nAnd Carlos experienced it right there.  But when he tried to explain what he \"knew\", he couldn't.\n\nThat's what I was doing last night.\n\nI'd been investigating two topics.  The \"happiness\" content of various items you can see in the dark room (puffs, swirls, streaks, sparkles) and whether you could simply play more with one kind, to improve the mood.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the mood the first time you start to see magic floating in the air.\n\nBut it's so much work to get even a little, after a few months of that, and if you aren't making fantastic progress because you can't find the time, people tend to get \"fussy\". They want more!\n\nThe mood suffers.\n\nDoesn't happen in a lineage, because you have 15 wise sorcerers to guide you. They make sure you feel entertained and optimistic.\n\nBut we're on our own!  Just demons for company.\n\nIf you get far enough there's that wonderful breath change, but you get used to that too.\n\nBy the way, the breath change becomes \"external breathing\" further out!  It's impossible to explain, but you breath from the dark room, not from your body.\n\nThat's also related to recapitulation, if only people would so as much of it, as they pretend.\n\nSo one of my queries last night was, can't you keep yourself shifted slightly horizontally, to keep the \"excitement\" going?  And left shift, or right shift?  How much?\n\nSo you can reach SK instead of deciding it's too cold in the world of sorcerers.\n\nIt's a long road!\n\nThe other \"query\" I had last night was how to tell one inorganic being from another, when their appearances are starting to get more vague (an inevitable effect of moving the assemblage point).\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that those \"Questions\" were now \"contaminated\".\n\nI had expectations from the day before.  So I had to drop those topics.\n\nIt's all about trace intent when you are in SK mode.  Even the slightest \"thing\" or \"Impression\", or \"concern\" messed up the flow of silent knowledge.\n\nIt's a \"topic changer\".\n\nMy inorganic being didn't buy it, and kept appearing hoping I'd use my gaze to follow her back to her home world.\n\nSo I took a chance on \"free from\" silent knowledge. It's quite overwhelming if you haven't gotten used to it.\n\nI was gazing straight ahead, and saw a tiny sparkle.  If I watched it longer, it bloomed into a mini dream bubble.\n\nI scanned my head left, and found another \"disturbance\" which could turn into something.\n\nIn SK mode there's no effort to get fun stuff to happen.  And it's stable.  You can stay like that for hours.\n\nNo more struggle with internal dialogue, except maybe a \"reminder\" every 20 minutes.  Otherwise you'll go down an SK \"story path\", and it'll turn into fantasizing.  SK has no limits. It can also simulate the internal dialogue, but with magic.\n\nEventually I realized, we have these golden fibers coming from our mid section, running out into space. And at the other end is a dream bubble.\n\nYou can gaze around and see the fibers hanging in the air.\n\nThey are in fact, what we try to recover by recapitulation!\n\nRecapitulation became fully visible!  I could glance around, find a fiber, gaze at its destination and find the past memory.  And inhale it back.\n\nThe more I inhaled, the fewer fibers were obvious, and finally I saw my energy body.\n\nCholita's shown me hers a few times, so I was happy to see it looked like hers.\n\nSo removing the internal dialogue inevitably leads to the realization that you need to recapitulate past memories.\n\nThat  mold of man you ask about, begins to \"fall off\" in that state.\n\nYou see \"pieces\" of what make you , \"you\" fall away, like they were just plaster stick ons, over your energy body.\n\nEach is a concern that is so \"thick\", it forms a real \"thing\".  Even a solid thing.\n\nBut it's all an illusion based on living in a single position of the assemblage point.\n\nWe pick up baggage from any position at which we linger.\n\nBut, the baggage is the same as those past memories, attacked to us by energetic strands!\n\nSo if you're looking for cool, \"book deal stuff\", like the mold, to convince yourself it's worth learning, never fear.\n\nThis isn't a fake magical system like all of the others.\n\nThere's no \"poetry\" hiding the \"true meaning\".\n\nNo buddhist \"levels\" to the explanations, to protect the real thing.\n\nNo crap.\n\nWhat they say, is literally true.\n\nIt's rather surprising.  You think those \"energetic connections\" to past events is a metaphor.\n\nNope.  You literally see a yellow to orange glowing thread stretching out from your stomach, leading to a flat screen TV view of a historical event.\n\nIf you gaze into it you zip into that past memory, as if it were a dream.\n\nSober!  Wide awake!  Eyes open!!!\n\nNo one does that.  Instead, they try to confuse you with \"sacred texts\" which in fact, are lies.\n\nIn each \"sacred text\" is an appeal to male greed, to give you the sensation of some \"deep truth\" that makes you feel good, and believe it must be true.\n\nIt's like telling a little kid about santa claus, and then telling him he has to behave a certain way, to please that old demon.\n\nAll we have, is literal.", "edited": 1648748344.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i2urd1e", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, several times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing made up in those books!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the tiniest, stupid detail, turns out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also visited heaven, the same way Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once fully awake, the other times in silence induced dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lovely place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan&amp;#39;s seen hell a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suppose the coolest thing is, once you reach Silent Knowledge, you realize ALL of it flows from the very same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;inevitable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to hear bad people (mostly buddhists) claim it&amp;#39;s all stolen from other stuff, and Carlos just &amp;quot;Hodge podged&amp;quot; it together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You hear that from someone, and they&amp;#39;re a knowledgeless idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if it&amp;#39;s an &amp;quot;enlightened master&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The know absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;out there in plain sight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example I saw last night, but I didn&amp;#39;t run to write it down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s fuzzy now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal is, and always has been Silent Knowledge (SK).

I guess some isolated group of people might not have heard of God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you get silent, and are doing &amp;quot;free form silent knowledge&amp;quot;, you can&amp;#39;t help but notice that particular glowing pea. The mold of man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It pulls you, and you find yourself looking at that specific collection of glowing emanation, as a &amp;quot;being&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s god.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as don Juan explained, it&amp;#39;s really everything good in humans. All they aspire to be.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As glowing emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not because that&amp;#39;s actually a real thing.  It&amp;#39;s a phantom!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It exists only because, everyone is making those very same emanations glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they&amp;#39;ve formed a &amp;quot;dip&amp;quot; in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you let your awareness &amp;quot;roll around&amp;quot; the emanations, it&amp;#39;ll fall into that dip once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you get to see the mold!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heaven is the same way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It exists because so many people expect it to exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In perfect silence, you can &amp;quot;experiment&amp;quot; with this theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even before you are capable of seeing the mold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the darkroom, when you can clearly see the second attention fog,  just say, &amp;quot;Hamburger&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then drop it.  Forget you said it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And see what comes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a good chance it&amp;#39;ll be related to hamburgers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you just added awareness to that range of emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might even find yourself sitting in a booth at McDonalds, about 3 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That takes a &amp;quot;lull&amp;quot; in awareness, to allow the assemblage point to move freely.  So the act of forcing even deeper silence, and forgetting about &amp;quot;hamburger&amp;quot;,  loosens the assemblage point up from the current spot, it drifts a tiny bit, and then the fact that you said, &amp;quot;hamburger&amp;quot; helps select where the assemblage point ends up, after moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all the same thing!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is just one topic.

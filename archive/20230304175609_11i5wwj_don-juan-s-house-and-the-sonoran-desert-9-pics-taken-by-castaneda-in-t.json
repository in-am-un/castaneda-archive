Within a year, Wasson met Castaneda twice and was favorably impressed. \u201cHe was obviously an honest and serious young man. \u201d  [source](https://hightimes.com/culture/high-times-greats-carlos-castaneda/)\n\nThe letter that was mailed to Carlos:\n\n**Gordon Wasson's Letter To Carlos Castaneda**\n\n**Dated - August 26, 1968**\n\n\\[R. Gordon Wasson (1898\u20131986) was an American author, ethnomycologist, and Vice President at J.P. Morgan Bank. In the course of CIA-funded research, Wasson made valuable contributions to the fields of ethnobotany, botany, and anthropology.\\]\n\nDear Mr. Castaneda:\n\nI have been asked to review *The Teachings of Don Juan* for *Economic Botany.* I have read it and am impressed by the quality of the writing and the hallucinogenic effects you have had. Perhaps you are not yet overwhelmed with letters from strangers and you can discuss with me the use of mushrooms by don Juan.\n\nMy professional life has been chiefly concerned with the hallucinogenic effects of the Mexican \u02bbsacred mushrooms.\u2019 It was my wife and I who publicized the re-discovery of the cult in Oaxaca, and it was on my invitation to Professor Roger Heim that he came over and studied them with us. We three have written books about them and innumerable articles.\n\n**I.**\n\nAm I right in concluding from your narrative that you never gathered the mushrooms, nor indeed ever saw a whole specimen? In the book they are always in powder, perhaps already mixed with other ingredients, are they not? Don Juan carried the powder around his neck in a sack. When he utilized them, they were smoked. Once you embarked (p. 63) on a trip to Chihuahua for *honguitos*, but your quest turned out to be for mescalito. When you first mention the mushrooms they are \u02bbpossibly\u2019 *Psilocybe mexicana* (p. 7), but later they are that species. Did you satisfy yourself that you were dealing with *Psilocybe mexicana*? This mushroom would normally, in don Juan\u2019s hands, macerate into shreds, rather than a powder, whereas the hallucinogenic puffballs used in certain spots in the Mixteca would give a powder. Do you know where your mushrooms grew, whether in pastures, corn fields, bovine dung, on the trunks of dying trees, or elsewhere?\n\n**II.**\n\nDon Juan (I assume that this was a name adopted by you to save him from pestering) seems to have spoken perfect Spanish and to have lived in many places \u2014 the U.S. and southern Mexico, perhaps elsewhere, as well as Sonora and Chihuahua. What is his cultural provenience? Is he a pure Yaqui? Or has his personality been shaped to a noticeable extent by the influences of the foreign places where he has been? May he have been influenced by the Indians of Oaxaca, in the remote parts of that State, and there learned to know the mushrooms? I ask this because the use of the hallucinogenic mushrooms has never previously been reported in Sonora or Chihuahua. In fact they have never been found there, and one would think that if specimens were found, in the arid conditions prevailing in those States, it would be hard to find enough for ceremonial use, or at any rate to count on finding enough. There may be restricted areas known to the Indians where the Indians might expect to find them, places well watered and fertile. Perhaps the species is one not yet known to science and that grows in arid country. It would be thrilling if you could pursue this further and make a discovery. The practice of smoking the mushroom powder is hitherto unknown to me. Had you brought back the powder, or the mixture in which the mushroom powder was an ingredient, we might have identified the species under the microscope, since there must have been spores present, and if the species is a known one, the spore suffices to place it. We now have almost a score of hallucinogenic species from Mexico.\n\n**III.**\n\nWill there be a Spanish edition of the book? You gave a few translations, but there were many times when I was hungry for more. \u02bbA man of knowledge\u2019 \u2014 did don Juan say, \u02bbhombre de conocimientos\u2019 or simply \u02bbun hombre que sabe\u2019? In Mazatec a curandero is *cho\u2019ta\u2019chi\u2019ne\u2019*, \u02bbone who knows.\u2019 Was don Juan bilingual, or was he better in Spanish than in Yaqui? Did you gather in your field notes the Yaqui equivalents of the terms he used? It would be fascinating to study with a linguist proficient in Yaqui the meaning of those terms. Did you ever tell your readers whether he could read and write in Spanish? How did he ordinarily make his living? His esoteric knowledge must have been his vocation, but he must have had a bread-and-butter occupation. I take it that you yourself are a fully acculturated \u02bbgringo,\u2019 since you spell your name \u02bbCastaneda\u2019 rather than Casta\u00f1eda in the Spanish way.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nR.

Gordon Wasson**\n\n**Dated - September 6, 1968**\n\n[Veja a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o da Carta de Castaneda a R. Gordon Wasson de 1968](http://www.consciencia.org/castaneda/castaneda-carta-gordon-wasson.html)\n\nDear Mr. Wasson:\n\nIt was indeed a great pleasure to receive your letter. I am very familiar with your professional contributions in the field of hallucinogenic mushrooms, thus, I couldn't be more honored with the opportunity of discussing this topic with you.\n\nYou must bear in mind, however, that I am not an authority, and that my knowledge is limited strictly to the ethnographic data I have collected.\n\nFirst of all I should tell you that my field work--and I have already stated this in the introduction of my book--was done under very constricting conditions. It was never an anthropological work proper; my work was rather an inquiry product of my own interest, and since my interest is \"content\" and \"meaning\" I became absorbed in the innuendoes that made don Juan's system of beliefs, disregarding to a large extent data which dealt with specific ethnographic details.\n\nSince I was dealing with a dramatic and serious system of beliefs I have purposefully blurred in my book more of such pertinent ethnographic details, thus compounding the vagueness in one letter without going back first to re-establish a better ethnographic context. However, I will try the best way I can answer your questions in the order in which you have written them.\n\n**Q:** Am I right in concluding from your narrative that you never gathered the mushrooms, nor indeed ever saw a whole specimen?\n\nI have gathered the mushrooms myself. I have held perhaps hundreds of specimens in my hands. Don Juan and I made yearly trips to collect them in the mountains Southwest and Northwest of Valle Nacional in the state of Oaxaca. I have deleted in my book all specific details about those trips and all the specific details about the collecting process.\n\nDon Juan expressed himself very strongly against my desire to include those descriptions as part of my book. He did not object to my revealing specific details about collecting peyote or Jimson weed on the grounds that the deity in peyote was a protector, therefore accessible to every man, and the power in Jimson weed was not his ally (alidado). The power in the mushrooms, however, was his ally and as such it was above everything else. And that entailed a total secrecy about specific processes.\n\n**Q**: Did you satisfy yourself that you were dealing with *Psilocybe mexicana*?\n\nNo. My botanical identification was a tentative one, and terribly unsophisticated at that. In my book, it appears as though the mushrooms was *Psilocybe mexicana*, that is, I am afraid, an editorial error. I should have carried the assertion that it was a tentative classification all the way through, since I have never been completely convinced that it was. The particular species used by don Juan looked like the *Psilocybe mexicana* pictures I have seen.\n\nA member of the Pharmacology Dept. at UCLA also showed me some specimens that he had, and based on that I concluded I was dealing with that species. However, it never turned into powder upon being handled. Don Juan picked it always with his left hand, transferred it to his right hand and then put it inside a small, narrow-gourd. The mushroom would then disintegrate into fine shreds, but never into powder, as it was forced gently inside.\n\n**Q:** Do you know where your mushrooms grew?\n\nWe found them growing on dead trunks of trees, but more often on decomposed remains of dead shrubs.\n\n**Q**: What is don Juan's cultural provenience?\n\nDon Juan is, in my judgement, a marginal man who has been forged by multiple forces outside the purely Yaqui culture. His name is really Juan. I tried to find a substitute name to use in my book, but I couldn't conceive him in any other way except as don Juan.\n\nHe is not a pure Yaqui, that is, his mother was a Yuma Indian, and he was born in Arizona. His mixed origin seemed to have rendered him as a marginal man from the beginning.\n\nHe lived in Arizona the first years of his life and then moved to Sonora when he was perhaps six or seven years old. He lived there for a while, I am not sure whether with both parents or just with his father. That was the time of the great Yaqui upheavals and don Juan and his family were picked up by the Mexican armed forces and were deported to the state of Veracruz. Don Juan later moved to the area of \"el Valle Nacional\" where he lived for over thirty years.\n\nIt is my belief that he moved there with his teacher, who must have been Mazateco. So far I have not been able to determine who his teacher was, nor where he did learn to be a brujo, yet the mere fact tht I have to take him every year to Oaxaca to collect mushrooms should be a serious clue as to where he learned, at least, about mushrooms.\n\nAs you can see, it is impossible for me at this point to determine with certainty his cultural provenience, except in a guessing manner. However, the subtitle of my book is \"A Yaqui Way of Knowledge.\" This is another mistake in which I became involved due to my lack of experience in matters of publications. The Editorial Committee of the University of California Press suggested upon accepting my manuscript for publication, that the word Yaqui should be included in the title in order to place the book ethnographically.\n\nThey had not read the manuscript but they concluded that I had said that don Juan was a Yaqui, which was true, but I had never meant that don Juan was a product of the Yaqui culture, as appears to be the case now judging from the title of the book. Don Juan considered himself to be a Yaqui and seemed to have deep ties with the Yaquis of Sonora. However, it has become obvious to me now that those ties were only a surface affiliation.\n\nI am not familiar with whether or not the hallucinogenic mushrooms grow in the arid regions of Sonora and Chihuahua. Don Juan has never looked for them there to my knowledge. Yet he has asserted repeatedly that once a man learns to command the power in them the mushrooms can grow any place the man wants, that is, they grow by themselves without his direct intervention.\n\nThe first time in my life I saw the mushrooms was in Durango. I thought we were going to look for \"hongitos\" but we wound up collecting peyote in Chihuaha. At that time I saw quite a few, perhaps ten or twelve. Don Juan said they were only a token, and that there were not enough to make use of them. At that time he also told me that we had to make a trip to Oaxaca to find the right number of mushrooms.\n\nIn 1964 I found one specimen myself in the Santa Monica mountains here in Los Angeles. I took it to the laboratory at UCLA but through carelessness they lost it before identifying it. It was strikingly obvious to me that it was one of the mushrooms used by don Juan; he naturally interpreted the event of finding it as an omen that I was on my way to learning, but my subsequent actions, such as picking it and leaving it with strangers, reassured him, he said, of my utterly fumbling nature.\n\n**Q**: Have you brought back the powder, or the mixture, in which mushroom powder was an ingredient?\n\nNo. However, I am sure I could obtain a very small amount of it, perhaps a dab of it. If that would be enough to examine it under the microscope I can send it to you by the end of this year.\n\n**Q:** Will there be a Spanish edition of the book?\n\nI hope the University of California Press will consider that possibility. My notes are all in Spainish. In fact this book was almost an English version of a Spanish manuscript.\n\n**Q:** Did don Juan say \"un hombre de conocimiento\" or simply \"un hombre que sabe?\"\n\nYou have given me here the most fascinating piece of information. To define the conditions of being, or the stage of learning \"man of knowledge\" don Juan used the terms \"hombre de conocimiento\" , \"hombre que sabe\", and \"uno que sabe.\" I have preferred the term \"man of knowledge\" because it is more concrete than \"one who knows.\"\n\nI have taken some parts of my notes in Spanish dealing with \"el hombre que sabe\" and I have included them here. I hope they are legible. These sheets are a direct transcription of the even more illegible direct notes I took while don Juan talked to me. As a rule I always rewrote my notes immediately so I would not lose the freshness and the flare of don Juan's statements and thoughts.\n\n**Q:** Was don Juan bilingual, or was he better in Spanish than in Yaqui?\n\nDon Juan speaks Spanish so fluently that I am willing to believe that his command of Spanish is better than any other language he knows. But he speaks also Yaqui, Yuma, and Mazatec. I have reasons to believe that he also speaks English, or at least he understands it perfectly, although I have never heard him using it.\n\n**Q:** Did you gather in your field notes the Yaqui equivalents of the terms he used?\n\nI have some terms which are not Spanish, but too few to make a serious study. Our conversations were conducted strictly in Spanish and the few foreign terms are not all Yaqui words.\n\n**Q:** Do you ever tell your readers whether he could read and write in Spanish?\n\nHe reads very well; I have never seen him writing though. For a long time I thought he was illiterate, this misjudgement on my part was the result of our differences in emphasis. I stress areas of behavior which are thoroughly irrelevant to him, and vice versa. This cognitive difference between us is the theme I am striving to develop in the biography of don Juan which I am writing now.\n\nThere is not much to tell about myself. My home was in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but I went to school in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before I came to this country. My full name is Carlos Aranha. Following the Latin tradition one always adds to one's name the mother's last name, so when I came to the United States I became Carlos A. Castaneda. Then I dropped the A. The name belonged to my grandfather who was from Sicily. I don't know how it was originally, but he himself altered it to Castaneda to suit his fancy.\n\nI hope I have answered clearly all your questions. Thank you for your letter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nCarlos Castaneda\n\n[source](http://www.consciencia.org/castaneda/castaneda-letter-gordon-wasson.html)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false,

Within a year, Wasson met Castaneda twice and was favorably impressed. \u201cHe was obviously an honest and serious young man. \u201d  &lt;a href=\"https://hightimes.com/culture/high-times-greats-carlos-castaneda/\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The letter that was mailed to Carlos:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon Wasson&amp;#39;s Letter To Carlos Castaneda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dated - August 26, 1968&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[R. Gordon Wasson (1898\u20131986) was an American author, ethnomycologist, and Vice President at J.P. Morgan Bank. In the course of CIA-funded research, Wasson made valuable contributions to the fields of ethnobotany, botany, and anthropology.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Castaneda:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been asked to review &lt;em&gt;The Teachings of Don Juan&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Economic Botany.&lt;/em&gt; I have read it and am impressed by the quality of the writing and the hallucinogenic effects you have had. Perhaps you are not yet overwhelmed with letters from strangers and you can discuss with me the use of mushrooms by don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My professional life has been chiefly concerned with the hallucinogenic effects of the Mexican \u02bbsacred mushrooms.\u2019 It was my wife and I who publicized the re-discovery of the cult in Oaxaca, and it was on my invitation to Professor Roger Heim that he came over and studied them with us. We three have written books about them and innumerable articles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I right in concluding from your narrative that you never gathered the mushrooms, nor indeed ever saw a whole specimen? In the book they are always in powder, perhaps already mixed with other ingredients, are they not? Don Juan carried the powder around his neck in a sack. When he utilized them, they were smoked. Once you embarked (p. 63) on a trip to Chihuahua for &lt;em&gt;honguitos&lt;/em&gt;, but your quest turned out to be for mescalito. When you first mention the mushrooms they are \u02bbpossibly\u2019 &lt;em&gt;Psilocybe mexicana&lt;/em&gt; (p. 7), but later they are that species. Did you satisfy yourself that you were dealing with &lt;em&gt;Psilocybe mexicana&lt;/em&gt;? This mushroom would normally, in don Juan\u2019s hands, macerate into shreds, rather than a powder, whereas the hallucinogenic puffballs used in certain spots in the Mixteca would give a powder. Do you know where your mushrooms grew, whether in pastures, corn fields, bovine dung, on the trunks of dying trees, or elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan (I assume that this was a name adopted by you to save him from pestering) seems to have spoken perfect Spanish and to have lived in many places \u2014 the U.S. and southern Mexico, perhaps elsewhere, as well as Sonora and Chihuahua. What is his cultural provenience? Is he a pure Yaqui? Or has his personality been shaped to a noticeable extent by the influences of the foreign places where he has been? May he have been influenced by the Indians of Oaxaca, in the remote parts of that State, and there learned to know the mushrooms? I ask this because the use of the hallucinogenic mushrooms has never previously been reported in Sonora or Chihuahua. In fact they have never been found there, and one would think that if specimens were found, in the arid conditions prevailing in those States, it would be hard to find enough for ceremonial use, or at any rate to count on finding enough. There may be restricted areas known to the Indians where the Indians might expect to find them, places well watered and fertile. Perhaps the species is one not yet known to science and that grows in arid country. It would be thrilling if you could pursue this further and make a discovery. The practice of smoking the mushroom powder is hitherto unknown to me. Had you brought back the powder, or the mixture in which the mushroom powder was an ingredient, we might have identified the species under the microscope, since there must have been spores present, and if the species is a known one, the spore suffices to place it. We now have almost a score of hallucinogenic species from Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will there be a Spanish edition of the book? You gave a few translations, but there were many times when I was hungry for more. \u02bbA man of knowledge\u2019 \u2014 did don Juan say, \u02bbhombre de conocimientos\u2019 or simply \u02bbun hombre que sabe\u2019? In Mazatec a curandero is &lt;em&gt;cho\u2019ta\u2019chi\u2019ne\u2019&lt;/em&gt;, \u02bbone who knows.\u2019 Was don Juan bilingual, or was he better in Spanish than in Yaqui? Did you gather in your field notes the Yaqui equivalents of the terms he used? It would be fascinating to study with a linguist proficient in Yaqui the meaning of those terms. Did you ever tell your readers whether he could read and write in Spanish? How did he ordinarily make his living? His esoteric knowledge must have been his vocation, but he must have had a bread-and-butter occupation. I take it that you yourself are a fully acculturated \u02bbgringo,\u2019 since you spell your name \u02bbCastaneda\u2019 rather than Casta\u00f1eda in the Spanish way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sincerely yours,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R. Gordon Wasson&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nagualism-volume-1-4th-ed-2022-the-teachings-of-don-juan-eng-esp-ukr-rus\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;___________________________&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlos Castaneda&amp;#39;s Letter to R. Gordon Wasson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dated - September 6, 1968&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.consciencia.org/castaneda/castaneda-carta-gordon-wasson.html\"&gt;Veja a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o da Carta de Castaneda a R. Gordon Wasson de 1968&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Wasson:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was indeed a great pleasure to receive your letter. I am very familiar with your professional contributions in the field of hallucinogenic mushrooms, thus, I couldn&amp;#39;t be more honored with the opportunity of discussing this topic with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must bear in mind, however, that I am not an authority, and that my knowledge is limited strictly to the ethnographic data I have collected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all I should tell you that my field work--and I have already stated this in the introduction of my book--was done under very constricting conditions. It was never an anthropological work proper; my work was rather an inquiry product of my own interest, and since my interest is &amp;quot;content&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; I became absorbed in the innuendoes that made don Juan&amp;#39;s system of beliefs, disregarding to a large extent data which dealt with specific ethnographic details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was dealing with a dramatic and serious system of beliefs I have purposefully blurred in my book more of such pertinent ethnographic details, thus compounding the vagueness in one letter without going back first to re-establish a better ethnographic context. However, I will try the best way I can answer your questions in the order in which you have written them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Am I right in concluding from your narrative that you never gathered the mushrooms, nor indeed ever saw a whole specimen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have gathered the mushrooms myself. I have held perhaps hundreds of specimens in my hands. Don Juan and I made yearly trips to collect them in the mountains Southwest and Northwest of Valle Nacional in the state of Oaxaca. I have deleted in my book all specific details about those trips and all the specific details about the collecting process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan expressed himself very strongly against my desire to include those descriptions as part of my book. He did not object to my revealing specific details about collecting peyote or Jimson weed on the grounds that the deity in peyote was a protector, therefore accessible to every man, and the power in Jimson weed was not his ally (alidado). The power in the mushrooms, however, was his ally and as such it was above everything else. And that entailed a total secrecy about specific processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you satisfy yourself that you were dealing with &lt;em&gt;Psilocybe mexicana&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. My botanical identification was a tentative one, and terribly unsophisticated at that. In my book, it appears as though the mushrooms was &lt;em&gt;Psilocybe mexicana&lt;/em&gt;, that is, I am afraid, an editorial error. I should have carried the assertion that it was a tentative classification all the way through, since I have never been completely convinced that it was. The particular species used by don Juan looked like the &lt;em&gt;Psilocybe mexicana&lt;/em&gt; pictures I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A member of the Pharmacology Dept. at UCLA also showed me some specimens that he had, and based on that I concluded I was dealing with that species. However, it never turned into powder upon being handled. Don Juan picked it always with his left hand, transferred it to his right hand and then put it inside a small, narrow-gourd. The mushroom would then disintegrate into fine shreds, but never into powder, as it was forced gently inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know where your mushrooms grew?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We found them growing on dead trunks of trees, but more often on decomposed remains of dead shrubs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: What is don Juan&amp;#39;s cultural provenience?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan is, in my judgement, a marginal man who has been forged by multiple forces outside the purely Yaqui culture. His name is really Juan. I tried to find a substitute name to use in my book, but I couldn&amp;#39;t conceive him in any other way except as don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is not a pure Yaqui, that is, his mother was a Yuma Indian, and he was born in Arizona. His mixed origin seemed to have rendered him as a marginal man from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He lived in Arizona the first years of his life and then moved to Sonora when he was perhaps six or seven years old. He lived there for a while, I am not sure whether with both parents or just with his father. That was the time of the great Yaqui upheavals and don Juan and his family were picked up by the Mexican armed forces and were deported to the state of Veracruz. Don Juan later moved to the area of &amp;quot;el Valle Nacional&amp;quot; where he lived for over thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is my belief that he moved there with his teacher, who must have been Mazateco. So far I have not been able to determine who his teacher was, nor where he did learn to be a brujo, yet the mere fact tht I have to take him every year to Oaxaca to collect mushrooms should be a serious clue as to where he learned, at least, about mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it is impossible for me at this point to determine with certainty his cultural provenience, except in a guessing manner. However, the subtitle of my book is &amp;quot;A Yaqui Way of Knowledge.&amp;quot; This is another mistake in which I became involved due to my lack of experience in matters of publications. The Editorial Committee of the University of California Press suggested upon accepting my manuscript for publication, that the word Yaqui should be included in the title in order to place the book ethnographically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had not read the manuscript but they concluded that I had said that don Juan was a Yaqui, which was true, but I had never meant that don Juan was a product of the Yaqui culture, as appears to be the case now judging from the title of the book. Don Juan considered himself to be a Yaqui and seemed to have deep ties with the Yaquis of Sonora. However, it has become obvious to me now that those ties were only a surface affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not familiar with whether or not the hallucinogenic mushrooms grow in the arid regions of Sonora and Chihuahua. Don Juan has never looked for them there to my knowledge. Yet he has asserted repeatedly that once a man learns to command the power in them the mushrooms can grow any place the man wants, that is, they grow by themselves without his direct intervention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time in my life I saw the mushrooms was in Durango. I thought we were going to look for &amp;quot;hongitos&amp;quot; but we wound up collecting peyote in Chihuaha. At that time I saw quite a few, perhaps ten or twelve. Don Juan said they were only a token, and that there were not enough to make use of them. At that time he also told me that we had to make a trip to Oaxaca to find the right number of mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1964 I found one specimen myself in the Santa Monica mountains here in Los Angeles. I took it to the laboratory at UCLA but through carelessness they lost it before identifying it. It was strikingly obvious to me that it was one of the mushrooms used by don Juan; he naturally interpreted the event of finding it as an omen that I was on my way to learning, but my subsequent actions, such as picking it and leaving it with strangers, reassured him, he said, of my utterly fumbling nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you brought back the powder, or the mixture, in which mushroom powder was an ingredient?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. However, I am sure I could obtain a very small amount of it, perhaps a dab of it. If that would be enough to examine it under the microscope I can send it to you by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Will there be a Spanish edition of the book?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope the University of California Press will consider that possibility. My notes are all in Spainish. In fact this book was almost an English version of a Spanish manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Did don Juan say &amp;quot;un hombre de conocimiento&amp;quot; or simply &amp;quot;un hombre que sabe?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have given me here the most fascinating piece of information. To define the conditions of being, or the stage of learning &amp;quot;man of knowledge&amp;quot; don Juan used the terms &amp;quot;hombre de conocimiento&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;hombre que sabe&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;uno que sabe.&amp;quot; I have preferred the term &amp;quot;man of knowledge&amp;quot; because it is more concrete than &amp;quot;one who knows.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have taken some parts of my notes in Spanish dealing with &amp;quot;el hombre que sabe&amp;quot; and I have included them here. I hope they are legible. These sheets are a direct transcription of the even more illegible direct notes I took while don Juan talked to me. As a rule I always rewrote my notes immediately so I would not lose the freshness and the flare of don Juan&amp;#39;s statements and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Was don Juan bilingual, or was he better in Spanish than in Yaqui?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan speaks Spanish so fluently that I am willing to believe that his command of Spanish is better than any other language he knows. But he speaks also Yaqui, Yuma, and Mazatec. I have reasons to believe that he also speaks English, or at least he understands it perfectly, although I have never heard him using it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Did you gather in your field notes the Yaqui equivalents of the terms he used?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have some terms which are not Spanish, but too few to make a serious study. Our conversations were conducted strictly in Spanish and the few foreign terms are not all Yaqui words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you ever tell your readers whether he could read and write in Spanish?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He reads very well; I have never seen him writing though. For a long time I thought he was illiterate, this misjudgement on my part was the result of our differences in emphasis. I stress areas of behavior which are thoroughly irrelevant to him, and vice versa. This cognitive difference between us is the theme I am striving to develop in the biography of don Juan which I am writing now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is not much to tell about myself. My home was in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but I went to school in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before I came to this country. My full name is Carlos Aranha. Following the Latin tradition one always adds to one&amp;#39;s name the mother&amp;#39;s last name, so when I came to the United States I became Carlos A. Castaneda. Then I dropped the A. The name belonged to my grandfather who was from Sicily. I don&amp;#39;t know how it was originally, but he himself altered it to Castaneda to suit his fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I have answered clearly all your questions. Thank you for your letter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sincerely yours,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos Castaneda&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.consciencia.org/castaneda/castaneda-letter-gordon-wasson.html\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/sxBnZMSxgUMSDKfQQbLcwCL3GS5ATQvx4t2u5uDFpZ0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=722baf7682a70e14402822a1864962286163d696", "width": 180, "height": 159}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/sxBnZMSxgUMSDKfQQbLcwCL3GS5ATQvx4t2u5uDFpZ0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=089f45272f33f059ed011bb290b5d6e0f56a193e", "width": 108, "height": 95}], "variants": {}, "id": "rsus-mMRxkn4B5tShe3Lbgr3AjUR4VLxFquX85fJO14"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7061e896-ee7d-11eb-a866-7a4e134b671f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "11i5wwj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11i5wwj/don_juans_house_and_the_sonoran_desert_9_pics/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/11i5wwj/don_juans_house_and_the_sonoran_desert_9_pics/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1677948969.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jaxdffe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1677961189.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11i5wwj", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It\u2019s possible that the photos included above were given by Carlos to his publisher as creative fuel for the illustrators of his book covers.

[This letter was sent by Michael Harner in reply to the pseudoscientific review of \u201cThe Second Ring of Power\u201d by Robert Bly compiled in the de Mille\u2019s spirit and published in The New York Times on Jan. 22, 1978.]\n\nMichael Harner\n\nTo the Editor: \u201cWhile it was flattering to be referred to as a \u201cgenuine researcher\u201d whose work is a source of Carlos Castaneda\u2019s data by Robert Bly in his review of \u201cThe Second Ring of Power\u201d (Jan. 22), I must lodge a protest in the interest of accuracy and fairness to Castaneda and his readers\u2026I am thoroughly conversant with Castaneda\u2019s publications; I have known him for a decade and a half; and I am not familiar with any evidence that he has borrowed material from my works\u2026\n\n\u2026And then an American writer who I won\u2019t mention the name of decided to make a career out of attacking Carlos, even claimed that I had made up [with Carlos?] (inaudible) the Yaqui sorcerer who used the Datura to change consciousness. And then years later he apologized in print because finally somebody \u2014 I think a man in Switzerland sent him this reference to this Mexican book on ethnobotany that said that the Yaquis did use the Datura ointment in that way. But by the time I had nothing more to say to this man. So Carlos was attacked, but Carlos really didn\u2019t care. He was having a great time and unfortunately died... very early in his life\u2026\n\n\u2026It is unfortunate that the persons chosen to review Castaneda\u2019s books are not really experts on shamanism. Whatever Castaneda\u2019s faults, he is one of the very few Westerners who have ever been able to communicate the nature of the shamanic experience. In this sense he conveys a deep truth, although his specific details can often be justifiably questioned (by those with no experience in non-ordinary reality). Who is the more significant conveyor of truth, Castaneda or a plodding ethnographer who gets a lot of second-hand details right, but who never has had a shamanic experience..\u201d\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nCLEMENT MEIGHAN ON CASTANEDA - [Meighan\u2019s words from discussion at the Editorial Board of the U.

[This letter was sent by Michael Harner in reply to the pseudoscientific review of \u201cThe Second Ring of Power\u201d by Robert Bly compiled in the de Mille\u2019s spirit and published in The New York Times on Jan. 22, 1978.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Michael Harner&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the Editor: \u201cWhile it was flattering to be referred to as a \u201cgenuine researcher\u201d whose work is a source of Carlos Castaneda\u2019s data by Robert Bly in his review of \u201cThe Second Ring of Power\u201d (Jan. 22), I must lodge a protest in the interest of accuracy and fairness to Castaneda and his readers\u2026I am thoroughly conversant with Castaneda\u2019s publications; I have known him for a decade and a half; and I am not familiar with any evidence that he has borrowed material from my works\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026And then an American writer who I won\u2019t mention the name of decided to make a career out of attacking Carlos, even claimed that I had made up [with Carlos?] (inaudible) the Yaqui sorcerer who used the Datura to change consciousness. And then years later he apologized in print because finally somebody \u2014 I think a man in Switzerland sent him this reference to this Mexican book on ethnobotany that said that the Yaquis did use the Datura ointment in that way. But by the time I had nothing more to say to this man. So Carlos was attacked, but Carlos really didn\u2019t care. He was having a great time and unfortunately died... very early in his life\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026It is unfortunate that the persons chosen to review Castaneda\u2019s books are not really experts on shamanism. Whatever Castaneda\u2019s faults, he is one of the very few Westerners who have ever been able to communicate the nature of the shamanic experience. In this sense he conveys a deep truth, although his specific details can often be justifiably questioned (by those with no experience in non-ordinary reality). Who is the more significant conveyor of truth, Castaneda or a plodding ethnographer who gets a lot of second-hand details right, but who never has had a shamanic experience..\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CLEMENT MEIGHAN ON CASTANEDA - [Meighan\u2019s words from discussion at the Editorial Board of the U. C. Press before publication of The Teachings, distilled from Margaret Runyan\u2019s A Magical Journey with Carlos Castaneda]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u201cI can believe what he\u2019s telling me. It was the same thing he\u2019d been telling everybody for months. The sorts of things he is coming in with are too damned good. Even to fake it, you\u2019d have to study anthropology for ten years in order to provide the kind of convincers or data he comes up with\u2026.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve known him since he was an undergraduate student here and I\u2019m absolutely convinced that he is an extremely creative thinker, that he\u2019s doing anthropology. He\u2019s working in an area of cognitive learning and the whole cross-cultural thing. He\u2019s put his finger on things that no other anthropologist has even been able to get at, partly by luck and partly because of his particular personality. He\u2019s able to get information that other anthropologists can\u2019t get, because he looks like an Indian and speaks Spanish fluently and because he\u2019s a smart listener.\u201d\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_11i5wwj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11i5wwj/don_juans_house_and_the_sonoran_desert_9_pics/jax7k0b/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677958756.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1677958756.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jax1l4q", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jawywic", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Tonight if I remember, and my Ally Fancy appears in very realistic style, I'll ask her if Carlos made it all up.\n\nThat ought to be fun!\n\nBut I won't ask Minx.

Subsequently he referred to me as an &amp;quot;honest and serious young man,&amp;quot; or words to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, some critics proceeded to assert that any field notes produced by Castaneda must be assumed to be forgeries created after the fact. At that point I realized there was no way I could satisfy people whose minds were made up without recourse to whatever documentation I might provide. Actually, it was liberating to abandon the enterprise of public relations -- intrinsically a violation of my nature -- and return to my fieldwork with don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11i5wwj/don_juans_house_and_the_sonoran_desert_9_pics/jbohlm2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1678460016.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_11i5wwj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "juok6xq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1691100516.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11i5wwj", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Very directly related post.

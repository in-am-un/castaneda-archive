The assemblage point moves during this time, so the cooler stuff happens past the 2 hour mark.  Inorganic beings will visit, tunnels of light can open up, and you might actually be able to visually see some scenes or images associated with what you are recapitulating.\n\nYou know you did a good length of time when you blank out during a breathing sweep, continue it, and blank out again before you can even finish it.\n\nNo, you don't sweep only at the end.\n\nYou sweep the whole time.  Later you'll be able to *see* the emanations and you'll realize the breath really does manipulate them.  They do indeed seem to have movement when you breath them in, or expel them.\n\nThe movement is more like a pulse of light traveling up them in the right direction, inhale or exhale.  Like an LED strip where the leds are all lit dimly, but a pulse travels across with each breath.\n\nI was  hoping they suck up like spaghetti, but I haven't seen anything like that yet.\n\nTherefore, don't expect to \"erase\" the bad memories.\n\nThey only get weaker, they are not removed.\n\nBut the weakening means, when you are trying to be silent and the Eagle gives a command to take an inventory, and  you're forced to look inside, you don't get trapped in a memory.  Recap makes you sick and tired of that memory, so there's nothing attractive about it, and you can simply put it in the inventory you were commanded to take, and drop it.\n\nIt causes you to \"stop worshiping your inventory\".\n\nMan, we love those lousy inventories!  A bad image comes to my mind.  A woman having her miniskirt lifted by a bad person, and the shock she feels on seeing her panties exposed.\n\nThat's us.\n\nAfter recap over and over,  you'll be more like an exotic dancer who has a customer lift up her skirt.\n\nYou'll just slap his hand gently.\n\nIf you waited until the end to do the breathing, you'd lose most of the benefit.\n\nNote:  Some things which happen in sorcery are more caused by *intent*, than the physical thing you do.\n\nSo let's take Fancy, my new IOB.  I was trying to make her more solid last night, and she's helpful in that regard. Likes to stick to my hand and not get off!\n\nI blew air into her, to see if that 5 second delay was still there.   In the past, I thought that blowing into them was pitiful at best, until I realized, there's a 5 second delay.\n\nIt reminds me of an *intent* delay on requests for objects.  I've counted that at around 10 seconds.\n\nThe 5 second delay was in fact there.  I kept watching as I blew, until finally she was full sized, standing on the floor, looking at me with a puzzled look.  I said, \"Just sit here next to me on the edge of the bed!\"\n\nShe did. But she still had that puzzled look, so I asked her if she wanted to dance?\n\nNope.\n\nBut, how can blowing into them make them more vivid?\n\nThey have no body.  They aren't really there.  They're just a projection of awareness.\n\nIs it actually the breath, or is it your *intent* that this will make them brighter?\n\nI suspect it's the intent.  I could probably snap my fingers to make her brighter.\n\n(I'll give that a try tonight if I remember).\n\n*Intent* is key to everything in sorcery!\n\nPeople always forget that point.  We're learning, \"the mastery of *intent*\".\n\nEverything else, including *dreaming*, is just a way to summon *intent*.\n\nCarlos stopped reading because of that, and so have I. When someone shows something they believe is sorcery related in a positive way, I love to read why.\n\nBut not the material. It will add the *intent* of something not compatible with sorcery.\n\nSo, the breath probably summons *intent*.  It also helps reduce the internal dialogue, since the internal dialogue messes with our breathing big time.  By mellowing it out, you can \"soothe\" some of the internal dialogue's rough edges.\n\nOnline?  Do your best to recap it.\n\nBut from now on, consider that online is the playground of petty tyrants!\n\nIt's wonderful!  The worse they attack you, the better.\n\nIt's like an amusement park with short rides:\n\nRide 1: Self-important Indian wanna be sorcerer petty tyrant attack here!   See the lame explanations, feel the thrill of the depth of his self-pity...\n\nRide 2: Bitter former Carlos student trying to explain that even if you make it work, it's all in your head, and so Carlos is still a fraud!\n\nRide 3: Completely confused women who like Fairies, but don't really believe in them...\n\nRide 4: Demon enthusiasts who don't actually want to know anything about demons.\n\nBut until you can shut off that internal dialogue they'll stick fibers in you, the same as a physical interaction.\n\nNot care about results?\n\nIf you put in a long session everyday, you'll get results.\n\nIf you don't, tell me what did happen, and I can \"tweak\" it.\n\nEveryone went on, after Carlos' death,  mindlessly doing the minimum they could from Carlos' techniques, so they could puff themselves up and feel a little less desperate.\n\nThey're out there!  Castaneda practitioners, smile on face, filled with insecurity and self-pity.\n\nYou have to look inside the techniques, for the fine details coming from the second attention.\n\nIf you don't, they won't work very well.\n\nOr you could end up like Cholita.  A very powerful witch, who can't do anything consciously.\n\nShe never became aware of her power.\n\nBut she got it anyway because she never stopped practicing.\n\nWhen I got home last night, the house was surrounded with \"Crime Scene, Do not enter\" yellow tape.\n\nEvery door was blocked.\n\nI had to bend down low to get in.\n\nAnother Cholita spell.\n\nEdited", "edited": 1598983684.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g3ll98r", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long: 2 hours is better.

Do your best to recap it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But from now on, consider that online is the playground of petty tyrants!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s wonderful!  The worse they attack you, the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like an amusement park with short rides:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ride 1: Self-important Indian wanna be sorcerer petty tyrant attack here!   See the lame explanations, feel the thrill of the depth of his self-pity...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ride 2: Bitter former Carlos student trying to explain that even if you make it work, it&amp;#39;s all in your head, and so Carlos is still a fraud!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ride 3: Completely confused women who like Fairies, but don&amp;#39;t really believe in them...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ride 4: Demon enthusiasts who don&amp;#39;t actually want to know anything about demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But until you can shut off that internal dialogue they&amp;#39;ll stick fibers in you, the same as a physical interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not care about results?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you put in a long session everyday, you&amp;#39;ll get results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t, tell me what did happen, and I can &amp;quot;tweak&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone went on, after Carlos&amp;#39; death,  mindlessly doing the minimum they could from Carlos&amp;#39; techniques, so they could puff themselves up and feel a little less desperate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re out there!  Castaneda practitioners, smile on face, filled with insecurity and self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to look inside the techniques, for the fine details coming from the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t, they won&amp;#39;t work very well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you could end up like Cholita.  A very powerful witch, who can&amp;#39;t do anything consciously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She never became aware of her power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she got it anyway because she never stopped practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home last night, the house was surrounded with &amp;quot;Crime Scene, Do not enter&amp;quot; yellow tape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every door was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to bend down low to get in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another Cholita spell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ikgkzz/how_does_recapitulation_work_exactly/g3ll98r/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1598974071.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ikgkzz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g3ll559", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BananaCute", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1598974028.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ikgkzz", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_2fnyevj1", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "When I saw Recapitulation, I immediately thought about Lucia Rene?

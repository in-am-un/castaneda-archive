They know how to stir the emanations so as to put silent knowledge ideas into your perception.\n\nThe voice said, \"They kind of cheat you know! Their interface to humans has always been silent knowledge. The Men of Knowledge exploited that, and you got amazing rituals producing the most vivid interactions with inorganic beings possible. They could even share those with their customers.\n\nNo different than what you try to do during darkroom, with your own rituals. Except you have no purpose so the rituals become less effective over time.\n\nSorcery needs purpose, to direct the flow of awareness in the correct direction.\"\n\nAs I watched the historical scene float away on that supernatural conveyor belt made of lines of yellow white light, I realized it was the \"interplay\" of the emanations in Man's band.\n\nI could watch a \"rerun\" of history, because that already happened.\n\nAnd the traces of it are present in man's band of awareness.\n\nOur awareness flows into the emanations, and our view of the world is \"skimmed\" from the nearly infinite number in there. Some selected, some not.\n\n\"Seeing\" is in fact simply silencing the mind so that our trace \"concerns\" are all that's present, and some of our awareness flows into the emanations carrying a message.\n\nIt's like being absolutely silent in the second attention, then saying \"hamburger\" and dropping it.\n\nDon't think about \"hamburger\"!\n\nJust say it once.\n\n10 seconds later it's served.\n\nFloating in the air.\n\nOr plopping down onto your bed, if you're sitting up on pillows in darkness.\n\nManifesting objects is a definite skill you can get better and better at, but it leads horizontally on the J curve. Doesn't move you further along the J curve.\n\nSo it's not a very good hobby.\n\nThinking about what the entity said, namely that IOBs can't lie because a lie doesn't exist, made me think that they interact with us by pushing their own awareness into the emanations to let \"the past\" reskim and present us with information.\n\nThey can't \"make\" the old luggage with stickers from its travels.\n\nBut they can cause one that previously existed to manifest.\n\nJust by blowing energy into it.\n\nThe rest takes form as best it can, depending on how far down the J curve our assemblage point moved.\n\nAnd on how little we interfere.\n\nWhich is far too much, so you end up with an evil Clown about to bite your head off.\n\n\"History!\", the entity said.\n\nI didn't understand that.\n\n\"You need a purpose. It's a lot easier. You all do. Right now there's none.\"\n\nI thought about the old seers and their individual purposes, and then the new seers and their \"farfetched enterprise\" of a quest for freedom.\n\nDon Juan had said that's a first step with apprentices. Engage them in the lineage's purpose.\n\nCarlos did the same. He didn't just invite people over to chat in lecture halls, the way many guru types do.\n\nLos Angeles used to have some guy like that called, \"Charly\". He was a bit like a Krishnamurti type.\n\nJust gave lectures. Made up stuff as he went, but it was \"inspiring\" to new ager types.\n\nCarlos did give lectures, but he also had a writing enterprise going on. And workshops, 3 or 4 different levels of private classes, and a complicated outreach around the world to set up stations to prepare for workshops.\n\nNot to mention answering random letters, or giving interviews in different language publications.\n\nAnd unknown to us, dealing with the old apprentices who had moved to LA.\n\nApparently don Juan used to eat at \"The Pantry\".\n\nOne of the oldest restaurants in the haunts the workshops of Carlos took people to.\n\nBruce wrote about it in his notes, compiled by Techno.\n\n\"Historians?\", I asked the entity.\n\n\"You were born for it!\", the entity replied. \"You were there at several key points in the path Castaneda took, from as early as 9 years old. You even bumped into him a couple of times in the UC system's martial arts classes. And then you also know the history of private classes. A historian is precisely what you've become.\"\n\nI didn't like the idea of that at all.\n\nThe entity continued, \"Look at your current obsession. Tracking down the techniques of 100,000 year old sorcerers. For what? To give a history lesson?\"\n\nActually my interest is in their technology to move solid matter using the living earth as the transport medium.\n\n\"Ancient Technology is a historical topic. You should know. You watch all of those streaming media shows on it\", the entity argued.\n\nThe entity continued to explain, \"what was\" is what is now.\n\nIt was, so it is. So for your audience knowing how things were can help them assemblage how things can be right now.\n\nBesides, don Juan gave Carlos a bunch of history lessons!\n\nAnd it's precisely what Silent Knowledge is for. To watch the flow of the past, present, and try to catch a bit of the future.\n\nFlowing in the emanations.\n\nSo in many ways, all seers are \"historians\".\n\nI suppose it's as Yoda says. The force flows through all things, binding them together.\n\nCleaning the link to intent is the process of learning to inject just the bare minimum of awareness into emanations that glowed in the past. To allow that reality to form more solidly, so you can review \"what was\".\n\nIt argued, that's why sorcerers recapitulate. To exercise that ability at the level of ordinary consciousness. While their assemblage point is still up at their left shoulder blade.\n\nThe recapitulation uses history to convince people they can change.\n\nI told the entity that I want to make cartoons of Tensegrity moves, and then some entertaining ones that show real magic, and how to get it.\n\nTo encourage as many out there as possible to learn to see. By making it entertaining to learn.\n\n\"Exactly!\", the entity exclaimed.\n\nI was a bit scared by the enthusiastic outburst.\n\n\"You've fallen under an obscure branch of 'the rule'. Not a very pleasant part I might add. Too bad for you. Best you can do to mitigate that is become a historian. Don Juan even admired the historians among the old seers.\"\n\nI realized what the entity was referring to.\n\nI don't know the exact passage, but the gist of it goes like this:\n\nAfter generations of dealing with power plants, some of the Men of Knowledge learned to *see*. The more enterprising among them began to teach that to others, and that was the beginning of their end.\n\nThey ceased to be Men of Knowledge, and became obsessed with the strange worlds they *saw*.\n\nAnd when invaders came, the seers who could only *see* were fiascos.\n\nI asked the entity, \"Who's going to invade us in this time and age?\"\n\nThe entity said, \"Just report the past. Teach seeing, as you must. But don't break the link. Go back in time, recover private classes, then go back further and fill in the missing details on the old seers.\n\nIf you like, go back even further to the start of it all, before any history was kept.\n\nWere the first sorcerers even human yet?\n\nBeing a historian is one way to avoid being a fiasco.\"\n\nIt added, \"Besides, a good streaming media service needs documentaries too.\"\n\nI got to thinking if there was any use for that 3D photorealistic Chimp family I purchased.\n\nI've become a fan of \"Chimp Dynasty\" on streaming media.

Your \"undivided attention\".\n\nIf fear doesn't work, they try something else.\n\nThey behave very much like we would ourselves, if we had to project our image billions of light years, to visit with aliens.\n\nThey've discovered the sure way to get our attention, is to play to local customs and religious beliefs.\n\nThus demon forms are their preferred.\n\nThe Buddhists and the Jewish Prophets, Milarepa,  and other delusional religious types are convinced they really are demons!\n\nDue to their inability to visit with them more than a few times.\n\nBut if they see you aren't reacting to the scary forms, they'll try another.\n\nSame as you would if you were in their position.\n\nI made a picture of that, before my drawing skills had advanced.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3uc16lgtgwa1.jpeg?width=908&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4abc435e472b14017aedac914968dcaba2a6717", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jhww4iw", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sure did!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got chased across a very long hallway in an expensive hotel in Shanghai.

That whole system of modified behavior appeals to people who believe they can &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery isn&amp;#39;t much like the first 3 books at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don Juan told us that!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People just don&amp;#39;t read carefully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said he&amp;#39;d show him the point of view of the Men of Knowledge, so that with his current point of view he&amp;#39;d now have two ideas of what the world was like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then he could find a way to slip through the middle, to &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seers don&amp;#39;t have to wrestle the allies at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t fooled by their appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now that I told you, you don&amp;#39;t have to either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just stand up to them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give in to the idea it&amp;#39;s going to murder you violently, and accept it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;ll stop it in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Cholita first introduced me to her Ally &amp;quot;Minx&amp;quot;, it tried to bite my head off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita brought it into my darkroom right through the locked door and lay across my legs so I couldn&amp;#39;t run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No man would turn down Cholita laying across their legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then her Ally floated up to the ceiling in front of me, and became a giant Demon with a mouth wide open to bite me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since it was using Cholita&amp;#39;s energy, it was very impressive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I complimented it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It got a sad look on its face, then changed into something it knew would interest me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what they want.  Your &amp;quot;undivided attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If fear doesn&amp;#39;t work, they try something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They behave very much like we would ourselves, if we had to project our image billions of light years, to visit with aliens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve discovered the sure way to get our attention, is to play to local customs and religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus demon forms are their preferred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Buddhists and the Jewish Prophets, Milarepa,  and other delusional religious types are convinced they really are demons!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to their inability to visit with them more than a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they see you aren&amp;#39;t reacting to the scary forms, they&amp;#39;ll try another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as you would if you were in their position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a picture of that, before my drawing skills had advanced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j3uc16lgtgwa1.jpeg?width=908&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a4abc435e472b14017aedac914968dcaba2a6717\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/j3uc16lgtgwa1.jpeg?width=908&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a4abc435e472b14017aedac914968dcaba2a6717&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_12zibi3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/12zibi3/historians_of_infinity/jhww4iw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1682599954.0, "media_metadata": {"j3uc16lgtgwa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j3uc16lgtgwa1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0915a1f62431aefc40483d4df8f88882ca980e3c"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j3uc16lgtgwa1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a70a0518ba1aa19aee22e0dde5f6195a987aa9"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j3uc16lgtgwa1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c47d4b6c2eb55f17f7b936da8ba18f9e0c18a44"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j3uc16lgtgwa1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0c0887fb4c29e2074e4fcf21b342869d62550cf"}], "s": {"y": 605, "x": 908, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j3uc16lgtgwa1.jpeg?width=908&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4abc435e472b14017aedac914968dcaba2a6717"}, "id": "j3uc16lgtgwa1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jhunt4m", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "see_oh_two", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1682551597.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_12zibi3", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_nkrjvpl1", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Did you ever have to wrestle an ally?

she were returned to being a sun.  Which sucks up and burns anything which goes into it's gravity pull.\n\nIt all began to spin towards her as if she'd negated that alien planet's gravity, and the junk was crushed and burned in various colors while she swam around in it.\n\nIt was spectacular, except she was trying to teach me that it's impossible to remember it, because it's happening at the same time as our tonal awareness' timeline.\n\nWhich is part of why waking dreaming is superior to sleeping dreaming.\n\nYou get two timelines!\n\nBut in sleeping dreaming only one.\n\n\\&gt; maybe Fairy assumed the form of anime characters because I was watching anime earlier in the afternoon?\n\nThus Carlos warned us against watching porn, because you'd keep escalating and soon you'd be looking at pictures of women being choked.\n\nHe didn't say it, but those images could easily bubble up into your darkroom practice.\n\nExcept Carlos lived before internet porn.\n\nThat battle is over.  The women even choke themselves, on XHamster.\n\nCholita is surely into that kind of thing.\n\nGood thing Carlos made me celibate.\n\n\\&gt;  but this time I could actually see my individual fingers articulating.\n\nThat's orange zone.\n\n\\&gt;  And I also noticed that I had super-hearing!\n\nAll of the senses are greatly enhanced by sorcery. It's the silence in part, but then also, that your senses are a \"hook\".\n\nSo if you focus on one of the hooks, and the assemblage point shifts sideways to make it more real.

Get a little throne to sit on, or declare themselves holy or saintly.\n\nHe explained left and right shifts there, just to let us know that people trapped in the green, still believe they are \"going further and further\" into higher states.\n\nExcept they're just sliding left and right.  Into dreaming realms.\n\nWhich makes sense because people most commonly get there with their eyes closed, dozing off from their confused meditation techniques.\n\nThen he described the red zone.\n\nThat's the trap for drug users.  But also the one the new seers warn about, because it slows your ability to move your assemblage point fast along the entire curve.\n\nYou \"set up house\" down there, because it's an active place.\n\nMaybe even, you can't reach the red zone with your eyes closed.\n\nI believe that might be true.  If you tried, you'd just induce a horizontal shift, back up at the green.\n\nAnd he did give us the orange, but more so in his Silent Knowledge publication where he describes what amounts to heightened awareness, as the start of Silent Knowledge territory.\n\nGiving fine details of the movement, only at the very end.\n\nI really need to recreate that lecture in the most detail I can. It's a shame we don't have a video tape of it.  Someone needs to get good at re-runs and try to retrieve that information.\n\nOr we need an active effort to locate and bribe the others who heard that lecture.  Cholita estimates it was 50 people.  I think more like 30.\n\nThe sad part is, there had to have been \"inner circle\" watching it upc lose from behind the woman, while I was on the opposite side.\n\nAnd some of those could be made to describe what they saw.\n\nBut they're all trapped in ego concerns, being saintly at Cleargreen.\n\nI believe Pat, Victoria, Virginia , Felix, and Corey were there.  Likely Larry and Ralph.\n\nWe really ought to try to get details from them.\n\nCholita and Jadey were not there.  That's a pity.\n\nSo Juann and I invented the idea of a pink zone Carlos didn't mention, just because it's so obvious there is one as you pass into the vastness of the orange zone.\n\nIt's like the last place you can still see the scenery when walking into a fog bank.  In a rose garden park.  On a day with super thick fog.\n\nIf you keep walking into the fog bank, there's essentially nothing to see.\n\nBut at the start of it, you can still see the red roses a little.\n\nThus pink.\n\nI'm also nauseous tonight.\n\nAnd from curry too.\n\nYellow.  But even worse, Keto curry.  It's basically butter sticks with curry powder in it, and some leafy veggies to make it seem ok to eat pure fat.  And next to 0 carbs.\n\nFortunately being ill during darkroom stirs things up, and if you can overcome it and practice anyway you get rewarded.\n\nGet to see \"something different\".\n\nAnd you realize you can get into a rut.\n\nSeeking cool visual results is such a rut.\n\nIt's a nice rut, but the truth is more silence is always what men should seek.\n\nThe women? I have no idea.   But perhaps emphasizing cool visual sights, puts them into male territory a bit too far.\n\nI don't know.  It's like insisting they have to enter the haunted mansion through the front door along with the men, when in fact, you're better off to let the women snoop around the outside of the house, looking for secret ways to enter without being seen.\n\nWe'll need to figure that out, to make useful cartoons.\n\nI had the idea to go \"blameless\" by having the cartoons be about  2 kids learning.  A girl and a boy.   With help from the characters in Dance home.\n\nIt's not out of line.  Carlos had Carola, and tried to use her as a positive example at a few workshops.\n\nHaving a girl and a boy be the focus lets people see how both learn, and how it's not the same. That men and women learn differently.\n\nIt's a good strategy, because you can also introduce children to the idea that it's ok to play around with your dreams, and summon phantoms into the real world. Something totally forbidden in our culture.\n\nThe kids will do it.  The effect on society might be profound if enough see them.   Which has never before been possible.  Streaming media is what allows it.\n\nBut Stella was floating around and I realized from watching her,  which stabilized silent knowledge for me, that there's no way I can design a realistic female character.\n\nI even got SK lectures on how to do it, but my male mind rejected it as not exciting enough.  \n\nOur society has tried to turn all women into men. Or into servants of men.\n\nOddly the left seems to advocate for that, angrily.  They fight against the servants of men part, only to insist women have to be aggressive like men.  And then they even bring in male substitutes, dressed up like women.  We've now got male weight lifters, pretending to be female ones so they can win more easily.\n\nIt's mind boggling.\n\nI liked it better in the 70s when women in hot pants were insisting they didn't want to be treated like sex objects.\n\nAt least that was hypnotic.\n\nBut the right uses ugly religion to suppress women, insisting making babies is their highest purpose.\n\nBoth sides end up suppressing witchcraft.\n\nWe ought to encourage more female voices, in order to educate the men on what they've been ignoring.\n\nOr avoiding...\n\nI tried to get my house painted today, and Cholita got furious.  I had to cancel the work crew.\n\nShe won't let them paint her black!!!\n\nNot even a moustache!\n\nI tried to argue that the paint is peeling, but she said  she's leaving soon anyway, so why does she care?\n\nEnd of story.  I'd have dead painters on my hands, if I opposed her.\n\nOddly, when Cholita seems more crazy I eventually realize she was right.\n\nEven when it makes no sense.\n\nShe's just discussing a different topic than I am.", "edited": 1678439438.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jbnjdo5", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like pink to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave us the few levels we have, and I suspect there was a different motivation in the ones we got, than simply explaining how it works as the assemblage point shifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He described those levels, because they&amp;#39;re the most relevant to our situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The green zone is &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot; and traps all religions or magical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the least amount of work you can do to see some small amount of magic, and then people simply declare victory and stop.

Into dreaming realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes sense because people most commonly get there with their eyes closed, dozing off from their confused meditation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he described the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the trap for drug users.  But also the one the new seers warn about, because it slows your ability to move your assemblage point fast along the entire curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;set up house&amp;quot; down there, because it&amp;#39;s an active place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even, you can&amp;#39;t reach the red zone with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that might be true.  If you tried, you&amp;#39;d just induce a horizontal shift, back up at the green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he did give us the orange, but more so in his Silent Knowledge publication where he describes what amounts to heightened awareness, as the start of Silent Knowledge territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Giving fine details of the movement, only at the very end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really need to recreate that lecture in the most detail I can. It&amp;#39;s a shame we don&amp;#39;t have a video tape of it.  Someone needs to get good at re-runs and try to retrieve that information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or we need an active effort to locate and bribe the others who heard that lecture.  Cholita estimates it was 50 people.  I think more like 30.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sad part is, there had to have been &amp;quot;inner circle&amp;quot; watching it upc lose from behind the woman, while I was on the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some of those could be made to describe what they saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re all trapped in ego concerns, being saintly at Cleargreen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Pat, Victoria, Virginia , Felix, and Corey were there.  Likely Larry and Ralph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We really ought to try to get details from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita and Jadey were not there.  That&amp;#39;s a pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Juann and I invented the idea of a pink zone Carlos didn&amp;#39;t mention, just because it&amp;#39;s so obvious there is one as you pass into the vastness of the orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like the last place you can still see the scenery when walking into a fog bank.  In a rose garden park.  On a day with super thick fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep walking into the fog bank, there&amp;#39;s essentially nothing to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the start of it, you can still see the red roses a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus pink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also nauseous tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And from curry too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yellow.  But even worse, Keto curry.  It&amp;#39;s basically butter sticks with curry powder in it, and some leafy veggies to make it seem ok to eat pure fat.  And next to 0 carbs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately being ill during darkroom stirs things up, and if you can overcome it and practice anyway you get rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get to see &amp;quot;something different&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you realize you can get into a rut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeking cool visual results is such a rut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a nice rut, but the truth is more silence is always what men should seek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women? I have no idea.   But perhaps emphasizing cool visual sights, puts them into male territory a bit too far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know.  It&amp;#39;s like insisting they have to enter the haunted mansion through the front door along with the men, when in fact, you&amp;#39;re better off to let the women snoop around the outside of the house, looking for secret ways to enter without being seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll need to figure that out, to make useful cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the idea to go &amp;quot;blameless&amp;quot; by having the cartoons be about  2 kids learning.  A girl and a boy.   With help from the characters in Dance home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not out of line.  Carlos had Carola, and tried to use her as a positive example at a few workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having a girl and a boy be the focus lets people see how both learn, and how it&amp;#39;s not the same. That men and women learn differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a good strategy, because you can also introduce children to the idea that it&amp;#39;s ok to play around with your dreams, and summon phantoms into the real world. Something totally forbidden in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kids will do it.  The effect on society might be profound if enough see them.   Which has never before been possible.  Streaming media is what allows it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Stella was floating around and I realized from watching her,  which stabilized silent knowledge for me, that there&amp;#39;s no way I can design a realistic female character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even got SK lectures on how to do it, but my male mind rejected it as not exciting enough.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our society has tried to turn all women into men. Or into servants of men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly the left seems to advocate for that, angrily.  They fight against the servants of men part, only to insist women have to be aggressive like men.  And then they even bring in male substitutes, dressed up like women.  We&amp;#39;ve now got male weight lifters, pretending to be female ones so they can win more easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s mind boggling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I liked it better in the 70s when women in hot pants were insisting they didn&amp;#39;t want to be treated like sex objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least that was hypnotic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the right uses ugly religion to suppress women, insisting making babies is their highest purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both sides end up suppressing witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ought to encourage more female voices, in order to educate the men on what they&amp;#39;ve been ignoring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or avoiding...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to get my house painted today, and Cholita got furious.  I had to cancel the work crew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She won&amp;#39;t let them paint her black!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not even a moustache!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to argue that the paint is peeling, but she said  she&amp;#39;s leaving soon anyway, so why does she care?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;End of story.  I&amp;#39;d have dead painters on my hands, if I opposed her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, when Cholita seems more crazy I eventually realize she was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even when it makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s just discussing a different topic than I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_11mk18w", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11mk18w/how_iobs_might_be_perceived_at_first/jbnjdo5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1678438739.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1678438739.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbln57s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "superr", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbkxcht", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3vses", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Ahh see that\u2019s the clear difference between men and women.

I didn't fixate on that though and she zipped by in several new animations. At that point I was in a great mood seeing the air so dense with all kinds of vague magical things.

I jumped up in joy, trying my best to recreate that pure feeling of joy and happiness I felt when my dad took me to Disneyworld for the first time as a kid. Fairy liked that! She dazzled through my darkroom through the densest fog ever. I was surrounded by all sides by that shimmering \"energy barrier\" I had seen previously, only now it was much clearer and I could easily see the dividing line between inside the \"wall\" and outside the wall.

I loudly exclaimed \"oh Fairy! I know that was you!\" and she winked at me in agreement. She then manifested a series of shifting sinister faces, but I was not scared, only a tiny bit spooked by the sights. But that low level of \"spooked\" feeling was enough to cause the faces to be quite clear and brilliant. It was as if Fairy was telling me, \"see, we're not trying to scare you for no reason! It's that fright energy! It's useful to help us interact with you silly humans!\"\n\nAfter that I tried to get her to do something dirty like you suggested.

But I've had some new *unexplained* phenomena happening. \n\nNight before last, I was so tired and stressed out bc ble line ordinary life takes a heckin' toll. Still, before I laid down, I wanted to do a little darkroom. \n\nEven on days when I don't \"feel\" like it bc (^ blue line bs), I always do something just to make sure I'm not skipping days. \n\nSo I was in my bathroom doing my passes, but I couldn't get silent. Walked into my closet and am standing there trying to *push something out of the body*. Then I feel someone blowing on the back of my neck. No way it could be a draft, no way for any air to blow in there, and it was concentrated on the point where my left shoulder meets my neck. It was so intense that it scared me. Like really scared me, I grabbed my phone to get a light on and looked behind me...just clothes... of course. \n\nI haven't succumb to fear like that in DR for some time now. \n\nI knew I had missed out on something \"breathtaking\" and as I laid down to sleep I was reminded of the tunnel that Dan has in his closet. The one he's felt a breeze through that could have very possibly come from Jadeys home....across the world. \n\nYesterday morning I hung blackout curtains up over the doors in my bathroom. They are French doors and have frosted glass windows that let in the light from my bedroom. \n\nI got in the shower and was gazing at the walls in there and was able to see puffs! Haven't seen them in the light before! \n\nI get out and turn off the lights while I'm drying off/getting dressed. \n\nI knew my son was going to wake up soon which always makes it hard for me to get silent but I wanted to get in whatever time I could. \n\nSo I'm doing *affection for the energy body* and *forcing* silence as best I can. \n\nSuddenly there's a loud crash right beside me. A shock wave of fear runs through me and I turn and reach for the lights. But I stop myself, turn back to face SE again and restart my movement.  I say outloud \"that scared me, but I'm not scared of you, I will feel this fear intensely to provide energy for you.\"\n\nBefore I had completed the entire pass, my son was crying. So that was the end of that. \n\nWhen I did turn on the lights to go get him, I looked around to see what had fallen that made the crashing sound.

But I&amp;#39;ve had some new &lt;em&gt;unexplained&lt;/em&gt; phenomena happening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Night before last, I was so tired and stressed out bc ble line ordinary life takes a heckin&amp;#39; toll. Still, before I laid down, I wanted to do a little darkroom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even on days when I don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; like it bc (^ blue line bs), I always do something just to make sure I&amp;#39;m not skipping days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was in my bathroom doing my passes, but I couldn&amp;#39;t get silent. Walked into my closet and am standing there trying to &lt;em&gt;push something out of the body&lt;/em&gt;. Then I feel someone blowing on the back of my neck. No way it could be a draft, no way for any air to blow in there, and it was concentrated on the point where my left shoulder meets my neck. It was so intense that it scared me. Like really scared me, I grabbed my phone to get a light on and looked behind me...just clothes... of course. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t succumb to fear like that in DR for some time now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I had missed out on something &amp;quot;breathtaking&amp;quot; and as I laid down to sleep I was reminded of the tunnel that Dan has in his closet. The one he&amp;#39;s felt a breeze through that could have very possibly come from Jadeys home....across the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning I hung blackout curtains up over the doors in my bathroom. They are French doors and have frosted glass windows that let in the light from my bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got in the shower and was gazing at the walls in there and was able to see puffs! Haven&amp;#39;t seen them in the light before! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get out and turn off the lights while I&amp;#39;m drying off/getting dressed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew my son was going to wake up soon which always makes it hard for me to get silent but I wanted to get in whatever time I could. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m doing &lt;em&gt;affection for the energy body&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;forcing&lt;/em&gt; silence as best I can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there&amp;#39;s a loud crash right beside me. A shock wave of fear runs through me and I turn and reach for the lights. But I stop myself, turn back to face SE again and restart my movement.  I say outloud &amp;quot;that scared me, but I&amp;#39;m not scared of you, I will feel this fear intensely to provide energy for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I had completed the entire pass, my son was crying. So that was the end of that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I did turn on the lights to go get him, I looked around to see what had fallen that made the crashing sound. My face wash was on the floor of my shower instead of on its shelf...but ive lived here for 3 years, and NOTHING has ever fallen off that shelf before!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I don&amp;#39;t question whether something was real or a coincidence.

But I've gotten that feeling all my life, and it has almost always been extremely unsettling.\nMy first few times in DR, I would get about 20 minutes in and  become so flooded with fear that a monster was about to emerge from the darkness. So scared, I'd run to the light switch. \nLights on, everything normal, I'd shake it off \"fuck this, I'll try again tmro\".\n\nThen I was encouraged to be aware that I'm not alone on there, that my double is always with me in the dark and that she doesn't even know what fear is. \n\nWhile the concept was somewhat obscure, I reinforced it and was able to push through into longer and longer sessions. \n\nThat was good, I was getting more time in, but I had sort of boxed my emotions away, which meant I was quite literally, going through the motions (tensegrity) but from an intellectual place, with very little feeling other than wanting to perfect my passes and feeling quite satisfied when I'd make it through a long form without having to stop and think what was next. \n\nBut very low feeling means very low energy, which means very low possibility of seeing something cool. \n\nThere were a few sightings of interesting disturbances in the dark, but internally, I was pretty much undisturbed. My thoughts were calculating, exploratory, dissecting, observations. Basically, I was doing tensegrity homework.  \n\nI'd analyze every little fluctuation I saw until I was just dancing around in the dark, unperturbed.

I was excited about what I'd experienced but had neary convinced myself it was just imagery with no being behind it. \n\nWhen I read this post, I was able to put those thoughts aside and get excited about what I had experienced. \n\nSo feel the presence, *know* that it's real. Expect *someone or something* to emerge from the darkness.  Feel everything. Every way you can feel it with abandon, without a thought for why you are feeling it. Fan that energy of feeling and let it flow in your tensegrity. \n\nThen come tell us what you see! Being able to share these experiences with each other, especially between those of us, just starting to perceive, is the best way to confirm that what we are experiencing is, in fact, real.

But I&amp;#39;ve gotten that feeling all my life, and it has almost always been extremely unsettling.\nMy first few times in DR, I would get about 20 minutes in and  become so flooded with fear that a monster was about to emerge from the darkness. So scared, I&amp;#39;d run to the light switch. \nLights on, everything normal, I&amp;#39;d shake it off &amp;quot;fuck this, I&amp;#39;ll try again tmro&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I was encouraged to be aware that I&amp;#39;m not alone on there, that my double is always with me in the dark and that she doesn&amp;#39;t even know what fear is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the concept was somewhat obscure, I reinforced it and was able to push through into longer and longer sessions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was good, I was getting more time in, but I had sort of boxed my emotions away, which meant I was quite literally, going through the motions (tensegrity) but from an intellectual place, with very little feeling other than wanting to perfect my passes and feeling quite satisfied when I&amp;#39;d make it through a long form without having to stop and think what was next. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But very low feeling means very low energy, which means very low possibility of seeing something cool. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were a few sightings of interesting disturbances in the dark, but internally, I was pretty much undisturbed. My thoughts were calculating, exploratory, dissecting, observations. Basically, I was doing tensegrity homework.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d analyze every little fluctuation I saw until I was just dancing around in the dark, unperturbed.

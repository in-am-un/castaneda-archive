I tried to slow down to give it more time to manifest\n\nI was remembering that prior to this I was having a dream that there was a pretty woman I was flirting with, at first she acted shy, but then she was more aggressive than I was.  She was also a perfect kisser, kissing exactly the way I wanted her to.  This whole combination had me becoming slightly lucid.  I was aware that it was a dream, more-so I was aware that this\u2026 her\u2026 was the being that interacts with me.\n\nAs I thought about this, my fear did a cycle of the possibilities, of how it might attack, knowing I knew, I vacillated between that and the thought that it was real.  Part of me was convinced at the reality of the experience, but another part of me knew it was definitely a dream, and an interaction.  Part of me thought how, this is how it gets energy from me.  I was studying what energy exchange might be taking place, trying to feel if I felt any of my energy draining out of me.  I honestly could feel none, it just felt like kissing a woman.\n\nIt was after this experience that I sort of woke up, but I was in the in-between state, and I quickly caught a movement of a shadow that looked like a small octopus out of my left side peripheral vision.  I then quickly started to gaze (relaxed vision) to allow myself to see it better.  It manifested on my right side, I started trying to jab at it as it happened, but it would dart back under the bed.  It wasn\u2019t really under the bed, but peripheral it was coming up from the edges of the bed.  The interesting thing is that the right side is right against the wall.\n\nI tried to blast it with energy, kind of like a fireball, I didn\u2019t see anything, and energetically I felt quite weak, like all I was doing was going through he motions, and I need some serious energy training.\n\nI then relaxed even more, and allowed it to manifest even more instead of trying to attack it.  I saw a huge white/red striped man emerging through a doorway in the distance (at this point my room is morphing into a dream scene, but I\u2019m so caught up with this image, that I wasn\u2019t immediately aware of it.  But at the time, my room was turning into a house that I was in, a different house, a bigger house, empty with a decent amount of open rooms.  As I immediately panicked at the size of him, but reminded myself that Don Juan would have recommended to stay with the vision, and let it become what it will, instead of rationalizing it away or staring directly at it to make it something known.  I decided to keep it in my peripheral, until it started walking towards me, and I slowly started to shift my gaze to a direct look.  Somehow I knew that I would be able to hold it in my direct view this time, it was like I waited long enough for it to become what it would, and then once it was, which was then something known, I could look at it directly, as it had not completely manifested.\n\nBut I should also mention that the way I looked at it felt like I was still holding a small background gaze like 10-20%.  Like it took a certain effort to continue seeing him while looking directly at him.\n\nIt grew smaller as from a giant into a tall light complected early 20\u2019s black man.  I knew still that he was the manifestation of the being.  He came towards me, and at first I was attacking him any time he came too close.  As time went on, I felt that he wasn\u2019t necessarily a threat, or at least the biggest threat.  I was able to ask him a whole slew of questions, but the only 2 that I remember were these:\n\n\u201cDo you need or seek to otherwise feed off of my friends?\u201d , to which he sort of laughed and said \u201cno\u201d with a tone of \u201chow ridiculous\u201d.  I followed up with \u201cBut you DO need me to feed you energy from time to time, right?\u201d  He said something like \u201cIt would be nice\u201d.  I still understood at this level how it works, that I need to feed it, in order for it to continue to exist/manifest in my world.\n\nI relaxed and told him that it was one of my biggest issues with it, but now that I was clear, perhaps we could communicate without all the defensiveness.  I never did quite get down to an optimal way of feeding it though.  This was the question, that when I was seeking to get information on, something else woke me up.  Not a movement of any sort, but more like a distractions from elsewhere, I can\u2019t recall it.\n\nThere were also about 3 or 4 times that I had looked too much with my normal sight, and he completely disappeared, I told him to pop out of a doorway while I gazed at the distance so I could re-focus and keep him in my view.  So he did this a few times, and however it works, this method seems to make it work best.  So I definitely had to exercise a certain type of looking at him in order to prevent him from disappearing, perhaps it was only my expectation/belief about it?  I'm not sure.\n\nI was so excited that I had such direct contact, as this interaction went on for a good 20 minutes, that I didn\u2019t want to wake up, I wanted to continue sleeping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2021-05-06\n\nAs soon as I laid down to sleep, I was very tired.  It was quite immediate this time, I was definitely scared, but quickly reminded myself that my goal was to go with the experience, not fight it.\n\nAs soon as I was falling asleep, I was feeling movement all over me, like energetic nudges all over my legs and body.  I was also feeling the, I don't even know how to explain most of this, but it is also very familiar.\n\nIt was similar to when I wake up in the in-between state and find vibration activity, I always fight it because it doesn't feel like it's me doing it.  It feels like it is something else acting upon me.  And if I allow it to do what it wants it will pull me off to somewhere.\n\nWell this time, I definitely had the instinct to fight it, and I did at first, but quickly adjusted and braced myself to just go with it.  I did though put out my intention firewall stating that I am only open to those beings that have my best interests at heart, and even prayed that I would be kept safe during such an experience.\n\nI also was remembering that earlier in the day I had set a clear intention out to higher beings or aliens, however you want to put it that I was open to communication/interaction.\n\nI can already tell that no matter how I write this, I won't do any real justice to the experience by trying to wrap it with words.  Not only that but it was at the very beginning of the night.\n\nAnyway, the energy feeling is accompanied by a sort of head feeling like, my head is falling or being pulled back and every time I am prompted by this energetic feeling, the falling sensation is accompanied by sounds that are kind of like a \"whoomp, whoomp, whoomp\".\n\nMy whole life I have fought this, thinking I was under attack, and this felt no different, but I figured it was time to try something different, at the suggestion of a friend, to not fight it, but go with it.  So instead, I just allowed myself to enter that high vibration state.  It also has a distinct feeling of shifting, where I am now fully in the realm of intuitive understanding, for lack of a better description.  The movement picked up it was all over me, little energetic nudges, that part is a little different, but perhaps it's because I never allowed myself to go with the experience.\n\nThe rest of this experience is mostly new to me.  I let them continue, and then I felt something behind me, fairly certain it's my IOB, but at the same time I can't be certain of anything other than, it was definitely an external force.  It was moving my energy body out of my physical body, sliding me out like jello, I felt it roll me to the right, and I slid far enough out of my body completely, but then it rolled me to the left, a little farther than the right side, this happened again, and then when it rolled me back to the right the 3rd time it began to take off, and was pulling me, I felt like I was flying with it.  I even sort of curled the tips of my fingers to hold onto this precipice I felt like I was on, even though I felt like it may be unnecesary.\n\nI was moving very fast and upwards into the air, hundreds of miles per hour.\n\n(This is the only part of the experience that I have experienced before, I've allowed myself to be pulled by this being only maybe twice before, and this is what it chose to do when I stopped fighting)\n\nI very narrowly cracked my physical eyes open during this experience, as I just HAD to know if I was still in my bed, I was, in that dimension, and I didn't want to interrupt the process so I quickly closed them and tried to relax as it kept flying.\n\nAfter a while, maybe around 5 minutes of this, I found myself laying in bed, except in hindsight, it wasn't my physical bed, but I was now in a dream, thinking I was still in bed.  I then felt a series of other energy maneuvers on me, one of them felt like a floor buffer that was going over my head, vibrating it intensely, at times I had to move my head violently out of the way as I telepathically said \"WTF, that hurts\".  I would then try to leave it how it was even though it hurt, but sometimes it was so intense I had to move my head, annoyed, because I felt like they should know how much was too much.\n\nI then got the telepathic impression that they were working on me, or upgrading me, to make me fit for interaction.  What they were doing, I really have no idea, but this isn't the first time I've had energy or invisible beings working on me in a way where it clearly felt like they were doing upgrades to my energy body.\n\nAfter this, some very interesting dreams took place, one of them which was a continuation of this one, where I got out of bed, and was walking around, I remember there were some sort of creepy human statues, after a long while as I was leaving (and doing all kinds of other stuff) I just HAD to test it, as my intuition or inner knowing, knew that if I only just beckoned it/them, they would come to life.  And so I did, I stood there with an expectation, and as if immediately on queue, these statues came alive and started interacting with me.  (In hindsight, I wonder if they were alive the whole time, simply masquerading as inanimate objects of people).\n\nAt first of course I want to be scared or creeped out, but they weren't negative or scary in any way they were very friendly every time they came alive to interact.  One of them I even shook his hand, it should have felt like wood or a soft pillow of sorts based on how it looked, but it felt like a human hand and I made a joke like \"oh you are real, you're just pretending huh?\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2021-05-07\n\nI also had a bit of an experience last night.  I had briefly mentioned it in the Castaneda chat, and Dan spoke saying \"keep it going, intent starts to develop momentum, but there are other things that can interfere, like trying to do too much\".\n\nInterestingly this is what I think interrupted my flow.  I wasn't as deeply tired last night as I was meditating before bed, at least I wasn't as deep in the other awareness.  But I was relaxing, and I could start to feel it prodding around my legs again, similar to the night before, but it wasn't as strong, it was like my 1st Attention was still very much still in control.  I then felt it rocking my energy body again, except instead of left to right, it was more at an angle like a 10 o'clock angle, from my bottom right foot to my upper left shoulder.\n\nI tried to help the movement, but thought left to right might be better so I tried to rock myself, my own energy body left to right, I started to get ambitious about the prospect of leaving my body, and quickly caught myself in that flow of thoughts, and noticed that by trying to take over, I had interrupted the natural subtle, and seemingly far too weak rocking motions that were already occurring.  I gave up and tried to telepathically say \"Sorry, I will just relax and try not to interfere\".  But it didn't really continue or pick up after that.  I mean it DID, but it was even weaker and instead of constant it was kind of sporadic, as if my thinking mind was disconnecting and reconnecting me to it, when I managed to disengage it, and then it would automatically involve itself again, so I found myself instead spending my energy trying to relax and disengage, but this whole process kept me thinking too much I think.  ---  ultimately I just fell asleep at some point.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "3 Nights of IOB activity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_n7acoi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_5rco1mpq", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1620425565.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1620425255.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be a bit of a long post, but I figured I would put all 3 here since I didn&amp;#39;t post them the day of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2021-05-05&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in the in-between state\u2026 I could sense shadow movement around my peripheral, in order to focus on it, I practiced gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately saw shadow movement again, it was moving around, as it did I started trying to attack it, but I was moving too slow, it would barely escape my wrath/clutch.

I mean it DID, but it was even weaker and instead of constant it was kind of sporadic, as if my thinking mind was disconnecting and reconnecting me to it, when I managed to disengage it, and then it would automatically involve itself again, so I found myself instead spending my energy trying to relax and disengage, but this whole process kept me thinking too much I think.  ---  ultimately I just fell asleep at some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "n7acoi", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DreamingTheDouble", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 15, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/n7acoi/3_nights_of_iob_activity/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/n7acoi/3_nights_of_iob_activity/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1620425255.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gxeh5il", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gxbw68o", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Both are the same thing.

That your experiences are not as valid as open eye, walking around dark room.\n\nMy most vivid experiences in dreaming as a child were just like that, as probably are those of all children. That's the cool thing about very small children. They don't distinguish between dreaming and waking.  It all just \"is\" what you are doing at that moment.\n\nBut I have a battle going with the skeptics of Carlos, and prefer if people do things no one else can do. Not even Yogis or Zen masters.\n\nSo if you can find a way, please try to move to standing up walking around, with eyes open, and eliminate the falling asleep part.\n\nYou're sort of off in sleep paralysis territory, where you wake up while asleep.  \n\nWalking around is important.  I just chatted with a guy on facebook who is doing darkroom, has had some success, but he falls asleep.\n\nWhich makes me think maybe he didn't read my instructions.\n\nYou NEED to be able to walk around, so you can't fall asleep by accident.\n\nIf you can't manage that, then you at least need to be vigilant to change sitting positions or move your legs around, when you get sleepy.\n\nAnd keep some espresso cans by the bed!\n\nFalling asleep = bad bad bad (for restoring reputations).\n\nThat said, those do sound like IOBs to me.\n\nI'm not so sure about your interpretation of what's the energy body.\n\nWe had a conflict recently over that.

The memory was so far into the red zone it could not be recalled without moving back.\n\nSo I'll describe the picture I wanted to make, instead of drawing it.\n\nImagine there's a big poster of \"The Teachings of Don Juan\" on a wall.\n\nPeople come to look at it.  There's a Castaneda guy who talks to them, if they are interested.\n\nThey do this sort of thing at the \"Hindu Festival of Colors\" near my home.

The Maitreya guy, on hearing this, joked, \"She wouldn't have nun of you!\"\n\nSo the guy at the Castaneda booth has someone walk up and suggest, \"This is a little like Daoist philosophy\", and he gives him a little paper with an inspirational taoist quote on it.  Asks if he'll stick it to the side on the poster. Maybe it will get more people interested in his book.\n\nThe Castaneda guy doesn't like it, knowing that's not the same thing at all, but he figures maybe it will increase interest as the visitor suggests.\n\nSo he sticks it on there.\n\nThe next guy comes along and insists Dzogchen has the same thing, and wants to put a little picture of Milarepa in a cave with his demons, on the other side of the poster.\n\nThis guy is a buddhist, so he's very angry. The castaneda expert sticks it on the other side with a fake grin, hoping the angry buddhist will go away before he starts striking out.\n\nBy the end of the day, you can't see any of the poster.  The Castaneda guy now has a large crowd around him, but they aren't discussing Castaneda at all.\n\nThey're fighting over the pieces of paper they stuck to the book.\n\nThat's where we are now.", "edited": 1620492504.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gxei4a0", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make a picture to explain this today, but I have to show what &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; looked like, digging on the red line dirt road with her fingers.

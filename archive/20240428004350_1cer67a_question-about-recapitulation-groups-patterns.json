false, "body": "I can only give my opinion, I suppose it will work differently for everyone.\n\nI stick with the explanations about the recapitulation given by Florinda (from the DJ group) in the gift of the eagle.\n\n\"Florinda explained to me that since awareness is the food of the Eagle, it can be satisfied with a perfect recapitulation instead of awareness itself. She then gave me the fundamental aspects of recapitulation. She said that the first stage consists of a brief recounting of all the incidents of our lives that are clearly open to scrutiny.\"\n\n\"The second phase is a more detailed recounting, starting at a point that could be the moment before the stalker takes a seat in the box, and systematically extends, at least in theory, up to the moment of birth itself. She assured me that a perfect recapitulation could change a warrior even more than total control of the dreaming body. In this aspect, dreaming and stalking lead to the same end: entry into the third attention. However, it was important for a warrior to know and practice both. She told me that a woman can only master one of the two, depending on configurations in the luminous body. On the other hand, men can easily practice both, but never reach the level of effectiveness that women achieve in each art.\"\n\n\"Florinda explained to me that the key element in recapitulating was breathing. Breath, for her, was magical, because it was a life-giving function. She said that remembering becomes easy if one can reduce the area of estimation around the body. That's why the box should be used; then, breathing itself promotes deeper memories.\"\n\n\"In theory, stalkers have to remember every feeling they have had in their lives, and this process starts with a breath. Florinda warned me that everything she was teaching me was just the preliminaries, and that someday in the future and in a different place, she would teach me the more intricate details.\"\n\n\"Florinda told me that her benefactor started by making her compile a list of events to relive. She said the procedure starts with an initial breath. Stalkers begin each session with their chin on the right shoulder and slowly inhale while moving their head in an arc of one hundred eighty degrees. The breath ends over the left shoulder. Once the inhalation is complete, the head returns to the front position and they exhale while looking forward.\"\n\n\"Stalkers then take the event at the top of the list and stay there until all the feelings invested in it have been recounted. As they remember, they slowly inhale moving their head from the right shoulder to the left. This breathing serves to restore energy. Florinda held that the luminous body constantly creates filaments resembling spider webs, and that these are propelled out of the luminous mass by any kind of emotion. Therefore, every situation involving social action, or in which feelings are involved, is potentially draining for the luminous body. By breathing from right to left, when an event is remembered the stalkers, through the magic of breathing, retrieve the filaments they left behind. The next immediate breath is from left to right, and it is an exhalation. With it, stalkers expel the filaments that other luminous bodies, which were involved in the event being remembered, left in them.\"\n\n\"Florinda emphasized that the rule defines stalking and dreaming as arts, therefore, they are something one puts into action, something one carries out. She said the intrinsic nature of breath is to give life, and that is what gives it the ability to cleanse the luminous body. This ability is what makes recapitulation a practical matter.\"\n\n\"In our next meeting, Florinda summarized what she called her last-minute instructions. She asserted that, since the mutual agreement of the nagual Juan Matus and his group of warriors had been that I did not need to deal with the everyday world, they had taught me to dream and not to stalk. She explained that this decision had been radically changed, and that they found themselves in an uncomfortable position: they no longer had time to teach me stalking. She had to stay on the periphery of the third attention, to fulfill this task in a later time, when I was ready. On the other hand, if I could leave the world with them, she would be relieved of that responsibility.\"\n\n\"Florinda told me that her benefactor considered the three basic techniques of stalking - the box, the list of events to recapitulate, and the stalker's breathing - as the three most important tasks a warrior can carry out. Her benefactor was convinced that a deep recapitulation is the quickest way to lose the human form.

She said that the first stage consists of a brief recounting of all the incidents of our lives that are clearly open to scrutiny.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The second phase is a more detailed recounting, starting at a point that could be the moment before the stalker takes a seat in the box, and systematically extends, at least in theory, up to the moment of birth itself. She assured me that a perfect recapitulation could change a warrior even more than total control of the dreaming body. In this aspect, dreaming and stalking lead to the same end: entry into the third attention. However, it was important for a warrior to know and practice both. She told me that a woman can only master one of the two, depending on configurations in the luminous body. On the other hand, men can easily practice both, but never reach the level of effectiveness that women achieve in each art.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Florinda explained to me that the key element in recapitulating was breathing. Breath, for her, was magical, because it was a life-giving function. She said that remembering becomes easy if one can reduce the area of estimation around the body. That&amp;#39;s why the box should be used; then, breathing itself promotes deeper memories.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In theory, stalkers have to remember every feeling they have had in their lives, and this process starts with a breath. Florinda warned me that everything she was teaching me was just the preliminaries, and that someday in the future and in a different place, she would teach me the more intricate details.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Florinda told me that her benefactor started by making her compile a list of events to relive. She said the procedure starts with an initial breath. Stalkers begin each session with their chin on the right shoulder and slowly inhale while moving their head in an arc of one hundred eighty degrees. The breath ends over the left shoulder. Once the inhalation is complete, the head returns to the front position and they exhale while looking forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stalkers then take the event at the top of the list and stay there until all the feelings invested in it have been recounted. As they remember, they slowly inhale moving their head from the right shoulder to the left. This breathing serves to restore energy. Florinda held that the luminous body constantly creates filaments resembling spider webs, and that these are propelled out of the luminous mass by any kind of emotion. Therefore, every situation involving social action, or in which feelings are involved, is potentially draining for the luminous body. By breathing from right to left, when an event is remembered the stalkers, through the magic of breathing, retrieve the filaments they left behind. The next immediate breath is from left to right, and it is an exhalation. With it, stalkers expel the filaments that other luminous bodies, which were involved in the event being remembered, left in them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Florinda emphasized that the rule defines stalking and dreaming as arts, therefore, they are something one puts into action, something one carries out. She said the intrinsic nature of breath is to give life, and that is what gives it the ability to cleanse the luminous body. This ability is what makes recapitulation a practical matter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In our next meeting, Florinda summarized what she called her last-minute instructions. She asserted that, since the mutual agreement of the nagual Juan Matus and his group of warriors had been that I did not need to deal with the everyday world, they had taught me to dream and not to stalk. She explained that this decision had been radically changed, and that they found themselves in an uncomfortable position: they no longer had time to teach me stalking. She had to stay on the periphery of the third attention, to fulfill this task in a later time, when I was ready. On the other hand, if I could leave the world with them, she would be relieved of that responsibility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Florinda told me that her benefactor considered the three basic techniques of stalking - the box, the list of events to recapitulate, and the stalker&amp;#39;s breathing - as the three most important tasks a warrior can carry out. Her benefactor was convinced that a deep recapitulation is the quickest way to lose the human form. Therefore, it is easier for stalkers, after recapitulating their lives, to make use of all the non-doings of the personal self, such as erasing personal history, losing self-importance, breaking routines, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope that the AI \u200b\u200bI used translated correctly, you can find more information about that explanation in the gift of the eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although in my case I did not read the books by Florinda and Taisha (from the CC group) where they surely explain more of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1cer67a/question_about_recapitulation_groups_patterns/l1mo0ue/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1714305280.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1cer67a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}]

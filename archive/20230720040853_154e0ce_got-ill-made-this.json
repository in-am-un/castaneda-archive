Couldn't concentrate on either computer design work, or the luminous egg animation.\n\nSo I started an easier one, working with a woman from the subreddit. \n\nWomb dreaming.\n\nThe blue panels with instructions are nice, but until you see it for yourself and realize what STUNNING magic sorcery produces, you might be thinking in terms of \"visualizing\" it.\n\nNEVER NEVER NEVER visualize sorcery effects!\n\nThat's the same as picking an ordinary dream that is about your obsession with sorcery, and claiming whatever happens that you can remember, is four gates dreaming.\n\nIt's NOT. If you don't follow the instructions, it's just an ordinary dream.\nLucid or not.\n\nLikewise, if you are \"visualizing\" magic, you're never going to succeed at learning the real thing.\n\nThe real thing takes real work! It's painful. It's AWFUL.\n\n\nBut slowly, the terribleness of it gives way to silence. And magic begins to be visible.\n\nThat will bring tears to your eyes! Imagine having REAL magic, instead of the pretend kind everyone is selling.\n\nBut puffs and weird colors floating in the air is not the end of it.\n\nYou'll get to play with the Allies, who will come and teach you as the dreaming emissary.\n\nAWAKE. There's no need to be inside a sleeping dream, in order for the Allies to teach you.\n\nIn fact, if you try to do it that way you must have passed the first and second gate of dreaming. And as far as I know, there isn't a single man who can find his hands for real, following the instructions Carlos gave us, and do that daily. \n\nDaily. \n\nThat's what it takes to pass the first gate, where you must find a scout and make good enough friends with it, and learn to hold those dreams for hours at a time, so that it will take you to its world.\n\nNo one has ever done that. They just make up stuff about their ordinary dreams, so they can deceive others.\nSame is true if you are \"visualizing\" your results.\n\nVisualizing is just fake magic, like everywhere else.\n\nSo I plan to take that post made a few day sago in the subreddit, and animate it.\n\nThen you can see what we're talking about, and hopefully get excited enough to stop merely \"visualizing\", and instead get involved with \"doing\".\n\nWorking your buns off to remove that internal dialogue.\n\nI'm afraid, this initial small piece of the final animation, has no special effects. \n\nOther than \"Fairy\", one of the two Allies Carlos introduced to one of his private classes. Fairy started out as a terrifying crazy man, a diabolical genius, who threatened and frightened me for perhaps 15 years following the death of Carlos. \n\nI finally had to taker her seriously, and admit that Carlos had told us the truth. She then created \"Darkroom\", so that the men wouldn't lie about their ordinary dreams, and keep messing up the community.\n\nDarkroom forces you to do dreaming AWAKE. With your eyes open, by using the Tensegrity. \n\nYou just can't fake that. Or pretend it. Or even lie about it, and get away with it. Someone who can do it knows when you're lying.\n\nWomb dreaming is a vast topic, but this poster has used darkroom practice to place some \"verifications\" on whether you have actually gotten silent.\n\nBy the way, the second of the Allies Carlos introduced us to, was seen just a day or two ago. Minx, likely the Devil's Weed entity, visited another from the subreddit and explained he'd (she'd) been busy lately.\n\nI haven't seen either Fairy nor Minx since Cholita told me I was overusing the Allies and they were going to be taken away.\n\nBy some old woman of unknown identity.\n\nSorcery is weird.\"\n\n*[Source Facebook Post](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0LqAsw5gdMMZwwBBgSdDzJrzzfopzakGXSbYYAj9vsAUxQYgTEtLVUMn9Xw1kjcNTl&amp;id=100004473870769&amp;post_id=100004473870769_pfbid0LqAsw5gdMMZwwBBgSdDzJrzzfopzakGXSbYYAj9vsAUxQYgTEtLVUMn9Xw1kjcNTl&amp;from_close_friend=1&amp;notif_id=1689766843413258)*", "edited": 1690155980.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jsq2y3n", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Dan&amp;#39;s Facebook posting:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Womb Dreaming Animation Coming&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was a little ill today.

They just make up stuff about their ordinary dreams, so they can deceive others.\nSame is true if you are &amp;quot;visualizing&amp;quot; your results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visualizing is just fake magic, like everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I plan to take that post made a few day sago in the subreddit, and animate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you can see what we&amp;#39;re talking about, and hopefully get excited enough to stop merely &amp;quot;visualizing&amp;quot;, and instead get involved with &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working your buns off to remove that internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, this initial small piece of the final animation, has no special effects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot;, one of the two Allies Carlos introduced to one of his private classes. Fairy started out as a terrifying crazy man, a diabolical genius, who threatened and frightened me for perhaps 15 years following the death of Carlos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally had to taker her seriously, and admit that Carlos had told us the truth. She then created &amp;quot;Darkroom&amp;quot;, so that the men wouldn&amp;#39;t lie about their ordinary dreams, and keep messing up the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom forces you to do dreaming AWAKE. With your eyes open, by using the Tensegrity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just can&amp;#39;t fake that. Or pretend it. Or even lie about it, and get away with it. Someone who can do it knows when you&amp;#39;re lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Womb dreaming is a vast topic, but this poster has used darkroom practice to place some &amp;quot;verifications&amp;quot; on whether you have actually gotten silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, the second of the Allies Carlos introduced us to, was seen just a day or two ago. Minx, likely the Devil&amp;#39;s Weed entity, visited another from the subreddit and explained he&amp;#39;d (she&amp;#39;d) been busy lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen either Fairy nor Minx since Cholita told me I was overusing the Allies and they were going to be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By some old woman of unknown identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is weird.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0LqAsw5gdMMZwwBBgSdDzJrzzfopzakGXSbYYAj9vsAUxQYgTEtLVUMn9Xw1kjcNTl&amp;amp;id=100004473870769&amp;amp;post_id=100004473870769_pfbid0LqAsw5gdMMZwwBBgSdDzJrzzfopzakGXSbYYAj9vsAUxQYgTEtLVUMn9Xw1kjcNTl&amp;amp;from_close_friend=1&amp;amp;notif_id=1689766843413258\"&gt;Source Facebook Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/154e0ce/got_ill_made_this/jsq2y3n/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1689858437.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_154e0ce", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jsqom18", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1689867262.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_154e0ce", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "My animation skills are growing.

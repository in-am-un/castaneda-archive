His theory is that the jogging interrupts the internal dialogue, eventually making them visible if one follows you and makes an effort to be seen.\n\nI wanted to know if he could REALLY visually see it. \n\nI'd like to know what it looked like.\n\nI couldn't get a good answer.\n\nEventually he said yes, he can visually see it. I asked, \"as if it were standing right here, in front of you?\"\n\nHe said yes.\n\nThat\u2019s hard to believe, since I never heard that he shit his pants the first time.\n\nAnyone meeting Little Smoke while jogging in the dark, would shit their pants for sure.\n\nIt wasn't until I started using gimp to make pictures that he admitted, no. \n\nHe doesn't see it, \"visually\".\n\nIt's his imagining ability.\n\nOr to say it more honestly, he doesn't believe this sorcery crap is really possible, so he invented his own idea of what I mean by \"visually see it for real\".\n\nHe thought I meant \"daydream\" it.\n\nI discovered this in private classes, when I was completely soaked in recapitulation.\n\nA full recapitulation has a profound effect on you. It restores your ability to \"day dream\".\n\nWe forget what that is, by the time we reach midlife.\n\nRecap brings it back.\n\nSo you find yourself pulled into a miniature dream, when you think about various topics.\n\nStanding there, you sort of \u201cblank out\u201d, but find yourself visually watching your memory.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s going inward.\n\nDarkness gazing requires going outward.\n\nSo I\u2019m afraid newbies, given a list of a bunch of things you can see in darkness, would start going inward and imaging the things.\n\nWe have hundreds of skilled lucid dreamers in the Castaneda community.\n\nBut it came to nothing.  No real magic.  Nothing more than what you find in the Lucid dreaming subreddit.\n\nThe people in there wouldn't even believe one of the illustrations of waking dreaming, in this subreddit\n\nYou need to **visually** see them, undeniably.

His theory is that the jogging interrupts the internal dialogue, eventually making them visible if one follows you and makes an effort to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know if he could REALLY visually see it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to know what it looked like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t get a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually he said yes, he can visually see it. I asked, &amp;quot;as if it were standing right here, in front of you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s hard to believe, since I never heard that he shit his pants the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone meeting Little Smoke while jogging in the dark, would shit their pants for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until I started using gimp to make pictures that he admitted, no. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t see it, &amp;quot;visually&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s his imagining ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to say it more honestly, he doesn&amp;#39;t believe this sorcery crap is really possible, so he invented his own idea of what I mean by &amp;quot;visually see it for real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He thought I meant &amp;quot;daydream&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered this in private classes, when I was completely soaked in recapitulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A full recapitulation has a profound effect on you. It restores your ability to &amp;quot;day dream&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We forget what that is, by the time we reach midlife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recap brings it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you find yourself pulled into a miniature dream, when you think about various topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standing there, you sort of \u201cblank out\u201d, but find yourself visually watching your memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that\u2019s going inward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkness gazing requires going outward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I\u2019m afraid newbies, given a list of a bunch of things you can see in darkness, would start going inward and imaging the things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have hundreds of skilled lucid dreamers in the Castaneda community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it came to nothing.  No real magic.  Nothing more than what you find in the Lucid dreaming subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people in there wouldn&amp;#39;t even believe one of the illustrations of waking dreaming, in this subreddit&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to &lt;strong&gt;visually&lt;/strong&gt; see them, undeniably. Or it won\u2019t move the assemblage point towards heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019ll move sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why Carlos designed the Tensegrity to scoop stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And taught us to compress the \u201cchi balls\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The \u201cfine details\u201d he gave us are hidden in the movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We won\u2019t know what those are until we get a lot of waking dreamers, and some are not as lazy as me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to get experts on each movement, to see what we\u2019ve missed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s our legacy, but we\u2019re treating it like merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ilzfhg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ilzfhg/the_purple_web/g3wtm9w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1599171048.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1599171048.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g3w8etj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1599163394.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g3w1gs4", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "So can the details not lead to heightened awareness?

A reward to make you get out of bed and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not necessarily an &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; position for anything in particular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, Cholita stopped visiting me in her dreaming double, just around the time I learned to pass through the crystalline dreaming fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got 2 visits while I was learning to do it, and each time when she tried to follow me she broke up into pieces.  Literally, large chunks of her were floating in the air, just like in that picture I made about Gremlin Hunting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that she turned green, trying to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s ALWAYS been bluish white. At least, all incidents I can remember off hand.  It&amp;#39;s hard to remember stuff from the second attention, and even if you write it down, it still fades away faster than you&amp;#39;d expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But 2 nights ago Cholita visited again, after a long time with no visits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she even re-enabled my ability to remote view her face!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A green ghost of Cholita, with her latest cutesy hair. She has 2 pony tails, one on each side of her head.  She&amp;#39;s finally given up the Carlos hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first thought at the time was, she&amp;#39;s learned to pass into where I&amp;#39;m at, inside the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she didn&amp;#39;t stop visiting. She simply couldn&amp;#39;t.  My assemblage point was too far for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe not anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ilzfhg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ilzfhg/the_purple_web/g402lrg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1599235789.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1599235789.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g3xdz0g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1599178147.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g3xar2b", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I like the new game.

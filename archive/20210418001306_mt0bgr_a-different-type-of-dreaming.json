Lidotska got me interested in that many months ago, so daily I go try to \"see\" the tree.\n\nI've had some progress.  I'll be looking at the huge tree, and especially the spaces between branches, and the dark parts will become intense, like dark energy in the dark room.\n\nI get a creepy feeling that lets me be almost perfectly silent, if I can hold it.\n\nOver time, I've seen more and more second attention content.\n\nA blueish ball of fibers, radiating out from the center, forms in the middle of the mass.\n\nI can see all the individual fibers, but not so well a \"normal\" person wouldn't rub their eyes and ignore it.\n\nI realized I need to hold it somehow, without interfering, and the sight would uncover hidden \"skimmings of intent\".\n\nWe block most of what we could perceive, so if you get even a tiny hint of it, watching that longer is a good thing to do.\n\nSo I was watching that 2 days ago, and an intense orange dot burned into view, nearer to the top of the tree.\n\nIt was much like the sun catching some glass, and glaring into your eye for an instant.  It was that bright.\n\nExcept, I could clearly see a perfect spherical shape to the orange dot, and it had yellow fibers emanating away from it.\n\nI rubbed my eyes, to ignore it.  Then I realized my mistake and returned to trying to see the blue fibers.\n\nThree more dots bloomed and disappeared, over different spots.  The tree was literally \"sparkling\".\n\nI got angry, lifted my hand, palm towards the tree, circled it around like I was Merlin the magician or something, and said, \"None of that!  That's not it!!!\"\n\nAnd it was gone.\n\nI've been back there 6 times since, and there's nothing.\n\nI intended it all away with a single careless mistake.\n\nI suppose I'm going to have to go apologize to the tree today.", "edited": 1618766960.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_guzkqgu", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Carlos died, I took a group of 3 or 4 women to  Della Van Hise&amp;#39;s home at Joshua tree, and we tried this with a rope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of us linked by the rope, eyes closed, walking along a desert path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was at front so I could select a safe path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d done this eyes open, and walked into another world a time or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought the mass of women ought to make it possible, but I didn&amp;#39;t have the energy back then that I do now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t have any luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, most of the women eventually gave up, and cursed Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lack of a &amp;quot;lifestyle&amp;quot; is the cause, according to my inorganic being Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t drop women off in the middle of nowhere, and not expect them to find some friends.  Even if there&amp;#39;s a rumor that an old gold mine is nearby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is, the women who followed me there were hoping to come up with a new &amp;quot;lifestyle&amp;quot;,  given that Carlos was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what Carlos had done. Put together a lifestyle for the women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if men wanted to hang out, that&amp;#39;s fine. But it was all designed for the women to remain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the ones I took to Joshua tree still lurks around, but she&amp;#39;s hanging out with an ambivalent man from class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The type that simply declared himself a sorcerer, and to hell with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not to happy to see this place. So she won&amp;#39;t come too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But watch the closed eye thing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a death trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s tainted with the intent of meditation systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think that&amp;#39;s an exaggeration, I&amp;#39;ll tell a weird story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happened two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gazing at a huge tree, hoping to see the luminous shell.  Lidotska got me interested in that many months ago, so daily I go try to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; the tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had some progress.  I&amp;#39;ll be looking at the huge tree, and especially the spaces between branches, and the dark parts will become intense, like dark energy in the dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get a creepy feeling that lets me be almost perfectly silent, if I can hold it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time, I&amp;#39;ve seen more and more second attention content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A blueish ball of fibers, radiating out from the center, forms in the middle of the mass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see all the individual fibers, but not so well a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; person wouldn&amp;#39;t rub their eyes and ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized I need to hold it somehow, without interfering, and the sight would uncover hidden &amp;quot;skimmings of intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We block most of what we could perceive, so if you get even a tiny hint of it, watching that longer is a good thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was watching that 2 days ago, and an intense orange dot burned into view, nearer to the top of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was much like the sun catching some glass, and glaring into your eye for an instant.  It was that bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, I could clearly see a perfect spherical shape to the orange dot, and it had yellow fibers emanating away from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rubbed my eyes, to ignore it.  Then I realized my mistake and returned to trying to see the blue fibers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three more dots bloomed and disappeared, over different spots.  The tree was literally &amp;quot;sparkling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got angry, lifted my hand, palm towards the tree, circled it around like I was Merlin the magician or something, and said, &amp;quot;None of that!  That&amp;#39;s not it!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been back there 6 times since, and there&amp;#39;s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I intended it all away with a single careless mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;#39;m going to have to go apologize to the tree today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mt0bgr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mt0bgr/a_different_type_of_dreaming/guzkqgu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1618766551.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1618766551.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "guy7dxi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "ItsBeyoondMee", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1618733957.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_guwtzqn", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_bgj6frr6", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yes you can wear mask.

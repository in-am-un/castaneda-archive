Thus, everyone should try to read ALL of the books.  Things like that mention of changing to the double with a breath change, are useful when you stumble across it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you might consider it a &amp;quot;fluke&amp;quot; of which there are hundreds you will run across.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Undiscovered&amp;quot; techniques. Which because no one else did that, aren&amp;#39;t as useful as the ones where seers of the past burned a wide path to repeat them (their latent awareness in the emanations).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as long as you maintain that &amp;quot;the double is merged with you&amp;quot; feeling, which gives rise to that noticeably odd and peaceful breath, where the air seems to exhale into your energy body and make it glow a tiny bit brighter, you could afford a small amount of mundane internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the odd thing about your experience isn&amp;#39;t the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could be seeing naked women up there and it would be the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Darn, I&amp;#39;ll have to try that...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The unusual thing is that you managed to sustain it a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1b51fqk/dancing_leaves/kt5d8wx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1709474938.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1b51fqk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kt5dd34", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1709474992.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1b51fqk", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "https://i.redd.it/tifjv5ptm4mc1.gif", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kt5dd34", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/tifjv5ptm4mc1.gif\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/tifjv5ptm4mc1.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1b51fqk/dancing_leaves/kt5dd34/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1709474992.0, "media_metadata": {"tifjv5ptm4mc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "AnimatedImage", "m": "image/gif", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tifjv5ptm4mc1.gif?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=bac93a4d6534e2e7eaf2353a4e2326aeaff144cd"}], "s": {"y": 132, "gif": "https://i.redd.it/tifjv5ptm4mc1.gif", "mp4": "https://preview.redd.it/tifjv5ptm4mc1.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=e947385d83ba3c661992122a4f8c7397907ddc33", "x": 200}, "id": "tifjv5ptm4mc1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1b51fqk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}]

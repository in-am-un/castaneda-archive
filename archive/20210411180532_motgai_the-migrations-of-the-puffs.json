You have to go inside, for that body.\n\nYou'll learn this eventually, you don't have to take my word for it.  In fact, don't take anyone's word for anything to do with magic, ever again!\n\nTake what they say as a possible \"lead\", but  you have to do it yourself. Find the answers with hard work of your own.\n\nMy inorganic being \"Fancy\" loves it when I build her a snowman from the puffs of color.  She takes it over, and will even dance with me.\n\nOne time she...\n\nWell.  Don't tell Cholita.  She already asks if I'm naked in the dark room, especially on the occasions when she visits in her dreaming double.\n\nAnd it was all on Fancy. I never laid a  hand on her.\n\nJuann's fed puffs to Fairy, like cotton candy.\n\nBut likely just pushing the cotton candy onto her head, would work better.  Don't worry, it doesn't get stuck the way bubble gum does.\n\nOf course, we all should have known that the puffs of color were associated with a \"body\", since Kylie and the Chacmools went over it again and again at workshops.\n\nGather the energy from the periphery using Tensegrity, and \"redeploy\" it to the center, to rebuild your energy body.\n\nMy favorite pass for discussions is the one where you jump up and hook puffs with your cupped hand, pulling them down into your torso.\n\nYou're trying to put the visible puffs of energy onto your body, so that you can visually see it, as a new body.  A body made of light.\n\nSome passes even ask you to strike it with Kung Fu blows picked up from Howard Lee's classes.\n\nWhile it's in front of you!  Not while it's on you.  So we know that new \"body\" can be there, a few feet from you.\n\nIt can be present in places other than on top of your skin.  Thus the \"Building a Snowman\" technique.\n\nAnd the finger wiggling thing of Zuleica is designed to help you \"feel\" the edge of the new energy body, which seems to be quite smaller than our luminous shell.  My guess is that it's about 2 feet from your torso, all around you.\n\nWell, not guess. I can visually see it now, which you can learn to do, if you just keep up the puffery.\n\nBut why is it 2 feet away, if you scooped it right onto your skin?\n\nAnd how does it end up all the away at the outer limit of our luminous shell?\n\nFor most people, it's all \"over there\", barely within arms reach.  And being dispersed like that, makes the owner of the energy dull indeed.\n\nThere seem to be a lot of unknown factors, in regards to \"puff migration\".\n\nFor instance, why the puffs of color circulate around the dark room for you?\n\nWhy you can reach far out and scoop up a lot of purple light when you first start darkroom gazing for the night, but then an hour later there's almost nothing left out there to gather up, and the whitish energy on surfaces takes over.\n\nIt's almost as if you emptied out the inside of your luminous shell, removing all the puffs of light that block your view, and can then see the shell itself.\n\nCould that be the whitish light that forms textures, and then eventually assembles new worlds you can actually enter?\n\nI hadn't thought much about puff migration in the past.\n\nBut then last night, Cholita gave me a lesson.\n\nI had discovered that scooping the puffs with your hands does build up the energy body, but it wasn't quite what I was after.\n\nSo I've created a technique to allow rapid entry into dreams.  Access to the dreaming worlds, only available with profound silence.\n\nI'll draw that  up eventually. Right now it's hazardous.  You can lose hours of time, with no way to stop it.\n\nBut that technique lures the puffs of color around 18 inches away from your body.\n\nI don't know if that's a \"Zuleica coincidence\". \n\nIt's just where my eyes can focus best in the darkroom.\n\nAnd a bit of a disappointment. I prefer to have the puffs floating as a near solid wall, around 3 feet away.\n\nThat way, you can isolate more of them.\n\nWhen they come too close, each one nearly takes up your entire view, if you try to gaze into them.\n\nI was noticing that last night, and a bit annoyed by it,  when Cholita came home in her little Fiat 500.\n\nI could hear her gently closing the door of her car, presumably so I wouldn't hear it.\n\nShe had pizza.  But I didn't find out until the morning when I looked in the trash bin to see what's come of her last spell, down at the bottom.\n\nIt was a designer pizza. Not from around here.\n\nI don't know what the deal is with a whole pizza, but it had paranoid Cholita tip toeing into the house, as if she didn't want to have to share the pizza.\n\nWhich is odd, because I never leave my room while she's in the house. It's too dangerous.\n\nAnd she usually stomps around like I don't exist, no matter what time of the day or night.\n\nI realized she was home, while I was gazing at the puffs which were just 18 inches from my eyes, around 8 inches down.  At chest level I suppose.\n\nOne had a little formation, and I was trying to get it to open into a dreaming portal.\n\nFancy was making faces in a swirl of pink, next to the puff.  IOBs love it when you bring the puffs that close to your body, without actually placing them on it.  \n\nIt's like a McDonald's colorful \"Playplace\" playground area to them.  All you can eat cotton candy.\n\nCholita quietly set the pizza down on the table in the living room, and her foot banged the chair by accident.\n\nIt wasn't a startling sound like she usually makes, but just the fact that she was being so careful had me worried. I didn't realize it was a pizza situation.\n\nThe worry caused the puffs of color to move further away, to around 3 feet.\n\nJust where I prefer them!\n\nI kept listening for Cholita, wondering if the noise she made had caused it or if perhaps my worry had moved them further away.\n\nI remembered don Juans words, regarding how worry pushes our energy to the outside of our shell.\n\nIt's the stress and strain of daily living that prevents us from being natural sorcerers.\n\nThat's what we have to undo, with \"impeccability\".\n\nChiefly, eliminate all the worry by being more strategic perhaps?\n\nCholita managed to remain quiet for a good 20 minutes after that, possibly because the pizza was still around.\n\nAnd as I gazed at the puffs all around me, searching for entry into dreaming, they moved closer and closer to my body, until finally I could only search one puff at a time.  My gaze seemed to pull them closer.\n\nCholita must have finished the pizza, and possibly a Chelada beer too, because she headed for the bathroom.\n\nEach step she took pushed the puffs back out a tiny bit.\n\nWas it the sound, or was it my worry?\n\nIt's pretty scary to have a powerful witch tip toeing towards your completely dark room, knowing the locked door is no barrier to her.  But I've dealt with that before.\n\nThis time, even knowing she was headed towards the bathroom wasn't enough dispel the worry.  What was she up to this time, sneaking around like that?\n\nBy the time Cholita arrived at the bathroom my puffs were back to where I prefer them, at arm's length all around me.\n\nCholita found something she didn't like in the bathroom.  Possibly she decided I've been using her expensive smelly hand soap again, because the level has gone down faster than she believes it should.\n\nLike the crushed Asiago cheese she loves on refried beans, which disappears all by itself as she watches the plate.  She's shown me, saying, \"Look!!!\" with an accusational tone.  \n\nAngry in the bathroom, she picked up an object and threw it against the door, making a horrible crashing sound.\n\nI was gazing at the puffs, now at arm's length, when the sound gave me a jolt.\n\nI had a touch of fright, and the puffs of color became a bit blurry.\n\nThey behaved like tight clouds of smoke which had been hit by an air shock wave, making them expand a tiny bit so as to lose their tight edges.\n\nI'm used to \"Cholita fright\", and even look forward to it as a way to move my assemblage point.\n\nBut for an instant I was worried about why Cholita was sneaking around,  and then decided to come out in the open by slamming something around.\n\nMy worry grew to powerful levels as I watched the puffs of light flee to the outer shell of my luminous cocoon.\n\nThey fled like the lemmings did when startled in \"Life of Pi\", scurrying as far away from my physical body as they could.\n\nAll to the outside of the luminous shell.\n\nI clearly saw that it was the worry that had pushed them out there, not the fright.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Migrations of the Puffs", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_motgai", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1618160654.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1618157132.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the puffs of color you see in the darkroom are actually potential &amp;quot;bodies&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every one of them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s not enough mass, they can still form a body but it has to be a dreaming body.

I'm old, so waking up at 3AM isn't easy.  Sometimes I feel so tired, all I can manage to do is sit up on pillows and do Tensegrity, until my assemblage point moves to heightened awareness, at which point the tiredness goes away.\n\nI take any form I can find in the videos or notes, and do it sitting up on the bed.  You just have to be creative about modifying it.  Do each movement as perfectly as you can but when you can't, modify it to work.\n\nExample: dropping the assemblage point down movement where you look behind you at the floor below your butt.  And you have to twist the torso, and extend the hands out on either side.\n\nCan't do that sitting up on pillows against the bed frame.  So I turn as far left or right as is practical, and the hand that's suppose to push behind, goes to the side. I try to look down, but the best I can manage is at an angle to the side.\n\nIt's fine!   I can attest to that, because I can *see* the energy produced.  There's a visible fireworks show as usual, it's just \"modified\".\n\nAnd don't feel bad about that.  You summoned the *intent* of it regardless of whether you can manage to actually do that move.\n\nBut try to pick a form that's more suitable for it.\n\nAs for whether it's \"ok\", take the case of Taisha, who practiced Tensegrity with Zuleica  until she moved her assemblage point to the deep orange zone (with don Juan's nagual's blow earlier having helped her out). Then Zuleica sent her up into a tree house, and told her to lay on her side and visualize she was still doing tensegrity on the ground.\n\nIt brought out her double!\n\nBe sure to notice that Zuleica made lavish promises in that story, about how good that could work, such as her double could spin in the air like a 1970s kungfu movie.  That set up the *intent* of it.  So that the double would have a goal when it came out.\n\nThe double likes activity that's \"odd\".  And problems that need solving.  It gets curious.  If there's an impossible goal that goes along with it, he's even excited to try it.\n\nLike a little kid I suppose.  If you tell  a little kid, \"Let's get your fire engine toy and stick it in some mud\",  he's not going to be entirely thrilled about it.  If you say, \"Let's pretend  you're the fire chief and there's been a terrible flood with people trapped on the other side of a huge river of mud\", he's going to be excited to play.\n\nSo possibly for the sake of the double, Tensegrity comes with \"stories\".\n\nCarlos was clever...\n\nDon't toss out the story if you've restricted the movements.  As you practice, you'll modify the story yourself.\n\nAnd, if you have \"trouble\" doing the tensegrity properly, but you're doing it anyway, you've given the double an added \"interest\".  How to do that on the bed?\n\nHe's probably drooling on the side like an old brother watching his sibbling fail at putting together a new toy.  He'd love to just take it over and finish it!\n\nYour double by the way, can actually touch the real floor below the bed, without getting off the bed!  Laws of physics don't matter to him.  He can not only plant his palm face down on the floor, right through the bed, but he can remote view the sight of it, so that it's \"almost\" normal looking.\n\nYou'll do it yourself one day!  Just don't dismiss it later on.\n\nSo \"restricted my ass!\" is the double's motto.\n\nI suppose we could say (assuming you keep your eyes closed and don't fall asleep), that \"restricted Tensegrity\" brings the double out faster.\n\nNot that you'd be able to do anything with him as a beginner.  It's better to bring out the puffs than the double, for a beginner.\n\nThose \"puffs\" are in fact pieces of the double anyway.\n\nMy favorite \"restricted tensegrity\" is the long form my inorganic being designed from pieces of other forms, which produce the most vivid visible magic.\n\nImagine if you were a beginner doing long forms, and noticed you got a spectacular result with just one movement, of one particular form.\n\nSo you add that to a \"new custom form\" you are making for yourself.  And if that final form was nothing but those selected moves, it might be quite entertaining.\n\nMy inorganic being's idea was, to create a long form that produces dazzling magic with every move, including remote viewing, arms on fire with blue flames, manifesting inorganic beings riding along on your hand.  Because it overwhelms the internal dialogue.  It's hard to be thinking about the argument you got into with a coworker, when your arms are on fire.\n\nIt's quite spectacular!\n\nShe modified it for me, to work sitting on pillows also.  The expected \"magic\" happens, even if I can't manage to do the full movements.\n\nAnd I should probably leave this out, but there's a \"hippy on drugs\" version, modeled after those old movies of woodstock, with sexy young women showing off by dancing as if they were in a trance.\n\nTrance Tensegrity.  Don't tell anyone but it speeds up getting to the green line.  The green line is readily accessible to bizarre dance moves, like the Sufi's use.\n\nMy inorganic being (the evil one of the 3) designed it primarily to give her the most energy, but the side effect is that it brings out the double. That's their favorite energy source.\n\nThat Olmec statue of the werejaguar (sorcerers) riding on Pikachu tells you all you need to know about the double and it's relationship to inorganic beings.\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2066608093498300&amp;set=a.1585701564922291](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2066608093498300&amp;set=a.1585701564922291)", "edited": 1643818783.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hvagq0p", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, I do that all the time.

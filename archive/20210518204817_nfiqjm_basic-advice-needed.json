Yesterday while waiting for a traffic light, I ended up in someone&amp;#39;s kitchen for an instant.  I had to call out to intent, &amp;quot;No, no, no!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And unless you get rid of the internal dialogue, you can&amp;#39;t get rid of the fantasy creation, which means you&amp;#39;ll never get to see that what I just said is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what does all this really mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means, it&amp;#39;s actually something else you&amp;#39;re trying to get control of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the thing with power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;first ring of power&amp;quot; perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure, but close enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of all possibilities at a given position of the assemblage point, including ones barely visible, it&amp;#39;s the thing that adds &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot; to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like a little flashlight, shining in an absolutely dark antique mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re locked in with your buddy, Mr. Second Ring of Power, and you&amp;#39;re trying to amuse yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get into little hypnotic trances, examining things that are similar using just that single beam of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the flashlight finds an antique toy on a shelf, you realize you are in the toy booth, and you move it from toy to toy on that shelf, remembering the past, as triggered by the sight of that toy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The remembering is the fantasy in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internal dialogue gives a critique about &amp;quot;how you feel about it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what we want is for your buddy to grab that light out of your sticky hand, and find the exit door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s smelly in that antique mall!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One puzzling thing about those 2 guys,  &amp;quot;Mr. First Ring&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Mr. Second Ring&amp;quot; is that when Mr. Second Ring asks Mr. First Ring to share the light a little more often,   Mr. First ring often says, &amp;quot;What light?  I don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re talking about!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nfiqjm/basic_advice_needed/gymav0h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1621372772.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_nfiqjm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "And why do you choose sight over tactile sensations while sitting?\nThere are many instances when sensory imputs are overlapping, how do you prioritize?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gyosvw5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ShimmeringMind", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gyodbv1", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_a9s6onuz", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's just a personal preference as I'm a more visual person, but I can use any of sense mainly sound and breath.

No help needed.\n\nForget your preacher, he's clueless. In fact, he doesn't even have a good understanding of his own bible!\n\nThey teach church management at priest school, not biblical understanding.\n\nSo you can't ask the priest to discuss the topic.  He's almost as clueless as the kid who got his first job at McDonald's.\n\nYou have to insist on seeing this for yourself!\n\nOnce you learn to see inorganic beings any time you like, and you learn how they behave, and then when you notice how ALL of the world's religions have demons,  but their pictures and descriptions are different, it becomes obvious.\n\nEspecially when their descriptions of heaven and God also vary!\n\nWhich is even more strange on first look.  If there's an ultimate destination, how come no one agrees on what it is?\n\nCould it be that a random ancient guy learned a little sorcery, maybe by eating the wrong mushrooms,  perceived some inorganic beings, and his own fears and flaws made them look evil?\n\nAnd he passed that discovery down to others?\n\nThen maybe over time a lot of people went down the same path of eating the wrong plants, and the accounts passed down became more and more consistent,  as more people learned about the \"demons\".\n\nMilarepa is a great example. The super famous, bad ass, Tibetan Yogi!\n\nAnd he's completely confused.  The story brags about how he spent so much time meditating out of guilt, that he began to perceive higher levels of reality.\n\nAnd he even got calluses on his butt in one comic book account.  Maybe, if you find it don't look at that page.  A woman drew it.\n\nThen, near to the peak of his super powers the demons took Milarepa to hell and forced him to watch people being tortured.\n\nIt's a good thing he was Tibetan instead of Chinese back then, or they might have taken him to prison camps to watch Uighur women being assaulted.\n\nI'm afraid, that torture in hell thing is all on Milarepa.\n\nHis demons were just some inventory he was unable to drop as he gained in meditation powers.\n\nWhen you're perceiving alternate realities, there isn't enough detail to force everyone to see the same thing.\n\nSo what you perceive is mostly based on what you have inside your mind.\n\nThe inorganic beings noticed the emotional content demons had for Milarepa, so they went along with the gag.\n\nThe Buddha saw 4 dancing women in blue dresses, so you can see how the state of mind of the perceiver can color the perception of \"spirits\".  The Buddha came from royalty, and likely commonly saw dancing girls in dresses.\n\nNow, supposedly Milarepa could fly.\n\nSo I'm not putting the guy down.\n\nEven Cholita can't fly yet. At least, not that I know of...\n\nBut what's the deal with religions anyway?\n\nThe Jews are the most puzzling to me.\n\nThey learned to force themselves silent, so they could perceive some kind of \"divine light\", and then get instructions from God and Heaven.\n\nThat I believe.  I posted  a technique for that almost a year ago, and it's in the wiki.\n\nAnd if you read the details of how the Jews got silent, it's also obvious they were forcing images from their mind too.\n\nAnd, since they sort of tortured themselves while doing it, I have to suspect that Mr. DoubleTake was not very active.\n\nAll in all, they really did gain the ability to see energy, and assemble other worlds.\n\nSo why the deception?\n\nI believe, to understand that you have to go back to the start of their religion.\n\nAt the time, the ancestors of the Chinese, the Akkadians, were running around with people's heads on moon shaped blades at the end of 15 foot poles.\n\nIt was like a calling card when they visited your town.\n\nIt was pretty rough back then.\n\nNo knowledge of germs and disease, agriculture was still new.\n\nThe world needed a little direction.\n\nI believe, the Jews decided to tinker with society.\n\nWould it be so surprising? The Buddhists did the same thing.\n\nThe Buddha was obviously a sorcerer, because we know how to do his highest techniques.  At least, the ones I've seen written down.\n\nBut a whole bunch of tinkering with society got added on by the time we arrived at the official version of Buddhism.\n\nSo the Jews gained magical powers, and then likely encouraged by the people who followed them, they decided to use their fame for the good of all.\n\nThey created a pretty good moral system, and insisted it came directly from God.\n\nAnd it likely did!\n\nI could pull that one off!  If there's something you want badly, for example in my case, for Cholita to wear mini-skirts, you just wait until the next time you make a visit to God, and you ask him for something.\n\nYou're allowed to do that!  Don't ask me why. I never read you could ask for something, until after I saw God, and he reminded me.\n\n\"What did you want to ask?\" he said.\n\nIf I'd known that was coming I might have said, \"Do you suppose it's ok to tell Cholita to wear miniskirts?\"\n\nYou're going to get an enthusiastic yes!\n\nIt's God.  That's what he does.  You'll have to see it for yourself, but the same has been reported by the witches.\n\nAnd Carlos was literally obsessed with viewing God at one point in the books.\n\nThen, understanding the nature of *intent*, which the ancient jews had to have figured out to some extent, they created a religion designed to get the help of *intent*, if you follow the rules and work hard at it.\n\nThat's what *intent* does!\n\nAnd they gave God credit, writing, \"The word of the Lord came to...\"\n\nThey didn't lie.  They just left out some important details.\n\nBut they seem to have known, *intent* helps you along your path if you work to deserve it, follow established procedures, and generally make progress on some mystical path you have selected.\n\nIt's an equal opportunity helper.\n\nThe Akkadians also probably new that, even at the same time as the Jews, because the Chinese had a very complex system for invoking intent (which they called \"luck\"), nearly as early as they are thought to have migrated from Akadia.  Rumor has it, they merged with the Queen of Sheba, friend of Solomon, who certainly possessed this knowledge of *intent*.\n\nSo in my opinion, the Jews created what they believed was a benign system, helpful to society, and which made use of the magic available to humans as best it could.\n\nThe prayer thing was merely stating your intent upfront, to summon the help.\n\nThe sacrifice represented labor you put into it.  You didn't sacrifice the calf to get the blood, he was food you could have eaten which ended up going to a priest somewhere, after a good roasting.\n\nIf you didn't have an animal, you could burn a measure of fine flower.\n\nMore work you put in to get it, and more food going to the priest, to further the *intent* of that system.\n\nWe get the same results, when we work hard in the dark room.  Intent rewards us!\n\nThe entire Jewish system *intended* heaven as a shared phantom realm, built by the collected perceptions of all of the people who believed in it.\n\nJesus is another story.  I believe he realized what was going on and decided to explain it more openly, to free the people from the priests.\n\nWho had gone bad by then.   So they arranged for him to die.\n\nBut perhaps he was teaching people to summon *intent* through the specific rules that the prophets had also used.\n\nBut he got book dealed, so it's kind of hard to figure out exactly what was going on there.\n\nGreed buries magic over time.\n\nI've been told, the Gnostics believed something like that about Jesus.\n\nWhy am I posting this?\n\nCarlos put me up to it.  He was in a constant battle with those religions.\n\nAnd Buddhism too.\n\nSo when it seems fun to counter intent the Jews and Christians, I'll do it.\n\nI was puzzled by a technique I'm drawing up, and needed a diversion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What were the Jewish Prophets up to?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Lineage"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 108, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"9bkjrhht4fs61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 83, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9bkjrhht4fs61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=495d2fc83f64188d70e4daa85d06dc47432fa904"}, {"y": 167, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9bkjrhht4fs61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78442625b942294a2d2239bc1c2556c2390bfc57"}, {"y": 247, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9bkjrhht4fs61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e763a990f62c270c39a79868a4b9a9eca9a77d6"}], "s": {"y": 464, "x": 600, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9bkjrhht4fs61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41f1cd83b3d70aad50bc3583700d46808b680aba"}, "id": "9bkjrhht4fs61"}}, "name": "t3_modoto", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Lineage", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7_7qxeAISdDvvB2au2mo_W7Qz5IF-FAyinOTX4lMkPU.jpg", "edited": 1618093329.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1618090854.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9bkjrhht4fs61.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41f1cd83b3d70aad50bc3583700d46808b680aba\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9bkjrhht4fs61.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41f1cd83b3d70aad50bc3583700d46808b680aba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First,  there are no demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry Jewish people and Christians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There just aren&amp;#39;t any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nor angels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that&amp;#39;s not good  for business, so I don&amp;#39;t expect any of you religious types to listen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can take some comfort in the fact that, there is indeed a  heaven (I&amp;#39;ve seen it multiple times), and there is a God (seen him too).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the deal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe, you&amp;#39;ll all be able to figure that out first hand if you keep working.

Facing intrusion is essential, because if we cannot see how we are deviated, we cannot find our true path in the cosmos.\r  \n\r  \n5, the work with lucid dreaming, astral travel, projection of the double, in Gnostic circles and the Mystery Schools: comparable to many episodes in Castaneda.\r  \n\r  \n6, the Toltec model of great bands of emanations that pervade the universe: comparable to the emanations or streamings from the Pleroma described in Mystery School revelation texts.\r  \n\r  \n7, the Toltec distinction between organic and inorganic beings: comparable to the distinction between humans and Archons in Gnostic cosmology.\r  \n\r  \n8, the Toltec exploration of other worlds and dimensions through the practice of non-ordinary awareness: comparable to age-old shamanic practices of the Mystery Schools.\r  \n\r  \n9, Don Juan\u2019s description of the \u201cluminous egg\u201d: comparable to the oval of clear light in Gnostic revelation texts and the augoeides or \"auric egg\" of the Mysteries.\r  \n\r  \n10, the Toltec figure of the Eagle, a primary metaphor in Castaneda: comparable to the same figure in the Nag Hammadi Codices where the instructing voice of sacred mind, perhaps equivalent to Castaneda\u2019s \u201cvoice of seeing,\u201d states: \u201cI appeared in the form of an Eagle on the Tree of Knowledge, the primal knowing that arises in the pure light, that I might teach them and awaken them out of the depth of sleep\u201d (The Apocryphon of John, 23.25-30).\r  \n\r  \n11, the organization of the sorcerer\u2019s party into eight pairs of male and female sorcerers: comparable to the organization of the Mystery cells into sixteen members, eight of each sex. (Artifactual evidence: Orphic Serpent bowl, and Pietroasa bowl. See A Sheaf of Cut Wheat)\r  \n\r  \n12, the cultivation of the fire from within, Kundalini, or the Plumed Serpent of the Toltecs: comparable to the Winged Serpent and divine Instructor of the Gnostics.\r  \n\r  \n13, the mechanism of the assemblage point.\r  \n\r  \nIt would take an entire book to develop these parallels at length. Three factors out of the ten are of particular importance. These factors are the luminous egg, the great bands of emanations, and the role of certain inorganic beings as allies.\r  \n\r\r  \nThe Assemblage Point\r  \n\r  \nAmong the many strange features in the teachings of don Juan, the matter of the assemblage point is certainly one of the most baffling. In several books we are told that the luminous egg surrounding a human being is attached to the physical body by an odd mechanism called the assemblage point. The location of the point is high behind the right shoulder. Apparently, at that point in the body, the luminous egg exerts a kind of pressure, forming a dimple or depression. As long as the force of the egg stays in the dimple, the assemblage point is stable and the human being perceives reality in a predetermined way. By shifting the assemblage point, sorcerers are able to change their perception of reality, or actually deconstruct and reconstruct reality at will.\r  \n\r  \nDon Juan\u2019s instructions regarding the assemblage point are as baffling as they are fascinating, and far from clear. The dynamics of sliding or shifting the mechanism are difficult to understand, and even harder to visualize. Moreover, it seems that the assemblage point is a weird item, not comparable to anything found in any other sources.\r  \n\r  \nThere is, however, a rare piece of testimony from the Mysteries that describes the assemblage point in exactly the manner found in Castaneda.\r  \n\r  \nIn The Subtle Body in Western Tradition, Gnostic scholar G. R. S. Mead cites the lost writings of Isadorus, the husband of Hypatia and one of the last Gnostics who taught at the Mystery School (the Museum) in Alexandria. Isadorus\u2019 original work is lost, but it was paraphrased by another writer, Damascius, so a few faint indications of his teachings can be surmised. Isadorus is said to have described the augoeides, \u201cgolden aura,\u201d comparable to the luminous egg of Castandea. The nature and operation of the augoiedes, also called the auric egg, was one of the deepest secrets of the Mysteries. Apparently, a lost treatise of Isadorus stated that the augoeides surrounds the human being like an oval membrane, in such a way that the physical body floats in the oval. This is precisely how Castaneda describes the luminous egg. **The Gnostic teacher also said that the luminous oval is connected or locked into the physical body at a point in the back, high up on the right shoulder blade.**\r  \n\r  \n**Thus, one of the weirdest details in Castaneda\u2019s writings is confirmed by a teacher of the Mysteries who lived in Alexandria the 5th century CE.**\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h7ubu1c", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been told, the Gnostics believed something like that about Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the only post that isn&amp;#39;t archived and locked that results from a &amp;quot;Gnostic&amp;quot; search.

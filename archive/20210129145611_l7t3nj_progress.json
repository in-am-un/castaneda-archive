Since I've found this reddit I couldn't stop thinking about it. I was kind of frustrated because I'm currently going through a very rough phase of depression (I read someone else describing the dark night of the soul and I think this captures also my experience). A sort of existential heartbreak if you will. So the moment I started meditating on the processes described here I would get very anxious/overwhelmed. And when I tried forced silence it was like a war with suicidal thoughts etc. This is not a normal mental state for me, so instead of trying the exercises I dedicated myself (again) to recapulation. I literally did everything I could think of to integrate as fast as I could the experiences I accumulated over the past 2 years (which were the most difficult). EMDR, magic mushrooms (which was like an epic hell ride), ayahuasca, meditating, breathwork, writing etc.(\\*I don't use substances anymore but I made an exeption these 2 times to release some emotions) I also tried to at least look around me when I was laying in bed to go to sleep and try to challenge my thoughts about reality and vision (semidarkness).\n\nNow comes the interesting part. Some two months ago I started seeing colours again in broad daylight. At first it was subtle, then layers of colour would come over certain places and objects. Like bright neon blue and violet. It was quit beautiful. Then I would start seeing purple smoke before falling asleep. Again in semidarkness which I find now is also good for slipping into second attention. I would watch these smokes but a couple weeks they only moved and would get a little brighter. Then last week when my existential dread was at a all time high I was so desperate for going deeper into second attention that something clicked. I figured out how to move my assemblage point and I pushed myself beyond the fear of 'seeing' and these are some (fairly simple) experiences so far:\n\nThe bouncing of the purple smokes turned my hands into neon green lights which was pretty amazing and uplifting energy.\n\nOne time I followed a purple smoke and it became beacon of purple light filling the whole room, it felt like it restored my whole belief in magic. I felt my innocence restored, really helped me regain some courage.\n\nA couple of times the purple smokes led me to inorganic beings. I thought it was a IOB because the structure of the cloud was different (stripey like static) and it felt very strongly like they 'wanted' the purple smokes. It felt like a strange exchange and the idea of food came to mind. And then I remembered that Dan (or someone else) posted about feeding smokes to IOBs. LOL I laughed out loud when this clicked. The IOB felt very friendly to me, because I felt it giving me good feelings in return (I even felt one stroking my head one time when I expressed I was feeling very lonely).\n\nOne time I went 'into' a purple cloud and in an instant I saw a very detailed image of a older woman with some kind of facial deformity (it seemed like her face was droopy on one side) which scared the shit out of me. Don't know what that was about.\n\nYesterday and the day before I was so tired but I noticed that I would slip into second attention before falling asleep and that would energize me so that's a new kind of problem lol\n\nI feel like I can 'feel' into second attention now more easily, but the seeing is still difficult. Most times I don't progress beyond purple smoke &gt; catch purple smoke with attention or hands &gt; inside purple smoke structures form but any further only happenes sporadic. I would love to hear feedback or thoughts.\n\nI'm still a little held back to fully engage on this forum and read more posts even though I really want too, it's just that everything shared here makes me over excited and that's due to mostly anxiety/overwhelm. Don't want to give the feeling that I just want to dump my experiences because I do scroll through posts and they help me a lot (so thanks!) If I feel a little bit more secure in myself I will visit the forum more frequently. For now I'm taking babysteps, but it sure feels great to have some progress.. (I'm going to take a day next week to read through all the basic terms and explanations to further my exploration)\n\nThis process has also reopened more buried memories of encounters with IOBS back when I had periods of slightly manic high energy. I really do appreciate the groundedness of this forum because I don't want to return to those ups and downs but master this in a way that it doesn't lead to overly optimistic/flying into space delusional states.

I won't quote it, because it would identify her.\n\nBut when she tried to make her dreaming into sorcery, Carlos really kicked her in the butt.\n\nAnd you're lecturing me on how to use my energy?\n\nUsually that's the sign of someone who wants to be a \"teacher\".

I had to ban him from Facebook.   I suppose he's still lurking around here, trying to figure out how to be both a \"good guy\", and become respected as a teacher of things he can't actually do.\n\n&gt;All I'm talking is a less intimate relationship that the one you have with your IOBs. \n\nI think, like others, you are misreading what don Juan said about IOBs.\n\nAt one point he admits they just scared the hell out of him, and that's the main problem.\n\nThe kidnapping thing is normal.  Rosendo gave his apprentices to them on purpose.

Maybe Juan or Lidotska can take the heat later.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you read the bad players thing?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re always &amp;quot;good guys&amp;quot; until their head explodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had one trying to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; me just a month ago. I had to ban him from Facebook.   I suppose he&amp;#39;s still lurking around here, trying to figure out how to be both a &amp;quot;good guy&amp;quot;, and become respected as a teacher of things he can&amp;#39;t actually do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All I&amp;#39;m talking is a less intimate relationship that the one you have with your IOBs. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think, like others, you are misreading what don Juan said about IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point he admits they just scared the hell out of him, and that&amp;#39;s the main problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kidnapping thing is normal.  Rosendo gave his apprentices to them on purpose.  Carlos spent years doing nothing but playing with little smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should read this quote, it is somehow more convincing when you read it from Carlos&amp;#39; books, than if I just tell you:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/hsf2ns/on_inorganic_beings/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/hsf2ns/on_inorganic_beings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l7t3nj/progress/glm8s4f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1612197677.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_l7t3nj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gljg0le", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_glj0ub8", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l7t3nj/progress/gljg0le/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gljg0le", "created": 1612139250.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1612139250.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "glj0ub8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gliw3j1", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Wow, I'm impressed.\n\nI thought I had 2 angry people to deal with.

Some way to pretend it actually is.\n\nBy disapproving of inorganic beings, they can pretend to be making progress, while doing nothing at all.\n\nTheir favorite excuses are to hate the old sorcerers, who could do actual magic, and forget that don Juan said we have to copy them exactly, until the very end.\n\nAnd to be afraid of inorganic beings, not remembering that we can't get along without them, and that in fact, sorcery was invented by them.\n\nThey teach.\n\nThe first sorcerer made a mistake and ate a power plant.\n\nHe learned to summon an ally.\n\nThe ally taught him.  Hoping to trap him in the long run.\n\nMy opinion: The lineages are all controlled by the inorganic beings.\n\nDo yourself a favor right up front.\n\nVow to die a horrible death at the hands of the inorganic beings. To have your head bitten off by a huge demon, or to be taken prisoner for 5 millions years, in their realm.\n\nAfter that vow, taken sincerely, you won't be afraid of them and they can't do anything to you.\n\nFear is how they control people.\n\nI've had them kidnap me a bunch of times, trying various tricks.\n\nEach time, I got an instant jolt of fright, and then remembered so what?\n\nBetter way to go than the ordinary way.\n\nWhen they scare you, and you say, \"so what\", you just \"wrestled\" them.\n\nSame as in the books.\n\nOnce you wrestle them, that trick won't work for them anymore.  \n\nSo they find another.  Once they run out, they're under your control (until they think up something else).\n\nThey're sort of like bad girlfriends.\n\nMy favorite is when they drop objects you can't resist in their realm, so that you'll reach down and pick it up.\n\nBig mistake if you do that consciously!\n\nSo I never do.\n\nCarlos and Carol were kidnapped by them for a short time.\n\nThey dumped them in a shack, naked, with clothes on the bed in the middle of the room.\n\nCarol Tiggs found, the more she focused on the bed and clothes, the more she forgot where she came from.\n\nIf they had put on the clothes, they would have been trapped.\n\nSo they just stood and waited until they could focus on where they came from, automatically returning there.\n\nNow I ask you, doesn't that sound like a huge bunch of fun!!!????\n\nThe Tensegrity community has rumors that it's dangerous to do Tensegrity barefoot outdoors, because energy beings (worm like IOBs) can crawl into your foot and up into your body.\n\nWhat????\n\nPlease tell me where that can happen!  I volunteer!\n\nBut it makes Tensegrity practitioners feel powerful to warn their friends about the \"dangers\", when in fact they know absolutely nothing about sorcery.\n\nHumans like to do that.\n\nIn China, they sometimes have warning signs over the male urinals, with lists of things you should avoid doing.\n\nNonsense really.\n\nSuch as, don't eat crab meat with persimmon, because the combination is poisonous.\n\nWhen in fact, it's rather tasty and very healthy.\n\nHope I wasn't too hard on the new guy here.\n\nDid you read the wiki button, \"Are you a Bad player...\"\n\nIt's on the side.\n\nI'm hoping it prevents head explosions when someone gets contradicted too much.\n\n&gt;As a side question, anyone ever been hurt by an IOB in 'real' life/tonal? Can they cause 'accidents' or 'bad luck'?\n\nthey can pus with a coupdl of ounces of force. And they're so intelligent, they can figure out how to make an entire tree toppler over on you, with just that much force.\n\nI've seen \"Fairy\" move objects 11 or 12 times.  One a little dim sum plate right in front of me. She moved it 3 times in a row to make sure I could see it was no accident.\n\nAnd Fancy once poked the side of a very old grocry store plastic bag, filled with metal parts.  It burst open, and made a loud crashing sound in my warehouse. I posted a pic of the situation in here somewhere.\n\nBut hurt anyone???\n\nHere's my rule of thumb about stuff like that.\n\nIf anythiung newsworth were common, we'd all know about it.\n\nSo, there's no super effective baldness cure, despite snake oil products out there.\n\nWe all know there's only one or two, and they're pathetic in their effect.\n\nIf a new one came along, it would be on the news every day or two, just to fill space.\n\nSame with supernatural beings hurting people or kidnapping them.\n\nPeople just don't turn up missing without some eventual explanation.\n\nOr if there's a few, it's not enough to be caused by the IOBs, who are as plentiful as we are.\n\nPeople like to flatter themselves by pretending they face huge dangers.\n\nI was experimenting in the \"realwitchcraft\" forum because I got emailed a question from there, which I could certainly answer.\n\nAnd I knew no one in there could.\n\nThe person asking got a warning from someone about what they wanted being dangerous.\n\nIt was the only response.\n\nI posted a big explanation of how to do exactly what they wanted.\n\nAnd the mod instantly deleted it.\n\nSame in the demons subreddit. They believe demons are dangerous over there.\n\nI taught them to make friends with demons.\n\nThe mod got rid of it.\n\nMade her look bad I suppose.\n\nFake.

Hoping to trap him in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My opinion: The lineages are all controlled by the inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favor right up front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vow to die a horrible death at the hands of the inorganic beings. To have your head bitten off by a huge demon, or to be taken prisoner for 5 millions years, in their realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that vow, taken sincerely, you won&amp;#39;t be afraid of them and they can&amp;#39;t do anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear is how they control people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had them kidnap me a bunch of times, trying various tricks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each time, I got an instant jolt of fright, and then remembered so what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Better way to go than the ordinary way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they scare you, and you say, &amp;quot;so what&amp;quot;, you just &amp;quot;wrestled&amp;quot; them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you wrestle them, that trick won&amp;#39;t work for them anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they find another.  Once they run out, they&amp;#39;re under your control (until they think up something else).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re sort of like bad girlfriends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite is when they drop objects you can&amp;#39;t resist in their realm, so that you&amp;#39;ll reach down and pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big mistake if you do that consciously!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I never do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos and Carol were kidnapped by them for a short time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They dumped them in a shack, naked, with clothes on the bed in the middle of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs found, the more she focused on the bed and clothes, the more she forgot where she came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they had put on the clothes, they would have been trapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they just stood and waited until they could focus on where they came from, automatically returning there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I ask you, doesn&amp;#39;t that sound like a huge bunch of fun!!!????&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity community has rumors that it&amp;#39;s dangerous to do Tensegrity barefoot outdoors, because energy beings (worm like IOBs) can crawl into your foot and up into your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What????&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please tell me where that can happen!  I volunteer!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it makes Tensegrity practitioners feel powerful to warn their friends about the &amp;quot;dangers&amp;quot;, when in fact they know absolutely nothing about sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans like to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In China, they sometimes have warning signs over the male urinals, with lists of things you should avoid doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nonsense really.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, don&amp;#39;t eat crab meat with persimmon, because the combination is poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact, it&amp;#39;s rather tasty and very healthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope I wasn&amp;#39;t too hard on the new guy here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you read the wiki button, &amp;quot;Are you a Bad player...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s on the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping it prevents head explosions when someone gets contradicted too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a side question, anyone ever been hurt by an IOB in &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; life/tonal? Can they cause &amp;#39;accidents&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;bad luck&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;they can pus with a coupdl of ounces of force. And they&amp;#39;re so intelligent, they can figure out how to make an entire tree toppler over on you, with just that much force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; move objects 11 or 12 times.  One a little dim sum plate right in front of me. She moved it 3 times in a row to make sure I could see it was no accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Fancy once poked the side of a very old grocry store plastic bag, filled with metal parts.  It burst open, and made a loud crashing sound in my warehouse. I posted a pic of the situation in here somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hurt anyone???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my rule of thumb about stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anythiung newsworth were common, we&amp;#39;d all know about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, there&amp;#39;s no super effective baldness cure, despite snake oil products out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all know there&amp;#39;s only one or two, and they&amp;#39;re pathetic in their effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a new one came along, it would be on the news every day or two, just to fill space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same with supernatural beings hurting people or kidnapping them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People just don&amp;#39;t turn up missing without some eventual explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if there&amp;#39;s a few, it&amp;#39;s not enough to be caused by the IOBs, who are as plentiful as we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People like to flatter themselves by pretending they face huge dangers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was experimenting in the &amp;quot;realwitchcraft&amp;quot; forum because I got emailed a question from there, which I could certainly answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I knew no one in there could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The person asking got a warning from someone about what they wanted being dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the only response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted a big explanation of how to do exactly what they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the mod instantly deleted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same in the demons subreddit. They believe demons are dangerous over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I taught them to make friends with demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mod got rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Made her look bad I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fake.

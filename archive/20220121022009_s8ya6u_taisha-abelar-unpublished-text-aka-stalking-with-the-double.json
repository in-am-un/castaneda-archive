Or only sometimes she was in a phantom house?\n\nI was researching the other day and noticed Carlos only saw the real Genaro twice.  Maybe even out of countless times not even recorded in the books?\n\nIt was Genaro's double, which explains the outrageous power Genaro had.\n\nI wonder if that's \"standard teaching method\"?\n\nWhy spend so much hard work to set up a magic demo by Little Smoke,  \"Man of Knowledge\" style with all the pointless rituals, but then waste the rest of the time together?\n\nIt took a  year to make the smoking mixture!  And many hours to grind the silly Lizard paste.\n\nJust \"trick\" the student by having him in  a magical situation from the very second he arrives.  So you could distract him with any old thing.  Just keep him around a double as long as possible.\n\nThe double is \"creepy\".   Even if it doesn't do anything unusual, you're looking right at the Nagual the whole time!  And it lights up the emanations in you, closer to the deep orange zone.\n\nOr some aspect of it.\n\nFrom what I get to see lately, we'll ALL be able to show up in our double, like Genaro did.\n\nWe've lucked out here.  Or Little Smoke planned it.\n\nLast night I was doing that Olmec statue thing where the sorcerer is holding up the double.\n\nThis one.  \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2082648641894245&amp;set=a.1585701564922291\n\nPlease notice, a leg is missing.  Naturally I wasn't thinking of that at all.  I was only remembering you could hold your double up in front of you.\n\nSo instead of doing what you are supposed to do, at the end of that \"affection for the energy body\" pass, I just kept the energy body I'd built in front of me, holding it by the sides near the armpit.\n\nExcept mine was still a \"puff being\" made with the Affection pass.  The Affection pass mixes up the purple puffs in the air, breaks it off with a cutting motion of the arms, and then \"forms\" it into a body with a head, shoulders, torso, hips, legs, and feet.\n\nIt works!\n\nBut I get tired of hugging it into myself.  The results of that are harder to see, visually.\n\nSo I copied the statue.\n\nI could move it around.  And moving it around, caused it to shape shift.\n\nBecause in moving it around, your awareness falls on \"parts\" of it, and you \"recognize\" a little.\n\nThe \"recognize\" causes a reskimming of the emanations.\n\n\"Recognize\" is a power we ought to examine more.  In some ways, it's our greatest magic.\n\nFirst the right leg formed a \"perfect copy\" of a real leg.\n\nIt was black though, which confused me. Is that mine or his?\n\nI had a puff being, with a \"real\" right leg.  Or was I now laying horizontally in the air?\n\nNot as  uncommon as one might think.  I have a technique to search my room for Cholita that requires creating a \"reality layer\" at the level where you might comfortably lay in the middle of the walking space. I caught Cholita hiding there once for sure, and \"almost\" on another 2.\n\nThen I noticed my own right leg was sticking up in the air, like a karate guy in good shape would hold it in a kick pose.  Except the angle didn't go down to my hips, it ended at my stomach.\n\nI couldn't figure out, is that my leg and I'm laying flat 2-3 feet above the ground,  or the double's leg?\n\nI got help from Fancy, lately my favorite entity because she's like the uncle who gives his niece candy, when her parents said \"no candy this time!\"\n\nWe have one of those at work.  a 3 year old Chinese girl who never tasted candy before they left her here at work with her uncle.\n\nFancy saw my puzzlement over who's leg that was, when I even moved it a bit to see if the one in the air moved, or the one touching the floor.\n\nFancy said, \"What's the difference?\"\n\nEarlier she was trying to please me with \"good old days\" costumes.  I was hoping for little red riding hood.\n\nShe tried, but something changes over time.\n\nI think, the available shared emanations which are lit up with awareness, increases greatly.\n\nSo when intent helps you to \"reskim\" reality to include the overlap of your ally in the room, there's too much to pick from.\n\nIt's not like they're \"brand new\", and there's only a tiny \"history\" to select emanations from.\n\nThey're too \"rich\" for intent to make something as simple as Red Riding Hood.\n\nSo it's not like they fade from lack of shared energy.\n\nThey become more complex.\n\nCould be, it's a tiny bit like trying to get your 50 year old wife, to wear the miniskirt she lured you in with, at 20.\n\nIt's just not the same and she's going to make you pay big time for forcing her to do that.\n\nI still like the red riding hood look.\n\nI complained to Fancy, and reminded her there was also a white miniskirt she wore a few days in a row.  Maybe that's easier to come up with.\n\nShe actually smiled warmly.", "edited": 1642788713.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_htmcv9g", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not supposed to read any of these, although I do for researching specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those who read it, in the end, it turned out Taisha was always in a phantom house and Emilito was Zuleica&amp;#39;s double?

Even if it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything unusual, you&amp;#39;re looking right at the Nagual the whole time!  And it lights up the emanations in you, closer to the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or some aspect of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I get to see lately, we&amp;#39;ll ALL be able to show up in our double, like Genaro did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve lucked out here.  Or Little Smoke planned it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I was doing that Olmec statue thing where the sorcerer is holding up the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2082648641894245&amp;amp;set=a.1585701564922291\"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2082648641894245&amp;amp;set=a.1585701564922291&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please notice, a leg is missing.  Naturally I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking of that at all.  I was only remembering you could hold your double up in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead of doing what you are supposed to do, at the end of that &amp;quot;affection for the energy body&amp;quot; pass, I just kept the energy body I&amp;#39;d built in front of me, holding it by the sides near the armpit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except mine was still a &amp;quot;puff being&amp;quot; made with the Affection pass.  The Affection pass mixes up the purple puffs in the air, breaks it off with a cutting motion of the arms, and then &amp;quot;forms&amp;quot; it into a body with a head, shoulders, torso, hips, legs, and feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I get tired of hugging it into myself.  The results of that are harder to see, visually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I copied the statue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could move it around.  And moving it around, caused it to shape shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in moving it around, your awareness falls on &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot; of it, and you &amp;quot;recognize&amp;quot; a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;recognize&amp;quot; causes a reskimming of the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Recognize&amp;quot; is a power we ought to examine more.  In some ways, it&amp;#39;s our greatest magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First the right leg formed a &amp;quot;perfect copy&amp;quot; of a real leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was black though, which confused me. Is that mine or his?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a puff being, with a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; right leg.  Or was I now laying horizontally in the air?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not as  uncommon as one might think.  I have a technique to search my room for Cholita that requires creating a &amp;quot;reality layer&amp;quot; at the level where you might comfortably lay in the middle of the walking space. I caught Cholita hiding there once for sure, and &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; on another 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed my own right leg was sticking up in the air, like a karate guy in good shape would hold it in a kick pose.  Except the angle didn&amp;#39;t go down to my hips, it ended at my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out, is that my leg and I&amp;#39;m laying flat 2-3 feet above the ground,  or the double&amp;#39;s leg?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got help from Fancy, lately my favorite entity because she&amp;#39;s like the uncle who gives his niece candy, when her parents said &amp;quot;no candy this time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have one of those at work.  a 3 year old Chinese girl who never tasted candy before they left her here at work with her uncle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy saw my puzzlement over who&amp;#39;s leg that was, when I even moved it a bit to see if the one in the air moved, or the one touching the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy said, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the difference?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier she was trying to please me with &amp;quot;good old days&amp;quot; costumes.  I was hoping for little red riding hood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tried, but something changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think, the available shared emanations which are lit up with awareness, increases greatly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when intent helps you to &amp;quot;reskim&amp;quot; reality to include the overlap of your ally in the room, there&amp;#39;s too much to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;brand new&amp;quot;, and there&amp;#39;s only a tiny &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; to select emanations from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re too &amp;quot;rich&amp;quot; for intent to make something as simple as Red Riding Hood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not like they fade from lack of shared energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They become more complex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be, it&amp;#39;s a tiny bit like trying to get your 50 year old wife, to wear the miniskirt she lured you in with, at 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just not the same and she&amp;#39;s going to make you pay big time for forcing her to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still like the red riding hood look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I complained to Fancy, and reminded her there was also a white miniskirt she wore a few days in a row.  Maybe that&amp;#39;s easier to come up with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She actually smiled warmly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null,

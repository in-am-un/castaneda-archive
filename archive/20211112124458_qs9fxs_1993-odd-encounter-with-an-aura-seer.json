(I hesitate to post this.  Seems a bit TOO inflating to the ol' self-importance.  Maybe I should just, heh, remain Silent?   Well, here goes...)\n\nBack in 1993 I spent many weeks in a very odd mental state: living temporarily as a cold, ruthless, \"truthteller,\" carefully observing a stream of emotionally-negative major events that the colleagues in our little startup-company simply could not stand to look at, or accept. \n\nOur company was imploding at the time, and I was working to save it.  Two of our seven company founders turned out to be manipulative, dishonest, even borderline \"evil.\"  I was also weeks into near-sleeplessness practice, from a big push to finish a major project.  It was \"Polyphasic sleep,\" years before the internet invented it.  Wife thought I was insane!  No, just intentionally hypo-manic, almost dreaming while wide awake and functioning.  Living at nearly twice the mental-speed of the rest of humanity, and sleeping in catnaps.  For several weeks!  I'd learned the trick when I was twelve, triggered by reading CC books, but it's not described explicitly in the books.\n\nMan, the synchronicities!  An entire \"storm of synchronicities\" turn on!  All sorts of bizarre events.  (They say that everything happens for a purpose  ...but now *everything* happened for a purpose.)  I found that I'd better not discuss these events, since all the others in my little company were acting intentionally blind to all problems, and reacted with rage if I pointed even small things out.  \n\nIt was so very strange, the probability-storm, the huge glut of synchronicities.  And my colleagues' response was an intentional, somewhat-desperate blindness.  I thought they were all insane.  THEY were certain that they were perfectly normal, and *I* was crazy.\n\nIn Seattle at that time, the newspaper \"The Stranger\" had just appeared, and there was a young psychic-healer advertising services.  Suddenly I was \"supposed\" to go to them.  A very strong urge, almost like a command.  I did so (I almost always follow these sudden intuitions.)\n\nThe \"psychic\" described my undiagnosed health problem which they'd never encountered before (That was 1993.  Today it's everywhere, called type-2 Diabetes.)\n\nAlso, they said there was something very weird about my \"aura,\" another thing they'd never seen before.  I had strange glowing \"spiderwebby\" stuff coming from the edge of my feet and extending up to my knees, like thin glowing socks!  WTF!  The person tried to remove it via hands-on healing.  I don't know if this worked.\n\nAnyway, our little company crashed and burned (caused by the focused intent of the group: entirely greed- and ego-driven.)  Giant advancing glacier-cliffs of Self-Importance.  Nothing to be done about it, and needing to support a wife and kid, I ended up having to flee. Also, in order to find a boring day-job I soon had to abandon my fast-burn mental state.  Become a normal human again.  \"Going normal\" still took me weeks to accomplish back then.\n\n---\n\nSo, a question  ...would the \"coat of awareness\" be described as a thin layer of spiderwebby material?!  The books aren't so clear on this.  But that's how this \"psychic\" described what he was seeing, surrounding my feet and lower legs.\n\nIt seemed to have been created by several weeks of being in \"accelerated living,\" sleeping only a couple hours per day, spread out in catnaps, while constantly examining all sorts of horrible personal stuff that most normal humans can barely stand to glance at, even briefly.\n\n- \" If the predators don't eat our glowing coat of awareness for a while, it will keep on growing.\"\n\nBut obviously I could be fooling myself\n\nMaybe it was something different, something caused by type-II diabetes, and not a CC thing caused by remaining for weeks in that non-Western \"pitiless\" mental state, greatly \"accelerated\" living, with the brutal-honesty stance which is said to repel flyers.\n\nPS\n\nDon't know if it's the cause, but I read and believed all the CC books when I was twelve.  I think there were only four published at the time.  Daily striving (unsuccessfully) for mental silence!  Always walking to 8th grade school in \"racewalk,\" while holding my hands in odd positions!  (And some years later, NEVER take your hat off when outdoors!)  I found that some mild altered states could be achieved, slight warped reality, no drugs needed.  I was a weird little kid.\n\n---\n\nPPS\n\nSeattle may have a \"power spot.\"\n\nI don't *See,* and otherwise barely sense that sort of locational-energy.  But a certain Seattle location has attracted all kinds of oddities.  It's where a massive underwater power-line comes up from the lake water and turns into overhead transmission lines.  It's where the I-90 highway makes landfall, with a giant black slab of concrete arcing across half the sky, contributing a constant roaring sound, so reality there is slightly \"broken.\"  Even on Google Maps the reality there is fractured: it has a long pier, and you can walk out on it via streetview.  You can actually find the Google Streetview car there (but it becomes invisible unless you stand in certain spots.)  So bizarre and cool  ...bizarre like the subtle weirdfeel of the physical place.  And as you wander those sidewalks in Streetview, the time-of-year jumps around crazily, with sunny days suddenly flashing into dark overcast (or if you turn around backwards, the cloudy month is in one direction, but all sunny in another.  Stepping from futureworld to pastworld.)  None of these things is so weird on its own ...but all of them are gathered together in one spot on Google Maps, and also in that one spot in the \"real\" world.  Most Seattle locations are pretty dead, but this place ...it's like becoming a character in some movie.  The whole collection together, both real-world and online, I'd label \"mild probability-excursion,\" it's yet another of those dense clusters of inexplicable synchronicites.   Here's the map location below, with views of the bicycle-trailer and Google Streetview car (and powerline diving into the lake.)\n\nActually I found this location while having great fun driving on I-90 during odd mental practice: getting \"out of the way\" and letting my body do the driving.  My steering arms take me to interesting places.  Suddenly I'm \"supposed\" to take this exit?  Okaaay...  Now turn left!  Now drive around in neighborhoods, making several \"random\" turns.  I arrive at  ...Entai Beach Park and kayak-rental.  But why?\n\nOnly later it became clear.  I was intending some personal entertainment, and man, Spirit sure coughed it up!  (But ...is this place an actual Power Spot where the world's muggle-normalcy is quite thin?  Or is it just some locational random weirdness, not important, but where \"History\" had randomly flipped a coin ten times, and got the Green Pill every time?)\n\nTry walking around in these abnormal Goog-maps worlds.  Many unique sights to see.  You can closely inspect the Streetview car, and the trailer for the Streetview Bicycle (which is used to create Streetview paths on park sidewalks.)   Seattle people can check it out in the real world.  Powerlines that dive into the water.  The constant technological roar, while you're relaxing in a beautiful nature-spot.  Rental desk, so you can explore the whole lake if desired.\n\n- [Entai Beach Park,  (Seattle/Bellevue)](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.5793268,-122.1965488,3a,75y,180h,91.49t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1scNSDoj5lgL6S19blZ7Hoow!2e0!3e5!7i13312!8i6656)\n- [Google streetview car, another view, wo/staffmember](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.579243,-122.1965718,3a,75y,101.33h,91.49t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sP3mKna56bhiYIfWsQlfECA!2e0!3e5!7i13312!8i6656)\n- [Under the roaring concrete traffic-river](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.579733,-122.1968445,3a,30y,247.67h,93.38t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbSEpoKc22j1r0mgBYT93Xw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)\n- [Warning: underwater powerline](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.5789869,-122.1967208,3a,75y,90h,91.49t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skHBgbnwSAyAcACtYzxQPEQ!2e0!3e5!7i13312!8i6656)\n- [Sunnyworld version, suddenly with swingsets](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.5792241,-122.1965427,3a,75y,270h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sNFRBhfg0D-6lRFPcmzgvLg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)\n- [You can even walk down those stairs!](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.5789834,-122.1969132,3a,75y,270h,91.49t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sQM1NCTvdqjSkdeVqkNYj6w!2e0!3e5!7i13312!8i6656)\n- [There's a \"3D Photosphere\" there, from a stormy day](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.5788187,-122.1974821,3a,75y,203.09h,56.1t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipON13zrV5EVUftTJb1b3j3_kwY70O7dp_mdAFyd!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipON13zrV5EVUftTJb1b3j3_kwY70O7dp_mdAFyd%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya145.13351-ro-0-fo100!7i6912!8i3456!5m1!1e1)\n- [Goog Maps view, w/sidewalk paths](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.578865,-122.1967033,3a,75y,350.74h,90t/data=!3m10!1e1!3m8!1s-AtuY-QTRobN3O31Gwq26A!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3D-AtuY-QTRobN3O31Gwq26A%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D353.72443%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i33!5m1!1e1)   \n\n.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "1993, odd encounter with an aura-seer", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_qs9fxs", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_skkp", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1649066409.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1636717498.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A personal story, and a question.

Feels like cobwebs that don't stick (much).\n\nWhy don't you learn to see it yourself?\n\nIf that energy rises up above the ankles, you can learn to view the color of your energy.  But it won't be clear because of all the \"fuzzy stuff\" down there, which includes what your psychic saw.  And then later, your energy body.  It gets crowded down there!\n\nWhen the energy rises to the knees, you can finally clearly see the color.  It covers over the fuzziness at the feet.\n\nIt looks like there's a pool of heavy gas, like dry ice vapor that's not bubbling so much that it blows away, which has settled down to a calm layer.\n\nYou can pat it with your hand and cause ripples, like it was weird water.\n\nMine is between chartreuse and yellow.\n\nYour energy rises up in response to internal silence, so if you want to see that, you have to learn to shut off your internal dialogue. And all day too.

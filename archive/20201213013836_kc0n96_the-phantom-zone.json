I have to get home soon.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI suppose that to those who have not learned to see energy, and have never seen their dreaming double come out, this looks like more of the same darkroom gazing thing. While it's true this is done in a darkroom, your eyes are fully open, you are wide awake, you are completely sober, and yet you see amazing things floating all around you, this is quite a bit different than my last posts.\n\nI've been attempting to gain entry into Cholita's phantom copy of our home. It was created when Cholita introduced me to Minx, perhaps 6-8 months ago. All three of us together in the same place, one in a physical body, one in a dreaming body, and one an inorganic being, fractured the house and split off a copy. Being a witch, Cholita hangs out over there, making constant improvements. Minx likes it there too, pretending to be Cholita's little boy, or grown lover. A time or two, he took the form of a begging squirrel when he encountered me.\n\nMy strategy to gain entry was taught to me by Fancy, my inorganic being. It consists of moving the assemblage point all the way down the back, until the dreaming double begins to come out. You should be able to look down, in your pitch black room, and see your entire body. You should also be able to see a bunch of lines and fibers waving around the middle. I'm afraid it would take days to capture it accurately, with a drawing program. But that's close.\n\nOnce you can see that, you can catch dreams in the room. You search for a disturbance in the dreaming fog, which at that assemblage point position will be obvious. Thick even. Using a particular \"gaze\", you can make it bloom into whatever it will be.\n\nThe dreaming double is irrational, and doesn't care if things ought to be, or really are. If they are, that's all that matters. It can enter those, by focusing the attention on an object of high interest. The dreaming double will swoop right out of your physical body, and you'll be in that dream.\n\nDo this repeatedly, and rapidly, and you might even find a real \"place\" with a real sorcerer waiting for you. But this night, all I wanted was entry to the side of our home, to the right of this image. I could sense that Cholita was over there, along with other spirits.\n\nBut I didn't count on the effects of Zuleica's daytime gazing, which is explained in Taisha's latest book. Instead of glossing inside your imagination all day, you go for a walk and intensely focus your awareness on everything you see around you. You are searching for \"power\". That could be anything. As you focus your awareness on even the tiniest of details, you \"externalize\" your silence. So that the objects maintain it for you. The world becomes \"Empty\" of anything other than potential power.\n\nDoing that is largely a trick on Zuleica's part, but I'll allow you to discover the deception. Much of the instructions we're given by sorcerers, actually do something other than what you are told.\n\nIn this case, I had retrained my expectations about the world, and it spilled over into the dark room. Instead of materializing a single dream at a time, so I could practice entry and exit on each, the room became filled with dreams. None would go away. They floated around like the puffs of color, on which we practice our Tensegrity energy redeployment.\n\nI tried to find a key thing to focus on in each one, but the large number of them was distracting. Cholita showed up on the right, behind the wall. I tried to see through it, but could not find her clearly. Minx walked in to see what was happening. A burst or cloud of dark energy covered the sight of both Cholita, and Minx.\n\nI lost consciousness and found myself in the kitchen, on the floor, with Cholita on top of me.\n\nI'd made it across the barrier.\n\nMy first thought on finding myself in that position was to ask Cholita, \"Can we do this often, please?\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\ncontinued...", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Phantom Zone", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"jvj6m5euuu461": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jvj6m5euuu461.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17572aec13ae734dfc9d11f98ddb3f333acd28ba"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jvj6m5euuu461.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbc1008d844f330e5ee0d35c9cb590aa93e82e64"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jvj6m5euuu461.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eb5ce3d93da0daf4133d26693ed56dae260a95a"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jvj6m5euuu461.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f60704e100477dfd2d229c4cb7cc573a3160938"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jvj6m5euuu461.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cedae1ad5098f3f1b1cb7175c7130d5d54a5daa"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jvj6m5euuu461.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8192517e5a0700bcd6eb089264890a127cc59826"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jvj6m5euuu461.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee72d4796ad3b8adedec147c3452b491127c913"}, "id": "jvj6m5euuu461"}}, "name": "t3_kc0n96", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/swDq6uXEP4KHDB4oAoMfDql0bdtOmd35AK_swg4YrdI.jpg", "edited": 1607878285.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1607819916.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jvj6m5euuu461.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bee72d4796ad3b8adedec147c3452b491127c913\"&gt;A place to gain entry to dreams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent too much time in Cholita&amp;#39;s phantom copy of the house last night, so I&amp;#39;ll have to just copy the Facebook Text.

Took another night trying to duplicate it, to recall more.\n\nExcept that Cholita took off a couple of hours after this happened.  In her car.  Hasn't returned.  It was quite odd.  Normally she hides out all morning, outside our home somewhere.  For the first time in months she came in while I was taking a shower,  made enough noise so I'd be sure to hear, got some things and left.\n\nStill didn't get a glimpse of her.  Haven't in a month.  Except in her dreaming double.\n\nWhat I hadn't recalled from that night was, just before Minx showed up,  while I was watching the results of Zuleica's daytime gazing technique, I got the strange idea to scoop the dreams onto my stomach.\n\nI've never tried that.  Scooping puffs is one thing. And it's wonderful when they stay there.\n\nYou can build up quite a glow on your torso, and by doing that you are \"pulling the colors in closer\", the way Zuleica said we need to do.\n\nCarlos called it, \"redeploying energy\", and that's mostly what the Tensegrity is designed for.\n\nSo while I was looking at the dreams, which had replaced the puffs of light, I found one on a perfectly formed puff.   Most were drifting free-form.\n\nAnd it was just too tempting.\n\nFor the life of me, I can't remember now what that dream was.   In fact, I saw scores of dreams drifting around, and frantically reminded myself what each one was, speaking out loud, so I might remember for use making pictures the next day.  Could have gotten out my cellphone to take notes, but I was afraid of the light.\n\nNow, all of those dreams are lost.  The only pic you see in that illustration, which is similar to the dreams I saw, was the flying witch.\n\nThe rest are \"sort of\" what I saw.\n\nThat position of the assemblage point is very far, so remembering is an issue.\n\nFancy was also clearly visible on a puff, staring at my stomach.   That part of the illustration is accurate.\n\nBut I've scooped her into that area often, seeing if I can give her more energy.\n\nThat was a full dream, not a single being.  I scooped it into my hand, looked to see it was still running, and got the crazy idea to do what tensegrity moves do.\n\nPut it on the left side of my stomach.  Carlos used to say, \"liver\", or \"kidney\", but I can never remember which side is which.\n\nI also got the feeling that was a risky thing to do.  But no one had said so.\n\nI can't even imagine what Carlos would have said, if I asked him about scooping dreams onto your torso!\n\nWhen I placed it there, instead of sitting on the surface like a puff of purple color, it sank in.  I could see it inside, below some fibers.   It was like inserting a computer program into a robot made out of light.  You could see the program sink in.\n\nThe fibers of my luminous body became very visible.  Not vaguely, but in fine detail.\n\nI'm not sure why, but I didn't keep that up.  And at some point, after seeing Minx, I simply stepped out of my body and through the door, and found Cholita near the bathroom.\n\nI believe, Minx led my dreaming double out, on purpose.  Cholita likely sent him to fetch me.\n\nThe perception of dark energy engulfing me and making me go unconscious, is possibly what only my physical body was perceiving.    So I recalled that part, but not actually walking out through the bedroom wall.\n\nPerhaps the experiences of the dreaming double were not visible to my physical body at that point.  Everyone's dreaming double is walking around somewhere out there, in infinity.\n\nCarlos explained that.\n\nThe unusual thing is when it comes near your physical body. That's when it can become useful.\n\nSometimes when I enter the \"other side of the house\", both my physical mind, and my dreaming double mind, are visible to me. It's as if the physical body were remote viewing it.\n\nOr it just goes away, and walks right in with the energy body.  Absorbed.\n\nFancy would interject, there is no physical body.  But if she can explain away physical matter to me, I'll believe her claims more.\n\nShe's a bit self-serving.  I cut back on her pass those 2 days, to reduce her influence.\n\nLast night she took it personally, and kept showing up as a little head, pleading that it was time to practice her pass.\n\nShe was a bit like the woman you fall in love with, and go to endless lengths to please her, so she'll hang out with you for a few minutes.\n\nOnce you give up they start to hang out on their own, without all the trouble.\n\nI have no clear idea of what happened from walking out in my dreaming double,  until I found Cholita on top of me.\n\nI get the impression there was a struggle, but as with all struggles with Cholita, she's smiling while she's digging her finger nails into your flesh.  She enjoys it.  Like a Junior High School girl punching the boys in the arm.\n\nFrom when I can recall clearly, Minx was standing near us, in human form, by the fridge.\n\nHe was tapping his foot, like he'd been waiting and it was taking too long.  He had shiny black shoes and white socks.\n\nBottom line:  you can scoop dreams onto your stomach!\n\nThat's what I repeated last night.  Just so I could tell you guys, yep. That's a useful technique.\n\nIf nothing else, it requires very refined gazing.\n\nI found a woman walking along high up to my right, put my hand behind her, lowered her slowly, and watched to make sure the dream kept going. It started to fizzle out for an instant, but I spoke to it, and stopped my hand movement.  Speaking kindly to it seemed to help, but probably just because it engaged my own attention.\n\nYou can't tell if talking to things changes them, or you.  It just works or it doesn't, and you don't get to know the details.\n\nOnce that dream was vivid in my hand again, I very slowly put it on my left stomach.\n\nIt faded out, but I spoke to it again, and it became brighter.\n\nAnd again, I have no memory of what happened next, except for a flurry of thumbs ups I made, trying to mark it so I could recall it.\n\nHere's a weird theory:\n\nWe'll all have to repeat many of the events from the books.  That's because, the books describe sorcery, and sorcery is the mastery of intent.\n\nSo the stories contain pieces of the very same intent trail we are following.\n\nWhich means, some of the smaller details of the events are also part of the intent.\n\nLet's say an old sorcerer invented an amazing technique, but he had a problem with flatulence.\n\nToo much cocoa and Chiles drink maybe.  Possibly he sweetened it up with some wild yams.\n\nSo while doing his magic, he often farted.\n\nI'm proposing, if we find his magic, we'll also fart.\n\nLikewise, we'll have to go through the \"task of remembering\" La Gordo mentioned.\n\nIt's amusing, because Carlos was attacked over and over for that.  A typical conversation goes like this:\n\n\"Oh great, now he's starting over entirely, claiming a separate series of events took place, but he forgot it all.  What a money grubber Carlos is, to come up with an implausible excuse like that, to write more books.    Amnesia?  Are you kidding?\"\n\nBut in fact, we'll all have to go through that to some extent.\n\nIt is in fact, very difficult to remember things that happen when the assemblage point moves so far.\n\nHere's a key point that's not obvious.\n\nMove the assemblage point until you can see little dreams in the dreaming fog.\n\nI suppose it would also be when  you can see videos on the walls, but I haven't proven that.\n\nIt's a very specific location, and you can just \"feel\" when it's possible because you look out at the dreaming fog, and feel some \\*\\*intensity\\* to any variation in smoothness.\n\nIf anyone wants to feel that, get out an image modifying program, which can find differences between 2 subsequent images.  Run it at highest setting, so you only get white lines, where a clear edge moved.\n\nThe image changes to white outlines of all the moving edges in the picture, but the colors go away. It's all black, except for the white edges.\n\n[https://www.sicara.ai/blog/2019-03-12-edge-detection-in-opencv](https://www.sicara.ai/blog/2019-03-12-edge-detection-in-opencv)\n\nThat's sort of what it feels like, looking out at the dreaming fog, when the assemblage point has moved far enough to intercept dreams.\n\nHere's the key point:  You can use the dreaming double's eyes at that point!\n\nBut if you keep using them, it steps out a tiny bit. \n\nEven further with time.\n\nSo if you want to switch bodies, that's a good place to experiment.\n\nYou possibly need more \"power\" to pull off what I've been doing the last 2 days.\n\nI've been using Zuleica's \"searching for power\" technique quite a bit during the day.\n\nLidotska was wondering what power is.\n\nIt's not the same as energy.\n\nI'd say, it's anything that moves the assemblage point into a location more favorable, for doing magic.\n\nCould be a warm breeze circling around you, and the right moment.\n\nCould be a butterfly which sees you gazing at the sun, from far away, and comes over to circle around your head.\n\nCould be the dreary dead leaves and trash, strewn along the path you are walking, with a single smooth pink river stone, shining in an opening in the leaves.\n\nWith Zuleica's daytime technique, you retrain your relationship to the world. Instead of going inwards to fuss about things, you focus your attention all the time, looking for things that make you feel good.\n\nLike a child.  They don't walk along like a tired zombie. They run around, looking at every tiny detail, hoping to find something cool.", "edited": 1607882122.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gfpvuml", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t recall much of what happened that night.

The only pic you see in that illustration, which is similar to the dreams I saw, was the flying witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest are &amp;quot;sort of&amp;quot; what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That position of the assemblage point is very far, so remembering is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy was also clearly visible on a puff, staring at my stomach.   That part of the illustration is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve scooped her into that area often, seeing if I can give her more energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was a full dream, not a single being.  I scooped it into my hand, looked to see it was still running, and got the crazy idea to do what tensegrity moves do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put it on the left side of my stomach.  Carlos used to say, &amp;quot;liver&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;kidney&amp;quot;, but I can never remember which side is which.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also got the feeling that was a risky thing to do.  But no one had said so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what Carlos would have said, if I asked him about scooping dreams onto your torso!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I placed it there, instead of sitting on the surface like a puff of purple color, it sank in.  I could see it inside, below some fibers.   It was like inserting a computer program into a robot made out of light.  You could see the program sink in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fibers of my luminous body became very visible.  Not vaguely, but in fine detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why, but I didn&amp;#39;t keep that up.  And at some point, after seeing Minx, I simply stepped out of my body and through the door, and found Cholita near the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe, Minx led my dreaming double out, on purpose.  Cholita likely sent him to fetch me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The perception of dark energy engulfing me and making me go unconscious, is possibly what only my physical body was perceiving.    So I recalled that part, but not actually walking out through the bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the experiences of the dreaming double were not visible to my physical body at that point.  Everyone&amp;#39;s dreaming double is walking around somewhere out there, in infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos explained that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The unusual thing is when it comes near your physical body. That&amp;#39;s when it can become useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I enter the &amp;quot;other side of the house&amp;quot;, both my physical mind, and my dreaming double mind, are visible to me. It&amp;#39;s as if the physical body were remote viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it just goes away, and walks right in with the energy body.  Absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy would interject, there is no physical body.  But if she can explain away physical matter to me, I&amp;#39;ll believe her claims more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s a bit self-serving.  I cut back on her pass those 2 days, to reduce her influence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night she took it personally, and kept showing up as a little head, pleading that it was time to practice her pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was a bit like the woman you fall in love with, and go to endless lengths to please her, so she&amp;#39;ll hang out with you for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you give up they start to hang out on their own, without all the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no clear idea of what happened from walking out in my dreaming double,  until I found Cholita on top of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get the impression there was a struggle, but as with all struggles with Cholita, she&amp;#39;s smiling while she&amp;#39;s digging her finger nails into your flesh.  She enjoys it.  Like a Junior High School girl punching the boys in the arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From when I can recall clearly, Minx was standing near us, in human form, by the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was tapping his foot, like he&amp;#39;d been waiting and it was taking too long.  He had shiny black shoes and white socks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line:  you can scoop dreams onto your stomach!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what I repeated last night.  Just so I could tell you guys, yep. That&amp;#39;s a useful technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, it requires very refined gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a woman walking along high up to my right, put my hand behind her, lowered her slowly, and watched to make sure the dream kept going. It started to fizzle out for an instant, but I spoke to it, and stopped my hand movement.  Speaking kindly to it seemed to help, but probably just because it engaged my own attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t tell if talking to things changes them, or you.  It just works or it doesn&amp;#39;t, and you don&amp;#39;t get to know the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once that dream was vivid in my hand again, I very slowly put it on my left stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It faded out, but I spoke to it again, and it became brighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again, I have no memory of what happened next, except for a flurry of thumbs ups I made, trying to mark it so I could recall it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a weird theory:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll all have to repeat many of the events from the books.  That&amp;#39;s because, the books describe sorcery, and sorcery is the mastery of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the stories contain pieces of the very same intent trail we are following.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, some of the smaller details of the events are also part of the intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say an old sorcerer invented an amazing technique, but he had a problem with flatulence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too much cocoa and Chiles drink maybe.  Possibly he sweetened it up with some wild yams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while doing his magic, he often farted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m proposing, if we find his magic, we&amp;#39;ll also fart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we&amp;#39;ll have to go through the &amp;quot;task of remembering&amp;quot; La Gordo mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amusing, because Carlos was attacked over and over for that.  A typical conversation goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh great, now he&amp;#39;s starting over entirely, claiming a separate series of events took place, but he forgot it all.  What a money grubber Carlos is, to come up with an implausible excuse like that, to write more books.    Amnesia?  Are you kidding?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, we&amp;#39;ll all have to go through that to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is in fact, very difficult to remember things that happen when the assemblage point moves so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a key point that&amp;#39;s not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Move the assemblage point until you can see little dreams in the dreaming fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it would also be when  you can see videos on the walls, but I haven&amp;#39;t proven that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very specific location, and you can just &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; when it&amp;#39;s possible because you look out at the dreaming fog, and feel some **intensity* to any variation in smoothness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to feel that, get out an image modifying program, which can find differences between 2 subsequent images.  Run it at highest setting, so you only get white lines, where a clear edge moved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The image changes to white outlines of all the moving edges in the picture, but the colors go away. It&amp;#39;s all black, except for the white edges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sicara.ai/blog/2019-03-12-edge-detection-in-opencv\"&gt;https://www.sicara.ai/blog/2019-03-12-edge-detection-in-opencv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s sort of what it feels like, looking out at the dreaming fog, when the assemblage point has moved far enough to intercept dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the key point:  You can use the dreaming double&amp;#39;s eyes at that point!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you keep using them, it steps out a tiny bit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even further with time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to switch bodies, that&amp;#39;s a good place to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You possibly need more &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; to pull off what I&amp;#39;ve been doing the last 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using Zuleica&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;searching for power&amp;quot; technique quite a bit during the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lidotska was wondering what power is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the same as energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say, it&amp;#39;s anything that moves the assemblage point into a location more favorable, for doing magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be a warm breeze circling around you, and the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be a butterfly which sees you gazing at the sun, from far away, and comes over to circle around your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be the dreary dead leaves and trash, strewn along the path you are walking, with a single smooth pink river stone, shining in an opening in the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Zuleica&amp;#39;s daytime technique, you retrain your relationship to the world. Instead of going inwards to fuss about things, you focus your attention all the time, looking for things that make you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a child.  They don&amp;#39;t walk along like a tired zombie. They run around, looking at every tiny detail, hoping to find something cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/kc0n96/the_phantom_zone/gfpvuml/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1607881247.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_kc0n96", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gfq410n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1607885181.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_kc0n96", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Oops, forgot another.\n\nI was bending way back and down, to scoop up something.\n\nCan't recall what.

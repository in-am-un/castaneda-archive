It's a position of the assemblage point.  Best to think of it that way too.\n\nWait until you get to heightened awareness, and then redo your explanation. Might be the same for all I know, but I doubt it.  Also, since you are here, go listen to Shinzen Young explain that what we are doing in here, is nothing short of reaching enlightenment in the shortest possible time.  There are many other \"westernized\" yogis and Buddhists, who tell the truth about enlightenment.  It's just a lack of an internal dialogue (plus practice in that state).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nSince you're in here, and you're a \"big boy\" as proven on facebook, I have to say that those who come here and comment that I've taken a leadership position, typically turn out to be desperate to get one themselves. So they notice who has the box of donuts on their desk. It never seems to occur to them that the guy with the box of donuts on his desk, merely had the only \"flat spot\" in the office. And doesn't really want them there.\n\nSo watch that.  The pic you have on facebook is a little like your own fantasy of being don Juan smoking a pipe.  \n\n(Everyone, we've duked it out on facebook, he can take it.)\n\nNow the opposite point of view:  The women need other people.\n\nThey need a \"lifestyle\", not power over other people.  They already know how to manipulate other people to their satisfaction (ignoring youth and such).\n\nSo my feelings about companionship being a bad thing, don't apply to them.\n\nBut that's mostly because, they have so much talent, you don't have to worry about the fellowship holding them back.

It&amp;#39;s a position of the assemblage point.  Best to think of it that way too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait until you get to heightened awareness, and then redo your explanation. Might be the same for all I know, but I doubt it.  Also, since you are here, go listen to Shinzen Young explain that what we are doing in here, is nothing short of reaching enlightenment in the shortest possible time.  There are many other &amp;quot;westernized&amp;quot; yogis and Buddhists, who tell the truth about enlightenment.  It&amp;#39;s just a lack of an internal dialogue (plus practice in that state).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you&amp;#39;re in here, and you&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;big boy&amp;quot; as proven on facebook, I have to say that those who come here and comment that I&amp;#39;ve taken a leadership position, typically turn out to be desperate to get one themselves. So they notice who has the box of donuts on their desk. It never seems to occur to them that the guy with the box of donuts on his desk, merely had the only &amp;quot;flat spot&amp;quot; in the office. And doesn&amp;#39;t really want them there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So watch that.  The pic you have on facebook is a little like your own fantasy of being don Juan smoking a pipe.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Everyone, we&amp;#39;ve duked it out on facebook, he can take it.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the opposite point of view:  The women need other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They need a &amp;quot;lifestyle&amp;quot;, not power over other people.  They already know how to manipulate other people to their satisfaction (ignoring youth and such).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my feelings about companionship being a bad thing, don&amp;#39;t apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s mostly because, they have so much talent, you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about the fellowship holding them back. In fact, seeking a &amp;quot;lifestyle&amp;quot; can cause them to become competitive in a good way.

Even the wise Chinese guy everyone likes to point to.\n\nThose guys over there in china.  You know the ones!  The \\*\\*real\\*\\* sages.\n\nOr maybe some crazy yogi in a cave. Yea, he's got the knowledge! It's everywhere!!!\n\nIt's nowhere.  At least, not anywhere that would bother with us.  As don Juan said, there's a small handful.  But that's all.\n\nThe second reason is, real magic creates excitement!\n\nNo excitement, no magic.\n\nIn fact, magic  creates RELIGIONS.  Each religion was started by someone doing real magic.\n\nReal magic is very exciting to humans!\n\nThis produces a desire for profit making , franchises, and soon the whole thing is turned to crap.\n\nUntil you realize this, you'll be a victim of it.\n\nIt's odd!  People stay in meditation systems for decades, and somehow ignore that everyone eventually gives up, because it didn't work.\n\nYou can go talk to them, and say, \"Hey, I can get you to enlightenment it 2 months!  Two weeks if you really want it!\"\n\nBut they won't even read a little to find out. They attack. And try to destroy you.\n\nSo, no actual interest.\n\nMy only theory for why this is so is, they didn't want magic in the first place. They wanted socialization.\n\nThe saffron monk robe. The tidy Zen master cloak.  An eagle feather in their hat, while hippies sit at their feet around a campfire.\n\n\\&gt; It sounds like you are assuming Carlos' teachings are doomed\n\nThey were.  If you've been following them for the last 55 years as I have, you've seen their obvious decline.\n\nIf you didn't know that, you should be a little careful. Your history isn't long enough to know what's going on here.\n\nIn the world of Esoterica, Carlos is now universally considered a fraud.\n\nAt one point, he was the king!  On the cover of time magazine even.\n\nExcept he's still the king, with new people who get sucked in and are too lazy to look around.\n\nSomeone on Facebook commented, there's a group of solid practitioners in the Soviet Union!\n\nWhere????  I see people who dutifully do some tensegrity each day, skip recap each day, and consider themselves \"on the path with heart\".\n\nBut they aren't. There's no magic going on there at all. Just anger and egotism.\n\nThey've been hoodwinked by Cleargreen.\n\nBait and switch it's called. You read the books, they're filed with magic, and that hooks you.\n\nAnd then you go to get your tasty \"hamburger\", and they give you a stick of gum.\n\nI can't understand why the stick of gum fools everyone!\n\nBut I suppose it's the same old thing.\n\nNo one really wants to learn magic. They want to be don Juan.  Or don Genaro. Or a mysterious Zuleica type.\n\nThey want to be part of a \"lineage\". Get together!  Someone even bugged me about getting together with Juan!\n\nCan you believe that?  On realizing maybe there is a path to the real thing, they want to go harm Juan's chances of making it, so they can \"hang out\".\n\nThey want human interaction.  Attention.\n\nSo as long as they're in a group which is telling them, \"Yes, you're doing fine!  Just keep it up and someday it'll all begin to work!  And be sure to attend our next workshop. Here's a 10% discount coupon\", they believe they are doing fine.  Because an authority figure is telling them, they're doing fine.\n\nLet me ask a simple question:  What happened to the 100+ private class students?  Carlos put years into them.  All special attention.\n\nAnd what happened to the 1500+ workshop attendees from back then?  Could be as many as 3000, I haven't counted yet.\n\nAll gone.  I suppose we still have one or two from the workshops in here.  But I'm the only private class person.\n\nSo, if you are stuck inside the Nazi prison camp, and they promise you a shower, please be sure to remember how those showers worked out for other people, in the time you started paying attention.\n\nYou're in the camp, possibly drooling over the possibility of a shower in the future.\n\nInstead, you should be looking around more closely.\n\n\\&gt; Would anyone advanced enough even need, to show off their silent knowledge on the social media?\n\nIf they weren't bastards they would.\n\nThere's a bible story I like to use for this case.  A leper is tossed out of the city, and forced to live alone outside the walls.\n\nThere's no love lost between him and the city guards.\n\nA drought causes starvation in the city.  The entire thing is doomed.\n\nThe leper comes across an enemy army camp. He notices the enemy has fled. Nowhere to be found.\n\nBut their food tent is full!!\n\nHe eats as much as he likes, but then begins to think of the starving people back in the city.\n\nHe realizes, he has to go tell someone, even if he's not on best terms with them.\n\nSo you're telling me, there's advanced sorcerers out there who are so selfish they aren't willing to try to help Carlos out, by teaching others to actually make his techniques work?\n\nIt's not that hard.  You just need a bull whip, and to tell them what to focus on.\n\nIsn't that the same old crap we get with Daoism?  Where \"someone out there is full of magic\", but you never get to see any? For some reason, the Daoist master can't actually show anyone.  It's just not allowed?\n\nCholita has those Daoist masters beaten by a thousand miles, and she just casually does magic for me.   It doesn't even occur to her to hide it.\n\n\\&gt; Are we trying to emulate each other?\n\nYou have a dose of poison somewhere in you.\n\nNothing I can do about it.\n\nDoesn't seem like a fatal dose yet, but it's troubling.\n\nI can guess:  You wanted to develop a reputation for yourself, based on pretending.  And this subreddit is threatening.\n\nBut you aren't a total bastard like the rest who visit here and drop bombs.\n\nSo you're trying to chip away at the idea, to make room for  your pretending to be satisfying again.\n\nJust a guess.  I don't analyze people for a living.\n\nIf I did, the answer would always be the same:  \"Yes, you're insane. Go away.\"\n\nInstead, I just try to increase the number of people who do real magic from Carlos' books, and lower the number of angry men who can get away with deceiving others.\n\nIt's nearly a hopeless cause.\n\nCarol, Taisha, and Florinda gave up on the idea.  It's rather obvious.\n\nI was supposed to leave with Florinda. So I suppose Carlos also thought it was hopeless.\n\nKylie clearly did. She's gone with the witches.\n\nI suppose they figure the world gets what it deserves, and if intent can't pull it off this time, it'll come up in another few hundred years.\n\nI'm a tinkerer.

Nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But their food tent is full!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He eats as much as he likes, but then begins to think of the starving people back in the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He realizes, he has to go tell someone, even if he&amp;#39;s not on best terms with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re telling me, there&amp;#39;s advanced sorcerers out there who are so selfish they aren&amp;#39;t willing to try to help Carlos out, by teaching others to actually make his techniques work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that hard.  You just need a bull whip, and to tell them what to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that the same old crap we get with Daoism?  Where &amp;quot;someone out there is full of magic&amp;quot;, but you never get to see any? For some reason, the Daoist master can&amp;#39;t actually show anyone.  It&amp;#39;s just not allowed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has those Daoist masters beaten by a thousand miles, and she just casually does magic for me.   It doesn&amp;#39;t even occur to her to hide it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are we trying to emulate each other?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have a dose of poison somewhere in you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing I can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a fatal dose yet, but it&amp;#39;s troubling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can guess:  You wanted to develop a reputation for yourself, based on pretending.  And this subreddit is threatening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you aren&amp;#39;t a total bastard like the rest who visit here and drop bombs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re trying to chip away at the idea, to make room for  your pretending to be satisfying again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a guess.  I don&amp;#39;t analyze people for a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I did, the answer would always be the same:  &amp;quot;Yes, you&amp;#39;re insane. Go away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I just try to increase the number of people who do real magic from Carlos&amp;#39; books, and lower the number of angry men who can get away with deceiving others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s nearly a hopeless cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol, Taisha, and Florinda gave up on the idea.  It&amp;#39;s rather obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to leave with Florinda. So I suppose Carlos also thought it was hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kylie clearly did. She&amp;#39;s gone with the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose they figure the world gets what it deserves, and if intent can&amp;#39;t pull it off this time, it&amp;#39;ll come up in another few hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a tinkerer.  I don&amp;#39;t give up until I run out of wire and glue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/koiha2/how_does_online_participation_affect_our_energy/ghutl0q/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1609616899.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_koiha2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ghts96l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "expat0tree", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1609596285.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ghrna64", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3q70ji14", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;Any valid ones would never broadcast it.

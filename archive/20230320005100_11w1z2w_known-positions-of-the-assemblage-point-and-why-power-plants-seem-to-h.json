If we want to live in control of the physical world, as we consistently \"know\" it, that is! Which is semi-necessary for a society in which we dont utterly cooperate with nature. Math, language, engineering, science, chemistry. All ways to predict and control the matter and energy that apparently exists all around us. Even control *ourselves*.\n\nQuestion is, what all can we do, without worrying about any of that???? Isn't all of that thinking and planning and controlling, the smaller part of ourselves, our rationality?\n\nIdk. In large part we decreased those capacities through the sheer atrophy of not needing or wanting to, when we're socialized and comforted this heavily, not living naturally, fearing death, etc. Tho it's very easy to want magic. And it's very easy to do it when the time calls for it. But nowadays it takes massive discipline whereas before civilization it probably took massive adventure or a massive desire to simply do it. Social pressure and weird ideas ingrained at childhood wouldn't have been as much of a problem. Tho they would have lived in much more \"survival mode\" and hence probably rarely had the time or energy to seek magic.\n\nAlso, more notions. Are we making the \"laws of physics\" stronger across the planet by believing in them? Do we have collective amnesia, from keeping our assemblage points so collected and stable, keeping us from remembering the obvious things which disprove the basic scientific and traditionalized perceptions of reality? In one person we know that tends to be how it works. Probably the same for a collection of billions of people. In fact I think thats how the river of shit is described in here and the books.\n\nFurther along this topic, how might matter and/ energy, in this apparent portion of existence, function to us, or perhaps even on its own, if we weren't constantly determining it to be lifeless and concrete? Maybe it's only lifeless and concrete, because that's how animals and to a much greater extent humans, choose to live.\n\nBut likely there's so many other intents, properties, forces, awarenesses out there affecting our total reality, that we know so little or nothing about, for us to truthfully understand much, until we have reliable clarity, personal power and perhaps blend it with a dedicated scientific style of inquiry.

The laws of physics are a portion of all existence, all possibilities, and strongly held in our present day consciousness, the modality of our time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this would also mean science is incredibly important. If we want to live in control of the physical world, as we consistently &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; it, that is! Which is semi-necessary for a society in which we dont utterly cooperate with nature. Math, language, engineering, science, chemistry. All ways to predict and control the matter and energy that apparently exists all around us. Even control &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question is, what all can we do, without worrying about any of that???? Isn&amp;#39;t all of that thinking and planning and controlling, the smaller part of ourselves, our rationality?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk. In large part we decreased those capacities through the sheer atrophy of not needing or wanting to, when we&amp;#39;re socialized and comforted this heavily, not living naturally, fearing death, etc. Tho it&amp;#39;s very easy to want magic. And it&amp;#39;s very easy to do it when the time calls for it. But nowadays it takes massive discipline whereas before civilization it probably took massive adventure or a massive desire to simply do it. Social pressure and weird ideas ingrained at childhood wouldn&amp;#39;t have been as much of a problem. Tho they would have lived in much more &amp;quot;survival mode&amp;quot; and hence probably rarely had the time or energy to seek magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, more notions. Are we making the &amp;quot;laws of physics&amp;quot; stronger across the planet by believing in them? Do we have collective amnesia, from keeping our assemblage points so collected and stable, keeping us from remembering the obvious things which disprove the basic scientific and traditionalized perceptions of reality? In one person we know that tends to be how it works. Probably the same for a collection of billions of people. In fact I think thats how the river of shit is described in here and the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further along this topic, how might matter and/ energy, in this apparent portion of existence, function to us, or perhaps even on its own, if we weren&amp;#39;t constantly determining it to be lifeless and concrete? Maybe it&amp;#39;s only lifeless and concrete, because that&amp;#39;s how animals and to a much greater extent humans, choose to live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But likely there&amp;#39;s so many other intents, properties, forces, awarenesses out there affecting our total reality, that we know so little or nothing about, for us to truthfully understand much, until we have reliable clarity, personal power and perhaps blend it with a dedicated scientific style of inquiry.

Obviously, years of therapy gave me a head start in this, but no amount of mindfulness or DBT or whatever has ever given me the upper hand the way I have it now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11w1z2w/known_positions_of_the_assemblage_point_and_why/jcyhv7s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1679325199.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_11w1z2w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcwzs9j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jumpinchollacactus", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1679288951.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11w1z2w", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_vdoj99go", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Great hands on description of a crutch, thanks", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jcwzs9j", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great hands on description of a crutch, thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11w1z2w/known_positions_of_the_assemblage_point_and_why/jcwzs9j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1679288951.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_11w1z2w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

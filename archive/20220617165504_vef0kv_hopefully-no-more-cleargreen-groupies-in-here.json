It's astounding!!!!\n\nI'll tantalize you.\n\nEvery \"dirty little secret\" technique of the old seers, is likely hidden in the Tensegrity.  For real.\n\nBut I can't explain that until you rise up a level or two in subreddits.  It's harmful to distract beginners from stuffing puffs, on the pouches.\n\nAny excuse to not have to do actual work... And they'll take it. It HURTS to force silence.\n\nSo here's from Facebook.  Just FYI.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from Facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nThe HORRORS of Cleargreen Groupies\n\nI just don't get this.  We read the books, we got hooked on magic, and then everyone lately is trying to get rid of it. To make it go away, so they can keep pretending.\n\nI'm not criticizing Cleargreen, because I have no idea what they're doing.  One thing they certainly are doing, is preserving the Tensegrity.\n\nThey have an EXCELLENT video library you can subscribe to, and you should at least consider learning more Tensegrity forms.\n\nThere is MAGIC hidden in those.  It's not one kind of magic.  It seems to be everything the old seers knew.  At least, from what I've uncovered.\n\nBut one thing Cleargreen DID NOT do, is protect the reputation of Carlos.\n\nIt's absolutely shit out there on google.  Any new person who reads the books of Carlos, sees the magic, and craves the true heritage of human beings, to be sorcerers and seers, will find on using google that \"Carlos Castaneda was thoroughly debunked\".\n\nIt is of course total nonsense created by bad men like Robert Marshall, trying to cash in by \"riding on his back\".  As Carlos used to say.\n\nOr smug writers for Salon magazine, who never bothered to do any research at all.  They just jumped in to pile on Carlos when he died.\n\nWe even had inquiries from Time magazine for a redo of their 1968 cover story, but this time certainly to laugh about that, and how we were all too stupid to notice he was a fraud.\n\nI told them to go to the subreddit, and explained how no one trusts the media as far as Carlos is concerned, and if she did a little research she'd get a lot better story than she had anticipated.\n\nAnd everyone in the subreddit was convinced, she did in fact sneak in and ask people. But she's almost guaranteed to hide the results.\n\nThe world HATES real magic.\n\nThe pretend kind, like Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism, religion, Magick, and even Kabballah, are fine.\n\nKabballah deserves a mention as having a tiny bit of real magic, but they're religious nuts, and don't understand what's going on.\n\nThe rest only contain effects accessible by moving the assemblage down below the shoulder blades.  Bliss, visions, and if you obsess over that, you can even put yourself into a permanent egotistical state, and believe you are \"enlightened\". But none of that is anything you can't do much better with shamanic drumming.\n\nAnd none worth pursuing when you realize everything in the books of Carlos and the witches, is easily available.\n\nAs I said, fake magic is ok by society, but the real thing must be destroyed on sight.  Wherever it's found.\n\nYou wouldn't know if you weren't trying to save it from extinction.  Its endless attacks.\n\nBut from our own???\n\nThat seems to be the case.\n\nThere are \"purists\" out there, who never read the final publications of Carlos, never learned to get silent, never noticed all the astounding magical stories in the books are fully true, and have been duplicated by real people.  They didn't notice, it's all true!\n\nAnd they ditched Carlos, in favor of seeking attention in the organization that survived his death.\n\nWhen some of them find out that there are people seriously practicing and making it all work, they attack!  They try to destroy it, by condemning it as \"unauthorized by Cleargreen\".\n\nWhat the hell does that even mean? No one in the subreddit is trying to get money from anyone. It's just a practice group.\n\nBut it hurts the feelings of the groupies, who keep \"journals\", do tensegrity, and pretend they have great skills in \"dreaming\", because they've been misrepresenting ordinary dreams for decades.\n\nWhen they realize what frauds they've been, they don't decide to take advantage of that subreddit and learn.\n\nInstead they go there and try to convince people working hard, to give it up and go back to Mental Masturbation.\n\nIt's shameful from our own!\n\nI'd expect an arch enemy of Carlos like Jeremy of Sustained Action to behave like that.\n\nHis head exploded when he realized he was going down in history as a bad guy, and not, \"The man who exposed the fraud\" as he had hoped for.\n\nSo he tried to destroy it by pointing people to \"lucid dreaming\", his favorite pastime from years past.\n\nLucid dreaming practices are DEATH to magic.  Anyone who got interested in that, as Jeremy wanted them to, would be lost to sorcery.  \n\nI can't explain why here, but sorcery is \"the Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nYou can't do \"something else\" to help learn it. Anything else destroys the link to \"intent\".\n\nYou can learn to visibly see that if you work hard.  The emanations themselves are viewable in many forms.\n\nEven very interesting forms where you can reach your fingers in and \"tweak\" reality.  Right in front of you, like you were Dr. Strange or some other movie magician.\n\nIt's expected for past bad guys like Jeremy to try to stop people from learning that Carlos was the real thing.\n\nBut our own???\n\nShame on all of you who are pretending your sorcery, and get angry when someone tries to help you.\n\nI even picked up a groupie stalker, who wants to try to find something to complain about to Reni.\n\nIt's sick minded.\n\nHere's a wakeup call.\n\nYour dreams are NOT sorcery.  Carlos NEVER tolerated that kind of thinking. He instantly stopped anyone asking about their \"dreaming skills\".  He pointed out, until you can learn to be absolutely silent, you can't do real dreaming past the first gate where you just find your fingers. Anything past that, is impossible.\n\nAnd by the way, if you don't find your fingers, you're full of it to call that sorcery experience with \"dreaming\".\n\nAnd Carlos NEVER said, or even implied, you could just do your tensegrity daily, without any other efforts, and become a sorcerer.\n\nHe was endlessly frustrated trying to get us to \"wake up and take it seriously\".\n\nWe learned new tensegrity each private class!  We were ALL doing that, until Tensegrity came out of our ears.\n\nAs Carlos said, we were \"saturated\".\n\nAnd still, no real magic... He said so himself!  Did you even know that?  He said he was failing.  And died just a few months later.\n\nBut he was merely passing on the technology of the old seers in the Tensegrity forms. \n\nThat was NOT what he needed us to do, in order to really learn.\n\nIt's just not possible for Tensegrity to work, while you are too lazy to learn real silence.  \n\nThe Tensegrity is an aid, but you have to be learning to remove all traces of internal dialogue, you have to engage in not-doing, gazing, recapitulation, and in general INSIST on finding some tiny thing that's working to produce REAL magic,  and expand on that.\n\nYou can't hang out with your \"like minded\" groupie buddies and pat each other on the back.\n\nThat is NOT, \"the path with heart\".\n\nThat's the path to pretending.\n\nInstead, you need to READ what Carlos wrote to us, as he was dying. His final 5 publications.\n\nAnd you need to DO what he told us to do.\n\nYou need to move your assemblage point all the way to the front and find the \"whitish light on surfaces\".\n\nThen choose.  Do you want \"Silent Knowledge\" to be videos?   Like the cover of Wheel of Time, projecting the phases of the moon into the sky.\n\nThat's EASY to do!!!  Even beginners of just a week or two in that subreddit, get to see those once in a while.\n\nOr do you want virtual beings who will lecture you about magic and guide you? \n\nLike Porfirio from the books.  That might take months, but when you have a supernatural being for a teacher, it'll all be VERY worth the hard work.\n\nOr do you want to become a \"Reader of Infinity\", literally reading text out of thin air, or on your palm, giving you knowledge.\n\nThat's \"seeing\" as text!  Don Juan even suggested selecting that choice.\n\nDid you know that?  If not, how come???\n\nLook... If you're too lazy to do actual work, that's not surprising.\n\nBut don't try to stop others from learning the real thing, because it makes you feel bad!\n\nDon't behave like the Buddhist Meditation Police,  with sorcery.\n\nSorcery is REAL, not pretend.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Hopefully no more Cleargreen Groupies in here?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"nj1i3ot937691": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nj1i3ot937691.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=496eb6b509f091a9dd9fee68eb3b9d70d1a180e9"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nj1i3ot937691.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27ee145fd2cabc5bd26f721f947f9c5d04f103f6"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nj1i3ot937691.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=012cd8a6adb817eaa0f05ad9f6a6f2c67a9322ed"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nj1i3ot937691.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dde8791e8ae07c434889f4b4b47d4bc251a563e"}], "s": {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nj1i3ot937691.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16640bb5ee1f39c2140b42a826a5bb7d984409f8"}, "id": "nj1i3ot937691"}}, "name": "t3_vef0kv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/f1gXbiVuWd4w47thQNyKZ-B30E_8UuwheCFZO_24EiY.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1655477704.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nj1i3ot937691.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=16640bb5ee1f39c2140b42a826a5bb7d984409f8\"&gt;We do that too????

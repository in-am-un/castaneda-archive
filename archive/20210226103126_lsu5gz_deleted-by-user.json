And takes far too much effort to be worth it.\n\nBeing able to repeat the \"how\" is sorcery.  You  learn how to invoke intent.\n\nSo a witch might learn how to do a single magical thing.  Which is very cool!\n\nBut a sorcerer can listen to what you want to do, and simply shout, \"Intent!!!\"\n\nAnd it happens.\n\n&gt;maybe it was trying to lead me the best \"spot\" in my room.\n\nSounds like you have read one of the first 4 books.\n\nThose are the point of view of the old \"Men of Knowledge\", who were in fact, not seers. They were tradesmen, trading in ritualistic magical services.\n\nAnd so, they understood \"finding your spot\" as a way to gather \"energy\" from around you.  A ritual.\n\nA seer can make his own \"spot\", anywhere he likes.  He can even make a portal into another world, where his \"spot\" will go.\n\nCholita, my witch friend, did that!\n\nAnd for a seer, the importance of \"finding your spot\", is just the same as darkroom gazing.\n\nNo different.  Don Juan taught Carlos dark room gazing, as the very first thing he did.\n\nThink about it! He was crawling around gazing at the dirt, look for colors.\n\nHe didn't find them, until it got dark outside.\n\nMusic?\n\nShould be possible to use that, but so far no one has.\n\nIn fact, the music seems to get stuck in people's heads, and is harder to remove than the internal dialogue.\n\nAnd be careful. You are \"trying\" an awful lot in that account.\n\nTrying prevents the downward movement of the assemblage point, along the \"J Curve\".\n\nWe are after that. The downward movement.\n\nTrying moves it horizontally.\n\nThat can be fun, but you can get \"stuck\" there.\n\nFocus mostly on perfecting silence at first.\n\nIf a zombie with a rotten eye shows up, and threatens to murder you, just say, \"Hey, you're always welcome here!\"\n\nAnd go back to forcing silence.\n\nBy the way, drugs make it harder to learn.

And takes far too much effort to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being able to repeat the &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; is sorcery.  You  learn how to invoke intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a witch might learn how to do a single magical thing.  Which is very cool!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a sorcerer can listen to what you want to do, and simply shout, &amp;quot;Intent!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;maybe it was trying to lead me the best &amp;quot;spot&amp;quot; in my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds like you have read one of the first 4 books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the point of view of the old &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot;, who were in fact, not seers. They were tradesmen, trading in ritualistic magical services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, they understood &amp;quot;finding your spot&amp;quot; as a way to gather &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot; from around you.  A ritual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A seer can make his own &amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;, anywhere he likes.  He can even make a portal into another world, where his &amp;quot;spot&amp;quot; will go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita, my witch friend, did that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for a seer, the importance of &amp;quot;finding your spot&amp;quot;, is just the same as darkroom gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No different.  Don Juan taught Carlos dark room gazing, as the very first thing he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it! He was crawling around gazing at the dirt, look for colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t find them, until it got dark outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Music?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should be possible to use that, but so far no one has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the music seems to get stuck in people&amp;#39;s heads, and is harder to remove than the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And be careful. You are &amp;quot;trying&amp;quot; an awful lot in that account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying prevents the downward movement of the assemblage point, along the &amp;quot;J Curve&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are after that. The downward movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying moves it horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That can be fun, but you can get &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Focus mostly on perfecting silence at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a zombie with a rotten eye shows up, and threatens to murder you, just say, &amp;quot;Hey, you&amp;#39;re always welcome here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And go back to forcing silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, drugs make it harder to learn.  For instance, a 50mg THC gummy bear, is like putting a neutral density filter over the colors in the darkroom.  And damages them for a good 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can still find them, but they&amp;#39;re very dull.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stronger stuff such as shrooms, burn trails that go horizontally, messing things up when you try to do it sober.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen a big shroom user, keep going until they learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They always flake out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lsu5gz/deleted_by_user/gqgoqya/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1615394735.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_lsu5gz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gqf20qa", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_govh90g", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "You were definitely right about the Pavlov analogy, I reminded myself that my reaction of fear was only conditioning and what I was feeling was actually movement of the AP, I was still a bit skeptical but I felt more confident than before.

Dark like asphalt, but not jet black. So far it's always vertical, never horizontal like Minx.\n\nWhen she transforms into a gnat, the dark smoke falls from just above my head where I can't see the origin, twists like smoke might normally twist in air currents, but then it takes on the movements of a mosquito, looking for a landing spot.\n\nInstead of just falling, it twists and it seems to be trying to put it's legs in the right spot to set down.\n\nActually she turned into several flying insects last night.  Mosquito, fly, gnat.  \n\nBetween each transformation she flew around in a circle for me, around a person that wasn't actually there.\n\nI was so far along the J curve, I didn't realize that she can't fly around me in a circle, all entirely in front of me.\n\nI was located in 2 spots, as if I were kneeling in front of my self, sitting on the bed.\n\nWho she was flying around is beyond my knowledge.  He wasn't visible.  And yet, he blocked her when she went around his back side.\n\nSo if you get an IOB and you make it to where the double is visible, keep an eye out for insects.\n\nWith Minx on the other hand, keep an eye out for rodents.\n\nI always thought don Juan was just trying to scare Carlos in order to move his assemblage point, with his tale of IOBs riding on busses like ordinary people.\n\nNow I have to think, maybe it was literal!\n\nMaybe it's a dreaming double \"assist\".  \n\nTo keep them, your double,  focused on this realm, instead of drifting off into an alternate copy of reality.\n\nLike an anchor for the double so they can be more useful?", "edited": 1614370461.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gov9odw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid to say, you just have to work twice as hard as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry to say that, because it&amp;#39;s already too much work for nearly all people!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only strategy for you would be, to get to the fun stuff as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t begin to describe how fun it gets!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a little gnat in my dark room for more than a week now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep the door open, but it won&amp;#39;t leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I come home, it greets me, then leaves me alone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It flies up to my eyes, doesn&amp;#39;t land, I say hello, and it leaves.

Like the very dark smoke that might come from a firework that had run of out steam, and was just emitting some left over dark smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more than 3 inches tall, and only 1/2 inch around, with twists and turns all along it.  Dark like asphalt, but not jet black. So far it&amp;#39;s always vertical, never horizontal like Minx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she transforms into a gnat, the dark smoke falls from just above my head where I can&amp;#39;t see the origin, twists like smoke might normally twist in air currents, but then it takes on the movements of a mosquito, looking for a landing spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of just falling, it twists and it seems to be trying to put it&amp;#39;s legs in the right spot to set down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually she turned into several flying insects last night.  Mosquito, fly, gnat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between each transformation she flew around in a circle for me, around a person that wasn&amp;#39;t actually there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so far along the J curve, I didn&amp;#39;t realize that she can&amp;#39;t fly around me in a circle, all entirely in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was located in 2 spots, as if I were kneeling in front of my self, sitting on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who she was flying around is beyond my knowledge.  He wasn&amp;#39;t visible.  And yet, he blocked her when she went around his back side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you get an IOB and you make it to where the double is visible, keep an eye out for insects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Minx on the other hand, keep an eye out for rodents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always thought don Juan was just trying to scare Carlos in order to move his assemblage point, with his tale of IOBs riding on busses like ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I have to think, maybe it was literal!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s a dreaming double &amp;quot;assist&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep them, your double,  focused on this realm, instead of drifting off into an alternate copy of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like an anchor for the double so they can be more useful?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_lsu5gz", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lsu5gz/deleted_by_user/gov9odw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1614366573.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1614366573.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gov2eip", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_goufztc", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lsu5gz/deleted_by_user/gov2eip/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_gov2eip", "created": 1614364127.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1614364127.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "goufztc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gouel94", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Carlos didn't like to add to our inventory.\n\nI didn't understand why very well, until I started working in this subreddit.\n\nSo he never mentioned that topic at all!\n\nI never had that problem.\n\nFancy, my inorganic being, pounced on me at 5 years old.\n\nIn the form of Satan himself, pitchfork and all.\n\nDid it nightly for months, until I kind of liked the fear sensation.\n\nI am of course assuming it was Fancy.

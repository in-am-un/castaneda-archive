Sometimes to promote their latest book deal.\n\nOne of my students, so advanced he doesn\u2019t need me anymore, says the cheerful, friendly, helpful students have no chance.\n\nThey\u2019re a fraud.  Needy people, looking for attention. Groupies.\n\nThey\u2019re a drain on the system and a burden to whoever has to associate with them, in the course of learning sorcery.\n\nBut why is that helpful community behavior encouraged at Tensegrity workshops, to the point that people volunteer to help organize?\n\nNot that it\u2019s **exclusively** helpful and happy people organizing at workshops.\n\nCholita did it way back when, for free attendance and transportation.\n\nAside from blackmail, as in Cholita\u2019s case, people are encouraged to be helpful and friendly because there\u2019s money involved.\n\nCash.\n\nOf course you\u2019re welcome to the workshop!\n\nAnd everyone is encouraged to be helpful.\n\nIf you don\u2019t \u201cfit in\u201d here, there\u2019s a Jesus Freak convention down the hallway. I hear the women are looking for husbands.\n\nOr you can share your knitting tips, with like-minded old people.\n\nBeing inclusive is more profitable.\n\nAnd free labor is always good.\n\nMy grumpiest student says the only ones who will succeed are the ones whose normal lives were so miserable that they had no choice but to kill themselves, or change.\n\nThey have angry, bitter, violent personalities.\n\nI disagree.\n\nI\u2019m autistic, but I still manage to have more fun than anyone else I know.\n\nLast time I was on Catalina Island riding an electric golf cart with 2 amazingly beautiful, young,  intoxicated women in control, both too young to drive the carts, and the police guy didn\u2019t bust us because he was a Castaneda fan\u2026\n\nSorry.\n\nForget about that story.  One almost jumped off the boat on the way back.  She didn't want to leave the island.\n\nLet\u2019s go for an expert opinion on who\u2019s going to succeed.\n\nAccording to don Juan, the well-educated successful people would not be good students.\n\nIt\u2019s only the homeless kids, licking the plates in outdoor restaurants just to survive, who have a chance.\n\nMoscow runaways and abandoned kids, sheltering in the drainage system to escape the snow, and unable to use the foot traffic underpasses because they\u2019ll be sexually exploited.\n\nThose are the best candidates to learn sorcery.\n\nIn Second Ring of Power, I suspect the first thing all of us felt on reading that book, as it came out many years ago, was:\n\n\u201cWhat a load of jerks those apprentices are!  This is depressing.\u201d\n\nYes, they **were** horrible.  Unhelpful, grumpy, suspicious, and violent.\n\nRather than helpful, they were secretive.  As if what they\u2019d learned was just a tool for playing tricks on Carlos to get revenge for \u201cwhat was done to them\u201d.\n\nLater they even killed La Gorda for being too bossy, according to Carlos.\n\nI still have to worry nightly that Josefina (Cholita) will kill me.\n\nThe old sorcerers used to cut people up with their sharp little knives, and consume their flesh in order to frighten them to death.\n\nSorcerers aren\u2019t saints.\n\nA saint wouldn\u2019t go against the prevailing social order.\n\nBut you don\u2019t actually have to be a stinker.  It just helps.\n\nAnd everyone has a chance in my opinion.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to be so grumpy that we resort to cannibalism.\n\nThe problem is, learning sorcery is nothing at all like learning anything else.\n\nYou can\u2019t learn by memorizing new inventories. There\u2019s plenty of \u201cexperts\u201d on Castaneda out there, with web pages devoid of any actual understanding.\n\nSo while knowing what don Juan had for dinner might be interesting, and might even give you bonus points when you\u2019re sitting around chatting with your sorcery buddies, it\u2019s only going to hold you back from learning sorcery.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel \u201caccomplished\u201d, instead of desperate.\n\nAnd you won\u2019t work, unless you are more desperate to gain sorcery knowledge than you are to waste all your time on entertainment and sex.\n\nCan you learn by paling up to one of the inner circle?\n\nDo chores for Carol Tiggs?\n\nGet a big smile from Reni?\n\nNope.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why. That seems like it ought to work.\n\nBut they had plenty of pals back in the day.\n\nAll gone.\n\nWhat about memorizing every single Tensegrity technique?\n\nThat sure seems like it ought to work.\n\nBut unfortunately, as you do the Tensegrity, there you are.\n\nRight there. It\u2019s you. Doing tensegrity.\n\nAnd you\u2019re the problem.\n\nYou suck. Your family saw to that when they brainwashed you.\n\nI saw a sign just a while ago,  at the Starbucks drive through. They\u2019d closed the doors to the inside, due to the COVID19 virus.\n\nIt was intended to encourage us.\n\nThey had several uplifting signs, all drawn by an enthusiastic person who worked there.\n\n\u201cHelp others to feel like SOMEBODY.\u201d\n\nThat was too much for me. I didn\u2019t read the others.\n\nSOMEBODY important? Someone special?\n\nThat\u2019s the hellish world we were born into.\n\nYou feel special, and I\u2019ll keep my distance, and not mess with your stuff.\n\nYou respect me, for the person I am, and I\u2019ll treat you with dignity.\n\nOf course, if you learn to get silent you realize, everyone around you is on the edge of murder at any moment, and the only thing stopping one person from beating another with their fists is that we\u2019ve all learned what not to say, and when, and what rules not to break.\n\nWe\u2019ll all be happy, living in this cozy social order. If you follow the rules.\n\nAnd the rules don\u2019t allow escaping to freedom. That\u2019s a \u201csin\u201d.\n\nYou have to find your place, and fit in cheerfully.\n\nIf I\u2019d chalked that Starbucks sign it would say, \u201cA PLAGUE IS UPON US!!!\u201d\n\nIt would be more useful than encouraging inclusiveness.\n\nUse the fear!\n\nIt\u2019s easier to assemble another world right now.\n\nThe assemblage point of the entire planet is being pushed.\n\nIf Cholita was sane, I\u2019d convince her to sew us some black robes, and build a wooden cart so we could roam the streets at night shouting, \u201cBring out your Dead!!!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what we need more of.\n\nBut what\u2019s wrong with being a curious, intellectually interested, helpful junior sorcery student?\n\nIf that's your question, I have to ask, haven\u2019t you been doing your recapitulation?!\n\nYou go for the most troublesome topic, and the next time you\u2019re trying to do something magical, that thought comes back and spoils the whole thing.\n\nYou force yourself silent anyway, blood dripping from your nose because of the intense effort.\n\nAnd you manage to win for an instant.\n\nBut the next time, that situation is still soaking up all of your awareness.\n\nYou recapitulate deeper, discover it was all your fault after all, and now you think you\u2019re finally over it.\n\nBut you aren\u2019t! Maybe it\u2019s half the effort to banish that topic from your internal dialogue, but it\u2019s still not easy.\n\nThe problem is YOU.\n\nThat\u2019s you!  You're a big knot of negative feelings.\n\nThat single topic for recapitulation is actually just a thread, leading to a gigantic ball of string.\n\nAnd not a ball from a continuous string.\n\nYou pull one thread off the ball, and there\u2019s almost no noticeable reduction in size.\n\nYou have to keep fighting \u201cYOU\u201d until the entire ball is gone. And that\u2019s going to tug on other threads, on other balls.\n\nYou are a matrix of trouble and worry. You\u2019ve been hazed and punished, and lured, into being the wonderful, helpful, intellectually curious person you are.\n\nThat's the human form. A maze of knots of energetic threads, on many balls, holding your personality together.\n\nEvery time you tickle your fancy with tantalizing intellectual information regarding Carlos\u2019s books, you just wound another thread back onto the ball.\n\nWhen you volunteer at a workshop, and smile at people coming through the door, you just tightened the threads.\n\nIt\u2019ll be even harder to remove them.\n\nYou have to engage in not-doing.\n\nGive up being YOU.\n\nYou won\u2019t get there otherwise.\n\nYou\u2019ll become a story for Cholita and I to talk about:\n\n\"Cholita, remember that really friendly guy in Carlos\u2019 classes?  What was his name?\"\n\n\"Which one? The guy who did the hat trick?\"\n\n\"Yea, him.\"\n\n\"I think it was Ralph.\"\n\n\"Yea. That\u2019s it. I really liked that guy!  Do you know where he is now?\"\n\n\"No, sorry.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s a real pity. He really seemed like he had a chance.\"\n\nEdited three times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What\u2019s The Right Attitude for Learning Sorcery?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_fm25l4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1584740181.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1584736238.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I do know what doesn\u2019t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched 100 of Carlos\u2019 apprentices give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now they even badmouth Carlos.

You\u2019ll be sorry if you do.\n\nBut the characters in a lucid dream are fair game.  And you will indeed need a defense against them, if you plan to pass the 4 gates of dreaming.\n\nIt might happen like this. You are in the middle of trying to put a donut onto the tail of a cute little dog, who from time to time seems more like a lizard. But you don\u2019t like lizards, so you try to ignore that.\n\nIt\u2019s just a little dog.\n\nYou check again. Yes, a little dog.\n\nAs you reach down towards his tail, donut in hand, you have a weird thought.\n\nCould this be a dream?\n\nNo! Of course not.\n\nBut after another second or two, you realize how absurd this all is.\n\nYou look at your hands.\n\nBut, you\u2019re still worried about the dog.\n\nYou almost get sucked back into the dream. But having gotten sucked back in many times you force yourself to turn around. You take a step or two away.\n\nIt\u2019s over. A sigh of relief comes over you, minus the actual sigh. Or maybe that\u2019s better said, you can feel something evaporating off of you, and freeing you to be fully lucid.\n\nYou start down the road, excited to do some exploring. After a few seconds you notice you\u2019re being followed.  There\u2019s a gang of people walking their dogs, right behind you.\n\nThey surround you, leashes and all. Little lizard dogs are below you, nipping at your feet.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely trapped.\n\nOne has the donut in his hand, and seems intent on gagging you with it!\n\nWhat to do?  You know if you remain trapped like that you\u2019ll wake up.\n\nYou need to take charge of this situation. So you stare at the person closest to you. You pick a spot on their chest, and concentrate on seeing every possible detail.\n\nMy advice? Point your finger at him too, until you get some action going.\n\nYou\u2019ve just summoned intent. Or perhaps, since the entire dream is made from intent,  you\u2019ve just concentrated it on a single spot.\n\nYou recognize that what you\u2019re staring at is part of a shirt.\n\nBut you don\u2019t let that fool you. You want to see the buttons, the fabric, everything. All the pieces making that a shirt. Maybe even look for contradictions.\n\nAs you look for more details, it starts to jerk a little.  The buttons change from round to shiny and square. The fabric vibrates.\n\nYou\u2019ve created an \u201c*intent* feedback loop\u201d. Each change causes you to look closer, to try to understand what you are seeing. Each time you look closer, it reacts by changing again.\n\nIt ultimately breaks up into tiny pieces, swirling away, and all that\u2019s left is an empty shirt on the ground.\n\nBy the way, it \u201cswirls away\u201d if you\u2019ve seen the right movies. If you\u2019ve seen different ones, don\u2019t be surprised if what it does looks suspiciously like one of your favorites.\n\nWhat it does when it finally goes away, depends on faint traces of *intent* in your own mind. And maybe some of the *intent* of the ancient sorcerers.\n\nOnce you get rid of one of them, the other phantoms will likely let you stare at them too.\n\nYou\u2019ve summoned the intent of searching that crowd.\n\nThat\u2019s all they really wanted. Some attention.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll uncover a \u201cscout\u201d. An inorganic being who\u2019s been trying to interact with you in the dream.\n\nIn that case, staring will reveal a bar or collection of lights.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the bars Carlos mentioned three times in dreaming, and twice while awake.\n\nBut in waking dreaming, I\u2019ve seen other configurations of lights.\n\nThe point is, it won\u2019t completely go away.\n\nDon Juan said his teachings should more properly be called, \u201cThe Mastery of Intent\u201d.\n\nWhen I first heard that, I imagined spooky music playing, with Silvio Manuel\u2019s left eye glowing through the darkness. Only Silvio Manuel could possibly understand that mystery.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing like that.  It\u2019s all totally obvious!\n\nOnce you learn to be silent, and especially if you stare at the darkness looking for colors, you\u2019ll be fully aware of what *intent* does.\n\nIt makes all the dreaming images and colors you can find in darkness.\n\nIt both obeys you, and gifts you.\n\nIf you are absolutely silent, and your assemblage point has moved at least a foot deeper inside you, you can make requests.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll get them, but more often than not you will.\n\nYou could say, \u201cI sure would like a donut!\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t be surprised if a minute or two later, after you\u2019ve completely forgotten, a donut  appears in front of you, rotating in space.\n\nBut why is it a pink frosting donut? You hate those!\n\nWho knows? Somewhere in there, you must have unfinished business with pink donuts.\n\nAnd thus part of the reason for the recapitulation. To reduce all that unfinished business, which clogs *intent*.\n\nHow can you make use of it, rather than just hear about it?\n\nAren\u2019t you tired of reading \u201cAutobiography of a Yogi\u201d, and would rather **do** what\u2019s written there?\n\nGet silent, stare at colors, move your assemblage point all the way into heightened awareness, and sit up on the bed.\n\nSlowly turn the head left and right, scanning for details in the colors you see. If you find a patch, stare intently at it, in full silence.\n\nIf you are expecting to intercept dreams, a dreaming scene will appear.  At that spot!\n\nOr, just stare straight ahead, and intend to \u201cburn\u201d a hole in reality. You have to get the hang of the gaze, but in perfect silence that won\u2019t be difficult.\n\nAll kinds of things will spill out of the hole. People, objects, shapes.\n\nOr, you can enter your dreaming body. Gaze at the darkness, intending to see a place you\u2019d like to visit.\n\nWhen it materializes, keep gazing without caring, intending to enter it.\n\nYou will.\n\nOr, you can intend to stop the world.\n\nOr assemble another world.\n\nOr summon inorganic beings.\n\nAll of these use the same basic technique; dreaming awake in darkness with the *intent* of the thing you want to do.\n\nOnly the intent varies. Well. There's internal dialogue, images, and Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nSo there are slight differences in how to invoke intent in darkness.  You might want to keep one or two of those 3, for a particular task.\n\nBut I\u2019ve written about those elsewhere.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a warning in all that I just wrote, which is not obvious.\n\nContinued\u2026", "edited": 1585247848.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_flkt8mg", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 3A: The Perils of &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you encounter a being in dreaming, or dreaming awake, and want to know if it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d, you can try staring at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s always worked for me, but there\u2019s such a huge variety of things you can run into in the second attention that making a rule about it is probably not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you run into Cholita please don\u2019t stare.

So many children, so few care workers.\n\nBabies go through their entire infancy with nearly no human touch. All they can do is lay in bed whimpering, and suck their own thumb while listening to the other children suffer.\n\nNo help is coming.\n\nOnce they\u2019re grown, it would take an expert decades to fix them enough to be able to handle a basic 2 way relationship.\n\nRussia has experts on this issue. Despite limited resources their medical knowledge is second to none.\n\nThe Russian experts on neglected children all generally agree, don\u2019t make such a being.\n\nThey can\u2019t be fixed.\n\nThe bad behavior is hardwired into the operating system to the point that the child himself can\u2019t see it.\n\nIf you try to deal with one issue, they change and another bad behavior pops out.\n\nIf you show them kindness, they\u2019re as likely to bite you as smile.\n\nIf you put in an extraordinary effort, coercing them to pretend to be learning to be human, you can be sure that eventually they\u2019ll get into trouble elsewhere and come back with their teeth bent on your flesh.\n\nIf you become their protector, any bad thing which happens to them in the future is your fault.\n\nIt\u2019s like they\u2019re playing tag. They aren\u2019t actually trying to find a better place for themselves.\n\nAnd they never get tired of twisting their body or darting away quickly just as you\u2019re about to make some progress.\n\nHowever, if a specific child has the strong desire to fix himself, and works hard with the people available, it\u2019s possible to salvage something.\n\nIt\u2019s just not up to the care givers.  They\u2019d give anything for just one success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of apprentices!\n\nCarlos had hundreds of them over the years. But a core 100 according to Cholita.\n\nThe Blue Scout was dead against it.  She told Carlos it was a waste of time, and would only harm his own party.\n\nCarlos had to hide private classes from her at first.  They even came to be known as \"secret\" classes.\n\nAnd Carlos wasn\u2019t blind to the hopelessness of sorcery students.\n\nAs part of his strategy, he had different factions.\n\nWhile in one faction, he\u2019d comment on the progress of the other faction.\n\nHe\u2019d use them as an example, hoping to gain at least a little from their failures.\n\nMy faction was summarized thus:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all a bunch of masturbators!\u201d\n\nBut I can get much more specific.\n\nWe had many types of masturbators.\n\nSpecialists even.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising. The porn industry loves specialists.\n\nIn most cases, it was so obvious you truly wanted to tell some of them to please put their pants back on when in class.\n\nBut you couldn\u2019t.\n\nSome did us the favor of being interviewed after Carlos died.\n\nI was happy to hear one of my advanced students comment on some of the interviews.\n\nHe saw what was obvious, even without knowing the people involved.\n\nThe total fakes were right up front, talking the loudest.\n\nAmong the rest were an assortment of disillusioned and confused ex-followers.\n\nNo one with any real knowledge, even after years of constant effort from Carlos.\n\nCults are like that.\n\nEveryone is welcome, as long as they don\u2019t hit, kick, or bite.\n\nAnd everyone has to force themselves to be blind to the truth about the group\u2019s behavior.\n\nEven when it\u2019s totally obvious to outsiders.\n\nWhen a cult finally dies,  often the head female takes over.\n\nIn the absence of anyone actual achieving the cults goal, that's the best you can do.\n\nSubdue the scandals.  A male successor would only add to them.\n\nAs professional masturbators, private class members flocked from one appealing image to the next.\n\nTheir current infatuation might last only a week or two.\n\nThen they\u2019d move on, and abandon their last love.\n\nI suspect Carlos could have worked with a masturbator, as long as they stuck to the same fetish.\n\nBut they behaved as if it were an orgy, and you couldn\u2019t get anyone to stay in one place long enough to help them out.\n\nAmong the worst of the masturbators, were the men with big dicks.\n\nTypically they were tall, handsome, had blue eyes, and a hint of a European accent.\n\nAs the big dick males, their ultimate goal was to become a porno star.\n\nBut in the meantime they were willing to work with the casting agents, and play with the available co-stars.\n\nOn the surface they were nice.  Polite even.\n\nBut you always had to acknowledge their dick was huge, or their mood could change quickly.\n\nThey'd never been turned down before, so they were miserable beings.\n\nThe women seemed to enjoy the big dick males.\n\nI found them a bit annoying.\n\nBut at least they weren\u2019t biting.  They could behave themselves, until Carlos was gone.\n\nThe worst, from my point of view, were the group masturbators.\n\nThey were so needy that they couldn\u2019t get an erection unless they had another person around to spoon feed them new pornography, and comment on their masturbation techniques and progress.\n\nIt might even have been possible to talk them down from that behavior, except that they had an endless need for new audiences, to appraise their masturbation skills.\n\nAmong the women, we had the child bearers. They loved to imagine the full commitment and spiritual connection they could have, being impregnated by a spiritually minded man.\n\nI never got to see them actually masturbate.\n\nCarlos had a talent for accumulating amazingly beautiful young women.  I would have liked to see that.\n\nBut Cholita assures me, they were good at it.\n\nOne even used Cholita a few times, to make it seem more \u201creal\u201d.\n\nAnd towards the end, everyone knew about the possibility of an invitation to an inner circle masturbation party.\n\nThe peeping toms were the most sinister. They\u2019d try to video tape Carlos with his pants down, find weaknesses which allowed them to watch more people with no one aware of it, and their entire focus was pretty much on degradation.\n\nBut they put up a good front. They tended to dress well.  That makes it easier to sneak around without raising suspicions.\n\nThe nerd masturbators might have been the most benign. They had some dreadful perversions, including choking women, but for the most part they stuck with those and didn\u2019t want to know what anyone else was looking at.\n\nThey just didn\u2019t want to get caught.\n\nCarlos could have worked with the nerd masturbators, except that when he died the big dicks and peeping toms took over.\n\nThe group masturbators went along with it, because their endless supply of porn had dried up.\n\nThere were also temptations in there, for Carlos himself.\n\nThere were the bondage queens. Women who wanted to be molested. Touched, handled, pushed around.\n\nI have a hard time with those myself.\n\nI kind of like to be nice to women.  But Cholita's taught me, that's not always the best course of action.\n\nAnd there were plenty of stray women masturbators, who were happy to be treated badly in exchange for a place to live.\n\nAlso among the stray women masturbators, we had a few reluctant dominatrix types.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say they loved to whip people, but they put on the outfits and paraded around on stage.\n\nThey even seemed to feel bad when replaced by a younger model.\n\nCarlos of course, was hoping that the pleasures of the unknown would eventually wake his students up, and they\u2019d end their masturbation.\n\nBut he died too soon.\n\nAnd the masturbators scattered, telling anyone they met about the perversions of secret classes.\n\nA few outside voyeurs joined in, despite never having had any meaningful contact with Carlos.\n\nOne still has a book pending.\n\nNot edited", "edited": 1584905923.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fl7nmf0", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2: The Horrors of Apprentices&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Russia, children are occasionally abandoned to cages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds.  I don\u2019t expect they\u2019re stacked cages, like those in a kennel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even if they can still walk around in there, they grow up absolutely poverty stricken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019re under the care of someone else who is completely dysfunctional.

A bunch of egoists who want to see other worlds and teleport their physical body in order to grow their self importance about their greatness and power?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pure practice without a deep philosophy is doomed to be dead end and the impeccability of a warrior is, above all, a careful and strategic attitude to the expenditure of one&amp;#39;s energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will quote Don Juan as an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00abImpeccability, as I told you so many times, is not morality \u2014. It only seems to be morality. Impeccability simply is, the best use of our energy level. Naturally requires frugality, anticipation, simplicity, innosence and, above all things, requires the absence of the self-image. All this seems similar to the monastic life manual, but is not monastic life\u00bb&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWarriors fight self-importance as a matter of strategy, not principle,\u201d he replied. \u201cYour&lt;br/&gt;\n mistake is to understand what I say in terms of morality.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI see you as a highly moral man, don Juan,\u201d I insisted.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019ve noticed my impeccability, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cImpeccability, as well as getting rid of self-importance, is too vague a concept to be of any&lt;br/&gt;\n value to me,\u201d I remarked.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan choked with laughter, and I challenged him to explain impeccability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cImpeccability is nothing else but the proper use of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy statements have no inkling of morality. I\u2019ve saved energy and that makes me impeccable.

People would whisper behind my back, and I knew they were talking about that.\n\nIt resulted in a little herd of absolutely beautiful young women, who would follow me around, even to hotel rooms, to practice.\n\nAt the peak, I believe I had a little group of 6.\n\nThe men on the other hand reacted in different ways.\n\nPeople who were serious, like Ralph, would confess they only put in an hour or two a day, because of other obligations. But that they also went for long walks practicing silence.\n\nThe worst reaction, the one you guys need to understand, came from one of the Europeans.\n\n\u201cI practice 8 hours a day! And then I do my dreaming all night. So that must be 16 hours of practice.\u201d\n\nAfter inquiring, it turned out he was lucky to find his hands once a month.\n\nAnd his 8 hours of practice was being \u201can impeccable warrior\u201d.\n\nHe was satisfied with his practice time. Plus it made him stand taller and push his chest out.\n\nHe was so proud of being impeccable.\n\nFirst, why do we need to be an impeccable warrior?\n\nBecause it says so in all of the books? And that\u2019s how Carlos learned to be a sorcerer?\n\nIf that\u2019s what you think, you have to read deeper than that! Or at least, put 2 and 2 together.\n\nCarlos never learned by being an impeccable warrior.\n\nUnless don Juan never actually existed.\n\nHe learned because he had a team of sorcerers teaching him, in an altered state, which he promptly forgot about.\n\nBut he had that inside himself. His assemblage point could easily move, with much less effort than it takes for us.\n\nThe rest of the time, he was simply a big pain in the ass for don Juan.\n\nWhat would you do if you were stuck with a crazy, angry, needy student?\n\nI have some!  I know the answer!\n\nYou have to potty train them.\n\nYou have to hurt their feelings, and see if they attack, or back off.\n\nIt\u2019s risky business.\n\nDon Juan had a better method.  Puff him up.\n\nBuild up his ego.\n\nGive him something childish, but understandable.\n\nBe a good little boy for daddy!\n\nThat\u2019s all the warriors way really is.\n\nPotty training.  A sedative for the little sisters and the Genaros.\n\nAnyone who really wants to learn however, has to stop fantasizing and put in the time.\n\nThe hours a day.\n\nIf they can only afford one, then they still get a taste.\n\nA taste is enough to see the fallacy of the impeccable warrior nonsense.\n\nThere is NO WAY you can know what impeccability is, in regards to sorcery, until you have a measuring tool.\n\nThe measuring tool is sorcery abilities which you are trying to develop.\n\nNot talk. Talk is cheap. You can\u2019t chat with your buddies, and figure out what impeccability is.\n\nThe best way to understand the true warrior\u2019s way, is to be standing face to face with magic.\n\nRight in your face. Right there. It\u2019s impossible, but there it is.\n\nNow the learning begins.\n\nThe argument you got into with someone comes back to your mind, and the magic goes away.\n\nYou just learned the price of indulging.\n\nOr you remember that you cheated someone out of some money. It was a mistake, but in the end, you cheated him.\n\nYou just learned the need to pay back debts.\n\nOr you keep thinking about your troublesome brother who wants to borrow money. He\u2019s got wind of your sorcery practices, and is sort of blackmailing you, by threatening to trash your reputation in the family.\n\nYou just learned the need to erase personal history.\n\nLet me remind you.  In this example, you are face to face with something so wonderful, something even coming directly from the Nagual, that you are nearly in tears.\n\nIts\u2019 a true Spielberg moment, where a shiver goes up your spine.\n\nAll the hours of hard work have finally paid off 110%.\n\nBut then, you start to wonder what you\u2019re going to title this new chapter in your \u201cMy Wonderful Life\u201d book.\n\nGone. The magic is gone. It vanishes. And along with it, everything else you could see in darkness.\n\nYou just learned the reason for losing self importance.\n\nWhat need did you have for someone to make you memorize a list of those behaviors, before they actually made a difference?  The \"warrior\" behaviors.\n\nBeing obsessed with that, before you can actually do something, is madness!\n\nIt\u2019s complete madness!\n\nAnd someone will take advantage of you. They\u2019ll sell you something, knowing you have an ego problem.\n\nBut what about the people in the middle.\n\nThe sorcery nerds. Let\u2019s call them \u201cwizards\u201d.\n\nA wizard is a nerd sorcerer. A collector of knowledge.  Sort of humble, but he does get a kick out of success.\n\nHe\u2019s not running around in Europe, spouting Kant and comparing it to Journey to Ixtlan.\n\nAnd trying to get another B-station radio interview.\n\nHe\u2019s one of the good guys. There were quite a few of those in private classes.\n\nBut they all failed.\n\nWhy?\n\nFor the answer to that, we have to look at how the brain works.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a physical explanation, but at least it has some authorities behind it.\n\nSo maybe it\u2019ll seem more true when I back myself up with those guys.\n\nBut in fact, *intent* is the problem. We\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nSomewhere in the human brain is the \u201cempathy\u201d region.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to go and get the scientific details.  We have some people in here very knowledgeable about such things, maybe they know.\n\nBut it boils down to, there\u2019s a little man in your head.\n\nA tiny little guy!\n\nI know, because being autistic, I don't have one.  So I can't figure out the minor neurosis of the people around me, resulting in constant social mistakes.\n\nBut most people have that man. Unfortunately, he\u2019s a lab rat.\n\nIf we hear about new COVID19 symptoms, we bring him out for experiments.\n\nThe fever produces hallucinations? We set him in bed, ice pack on his head, thermometer in his mouth, and then we see how much he suffers while he\u2019s delirious and his relatives can\u2019t wake him up.\n\nWe make him a test subject, observe him (run him through our internal dialogue), and we decide how much of a threat that would be to us.\n\nFor me, not much.\n\nHallucinations? Bring them on!\n\nBut you get the point. We have mini bundles of emanations in our head. The kind that produce a little dreaming world.\n\nAnd *intent* will fill it in for us. ESPECIALLY if we are silent in darkness.\n\nThat little man becomes a king in our head, once we are silent. Half of your energy will go off into that little man, if you set him in motion while being silent.\n\nHis world becomes like Cholita\u2019s playing cards. Each one a playground.\n\nThat poor little man in your head gets subjected to everything we don\u2019t understand, so we can judge the threat.\n\nIf you hear of a friend who got a juicy me-too Castaneda book deal, that  guy ends up in a convertible driving down Madison square, with a ticker tape parade.\n\nConfetti falls on his head, and he has to brush it off. No big deal. You can live with that.\n\nScores of women run up to him at the end of the parade, because he\u2019s a real \u201cSorcerer\u201d.\n\nHuggy women?\n\nThat\u2019s ok too.\n\nThink I\u2019m exaggerating?\n\nNot at all. You\u2019ll find out if you put in the work. *Intent* is amazing.\n\nIt takes only a business card (Cholita\u2019s playing card #1), to produce an entire city.\n\nSo here\u2019s Mr. Wizard, our good guy from private classes, standing in darkness, faced with \"the Nagual\".\n\nHe\u2019s gotten over the idea of writing his own book.\n\nGot over it 20 years ago when he saw how ugly that looked, listening to Carlos name all the people \u201criding on his back\u201d.\n\nI recall Miguel, Ken, Armando, Marilyn, and some guy who \u201cactually claims he\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nIf I missed any me-too naguals I\u2019m sorry.  If I included one that was post Carlos, also sorry. But it\u2019s still ugly.\n\nThe latest ugliness in me-too naguals is the concept of \u201cnot being like the old sorcerers\u201d. After all, don Juan criticized them.\n\nSo they\u2019re good to bring up, for luring lazy people.\n\nIt\u2019s not to help them. It\u2019s more like date rape.\n\nIt\u2019s designed to brainwash them into giving up money, for what\u2019s essentially pointless but easy to do techniques supposed to purge your soul, and make you ready to be a sorcerer.\n\nWhen you figure out you were had, they\u2019ll come up with another. And another.\n\nScientology did that. After people became \u201cclear\u201d and realized it was shit, they added on higher levels.\n\nBut our Nerd Wizard isn\u2019t that na\u00efve. He\u2019s actually putting in work.\n\nBecause he\u2019s made progress, he isn\u2019t desperate to parade around being \u201cimpeccable\u201d. Or to argue with his friends over who has the \u201cbest understanding\u201d.\n\nHe realizes, that\u2019s useless.\n\nBut he\u2019s still screwed.\n\nOur basic operating system is filled with worms.\n\nIdeas, behaviors, tactics. We were raised by mad-men.\n\nBut still, magic is right there!  Somehow he overcame his shittiness, and succeeded a little.\n\nHe\u2019s just got to tell his friend!\n\nAfter all, they\u2019ve been debating this for years.\n\nHow\u2019s he going to explain it?\n\nAs he ponders that, the little man in his head materializes in a pleasant setting. He\u2019s standing up, waving his hands to show how big and bright \u201cthe Nagual\u201d was, when he saw it. His friend also materializes in this virtual world.\n\nSince our Wizard isn\u2019t a bad guy, his friend is merely taken back. He has to admit, as he rubs his chin, that he was wrong all along.\n\nThe little man in his head smiles with pride, and consoles his friend by promising to teach him to do it too.\n\nYour assemblage point is moved back to normal, because that world only exists at the normal position.\n\nWhat about the magic in front of the Wizard?\n\nLong gone. That left when he first wondered how to explain it.\n\nIn fact, he\u2019s been lost in his internal dialogue for 5 minutes now.\n\nThe most puzzling thing to me about all this, is not that I can\u2019t seem to explain this to most people. They all want attention, not results. They don\u2019t care about magic.\n\nWhat\u2019s puzzling is why the witches haven\u2019t rectified this problem.\n\nCarol Tiggs hinted: A new mood is coming.\n\nEdited once", "edited": 1585595472.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_flxjysz", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 4: Why the apprentices failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In private classes, people would occasionally ask each other how much time they put into practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I told them 4-6 hours each day, I always got weird looks.

Each one a playground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That poor little man in your head gets subjected to everything we don\u2019t understand, so we can judge the threat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you hear of a friend who got a juicy me-too Castaneda book deal, that  guy ends up in a convertible driving down Madison square, with a ticker tape parade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confetti falls on his head, and he has to brush it off. No big deal. You can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scores of women run up to him at the end of the parade, because he\u2019s a real \u201cSorcerer\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Huggy women?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s ok too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think I\u2019m exaggerating?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at all. You\u2019ll find out if you put in the work. &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes only a business card (Cholita\u2019s playing card #1), to produce an entire city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here\u2019s Mr. Wizard, our good guy from private classes, standing in darkness, faced with &amp;quot;the Nagual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s gotten over the idea of writing his own book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got over it 20 years ago when he saw how ugly that looked, listening to Carlos name all the people \u201criding on his back\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recall Miguel, Ken, Armando, Marilyn, and some guy who \u201cactually claims he\u2019s me!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I missed any me-too naguals I\u2019m sorry.  If I included one that was post Carlos, also sorry. But it\u2019s still ugly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The latest ugliness in me-too naguals is the concept of \u201cnot being like the old sorcerers\u201d. After all, don Juan criticized them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they\u2019re good to bring up, for luring lazy people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not to help them. It\u2019s more like date rape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s designed to brainwash them into giving up money, for what\u2019s essentially pointless but easy to do techniques supposed to purge your soul, and make you ready to be a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you figure out you were had, they\u2019ll come up with another. And another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scientology did that. After people became \u201cclear\u201d and realized it was shit, they added on higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But our Nerd Wizard isn\u2019t that na\u00efve. He\u2019s actually putting in work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because he\u2019s made progress, he isn\u2019t desperate to parade around being \u201cimpeccable\u201d. Or to argue with his friends over who has the \u201cbest understanding\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He realizes, that\u2019s useless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he\u2019s still screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our basic operating system is filled with worms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideas, behaviors, tactics. We were raised by mad-men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, magic is right there!  Somehow he overcame his shittiness, and succeeded a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s just got to tell his friend!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, they\u2019ve been debating this for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How\u2019s he going to explain it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he ponders that, the little man in his head materializes in a pleasant setting. He\u2019s standing up, waving his hands to show how big and bright \u201cthe Nagual\u201d was, when he saw it. His friend also materializes in this virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since our Wizard isn\u2019t a bad guy, his friend is merely taken back. He has to admit, as he rubs his chin, that he was wrong all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little man in his head smiles with pride, and consoles his friend by promising to teach him to do it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your assemblage point is moved back to normal, because that world only exists at the normal position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about the magic in front of the Wizard?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long gone. That left when he first wondered how to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, he\u2019s been lost in his internal dialogue for 5 minutes now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most puzzling thing to me about all this, is not that I can\u2019t seem to explain this to most people. They all want attention, not results. They don\u2019t care about magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s puzzling is why the witches haven\u2019t rectified this problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs hinted: A new mood is coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited once&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false,

It's a natural evolution from selling it, to the destruction of any actual power in a system.\n\nWe can see that happening right now with Carlos' materials.  \n\nIt boils down to this:  You have 2 groups selling the same stuff.

Just the interactions with endlessly needy individuals are enough to wipe out any progress you might make.\n\nSo the 2 groups selling stuff have to badmouth each other. \n\nThey don't work together, they don't share, and if they hear that the other guy is doing more than they are, instead of rejoicing, they condemn him.\n\nSince they're impotent, they start to turn it into a thing where you clear yourself out.

Based on being cooler than everyone else, if you succeed.\n\nOf course if you know any of them, they just become even more obnoxious.\n\nIf you combine the fighting between groups selling the same thing, with the diversion of people to something that has no effect, like perfecting and clearing yourself of \u201cbad things\u201d,  and add on a pinch of hero worship, which boosts self-flattery in the followers, you end up with the mess Buddhism is in now.\n\nI'm of the opinion lately that Carlos\u2019 material is doomed.  And it's the people who pretend to be interested who have doomed it.\n\nThe best we might do in here, in this subreddit,  is leave records of people who succeeded to an extent that makes it seem like Carlos wasn\u2019t making stuff up.\n\nAnd off into obscurity that will go, along with his books.\n\nBut at least it\u2019ll be a complete path, if anyone becomes so obsessed they want to follow it.\n\nI\u2019d rather we created 10 dreamers with super powers, but it seems to be too difficult to find time to practice.\n\n&gt; \"sweat blood\" that you must struggle, WORK?\n\nYes, and it\u2019s truly horrible how hard you have to fight to be silent.\n\nBut later you don't have to fight so hard.

Or a problem.\n\nThat way he can go running to his teacher, and get some attention.\n\nHe won\u2019t learn sorcery. His intent is on something else.

And interviews.\n\nWe\u2019re still plagued by their revenge.

They first read Carlos\u2019 books in their teens, but had no access.\n\nSo they studied yoga. Buddhism. Martial Arts. Chi gong. Crystals. \u201cBreak through\u201d power plant experiences. Primal scream therapy.\n\nThese are the \u201ceverything is good\u201d students. Can\u2019t we all just get along and respect each other's ideas? \n\nNo one thing is better than any other!\n\nYou\u2019d think they\u2019d have learned the opposite in their searching. They should have notice, none of it is working.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t care about results. Not really.\n\nThey are expert collectors of inventories. They believe they can learn faster by collecting more techniques, from as many places as possible.\n\nThat way, they have the \"secret advantage\" over the lesser students, who actually follow instructions.\n\nWhen they want \u201cresults\u201d, they remind themselves how clever they are by joining a chat room.\n\nCholita became one of them, after Carlos died.\n\nTheir thinking is sort of like this: If they want to get silent, and rather than simply doing that, because that would be really hard, they first activate their heart chakra.\n\nThen they let their kundalini rise just a bit, take in a huge perfect yoga breath, and exhale fiercely 3 times.\n\nThey invoke the Indian spirit of the sky, and try to enter into a great white fog (they imagine), in order to pass directly into silence.\n\nI have to say, I wish I could take one of those, provide them with everything they need to stay home, and let them go for that, for a decade or two. Then see what happened.\n\nIt might work!\n\nBut I\u2019ve never seen anyone succeed that way.\n\nThey also pick up very wrong ideas while running around.\n\nCastaneda's books echo around, and other systems borrow his terms.\n\nIn one system, the \"Internal Dialogue\" is only the part you don't like. \n\nShut that off. Keep the good stuff.\n\nThat's inner silence!\n\nBut it's not.  And picking up such ideas will deviate you all along the way.  You won't get there, because you won't be headed that direction anymore.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ve never met a person practicing meditation in a group, who reached enlightenment.\n\nI\u2019ve never met someone practicing energy techniques, who could do anything you can\u2019t simply explain away as their own vivid imagination plus ego.\n\nNo other technique I\u2019ve studied, has ever produced results in anyone I\u2019ve known, which are spectacular.\n\nYou can go to a Zen master, and tell him what it\u2019s possible to do.  And that in fact you\u2019ve done it. So you want to know why he doesn\u2019t include that in his lectures.\n\nHe\u2019ll deny it\u2019s real, and call you delusional.\n\nSo even \u201cmasters\u201d seem to have missed the boat, when it comes to sorcery.\n\nWhich is fine by them. That\u2019s not \u201cZen\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not their intent.\n\nThe intent of sorcery is a straight path. A very narrow one too.\n\nWe have a map.\n\nBut if you desire to do too much meandering along the path, you put yourself in peril of not reaching the goal.\n\nWhich is to stop the world.\n\nYou won\u2019t stop the world if you\u2019re fussy.

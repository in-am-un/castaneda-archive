Think of  spending a  lifetime  torn between those  two views, envying the  view  of  the  street  if  you're inside, and envying the  view  of  the  wall  if  you're  on the  outside, tired of  looking out.\" \n\nDon Juan's  metaphor  bothered me  no end, for  I  had taken it  all  in. Now, faced with the  possibility of  having to rent  a  room  in a  hotel  comparable  to the  Edward the  Seventh, I didn't  know  what  to say or  which way to go.\n\n\"What  do you want  me  to do there, don Juan?\"  I  asked.\n\n\"A  sorcerer  uses  a  place  like  that  to die,\"  he  said, looking at  me  with an unblinking stare. **\"You have  never  been alone  in your  life. This  is  the  time  to do it. You will  stay in that  room  until you die.\"**\n\nHis  request  scared me, but  at  the  same  time, it  made  me  laugh.\n\n\"Not  that  I'm  going  to  do  it,  don  Juan,\"  I  said,  \"but  what  would  be  the  criteria  to  know  that  I'm dead?-unless  you want  me  to actually die  physically.\" \n\n\"No,\"  he  said, \"I  don't  want  your  body to die  physically. I  want  your  person to die. The  two are  very different  affairs. In essence, your  person has  very little  to do with your  body. Your person is  your  mind, and believe  you me, your  mind is  not  yours.\"\n\n\"What  is  this  nonsense, don Juan, that  my mind is  not  mine?\"  I  heard myself  asking with a nervous  twang in my voice. \n\n\"I'll  tell  you about  that  subject  someday,\"  he  said, \"but  not  while  you're  cushioned by your friends.\"\n\n\"The  criteria  that  indicates  that  a  sorcerer  is  dead,\"  he  went  on, \"is  when it  makes  no difference  to him  whether  he  has  company or  whether  he  is  alone..\"\n\nPage 1358:\n\n\"...My projection into Rodrigo Cummings  was  so total  that  it  frightened me. I  was  exactly like him. The  similarity became  untenable  to me. In an act  of  what  I  considered to be  total, suicidal nihilism, I  rented a  room  in a  dilapidated hotel  in Hollywood.\n\nThe  carpets  were  green and had terrible  cigarette  burns  that  had obviously been snuffed out before  they turned into full-fledged fires. It  had green drapes  and drab green walls. The  blinking sign of  the  hotel  shone  all  night  through the  window.\n\nI  ended up doing exactly what  don Juan had requested, but  in a  roundabout  way. I  didn't  do it to fulfill  any of  don Juan's  requirements  or  with the  intention of  patching up our  differences. I  did stay in that  hotel  room  for  months  on end, until  my person, like  don Juan had proposed, died, until  it  truthfully made  no difference  to me  whether  I  had company or  I  was  alone.\n\nAfter  leaving the  hotel, I  went  to live  alone, closer  to school. I  continued my studies  of anthropology, which had never  been interrupted, and I  started a  very profitable  business  with a lady partner. Everything seemed perfectly in order  until  one  day when the  realization hit  me  like  a kick in the  head that  I  was  going to spend the  rest  of  my life  worrying about  my business, or worrying about  the  phantom  choice  between being an academic  or  a  businessman, or  worrying about  my partner's  foibles  and shenanigans. True  desperation pierced the  depths  of  my being. For the  first  time  in my life, despite  all  the  things  that  I  had done  and seen, I  had no way out. I  was completely lost. I  seriously began to toy with the  idea  of  the  most  pragmatic  and painless  way to end my days. \n\nOne  morning, a  loud and insistent  knocking woke  me  up. I  thought  it  was  the  landlady, and I was  sure  that  if  I  didn't  answer, she  would enter  with her  passkey. I  opened the  door, and there was  don Juan!  I  was  so surprised that  I  was  numb. I  stammered and stuttered, incapable  of  saying a  word. I  wanted to kiss  his  hand, to kneel  in front  of  him.\n\nDon Juan came  in and sat  down with great  ease  on the  edge  of  my bed.\n\n\"I  made  the  trip to Los  Angeles,\"  he  said, \"just  to see  you.\"\n\nI  wanted to take  him  to breakfast, but  he  said that  he  had other  things  to attend to, and that  he had only a  moment  to talk to me. I hurriedly told him  about  my experience  in the  hotel. His presence  had created such havoc  that  not  for  a  second did it  occur  to me  to ask him  how  he  had found out  where  I  lived. I  told don Juan how  intensely I  regretted having said what  I  had in Hermosillo.\n\n \"You don't  have  to apologize,\"  he  assured me. \"Every one  of  us  does  the  same  thing. Once, I ran away from  the  sorcerers'  world myself, and I  had to nearly die  to realize  my stupidity. The important  issue  is  to arrive  at  a  breaking point,  in whatever  way, and that's  exactly what  you have done.  Inner  silence  is  becoming real for  you.

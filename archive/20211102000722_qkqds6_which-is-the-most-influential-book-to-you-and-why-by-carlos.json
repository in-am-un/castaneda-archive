I added that I would even call such a sorcerer storyteller a patriot because he was unable to accept bitter defeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan laughed until he was choking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But it&amp;#39;s not a matter of one sorcerer storyteller,&amp;quot; he argued. &amp;quot;They all do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then it&amp;#39;s a socially sanctioned device to express the wishful thinking of a whole society,&amp;quot; I retorted. &amp;quot;A socially accepted way of releasing psychological stress collectively.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your argument is glib and convincing and reasonable,&amp;quot; he commented. &amp;quot;But because your spirit is dead, you can&amp;#39;t see the flaw in your argument.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He eyed me as if coaxing me to understand what he was saying. I had no comment, and anything I might have said would have made me sound peevish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The sorcerer storyteller who changes the ending of the &amp;#39;factual&amp;#39; account,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;does it at the direction and under the auspices [* auspices- kindly endorsement and guidance] of the spirit. Because he can manipulate his elusive connection with intent, he can actually change things. The sorcerer storyteller signals that he has intended it by taking off his hat, putting it on the ground, and turning it a full three hundred and sixty degrees counterclockwise. Under the auspices of the spirit, that simple act plunges him into the spirit itself. He has let his thought somersault into the inconceivable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan lifted his arm above his head and pointed for an instant to the sky above the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because his pure understanding is an advance runner probing that immensity out there,&amp;quot; don Juan went on, &amp;quot;the sorcerer storyteller knows without a shadow of doubt that somewhere, somehow, in that infinity, at this very moment the spirit has descended. Calixto Muni is victorious. He has delivered his people. His goal has transcended his person.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_qkqds6", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qkqds6/which_is_the_most_influential_book_to_you_and_why/hj0z01y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1635869626.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1635869626.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hj0bncr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "matejthetree", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hizqlqq", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_ar84z8e", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "this is on point.\n\ni am listening to audio books and as I am practicing silence it happens to me that I listen to the books but not really listening. gazing the sound could be a metaphor.\n\nnext thing I know AP shifts. not yet knowledgeable enough about the J curve but If i keep the silence, next thing I know I have vivid visions in my face in broad daylight. or night as well. else I get stuck in that floating feeling and my dialogue kicks in.\n\nreally felt the power that stories carry, beyond the reasoning. and the intention behind them.\n\nsometimes the symptom before is uneasy feeling in my body, muscles, bones, and if I ignore it it cracks the barrier.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hj0bncr", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;this is on point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i am listening to audio books and as I am practicing silence it happens to me that I listen to the books but not really listening. gazing the sound could be a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;next thing I know AP shifts. not yet knowledgeable enough about the J curve but If i keep the silence, next thing I know I have vivid visions in my face in broad daylight. or night as well. else I get stuck in that floating feeling and my dialogue kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;really felt the power that stories carry, beyond the reasoning. and the intention behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;sometimes the symptom before is uneasy feeling in my body, muscles, bones, and if I ignore it it cracks the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qkqds6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qkqds6/which_is_the_most_influential_book_to_you_and_why/hj0bncr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1635859627.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1635859627.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hizqlqq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hiz8i13", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Its no fun, but you'd do well to use driving time to force off the internal dialogue.\n\nThat's the key to all of it.

At beginner's levels, you won't run into anything other than those two.\n\nYou have to be into silent knowledge to notice the others.\n\nOr asleep...\n\nHere's some relevant quotes:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe other kind of energy I found present in our world but alien to it was the scouts' energy; the energy don Juan had called sizzling. I encountered scores of items in my dreams that, once I saw them, turned into blobs of energy that seemed to be frying; bubbling with some heatlike inner activity.\n\n\"Bear in mind that not every scout you are going to find belongs to the realm of inorganic beings,\" don Juan remarked. \"Every scout you have found so far, except for the blue scout, has been from that realm; but that was because the inorganic beings were catering to you. They were directing the show. Now you are on your own. Some of the scouts you will encounter are going to be, not from the inorganic beings' realm, but from other even more distant levels of awareness.\"\n\n\"Are the scouts aware of themselves?\" I asked.\n\n\"Most certainly,\" he replied.\n\n\"Then why don't they make contact with us when we are awake?\"\n\n\"They do. But our great misfortune is to have our consciousness so fully engaged that we don't have time to pay attention. In our sleep, however, the two-way-traffic trapdoor opens: We dream. And in our dreams, we make contact.\"\n\n\"Is there any way to tell whether the scouts are from a level besides the inorganic beings' world?\"\n\n\"The greater their sizzling, the farther they come from. It sounds simplistic, but you have to let your energy body tell you what is what. I assure you, it'll make very fine distinctions and unerring judgments when faced with alien energy.\"\n\nHe was right again. Without much ado, my energy body distinguished two general types of alien energy. The first was the scouts from the inorganic beings' realm. Their energy fizzled mildly. There was no sound to it, but it had all the overt appearance of effervescence, or of water that is starting to boil.\n\nThe energy of the second general type of scouts gave me the impression of considerably more power. Those scouts seemed to be just about to burn. They vibrated from within as if they were filled with pressurized gas.\n\nMy encounters with the alien energy were always fleeting because I paid total attention to what don Juan recommended. He said, \"Unless you know exactly what you are doing and what you want out of alien energy, you have to be content with a brief glance. Anything beyond a glance is as dangerous and as stupid as petting a rattlesnake.\"\n\n\"Why is it dangerous, don Juan?\" I asked.\n\n\"Scouts are always very aggressive and extremely daring,\" he said. \"They have to be that way in order to prevail in their explorations. Sustaining our dreaming attention on them is tantamount to soliciting their awareness to focus on us. Once they focus their attention on us, we are compelled to go with them. And that, of course, is the danger. We may end up in worlds beyond our energetic possibilities.\"\n\nDon Juan explained that there are many more types of scouts than the two I had classified, but that at my present level of energy I could only focus on three. He described the first two types as the easiest to spot. Their disguises in our dreams are so outlandish, he said, that they immediately attract our dreaming attention. He depicted the scouts of the third type as the most dangerous in terms of aggressiveness and power- and because they hide behind subtle disguises.\n\n\"One of the strangest things dreamers find, which you yourself will find presently,\" don Juan continued, \"is this third type of scout. So far, you have found samples of only the first two types, but that's because you haven't looked in the right place.\"\n\n\"And what is the right place, don Juan?\"\n\n\"You have again fallen prey to words; this time the culprit word is 'items', which you have taken to mean only things, objects. Well, the most ferocious scout hides behind people in our dreams. A formidable surprise was in store for me in my dreaming when I focused my gaze on the dream image of my mother. After I voiced my intent to see, she turned into a ferocious, frightening bubble of sizzling energy.\"\n\nDon Juan paused to let his statements sink in. I felt stupid for being disturbed at the possibility of finding a scout behind the dream image of my mother.\n\n\"It's annoying that they are always associated with the dream images of our parents or close friends,\" he went on. \"Perhaps that's why we often feel ill at ease when we dream of them.\" His grin gave me the impression that he was enjoying my turmoil. \"A rule of thumb for dreamers is to assume that the third type of scout is present whenever they feel perturbed by their parents or friends in a dream. Sound advice is to avoid those dream images. They are sheer poison.\"\n\n\"Where does the blue scout stand in relation to the other scouts?\" I asked.\n\n\"Blue energy doesn't sizzle,\" he replied. \"It is like ours; it wavers, but it is blue instead of white. Blue energy doesn't exist in a natural state in our world.\n\n\"And this brings us to something we've never talked about. What color were the scouts you've seen so far?\"\n\nUntil the moment he mentioned it, I had never thought about this. I told don Juan that the scouts I had seen were either pink or reddish. And he said that the deadly scouts of the third type were bright orange.\n\nI found out myself that the third type of scout is outright scary. Every time I found one of them, it was behind the dream images of my parents, especially of my mother. Seeing it always reminded me of the blob of energy that had attacked me in my first deliberate seeing dream. Every time I found it, the alien exploring energy actually seemed about to jump on me. My energy body used to react with horror even before I saw it.\n\nDuring our next discussion of dreaming, I queried don Juan about the total absence of inorganic beings in my dreaming practices.\n\n\"Why don't they show up anymore?\" I asked.\n\n\"They only show themselves at the beginning,\" he explained. \"After their scouts take us to their world, there is no necessity for the inorganic beings' projections. If we want to see the inorganic beings, a scout takes us there. For no one, and I mean no one, can journey by himself to their realm.\"\n\n\"Why is that so, don Juan?\"\n\n\"Their world is sealed. No one can enter or leave without the consent of the inorganic beings. The only thing you can do by yourself once you are inside is, of course, voice your intent to stay. To say it out loud means to set in motion currents of energy that are irreversible. In olden times, words were incredibly powerful. Now they are not. But in the inorganic beings' realm, words haven't lost their power.\"\n\nDon Juan laughed and said that he had no business saying anything about the inorganic beings' world because I really knew more about it than he and all his companions combined.\n\n\"There is one last issue related to that world that we haven't discussed,\" he said.\n\nHe paused for a long while, as if searching for the appropriate words.\n\n\"In the final analysis,\" he began, \"my aversion to the old sorcerers' activities is very personal. As a nagual, I detest what they did. They cowardly sought refuge in the inorganic beings' world. They argued that in a predatorial universe poised to rip us apart, the only possible haven for us is in that realm.\"\n\n\"Why did they believe that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because it's true,\" he said. \"Since the inorganic beings can't lie, the sales pitch of the dreaming emissary is all true. That world can give us shelter and prolong our awareness for nearly an eternity.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Types of Dark Room Visitors", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_n50ow0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1620168662.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all visitors in the darkroom are inorganic beings, or even phantoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think anyone should worry about it.

And you have absolutely no interest in learning it.  You&amp;#39;re interested in attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not unusual. The &amp;quot;tall tales&amp;quot; market is big, and people enjoy reading about spooky stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;spooky stuff&amp;quot; subreddit, or else it would cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And obsession with getting attention is fatal to sorcery. Just a hint of that in the mind, prevents magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, spooky stories exist on the basis of false information, and lack of sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your stories are full of false claims, given as if they were obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have that kind of audience in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See if there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;false narrative&amp;quot; subreddit.  That&amp;#39;s what you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(He&amp;#39;s private chatting me with more &amp;quot;cool spooky experience&amp;quot; stories, backed up by so called indian shaman experts on spirits.  Not sure that&amp;#39;s obvious here, but he&amp;#39;s long been obsessed with stuff he never takes the time to investigate. Just likes telling the stories.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_n50ow0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/n50ow0/types_of_dark_room_visitors/gx1er5e/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1620229848.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_n50ow0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_n50ow0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gx1ngyq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gx1lbf3", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "He writes bigfoot books!\n\nHow come you've been in here nearly a year, telling the same story?\n\nWhat do you want, for someone to agree with you?

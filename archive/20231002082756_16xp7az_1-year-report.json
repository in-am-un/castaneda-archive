Still  cracks me up though:)\n\n\\-come in super happy, with tail wagging showing my belly. just happy to find a place like this really.\n\n\\-Dan99 Helicopters in. Pai Mai Slapdown. Im a \"bad player\"\n\n\\-woops, didn't read Moby Dick novel of bad player definitions before i posted\n\n\\-Sorry Boss\n\n\\-Try to explain myself-but get the one year chill out.\n\n\\- weird dreams and more synchronous events after that. Like I was being scoped out in my dreams. many strange objects place before me.  with an old crone peering from the door. scrutinized closely by strange faces. in reality, a  one in a million object rolls through my front door the instant I open it and lands in front of computer right after I read Dan99 Pai Mai slap down! \n\n\\-aaaannnd here I am.\n\nHere is what happened next.\n\n SO this is a one year report from a beginner.  Dan99 was right about a few things, but not all.  I am Lazy.  My Dark room practice dwindled off. Because of lazyness, of course. But my work became much more physically and emotionally draining. And perhaps most significantly, \"Tonal\" rages back even harder it seems. One could say, its need to recap, and be right. But It feels like a tentacles from the river-of-shit that just pulls you in too. Actual events, petty tirants, energy vampires, whatever.  almost literally. Not just mental machinations of the self and its dialogue, but river-of-shit events that suck you back in. Any one else experience that?\n\n \\-Just kept watching, reading, and learning what I could. I'm appreciative of all the hard work that goes into the graphics and animations, links and resources.\n\n\\-I Just gathered silence  as if it were a very precious substance in and of it self, and find this metaphor useful.  Probably a Nanogram of silence. LOL\n\n\\-Of course, I Haven't make it very far at all on J-Curve. Yet\n\n\\-I have noticed one objective, measurable, statistically measurable manifestation of real world magic. totally unexpected.  when I have a lot of silence from dark room. I sink a ball on the break in pool. almost every single time.  When I noticed it, I would gather silence just before the break. As if I were deploying the silence I gathered, even with pool hall cacophony all around. and only when I have some fresh dark room does it happen. Of course, the rest of my pool game sucks as usual. \n\n\\-continue retooling lifestyle architecture to optimize time and energy levels for practice. study. \n\n\\-continue also to be lazy as fug and indulgent\n\n\\-fStart to feel head slip under shit river waves, yet again. But keep dog paddling. Barely.\n\n\\-Here is where it gets completely mind blowing, yet again.\n\n\\-Not seeking attention here like a bad player with what follows! I know only practice is what matters. Recap. Dark room until nose bleeds. Tensegrity. Husbanding every drop of your precious energy. But I have no one else to talk to. isn't there a beginners group?\n\n\\-I think the spirit speaks, sometimes softly, sometimes loudly. symbolically, through events, to each of us if we listen. The events themselves are the signifier, the signified is instantly apparent to the observer. If you have to think about it, don't bother.  An ally making a water cooler bubble is different I guess. But, I suspect, this is what is meant when the pot bubbles at Don Juans  exact moment. Or your considering a course of action and a fire alarm goes off at that moment. Or carl Yungs Moth...\n\n\\-6 weeks ago\n\nMy work requires travel.  Got to find a place to rent. fast. \n\n\\-Bam, very nice place. In-law apt.\n\n\\-Land lady is early late 60's, early/late 70'S? Hard to tell, she is vibrant, with a twinkle in her eye. \n\n\\-She's sick, so I start making medicinal Broths for her.( My current fascination actually. A weekly staple that I highly recommend. nutritional Broths and healing broths.)\n\n\\-I'm running on impulse power. Physically. mentally, energetically, I Need to regenerate. \n\n\\-She's like \"a friend of mine from Mexico is coming.  You will Like him. He is a scientist\"\n\n\\-I get a bunch of time off, right when he visits. as \"luck\" would have it.\n\n\\-he is here for a conference. He is a doctor in the biomedical field, in his 80's i think, with a thriving business. And has done years of biomedical research.\n\n\\- I meet him. \n\n\\-he quotes to me  a hippocrates quote that I had just sent a friend the night before \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9700edc2b05a073122ba4861df4180291a28cb24\n\n\\-then he says \"oh, i was probably in your dreams since I am sleeping right above you...\"\n\n\\-Mind Blown\n\n\\-We talk for 6 hours straight. Like it ws 10 minutes. But I avoided any dream talk. He told me about health and medicine. Totally mind blowing stuff. And he made a gift of medicines to me that are quite expensive.\n\n\\_He spoke with his hands constantly wrapping around is torso and umbilicus\n\n\\-He has many medicines that he provides to his friend, my landlady. Her skin is beautiful and she is lean, fit. after a deadly illness. Although she still tires easily as she is still recovering.\n\n\\-next day, his last day here (last week before this post) he greeted me with a gift, an expensive book on nutritional health.\n\n\\- I suspected this guy is on a certain waveleangth. I said to him \"I am humble and grateful to have learned from a Man of Knowledge.\"\n\n\\-he then instantly activated. His eyebrows raised. he said \" I have something to show you.\"\n\n\\-He showed me some energy work stuff. how to activate the pituitary, and how to raise healing energy to give to someone else. in less than ten minutes. \n\n\\-So, before anyone calls bullshit, that IS what happened. To me. Last week. I speak Truth. The week before the one year post date I put on my calendar. Don't even step up and say this shit didn't happen and that i'm making it up. Because I give Zero Fugs. Why would I come here with a story so fugging implausible that its just an invitation to be fugged with?  I got better things to do with my time.  I probably wont even post until next year after Dan99 hands me my ass again anyway.\n\n\\-Now. Either he is real deal, and Spirits knocking on my forehead telling me to quit fugging up and get to work. Or he is a buffoon, and the spirit is still knocking on my forehead telling me to quit fugging up and get to work.\n\n\\-I have been taking a suppliment he gave me. The effects are. Impressive...\n\n\\-His Energy work was... Impressive...\n\n\\-i am being deliberately vague about him, for obvious reasons.\n\n\\-So I hope this post helps someone who hit rock bottom.  Or anyone who was touched by death. Felt like the eagle passed them by. Too old. Too weak. Too stupid.  Just try. Get back up and try again. Remold. Reframe. Pivot. Take Time out. regenerate. go back. push again. Hack at your \"Self\" ruthlessly with a Machete.  Make a gesture to the Spirit.  Do the work. Just dont give up. Whatever you do. Don't Give up. \n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "1 Year Report", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3buthz9zrprb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "o": [{"y": 1969, "x": 2953, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;blur=40&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c691721fe06a064c43998b61d502a5ce549913"}], "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e2a7959b4b4014c269169d419301fc09740de27"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3df1d02b5cb75b04f01fba6fc85abf64cbf1cb45"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e25d5d7464b58f632fb03a744d928f5b84ede2bb"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dacf50733af0495a6aa0c2d34bcd92899a0612ca"}, {"y": 640, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698f13409bf3a55b20e87612e05ad5f51c4eb623"}, {"y": 720, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af3970072c396a11e7b23ca56f4962ceca3e6a1"}], "s": {"y": 1969, "x": 2953, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=2953&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c30287c391a608e8aad4aa64552fb5dab5b02e"}, "id": "3buthz9zrprb1"}, "j2abokby1qrb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "o": [{"y": 640, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;blur=40&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e4b517749f8686dd26d3aa5c38ce3de984149f"}], "p": [{"y": 57, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b3fff3f946287f0058fa498e1a4e07e5791f5a1"}, {"y": 115, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0886e803fb56d57298e3747d606b67452b1357"}, {"y": 170, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d87d01e1c2fe75ffd9af5fa8a9d36533348d9699"}, {"y": 341, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9ee447fb213bd2c872fb0641ac94d5f86777096"}, {"y": 512, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=778480b73a008da0a873ad6bd69b32881fa82c57"}, {"y": 576, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69826244044718e1c6fce6f1e4a56c435f523558"}], "s": {"y": 640, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/j2abokby1qrb1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9700edc2b05a073122ba4861df4180291a28cb24"}, "id": "j2abokby1qrb1"}}, "name": "t3_16xp7az", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_s61ee75d", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "spoiler", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1696228076.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GREETINGS GIGA BRUJOS and ShitRiver Rapid Rafting enthusiasts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=2953&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=13c30287c391a608e8aad4aa64552fb5dab5b02e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3buthz9zrprb1.jpg?width=2953&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=13c30287c391a608e8aad4aa64552fb5dab5b02e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back from one year time out. one year to... the..

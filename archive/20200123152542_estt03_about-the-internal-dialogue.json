I know that Renata Murez described at some point that there are other world where our other Selves are living other lives, with other memory, etc. I wonder if this is relevant or some phantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now just to complicate things, we have 2 assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we can have a dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t have to be focused on the same point. In fact, doing that is really hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This topic is the most confusing and underdescribed by Carlos and witches. In books, it was always told of a single assemblage point (well, apart from cryptic Zuleica&amp;#39;s descriptions), but later one Carlos mentioned two cocoons and two APs.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is mind boggling (maybe, not for the mind anyway), because in the model of sorcerers AP is a place where our awareness resides, assembling the world from emanations. But we (usually) have one awareness and one point of reference, how could it be? Is other AP &amp;quot;non functional&amp;quot; when we are awake and is activated instead of normal one in second attention? Or something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now listening to the Art of Dreaming audiobook, and there the talk is also about a single one... So, as I said, this concept is really hard to grasp how it all works.

How we could be hoping to move our AP and reach to other worlds if all our energy is consumed by this petty habit, flooding us with images, internal chat, worries, expectations..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I have noticed is that if you try to stop it during your usual day, the world instantly become clearer. You are getting this feeling of being here and now, on a bodily level! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is similar to wandering in a dream and suddenly finding your hands. Seems that due to our internal dialogue we are all just sleeping awake most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with the silence practice I am doing my best to fight it off. As &lt;a href=\"/u/danl999\"&gt;u/danl999&lt;/a&gt; has told, we don&amp;#39;t have a Nagual around the corner, so the fight has to be even harder. Because we have only ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/estt03/about_the_internal_dialogue/ffc2dds/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1579789808.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_estt03", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ffcu5qg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "KrazyTayl", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1579807321.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_estt03", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3i08j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "cool stuff as always!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ffcu5qg", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;cool stuff as always!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/estt03/about_the_internal_dialogue/ffcu5qg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1579807321.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_estt03", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

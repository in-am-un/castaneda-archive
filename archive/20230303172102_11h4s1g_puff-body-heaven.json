Real magic, not the pretending kind.\n\nLast night Cholita got restless, and hovered outside my practice room.

I wish I had a rule #3 to do also.  We don't yet have that one as far as I can recall.\n\nSo you're now gazing at the swirling purple puffs lured closer to your physical body in the middle of the egg.  In the space between your torso, and the luminous shell in which our awareness is encased.\n\nAnd your attention, once you get that perception, flows along the \"movement\" of the visible energy in the darkness.\n\nYour attention \"flows\".\n\nNaturally that means your tonal awareness, the kind we control consciously, leaves (at least in part) those \"pouches\" into which we stuff the purple puffs.\n\nInstead of having to stuff puffs in the pouches, the stuff inside the pouches comes out!\n\nAnd mixes with the purple puffs.\n\nThe result is your \"energy body\".\n\nBut not all energy bodies.\n\nJust the blue ball of energy form that don Juan preferred.\n\nYou can also manufacture a fully visible, fully working \"Iron Man Suit\".\n\nThat's why don Juan warned us what the \"new seers\" prefer.\n\nAlways warning us...  Don't have fun. Don't eat donuts. Be a good warrior!\n\nBut I like donuts.\n\nSo I do that from time to time.  Form an iron man suit out of energy.\n\nBut that REQUIRES silent knowledge.\n\nThe purple zone.\n\nIt's really cool.\n\nThe iron man suit has heads up displays all over, with 100 remote views all around you available on tiny little spots distributed around the curved interior.\n\nUnfortunately, that's far away from the deep red zone on the J curve.\n\nAnd a beginner's goal is the deep red zone, where you get past the trap of the green zone, which holds all other magic practitioners prisoner.  And that's where shapeshifting happens, allowing you to snub your nose at fake magic.\n\nSo you'll have to settle for what don Juan recommended at first.\n\nA crummy blue ball of boring energy.\n\nConsider what would have happened to our sorcery if the old seers had a big screen monitor 8000 years ago, with the Disney+ channel streaming on it.\n\nGod only knows what kind of sorcery we'd have these days if they watched the Marvel Comic series!\n\nLet's find out!\n\nHarry Potter anyone?\n\nI prefer Dr. Strange myself.\n\nBut if the old seers saw Star Wars, who would they want to copy????\n\nThe Jedi, or the Sith?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Puff Body Heaven", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Practical Magic"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"k8l7w2mszjla1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54d9cd97fdd1e3706b02812c5db57fa01aea7b30"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ea3f98f76e08a2070676cd1a0a6cd454356846"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=721cba414c7aed88350e8ba1f9bb59ba3b91f431"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1dbca2d699c57ac8dacfada91743744bf72b951"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=903bec986eb4ba3e65d8bbd8d5c2a99b9422e729"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cdc6f20973018236f2826c66ff115663906bbf1"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a9f66970bf174e3315436072ad46f575eddbbf8"}, "id": "k8l7w2mszjla1"}}, "name": "t3_11h4s1g", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Practical Magic", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EINH7JcqcAK716dw3G-3CI96z-g3u4Jqg6-KLBzLEdg.jpg", "edited": 1677862053.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1677860462.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7a9f66970bf174e3315436072ad46f575eddbbf8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/k8l7w2mszjla1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7a9f66970bf174e3315436072ad46f575eddbbf8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll have to develop very good second attention sight to do this yourself, but if you never give up it&amp;#39;ll happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sooner if you emphasize silence and tensegrity above &amp;quot;show business&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get rid of that showbiz mind!

When I started reading his books 15 years ago I felt that I couldn't read too much at once. I was in my New Age phase and consumed pretty much all there was to be found on the subject at the time. You read something and send it through you inner lie detector, a lot of the books were basic self-help drivel with a pinch of magic, some books had more substance, but all of them were easy to read. I felt envigorated reading them, my mind was enjoying every meal and I'd go through a book in one or two sittings. \n\nWith Castaneda's books it was very weird from the start: I have to visualize a movie from everything I read, and it was super hard with his books, despite them being structured like movie screenplays - basically scene description + ton of dialogue, should be easy, right? But every page was a struggle, very weird feeling, I knew there was something valuable there, but it was very difficult to mine it, it felt like hard labor lol All the images that had to be constucted from the descriptions were extremely energy-consuming, like a small graphics card that is maxed out rendering 3D animations and stuff. And it's never like that even with the screenplays that require pretty much the same amount visualization - a long screenplay I'd read in a couple of hours tops. But with Castaneda's books it would take me anywhere from a week (the first book) to several months to finish just one book. On top of mental energy that was being drained there was also another weird component that I cannot describe - something inside just didn't want me to read it and it felt like pain and fear combined, like something attached wires to your nerves and occasionally is pulling causing you discomfort and stops when you stop reading. When I'd even think of reading that pull would appear. I stopped at book 5 or 6? And I think I skipped some, because all I was looking for was dreaming parts.\n\nFast forward 15 years, late July, try to make it short, basically - I was somewhere with no wi-fi and I had limited data on the phone. I had to spend 2-3 days alone with no TV, no wi-fi and no other human around, I pulled my google drive and decided to read something - saw I had Castaneda's library saved there and I started reading book 8- no pulling, no negative feelings, no fear or pain, but I did feel exhausted all of a sudden and fell asleep in the middle of the day - which never happens, and I mean NEVER happened to me before, I don't take \"naps\". I woke up and finished the book, pretty much in two sittings. After that experience I had the best week feeling-wise I've had in years: everything was just going right, but I tried reading the next book at home - and it just doesn't go the same way. I think I need more recapitulation before I can proceed, but the negative pull and feeling of fear or something in the gut is gone.\n\nQUESTION: Does anyone have similar feeling about reading the books, in the beginning or otherwise? What could be the reason for such feelings in a person who likes reading, always read a lot (high school, college - a lot of reading that was NOT required by the curriculum).\n\nNote: I stopped reading the boooks, but I'd do recapitulation here and there throughout the years still.

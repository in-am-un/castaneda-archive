Move your assemblage point where shown!](https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=361235fc18e56ced4f8311c269e56698f9b8e5fb)\n\nThe Deep orange zone is a struggle to remember.\n\nI mean, to remember even for 30 seconds!\n\nI do best with Lily around, but when there's an IOB involved, you wonder if there isn't something else going on you don't know about.\n\nWhich can include  you being in 2 places at once, and you only remember the \"normal\" one.\n\nHappens all the time, when the assemblage point gets way out there.\n\nBut it's clearly where we have to go, if we want to duplicate that wonderful Recapitulation La Gorda  and Carlos did.\n\nWe should note, La Gorda was quite advanced, if not prone to misunderstanding things.\n\nAnd formless.\n\nI believe the \"human form\" will appear to us, in our darkroom situation, as being \"attitudes\" that still remain, even after you get silent.\n\nBecause out at the deep orange zone, you'll have lost a few.\n\nBut they're too abstract to describe.\n\nFor instance, a month or so ago I noticed when I was forcing my internal dialogue off as deeply as I could, there were \"2\" of them.\n\nThey both turned into sheets of paper.\n\nBut I could still work on deeper silence.\n\nI realized, one of the sheets of paper wasn't there yet.  Someone was holding it, and would rush in at any minute,  handing me that second paper.\n\nso while I was worrying about the second paper, I couldn't do as good of a job on the first, and thus my silence wasn't as deep as it really ought to be.\n\nAt some point a bit later, but it might have been days, I noticed I was no longer obsessed with someone \"correcting\" me using that second sheet of paper.\n\nI didn't care about it anymore.\n\nAnd I realize, it was some kind of deep rooted obsession. To be worried someone would rush in, and show that you've been wrong all along, because there is it, \"right there!\" on that other sheet of paper.\n\nThat wasn't the first thing I \"lost\" out of the process of trying to get silent.\n\nAt one point there was a set of 3 of something.\n\nI began to notice it, and the 3 reduced to 2, until one day I was forcing silence, and realized there was now only 1.  I was so surprised, I worried the other 2 would return, but a few days later I decided it must be part of the process, and I had in fact gotten rid of those.\n\nToo bad I have no idea what they were now.\n\nOur childhood obsession with thinking about everything, is undoubtedly an effort to keep up with everyone else, so you don't get cheated or taken advantage of.\n\nSo for it to be \"specific\" and have odd visual obsessions you can notice in the darkroom, is not surprising at all.\n\nPerhaps losing the human form, is losing all of those obsessions which only apply to someone who has a human body.\n\nAnd don't apply to someone who's shifted their assemblage point as far as it can go.\n\nWhich is our natural state. To move it all the way to the end if the situation calls for it.\n\nWe were after all, without a human form before we ran into the intent of this world, and got trapped.\n\nAs for blowing up Cholita, all I can do is report what I saw.\n\nIt would be the first time Cholita ever showed up in my darkroom, when she wasn't in the house already.\n\nCarlos went out of his way to make sure I overheard conversations about this topic.\n\nWith \"some people\" he explained, the double is \"right there!!!\"\n\nWhich gives a sorcerer access.\n\nThen he added, everyone's double is out there wandering in infinity,  but it's impossible to find it, even for a sorcerer.\n\nSo when it comes around to visit, a sorcerer can visually see that.\n\nFrom experience, Cholita's double is fully visible in the green zone.\n\nBut someone in the blue, would likely not see it.\n\nDid Cholita actually visit?\n\nMy intuition says, her phantom copy of the house got extended to where she wanted to go live.\n\nA good 40 miles at least.\n\nThen when she moved out, it began to collapse.\n\nApparently Cholita held it in place, with the help of minx.\n\nAs it was collapsing, Minx complained continuously, all night long.\n\nIt got more and more pathetic sounding.\n\nUntil, one day I smelled Cholita's scent in the house.  And some of her mail was gone.\n\nMinx stopped complaining shortly after that.  \n\nCholita came to visit 2 more times, but only a faint smell was observable.\n\nAnd an object or two got moved.\n\nShe didn't touch the cash I left her, until the last time.  And she took just a fraction of it, scattering the rest on the table.\n\nSo my guess is, Cholita was sleeping wherever she's sleeping now.\n\nI \"blew up\" some remnants of her phantom copy of the house.  \n\nShe didn't actually visit.\n\nBut who knows?\n\nIt's very weird out at the end of the J curve.\n\nThat's wh4ere Carlos was when we read stories about him and La Gorda doing shared recap scenes.\n\nHe'd have to have been.  Unless there's a way to \"cheat\" and do what you see in that picture, before your assemblage point gets that far.\n\nOnce it does go there, it's automatic.\n\nYou can generate anything just by \"knowing\" it.\n\nI experimented with that.  And included it in that picture.\n\nI saw what looked like a tiny shadow of a man, so I grabbed it with my gaze, and shoved it into a new dream, which I manufactured to the right of it.\n\nIt worked, but it was very hard to get it to focus.\n\nFocus requires energy.  Dreaming energy.\n\nDoing only, not so much.\n\nBut doing without energy, isn't very satisfying.\n\nSo if you work hard and get weird stuff to happen, but the puff balls and floating dreams are very dim, don't fret.\n\nRemind yourself, you have very vivid dreams, often.\n\nThey're so vivid, if you get lucid you can't even be sure you are dreaming.\n\nThat's the double.\n\nHe can replace the low energy level.\n\nSo just keep at it!\n\nAnd, don't forget about sunlight glitter, and \"impeccability\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Intent Bombs in the Deep Orange Zone", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"dj8wums96e581": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f08335401992beaad1fff9f1536fc8d150cbdbb1"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb338ae63b5b6ff938887a6b9a31627c1a91bf06"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9e416b3a8863fed3efedbca8f1816730a394d38"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6301737dea9e2eb442e75c4783806baa58320568"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e44dc8a9367e2adc485dbba53120897fc4426185"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf4c536fc14d75e2faa3347a2c029166f316c25c"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=361235fc18e56ced4f8311c269e56698f9b8e5fb"}, "id": "dj8wums96e581"}}, "name": "t3_rfsmoc", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9NYRI2SOxem0rAMXiYsicQadNDq6s_YqGwEZt0q6TZU.jpg", "edited": 1639441183.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1639436146.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dj8wums96e581.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=361235fc18e56ced4f8311c269e56698f9b8e5fb\"&gt;Yes, that&amp;#39;s exactly as it happened.

Cholita has \"played dead\" for me in her double a few times.\n\nOne time, she had a picture on her cellphone, of how she posed dead the night before, and showed it to me, out of the blue.\n\nLike a surprise.  Nothing was going on, she held up the phone and said, \"Look!!!\"\n\nIt was a pic of what she did the night before.  Exactly the same, except it was something she'd found on the internet before duplicating it in her double.\n\nIt gets very weird off in the deep orange zone.  Carlos probably never spoke about it.  At least I can't remember it, unless it was a conversation he was  having with one of  the witches, and I merely overheard it.\n\nThe closest we got was the story about Genaro flying around the trees in a weird costume.\n\nAnd don Juan called that \"the Nagual\".\n\nPossibly it's like a continuum out there.\n\nFrom rational enough to relate in a story, to far too irrational to even mention because it will drive new people off.\n\nAnd even from too irrational, to impossible to even find a single word to describe it.\n\nAt least you can talk about the irrational. But you can't talk about the abstract.  Although Fancy has disagreed with me on that point a few times.  She says it's laziness that prevents talking about it.  Like someone with a hangover, saying they can't speak right now.\n\nThey can.  It just hurts.\n\nIn the case of Cholita sleeping in another \"layer\" of reality, it seems borderline too weird to be true.\n\nBut the fact is, everything out there is \"real\".\n\nWhether you can repeat it, is what makes it worth mentioning.\n\nThat intent bomb technique works.  I've done it 6 times so far.\n\nI know I can do it tonight.\n\nNot to mention, Carlos showed it to us.\n\nAs a technique, it's sort of \"important\".\n\nIt requires at the very least, deep red zone or you can't even form the puff the way Carlos showed it.\n\nSo it rules out pretending.\n\nThen, it produces a horizontal shift of the assemblage point, when you expect to see the puff compress.\n\nPuffs don't manipulate with your hands, until you get some kind of horizontal shift.\n\nScooping is one thing. You turn the head to do that.  It's non-directional.\n\nBut \"squishing\" can't be done by turning the head.  It's directional.\n\nThen, you expect something to happen as a result of \"using\" the puff.\n\nSo you are **intending**.\n\nWhile squishing it.\n\nIntent gets \"stored\" in the puff.  That's actually a deep mystery.\n\nOne could examine the puff closely, to see if you can perceive the fact that it's stored intent, more than the surrounding puffs.\n\nIt IS perceivable! I usually do a \"puff biopsy\" before I toss it.\n\nIt's got intent in it!\n\nIt has \"details\" and \"extensions\" of sorts (the lines).\n\nBut next, you do even more.\n\nYou release one hand, either from the puff having been super compressed, in which case you expect a manifestation.\n\nOr you don't compress it on the last movement, and instead gently bring it to the back, so you can toss it at a wall.\n\nYou have now \"intended\" a wall for it to smash into.\n\nAnd you'll see it!\n\nAt that point, you have shifted far enough horizontally that there's probably no way you won't see a wall to toss it at.\n\nEven better, the wall isn't even on  your mind.  You just take it for granted.\n\nSo it's a PERFECT wall.  Not vague at all. It's simply a wall right there but you aren't \"interfering\" with it, because that's not what you are expecting. You're worrying about whether the ball will explode on the wall.  The wall is just a \"side issue\".\n\nTaken for granted. So you get a valuable less on the second attention just by expecting a wall with no \"book deal mind\" to interefere.\n\nThen if you expect an explosion, you have compressed intent into an object, and now expect to see the intent visually released into the room.\n\nIt is in fact, Man of Knowledge style magic.  A ritual.\n\nIt's a series of procedures designed to invoke the correct intent.\n\nIt possibly takes you from the realm of needing \"*intent* gifts\", into the kind of *intending* that the Men of Knowledge had to do.\n\nIt's a lesson in how to do practical magic.\n\nRepeatable magic needs to have a  series of steps perhaps, in order to pick up the *intent* gift trail, so you don't need the gift anymore and can do it on demand.\n\nIf you were to train people in \"practical magic\" this would be a good technique to have on the list.\n\nLily's leaping across the universe is another one.  It has \"steps\", so that it's sustained intending.  If any one \"step\" works, you have full confidence all the rest will.\n\nBut if the first one or two don't work, you still have more steps to succeed.  You'll just figure, the first steps were a warmup.\n\nAnd Lily's star jumping technique repeats, probably because we know the \"doing\" of looking up at the stars.\n\nOnce you pick a star you can zoom in, possibly because stars are inorganic beings. There's awareness to pull on you.\n\nWhen you get good at Lily's technique and the ceiling in your room takes on a deep blue color and some stars become visible and are intense, it gives you goosebumps.\n\nThey aren't \"dreamy\" like other darkroom manifestations.\n\nIt's a clear, stable, absolutely real looking star.", "edited": 1639689321.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hotw929", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was killed in the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; bomb blast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is not unusual.

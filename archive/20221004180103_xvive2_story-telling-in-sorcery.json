So I can eventually make full animations of what Tensegrity passes can really do, when magic starts to happen.  To explain \"intent\" in a form that's very clear.\n\nBut it's an interesting observation, because it's an important topic in sorcery. Storytelling.\n\nOur reality is merely a story in our mind. I don't mean to imply you can ignore physical matter. That's in another band of the emanations, not in man's band of awareness.\n\nWe hijacked an organic body and are now halfway trapped in it.  Our double being the half that isn't trapped.\n\nYou can't manipulate that organic part as freely as you'd like. Somewhat, and to what extent we don't really know yet. \n\nYou can \"shrink the tonal\". So the airline ticket office story, likely from \"Tales of Power\", gives a good account of what's possible when Carlos is shoved by Don Juan into last week on sunday. \n\nBut doesn't realize it's not the day of the week he believed it was.\n\nFrom there he \"walks\" back to normal reality, with no awareness anything odd has happened. It's only when he returns to the coin dealer stands the next day to ask if they remember him,  that he finds out they weren't selling coins that day.\n\nThe same will happen to you, when you break the laws of physics doing darkroom and leave the sealed room to travel into another reality. There's NO INDICATION, you didn't just walk in there, fully awake, eyes open, completely sober.\n\nIf you all can stop pretending, you can see some really cool magic!!!  Why on earth do you keep up with the tedious pretending of your sorcery path when the real thing actually works as described?\n\nBut there's the problem. \"Pretending\" is a persistent form of storytelling, which creates delusional belief when done repeatedly. \n\nAs Carlos warned us in private classes.\n\nIn fact, your \"internal dialogue\" is one of those tedious stories which never ends.  And you're drowning in it this very moment!\n\nIf you've ever entertained a small child, when you don't have any of your own and it's been a long time since you were around them, you'll notice that if you \"get silly\" and propose crazy things, they laugh and insist you have to repeat it again. They're delighted by the absurd, but \"perhaps possible\" anyway.\n\nTalking to them seriously doesn't appeal as much to them, as \"storytelling\".\n\nIt's possibly why some like don Genaro so much more than the other characters from the books. He was a storyteller supreme.\n\nA well integrated story invokes images in the mind, giving a slightly new view of reality.  It artificially moves the assemblage point and even modifies our tedious internal dialogue a bit.\n\nOne child I had contact with last month is a 4 year old chinese girl, a member of a traditional strict chinese family.\n\nNo sweets, no toys, and most of the time no fun is allowed.\n\nSo she runs to me when she comes to visit her grandfather's business, and plots with me to go get her toys up the street at the amazing place she's discovered.\n\nShe got all excited one day, and insisted we had to find it on the computer. I was puzzled, so I looked to see where this shopping paradise was located.\n\nIt's actually just a Target store, the most common department store out here in the west.\n\nBut her uncle brought her there to get some clothes, and she got a look at the toy section.\n\nShe'd never seen such a thing.\n\nSo we conspired to get her some Disney princess dolls. I could order on the web page, and 2 hours later plus a 10 minute drive, and she had the goods.\n\nWhile talking about the toys, I made a joke about Chinese parents.\n\nBut she only understood it to be a joke about her situation. So it wasn't going to \"westernize\" her too much, to hear me making fun of the idea that children shouldn't have toys.\n\nI shouted, \"Toys???!!! Children can't have toys!!! If they had toys, they'd want to drive cars. And children driving cars is CRAZY!!! People could get killed!\"\n\nShe began to laugh and said, \"You crazy...\"\n\nShe's only had a couple of weeks to pick up english, but is doing amazingly well. Children learn around 5 times faster, due to an average of 10,000 connections per neuron, as compared to old people's 2000 left functional.\n\nThen she insisted I repeat the silly imitation of strict parents over and over.\n\nI even added in an imitation of how strict chinese parents conduct their body movements with restrictive \"dignified\" postures.\n\nWhat she liked about it, was the storytelling.\n\nStorytelling about new views of reality.\n\nNow by the time you're an adult, you'd only find that display of loud pantomime annoying.\n\nWe've all run into the \"class clown\" who overdoes that even with adults, to get attention. That's his trick. Mimicking others through storytelling, to make fun of everyone. He's really \"pissing on everyone\" in the river of shit.\n\nBut for children, it's pure gold. A new view of the world, summed up in imaginary events.\n\nLike \"sorcery theater\" for 4 year olds.\n\nI believe there's something to that, which we could understand and make use of in order to help others learn sorcery faster.\n\nDoing animation tutorials just now, the teacher who got stuck doing all the videos for Character Creator software, cut loose at the end of one.\n\nHe started commenting that the 3D character we were editing using a specific selection menu, was obviously poor because she had no shoes.\n\nSo we ought to give her some cool new tennis shoes.\n\nThen he suggested she might love to wear multi colored socks in her peasant neighborhood, to get all the attention.\n\nHe began to tell stories instead of just saying, \"Here's how to add shoes, here's some socks and notice how they automatically load under the shoes as they are supposed to.\n\nI remembered a favorite art teacher in my high school who did that. He didn't just blankly repeat material in a monotone voice like the dry guy from \"Ferris Bueler's Day Off\" saying, \"Bueler? Bueler? Bueler?\"\n\nThat guy became a famous business analyst after a few movies. People liked his \"storytelling\" using his monotone voice to suggest a very boring teacher type.\n\nHe was the opposite of a storyteller, when teaching. But even that told a story people liked, so he got rewarded in media as an investment and money expert.\n\nThe question is, why is storytelling so amusing to 4 year olds that they want to hear the same silly story again and again?\n\nIt brings them actual pleasure! \n\nMy theory is that if fills in missing neural net connections, but that's another \"story\".\n\nIf you have a very small child, you'll realize they only want the same book over and over at bedtime, until they finally get tired of it 20 times later.\n\nEven as adults, we can watch reruns perhaps 3 times and still enjoy it, but beyond that it's boring.\n\nEven Star Wars is really only good 4 times before it's just too much.\n\nAs teenagers we still liked the storytelling almost as much as the 4 year olds.\n\nBut it had to be unique and clever. And so we admired the art teacher who could improvise and always come up with funny ways to look at things while teaching, not needing to repeat the same material.\n\nAnd sorcerers are storytellers.\n\nEach private class with Carlos included at least one small story, during the 15 minute lecture period before learning new tensegrity moves.\n\nI hope someday to recover those lectures using sorcery \"re-runs\" of the past, and animate them.  Re-runs of any human event in history are available in Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt's just that finding a specific one is next to impossible.\n\nCarlos often told \"dirty\" stories by the way.\n\nThere's a lot more to storytelling, than we've realized!\n\nIn fact, we got hooked by stories. Carlos even admitted it in class.\n\nHe said something close to, \"I wrote the books to hook you. You're hooked. Now stop reading them.\"\n\nCarol Tiggs even got tired of the \"sorcery book experts\" at the Sochi workshop, and announced she would take no such questions from the audience.\n\nWhatever was useful in the books to help us want to learn sorcery, became a problem when we continued like a 4 year old, wanting to repeat the same story over and over again.\n\nIt's why most \"inventory warriors\" eventually have to be tossed out of the castaneda subreddit.\n\nThey become pests, not interested at all in learning real magic.\n\nThey're only interested in going over \"the warrior's way\", and all the rules about types of gazing, or rules for warriors to remember about how teapots gurgle to agree with you.\n\nBy the way, that was little smoke.  The moth on the book covers.\n\nNot \"the world around you\".   Zombie followers of the evil Tata Kachora have a problem realizing that, because they're \"first 4 books\" addicts.  so the knowledge that's just what inorganic beings do, is outside their inventory.\n\nBut in fact, Carlos demonstrated her doing that in class, using the water cooler.  And when he introduced us to his allies formally by having them \"swoop\", like the moth did at the campfire, I ended up having Little Smoke do the same in my home.  Cholita could even command her to move small objects just by looking at them.  On demand!\n\nThe laws of physics are no barrier to real sorcery.  Only to \"inventory experts\".\n\nNone of their vast knowledge of the books of Carlos produced any magic in anyone in all the 50 years since people read his books. \n\nIn fact, that obsession with memorizing facts and collecting inventory lead to the inevitable demise of the teachings.\n\nWhich now have a chance to survive because real explanations of how to make the books work, float to the top on google.   \n\nThrough the hard efforts of the mods on the castaneda subreddit who have deliberately targeted Google as best they can.  \n\nTo overwrite the twisted biased reporting of Robert Marshall, another bad guy attacking our community to  seek fame by riding on the back of Carlos.\n\nWho gets blindly repeated in lazy magazine articles on Carlos.\n\nInstead of \"Carlos was thoroughly debunked\", you now see stuff like, \"How to assemble another world on your bedroom wall\". \n\nBecause those have pictures! Google loves pictures.\n\nBut the inventory experts would rather Carlos was \"debunked\", so they could use their fake knowledge to steal from new people who didn't believe the enemies of Carlos on google.  And go looking for a teacher.\n\nThese bad men are precisely like date rapists!  All the Miguels, Kens, Victors, Roberts, Luhans,  Sergios, Kachoras, and too many more to count.  \n\nAll stealing from naive beginners, using \"inventory items\"  from the books to trick them.\n\nThe ones that aren't simply thieves, the \"inventory warriors\" who only like to confuse people on social media and misrepresent ordinary dreams as being magic, are like a stubborn 4 year old who throws a tantrum if you don't keep repeating the same old story over and over again.\n\nI got lucky and Carlos told me to stop reading the books of \"Carlos Castaneda\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Heed the possible

But even that told a story people liked, so he got rewarded in media as an investment and money expert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question is, why is storytelling so amusing to 4 year olds that they want to hear the same silly story again and again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It brings them actual pleasure! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory is that if fills in missing neural net connections, but that&amp;#39;s another &amp;quot;story&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a very small child, you&amp;#39;ll realize they only want the same book over and over at bedtime, until they finally get tired of it 20 times later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even as adults, we can watch reruns perhaps 3 times and still enjoy it, but beyond that it&amp;#39;s boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Star Wars is really only good 4 times before it&amp;#39;s just too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As teenagers we still liked the storytelling almost as much as the 4 year olds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it had to be unique and clever. And so we admired the art teacher who could improvise and always come up with funny ways to look at things while teaching, not needing to repeat the same material.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sorcerers are storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each private class with Carlos included at least one small story, during the 15 minute lecture period before learning new tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope someday to recover those lectures using sorcery &amp;quot;re-runs&amp;quot; of the past, and animate them.  Re-runs of any human event in history are available in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that finding a specific one is next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos often told &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot; stories by the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot more to storytelling, than we&amp;#39;ve realized!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, we got hooked by stories. Carlos even admitted it in class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said something close to, &amp;quot;I wrote the books to hook you. You&amp;#39;re hooked. Now stop reading them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs even got tired of the &amp;quot;sorcery book experts&amp;quot; at the Sochi workshop, and announced she would take no such questions from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever was useful in the books to help us want to learn sorcery, became a problem when we continued like a 4 year old, wanting to repeat the same story over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why most &amp;quot;inventory warriors&amp;quot; eventually have to be tossed out of the castaneda subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They become pests, not interested at all in learning real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re only interested in going over &amp;quot;the warrior&amp;#39;s way&amp;quot;, and all the rules about types of gazing, or rules for warriors to remember about how teapots gurgle to agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, that was little smoke.  The moth on the book covers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not &amp;quot;the world around you&amp;quot;.   Zombie followers of the evil Tata Kachora have a problem realizing that, because they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;first 4 books&amp;quot; addicts.  so the knowledge that&amp;#39;s just what inorganic beings do, is outside their inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, Carlos demonstrated her doing that in class, using the water cooler.  And when he introduced us to his allies formally by having them &amp;quot;swoop&amp;quot;, like the moth did at the campfire, I ended up having Little Smoke do the same in my home.  Cholita could even command her to move small objects just by looking at them.  On demand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The laws of physics are no barrier to real sorcery.  Only to &amp;quot;inventory experts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of their vast knowledge of the books of Carlos produced any magic in anyone in all the 50 years since people read his books. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, that obsession with memorizing facts and collecting inventory lead to the inevitable demise of the teachings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which now have a chance to survive because real explanations of how to make the books work, float to the top on google.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through the hard efforts of the mods on the castaneda subreddit who have deliberately targeted Google as best they can.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To overwrite the twisted biased reporting of Robert Marshall, another bad guy attacking our community to  seek fame by riding on the back of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who gets blindly repeated in lazy magazine articles on Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of &amp;quot;Carlos was thoroughly debunked&amp;quot;, you now see stuff like, &amp;quot;How to assemble another world on your bedroom wall&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because those have pictures! Google loves pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the inventory experts would rather Carlos was &amp;quot;debunked&amp;quot;, so they could use their fake knowledge to steal from new people who didn&amp;#39;t believe the enemies of Carlos on google.  And go looking for a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These bad men are precisely like date rapists!  All the Miguels, Kens, Victors, Roberts, Luhans,  Sergios, Kachoras, and too many more to count.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All stealing from naive beginners, using &amp;quot;inventory items&amp;quot;  from the books to trick them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ones that aren&amp;#39;t simply thieves, the &amp;quot;inventory warriors&amp;quot; who only like to confuse people on social media and misrepresent ordinary dreams as being magic, are like a stubborn 4 year old who throws a tantrum if you don&amp;#39;t keep repeating the same old story over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got lucky and Carlos told me to stop reading the books of &amp;quot;Carlos Castaneda&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/54kawnkextr91.jpg?width=960&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a0e68601a3dd27171b983c5ab95212f5e5cbe50c\"&gt;Heed the possible words of Soledad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "xvive2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 20, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xvive2/story_telling_in_sorcery/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/xvive2/story_telling_in_sorcery/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1664899263.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ir1ofed", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1664906861.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_xvive2", "score": 14, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Someone in chat (and likey whoever is down voting this post), didn't like the idea that \"the warrior's way\" was a total load of crap.\n\nMy point of view.\n\nOk, look... \n\nIt's completely true!\n\nBut what are you going to do, run around repeating \"I'm an impeccable warrior!\"\n\nWhat the heck will that get you?\n\nYou might as well become a Tata Kachora zombie, believe he's \"the real don Juan\", and mindlessly walk down the middle of the 405 freeway headed to Dance Home in LA, during high freeway speeds periods, saying \"I have a benefactor...\"\n\nThe oncoming traffic doesn't care if you fell for the old \"benefactor up the butt\" trick.\n\nWe lost a few to that first 4 books delusion.\n\nSo the \"warrior's way\", by itself, will get you nothing.

When I tried to sneak by and go into my room so I could lock it, she tossed the door open violently, insulted me, and then slammed the door hard. Twice.\n\nI couldn't help notice, her hair was down to her below her shoulder blades.  And she'd brushed it to the side so that it looked like the dark wings of a crow, spread out to be menacing so it can shout at another crow.\n\nI have no idea why.\n\nIt's easier to explain magic, than witches.\n\nBy the way.  Darkroom doesn't teach \"skimming\" very well.\n\nUntil you get to the whitish light.\n\nThe whitish light is all about skimming.\n\nThink pile of hay.\n\nA giant pile of hay is in front of you.\n\nIt's the world.\n\nWhen you can see the whitish light, you now have \"Hay X-Ray Vision\".\n\nYou can glance at the top layer to see if it's going to form what you want.\n\nIf not, you increase the \"depth\" and try again.\n\nIf you still aren't getting what you want after a while, give it a good kick!\n\nOr a punch.\n\n(See Tensegrity)\n\nMy favorite way to bring out the emanations behind the whitish light, is the \"teasing the web\" movement.\n\nOr maybe it has a different name.\n\nYou lift the hands, make claws, and wiggle your fingers all over the air in front of you, looking for emanations.\n\nCholita doesn't wiggle.

It is after all, *seeing*.  And we know don Juan could find out things he shouldn't have known, using seeing.\n\nWell...  There's how.  You just want to know something, forget about it, and then a movie plays later on, showing you what you wanted to know.\n\nThere's an intent delay, during which you better not wonder about something else or you'll disturb the answer.\n\nLily seemed to be teaching me how to skim emanations last night, but was too stubborn to take a form I could fully identify as her.\n\nI tried to coax her into catching on fire, and she taunted me with it.

Hoping I suppose, to either lie to get attention and get away with it because the lie is about something supposedly so advanced no one can contradict them (the trick used in fake asian magical systems such as Buddhism), or maybe they'll twist something else they actually experienced once to make it seem like this, the way those who are damaged by using too many drugs tend to do.\n\nThey can \"see\" all sorts of stuff, because their assemblage point positions were abused by drugs.  They have assemblage point PTSD.\n\nAPPTSD?\n\nIt's a condition where they see all sorts of odd things, which we used to call \"flashbacks\", but then they contort it to pretend it's success on the path of sorcery.\n\nBecause let's face it. They're looser drug users. And need something in their life to make them feel special.\n\nI'm not talking about people who experiment out of curiosity.\n\nI'm talking about men such as some in Brazilian \"Nagual\" cults who spent the last 20 years using drugs to pretend to be doing sorcery.  Shelling out money to some evil con artist who flatters them up to keep them coming back.\n\nThose are the type with APPTSD.  Who now have erratic shifts of the assemblage point sideways,  even up at the blue line on the J curve.\n\nAfterall, it's what they were pursuing for decades.  To use drugs, to transform their blue line reality.  They have no interest in escaping it.  That's where their attention seeking lies. In the river of shit of the blue line reality.\n\nSo they've been going to con artist Ayahuasca ceremonies with supposed \"shamans\", and pretending it's all very uplifting and enlightening.\n\nBut it's just drugs...\n\nOddly, if you practice the real thing at relatively advanced levels you can end up in the same boat.\n\nDazzled by actual immersive experiences.\n\nIf you consider it, what's the ultimate drug trip?\n\nIt's a FULLY immersive one.  Not just some rainbow trails on your hand, when you wave it in the air.\n\nWhat's the most motivation for all of us, is a mini-vacation from reality.  Like that ChatGPT simulated trip to Toontown from \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", in the picture of this post.\n\nNow that's a cool mushroom trip! I didn't request it, but even the AI knew there had to be shrooms involved with that sort of craziness.\n\nUnfortunately too much of that damages the movement of the assemblage point by burning memories in horizontally shifted positions, which can return to produce hypnagogia if you try to practice sorcery.  Obscuring the view of your energy body returning to you, and making it impossible to move your assemblage point to the other side where \"seeing\" is possible.\n\nRemember, recapitulation exists to recover your awareness which has become trapped in past events.  Fine strands of your awareness glowing in some small aspect of the dark sea of awareness such as the swing set you played on at 5  years old.\n\nConstantly pulling a bit of your awareness back to that event, and to the only reality where it makes sense.\n\nWe make those scenes visible during recap and recover our energy.\n\nBut the same happens in reverse with drug trips.  Your awareness gets focused on bizarre sights in the quagmire of the second attention, and from then on you have a tiny bit of yourself stuck there.\n\nJulian fell victim to something similar when he spent too much time goofing off with shapeshifting.\n\nHe made it difficult for his awareness to quickly pass that region on the J curve.  So he couldn't move his assemblage point fast enough to reach the third attention.\n\nIt's not, on the surface, the same thing.\n\nBut in fact, it's all about how real alternate realities can become, and how in doing so they trap awareness.\n\nThat's how we got into this mess in the first place.  Being trapped in this single view of reality.\n\nWe aren't looking to modify that, and merely improve our prison.\n\nWe're after something VERY PRECISE.  It's a path to a very distant place.\n\nNot a show biz racket.\n\nYou can relate this to what I call the snobiness of the New Seers.\n\nI'm not criticizing their goals.  But rather, their assumption that everyone has abundant magic available to them and can afford to be choosy.\n\nWe don't!\n\nIt seems like a crime to turn your nose up at any real magic.\n\nTo disdain the Allies?\n\nSuicide for us!\n\nYou need to use ANYTHING you can, to move your assemblage point as far as you can.\n\nWhich is not a bad thing. The new seers do that in spades!\n\nThey even manipulate sexual urges and worries, to train apprentices.\n\nSo they'll convince Taisha she's going to be raped by her new sorcery teacher don Juan, in order to get her frightened enough for an Ally to come attack her in her bed.\n\nHonestly, is that not as bad as what the old seers did, getting themselves trapped by all the alternate realities they could explore and control?\n\nActually, it's two different \"bad things\".\n\nWhat the new seers did by using anything available, even anti-social stuff, is because of how hard you have to struggle to get your assemblage point moving.\n\nBecause you aren't going ANYWHERE, until it does.\n\nBut their disdain for the old seers doings is about WHERE you go, once you are moving.\n\nDo you drive down the road 100 miles, discover the bar zone part of a small town in the middle of nowhere, and take up residence there so that you can party each night?\n\nYou can literally do such a thing, but in magical realms.\n\nIt happens once you can reach silent knowledge, or \"seeing\".\n\nThe old seers became obsessed with what they \"saw\", and how much control they had over it.\n\nSo that they ceased to be \"travelers\", and became gluttons for weird drug trips.\n\nMinus the drugs, which is good.\n\nBut in visiting other real worlds they could repeat, they began to store more and more of their awareness into them.\n\nBecoming \"trapped\" in what is merely a slightly more flexible version of reality.\n\nYou have to see this with your own eyes to understand why the new seers want people to avoid  that.\n\nTieing up awareness in alternate realities.\n\nThe old seers were obsessed with exploring.  They actually mapped out 600 \"cyclic being\" worlds, which simply means, they discovered that there are 600 STABLE positions of the assemblage point, where you have a life running concurrently with this one.\n\nIt's mind boggling to someone trapped in the blue zone.  How can you ignore all this lovely physical matter, and just ditch reality to live in a different one?\n\nWhat happens to your flesh body if you leave for years?\n\nIt's a good question, but it's based on a misunderstanding of what reality is.\n\nReality is a flow of sensations from the dark sea of awareness, in response to where your attention is focused.\n\nThis one seems so immutable, so very real that it can never be ignored, simply because we got ourselves trapped here.\n\nOur awareness got stuck in physical bodies.\n\nThe matter will always exist at this level of reality.  At this assemblage point position, where all the elements to create a specific time, location in space, and even very specific physical matter involved in the interactions in this time and place, will continue to exist forever.\n\nSubject to transformations (decay) from the flow of time here.\n\nBut that's not your awareness.\n\nThat's the information flowing back to you, when you focus your awareness on a specific bundle of the emanations.\n\nIf you want to return here and resume your current situation, after traveling into another reality for a while,  you certainly want your physical matter to be in a good state.\n\nBut that has nothing to do with whether the physical matter is \"you\".\n\nIt's more like, if you return to your favorite hotel on the road to a distant location which takes more than a day to get to, you'd like to find that your favorite diner across the street from it is still in business.\n\nBut you aren't merely a hotel guest who dines at a specific restaurant.\n\nThat's just one thing you do, out of millions of others.\n\nThe new seers were more concerned with traveling down that road as far as possible, and not getting attached to the sights along the way.\n\nIt was the accumulated wisdom of 8000 years of travelers.\n\nNot unlike \"All You Can Eat Buffet\" wisdom.\n\nDon't get greedy in the salad section they make you walk through first.  The meat is at the far end of the line of selections!\n\nAnd if you reach the meat and there's any room on your plate, they lure you with the \"mini-cake\" section which comes next, so that if you can only fit a little of the expensive stuff on your plate, you go over to the desert section and get a mini-plate instead.  Now your hands are full and you can't get more meat.\n\nYou have cake instead.  A very cheap food to make.\n\nThe new seers have the wisdom seers accumulated over thousands of years, and so much magic available to them that they could afford to be snobby and ignore \"unnecessary\" magic.\n\nI have no idea what happens if you keep going down their road, but it's pretty darned cool once you can sustain Silent Knowledge.\n\nEven though you're still trying to hold on to those \"videos in the air\", and especially even enter them for a visit.\n\nI just got back from one which made perfect sense at the time.\n\nIt was magic supreme, but within its own context.\n\nThis picture is the best I could get ChatGPT to draw it.  The ventilation tunnel.\n\nThat reality involved a dispute I was having with someone who discovered their own variety of sorcery \"path\".\n\nWhich they implied eclipses \"darkroom\".  Works faster, and is more reliable.\n\nSomehow I was expected to be bothered by that.  As if the goal of all of us in this subreddit, trying to help others, was actually about fame.\n\nSo that if anyone had a better way to learn which obsoleted what we do in the subreddit, we'd object to it.\n\nThe same thing that our social structure uses to trap us in this reality, that we ought to \"care\" about what they tell us to care about, was happening in that new reality.\n\nBut the specifics aren't important. The main thing was that I was awake, not asleep.\n\nI'd waved my hand to lift up my energy body and make the blue puffs swarm all around me,  and I'd ended up in such a \"complete\" reality that I could stay there for what must have been 20 minutes.\n\nWhich is enough time to acclimate to a new reality, until it seems perfectly normal.\n\nBut I was stuck in it.  With someone insisting I'm supposed to feel bad about it. About \"better\" magic.\n\nMy awareness was being tied up in the details of that reality, and how I was expected to feel about it.\n\nMeanwhile I noticed I was being chased by dried up rose petals.\n\nIndividual ones, but I couldn't convince the AI to draw that for me.  Once you say \"flower petals\", it gets \"overfitted\".\n\nThat's what they call it in the AI community but \"obsessed\" is more like it.\n\nI escaped my obsession with rose petal politics, returned to sitting up on pillows on my bed, and realized I'd gotten just as trapped in that world as I was in this one.\n\nAnd I got a lecture from Silent Knowledge about being trapped.\n\nThe old seers got trapped like that, at far more advanced stages of alternate reality exploration.\n\nThey weren't travelers the way the new seers are, because they were too early in the evolution of our sorcery to know any good destinations.\n\nSo they stopped to explore every small city along the road, looking for entertaining things to do.\n\nAnd in so doing they learned the \"doings\" of many places, and developed \"concerns\" in each.\n\nThey slowly trapped more and more of their awareness in random realities they could return to.\n\nAnd THAT'S what the new seers are warning against.\n\nWe get the lesson on this topic from the very start.\n\nWhen we see some amazing beginner's magic, which we call \"intent gifts\" in here.\n\nBut we can't repeat it.\n\nWe're forced to live without it the next day, and we just have to move on down the road to see what comes next.\n\nCarlos was taught in the same manner, as a series of little \"magic shows\" don Juan put on for him.\n\nNone of which he could do on his own.\n\nAnd none of which they repeated for him except for those triggered by power plants.\n\nOur road has been etched in the emanations themselves.\n\nAnd the command is to keep moving on.  Not to stop too long in any location.\n\nTowards what, we can't possibly know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why The New Seers Are So Snobby", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"wwvfbq3l9gtc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e32379c4e9a8ab4a42f63238a5ad4e7110a0141"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c432cc58956ef457bfa962262c3740aa4a1237f5"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=988947d6d513c307fe3bdce72a0843df993d86e3"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9917c3c19789cd56d90b13cdf110b74dd7c2f73"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d6f401b04c0a4f518847d8fff7bff4a0354f7cc"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5000be5dc89b51c8af13733a85826d64c50d35ec"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc28ab4597fc611f1b5f5776390fb4a194e4e58"}, "id": "wwvfbq3l9gtc1"}}, "name": "t3_1bzndkx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65z58FQWMsfxHInpPq5fPdHPtDK3LUx-dlz7nSTctfc.jpg", "edited": 1712669609.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1712652874.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7dc28ab4597fc611f1b5f5776390fb4a194e4e58\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/wwvfbq3l9gtc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7dc28ab4597fc611f1b5f5776390fb4a194e4e58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is so simple, it seems silly not to just tell people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s so advanced that no one can possibly understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that normally I&amp;#39;d worry beginners will try to skip to this, to get out of hard work.

At this assemblage point position, where all the elements to create a specific time, location in space, and even very specific physical matter involved in the interactions in this time and place, will continue to exist forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Subject to transformations (decay) from the flow of time here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the information flowing back to you, when you focus your awareness on a specific bundle of the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to return here and resume your current situation, after traveling into another reality for a while,  you certainly want your physical matter to be in a good state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that has nothing to do with whether the physical matter is &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more like, if you return to your favorite hotel on the road to a distant location which takes more than a day to get to, you&amp;#39;d like to find that your favorite diner across the street from it is still in business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you aren&amp;#39;t merely a hotel guest who dines at a specific restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just one thing you do, out of millions of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new seers were more concerned with traveling down that road as far as possible, and not getting attached to the sights along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the accumulated wisdom of 8000 years of travelers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not unlike &amp;quot;All You Can Eat Buffet&amp;quot; wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get greedy in the salad section they make you walk through first.  The meat is at the far end of the line of selections!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you reach the meat and there&amp;#39;s any room on your plate, they lure you with the &amp;quot;mini-cake&amp;quot; section which comes next, so that if you can only fit a little of the expensive stuff on your plate, you go over to the desert section and get a mini-plate instead.  Now your hands are full and you can&amp;#39;t get more meat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have cake instead.  A very cheap food to make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new seers have the wisdom seers accumulated over thousands of years, and so much magic available to them that they could afford to be snobby and ignore &amp;quot;unnecessary&amp;quot; magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what happens if you keep going down their road, but it&amp;#39;s pretty darned cool once you can sustain Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though you&amp;#39;re still trying to hold on to those &amp;quot;videos in the air&amp;quot;, and especially even enter them for a visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just got back from one which made perfect sense at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was magic supreme, but within its own context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This picture is the best I could get ChatGPT to draw it.  The ventilation tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That reality involved a dispute I was having with someone who discovered their own variety of sorcery &amp;quot;path&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which they implied eclipses &amp;quot;darkroom&amp;quot;.  Works faster, and is more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow I was expected to be bothered by that.  As if the goal of all of us in this subreddit, trying to help others, was actually about fame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that if anyone had a better way to learn which obsoleted what we do in the subreddit, we&amp;#39;d object to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same thing that our social structure uses to trap us in this reality, that we ought to &amp;quot;care&amp;quot; about what they tell us to care about, was happening in that new reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the specifics aren&amp;#39;t important. The main thing was that I was awake, not asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d waved my hand to lift up my energy body and make the blue puffs swarm all around me,  and I&amp;#39;d ended up in such a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; reality that I could stay there for what must have been 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is enough time to acclimate to a new reality, until it seems perfectly normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was stuck in it.  With someone insisting I&amp;#39;m supposed to feel bad about it. About &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My awareness was being tied up in the details of that reality, and how I was expected to feel about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I noticed I was being chased by dried up rose petals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Individual ones, but I couldn&amp;#39;t convince the AI to draw that for me.  Once you say &amp;quot;flower petals&amp;quot;, it gets &amp;quot;overfitted&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what they call it in the AI community but &amp;quot;obsessed&amp;quot; is more like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I escaped my obsession with rose petal politics, returned to sitting up on pillows on my bed, and realized I&amp;#39;d gotten just as trapped in that world as I was in this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I got a lecture from Silent Knowledge about being trapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers got trapped like that, at far more advanced stages of alternate reality exploration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They weren&amp;#39;t travelers the way the new seers are, because they were too early in the evolution of our sorcery to know any good destinations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they stopped to explore every small city along the road, looking for entertaining things to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in so doing they learned the &amp;quot;doings&amp;quot; of many places, and developed &amp;quot;concerns&amp;quot; in each.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They slowly trapped more and more of their awareness in random realities they could return to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And THAT&amp;#39;S what the new seers are warning against.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get the lesson on this topic from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we see some amazing beginner&amp;#39;s magic, which we call &amp;quot;intent gifts&amp;quot; in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can&amp;#39;t repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re forced to live without it the next day, and we just have to move on down the road to see what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was taught in the same manner, as a series of little &amp;quot;magic shows&amp;quot; don Juan put on for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of which he could do on his own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And none of which they repeated for him except for those triggered by power plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our road has been etched in the emanations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the command is to keep moving on.  Not to stop too long in any location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Towards what, we can&amp;#39;t possibly know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "1bzndkx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 47, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1bzndkx/why_the_new_seers_are_so_snobby/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1bzndkx/why_the_new_seers_are_so_snobby/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1712652874.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kyrnfop", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1712670163.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kyrhqx8", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Should look good on facebook too, so I copied it over.\n\nI kind of like Nelida...

The third attention only lasts until our sun goes red giant and burns up the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos seems to have discovered some way to move his awareness outside the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, that&amp;#39;s what I was told by Fancy, my &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who isn&amp;#39;t around anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita took her away, saying I was overusing the Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;#39;t seen a single once since she told me she was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1bzndkx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1bzndkx/why_the_new_seers_are_so_snobby/kyylrjl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1712774939.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1712774939.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kyy1og6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "aumuaum", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kyxmotk", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_tofhuk7r", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I didn't mean to use any social bullying tactics, but if I did anyway then I apologize.

No magic over there at Cleargreen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Avoid trying to be &amp;quot;holy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;sanctified&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon you&amp;#39;ll be worried about being &amp;quot;defiled&amp;quot; if you break some arbitrary rule, like &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t eat sugar!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nicotine is actually helpful to sorcery effects, all the way up to the purple zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Past there, I&amp;#39;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But past the purple zone, likely you wouldn&amp;#39;t even get into a bathtub, unless you needed it to fight off an attack by the Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I never get to the point of taking sponge baths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos didn&amp;#39;t make up stuff...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And La Gorda herself in the books said that water was &amp;quot;antithetical to the second attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings up a question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you suppose you could learn sorcery by never touching any alcohol, becoming intolerant of cigarette smoke, not eating any sugar, and only taking sponge baths?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or do you suppose all those placebos would tire you out so much, that you never got around to actually doing any work to learn to be silent?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in the long run, being tired is the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you drink so much that you&amp;#39;re too tired to practice, then it&amp;#39;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you consume too much marijuana causing you to sleep through the night, and not get up to practice, that&amp;#39;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I can&amp;#39;t imagine that would make any difference as long as you sober up before practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything has an effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most can be ignored all the way into the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out there, you can find out for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1bzndkx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1bzndkx/why_the_new_seers_are_so_snobby/kywrbqb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1712750586.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kywbvfe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Kind_Perception1309", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1712741003.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1bzndkx", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8qsgwsj7l", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "what of drinking alcohol, occasionally\u2026 and smoking tobacco\u2026 occasionally\nif you consider those as drugs \nand not taking these substances to\npractice magic", "edited": 1712742447.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kywbvfe", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;what of drinking alcohol, occasionally\u2026 and smoking tobacco\u2026 occasionally\nif you consider those as drugs \nand not taking these substances to\npractice magic&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1bzndkx/why_the_new_seers_are_so_snobby/kywbvfe/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1712741003.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1bzndkx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

Maybe it'll make sense to me.\"\n\n\"No. You must do it yourself. Once you learn, you can see every single thing in the world in a different way.\"\n\n\"Then, don Juan, you don't see the world in the usual way any more.\"\n\n\"I see both ways. When I want to look at the world I see it the way you do. Then when I want to see it I look\nat it the way I know and I perceive it in a different way.\"\n\n\"Do things look consistently the same every time you see them?\"\n\n\"Things don't change. You change your way of looking, that's all\"\n\n\"I mean, don Juan, that if you see, for instance, the same tree, does it remain the same every time you see it?\"\n\n\"No. It changes and yet it's the same.\"\n\n\"But if the same tree changes every time you see it, your seeing may be a mere illusion.\"\n\nHe laughed and did not answer for some time, but seemed to be thinking. Finally he said, \"Whenever you\nlook at things you don't see them. You just look at them, I suppose, to make sure that something is there. Since\nyou're not concerned with seeing, things look very much the same every time you look at them. When you learn\nto see, on the other hand, a thing is never the same every time you see it, and yet it is the same. I told you, for in-\nstance, that a man is like an egg. Every time I see the same man I see an egg, yet it is not the same egg.\"\n\n\"But you won't be able to recognize anything, since nothing is the same; so what's the advantage of learning\nto see?\"\n\n\"You can tell things apart. You can see them for what they really are.\"\n\n\"Don't I see things as they really are?\"\n\n\"No. Your eyes have learned only to look. Take, for example, the three people you encountered, the three\nMexicans. You have described them in detail, and even told me what clothes they wore. And that only proved to\nme that you didn't see them at all.

Finally he said, &amp;quot;Whenever you\nlook at things you don&amp;#39;t see them. You just look at them, I suppose, to make sure that something is there. Since\nyou&amp;#39;re not concerned with seeing, things look very much the same every time you look at them. When you learn\nto see, on the other hand, a thing is never the same every time you see it, and yet it is the same. I told you, for in-\nstance, that a man is like an egg. Every time I see the same man I see an egg, yet it is not the same egg.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But you won&amp;#39;t be able to recognize anything, since nothing is the same; so what&amp;#39;s the advantage of learning\nto see?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can tell things apart. You can see them for what they really are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t I see things as they really are?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. Your eyes have learned only to look. Take, for example, the three people you encountered, the three\nMexicans. You have described them in detail, and even told me what clothes they wore.

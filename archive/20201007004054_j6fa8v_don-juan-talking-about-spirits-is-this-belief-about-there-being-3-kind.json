how they got into private classes.\n\nMy guess is, it was by invite.  But not from Carlos.\n\nCarlos was surrounded with people he'd \"found\".  \n\nEach of those had people they liked, and wanted to also have a chance to learn.\n\nPeople wanted to \"save\" their friends.  And, without naming names, there was some latent sexual attraction going on in some cases. \n\nSo let's say you were Margarete, a somewhat famous, \"Chola\" in the California college system.  A specialist in Chicano studies.\n\nFor those from outside the USA, a \"Chola\" is not a bad thing here.   A \"Chola\" is a proud person born here, of South American ancestry.  Usually Mexican, but it wasn't a limitation on that title.  Officially they were called, \"Chicanos\".\n\nAs teenagers, they often painted their faces in exotic \"Gangster\" makeup (man I wanted one of those in high school!), and the men wore dazzling clothes like, \"Zoot Suits\", with big pocket chain watches they could twirl when emphasizing their coolness.\n\n\nI have an unproven theory that \"Chola\" makeup was modeled after Lyn May.  The 1950s version.  Or maybe Lyn was copying Golden Age Mexican Hollywood, but the look is the same.\n\nThe Chola teenage girls had switch blades, which made them even hotter!  The men had butterfly knives.  Big Bruce Lee fans all.  The local tiny theater played Bruce Lee every weekend, to a packed audience of Chicano men and women.\n\nLA was the headquarters for that sort of fashion sense.  If you've watched 1950s cartoons, the wolves howling at women are \"Chicanos\".\n\nMargarete was a long time companion of Carlos, and according to Cholita they ate dinner together often enough to make Cholita jealous.  As Cholita and I drive around LA, she often points to a restaurant and declares, Margarete and Carlos ate there. Carlos was fond of classic \"steak house\" type places, or the lower priced places like \"Ships\", which is pretty much a slightly better versions of \"Denny's\".\n\nOr in Russia, \"Carrows\"\n\nMargarete got wind of Cholita. I have no idea how.  Probably via the peyote fields of Mexico.\n\nHowever it came about, she enabled Cholita, who had just discovered Carlos' books, to travel directly from a peyote field, to LA.  \n\nShe was brought to Carlos for inspection.  He let her attend a private class or two, let her visit with the witches, and set her up with Margarete.  She lived with her.  Somehow Cholita got an old car that belonged to Carlos.\n\nBut Carlos wasn't happy with her.   She'd never actually taken care of herself, relying on men for everything.\n\nHe assigned her a job with one of his side businesses, a business Cholita could not resist.  She'd been dabbling in that business for years.   \n\nWhy Carlos got involved in that business is still a mystery to me.  \n\nShe left that first job he got her (chased around the table as she tells it), and took another, probably also associated with Carlos.\n\n2 jobs later Carlos announced she had to cut her hair, and quit smoking. And then she could return to private classes.\n\nIn my case, I was a thorn in Carlos' side, with my Nagualist newsletter.\n\nIt's obvious why. Although the intention of that publication was good, it was yet one more angry male bully trying to steal attention.  Like we see here on reddit.\n\nCarlos was as plagued by them, as the main Castaneda subreddit.\n\nKylie asked me to stop it.  Or maybe it was Reni or Nyei.\n\nOf course I did, and that got me into private classes.\n\nCorey was the head of a gay charity.  And back then, there weren't as many as there are now.  He even testified in front of congress at one point.\n\nI don't know why, but I suspect that's what got him in. \n\nHe had an annoying chip on his shoulder about being gay, back then.\n\nAnd there was an overall gay theme going on in private classes.  Gay orgies were not unheard of.\n\nMaybe gay people have a different energy more conducive to learning sorcery?\n\nOr maybe Gay people are more free from the nuclear family myth, and have more time to practice, or just ditch it all to go concentrate on sorcery?\n\nI'll pass on that gay energy, and stick with my Disney princess types.\n\nIf you're IOB decides to appear naked, do you want a Disney princess, or a gay man with a chip on his shoulder?\n\nDon't answer, please...", "edited": 1602102119.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g81ck4k", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we could get more to come back, we could find out how they got into private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is, it was by invite.

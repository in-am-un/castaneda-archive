Sometimes 10 years of hard work lost on an individual who never actually admitted, they weren't really interested in learning.  And yet they were willing to pretend they were.\n\nUntil this subreddit came into being.\n\nAs a result of that prior experience plus watching this place for perhaps 2 years, I can still spot someone who will never learn sorcery in just the first 2 or 3 sentences of their initial post or comment.\n\nCan that problem be altered on an individual basis?  Can you \"teach an individual\"?\n\nNope.    So far, no one has ever been able to do that.\n\nThe old seers got children as apprentices.  Those you can teach!\n\nThe lineages had 15 powerful sorcerers to use, to trick apprentices into succeeding.  And the apprentices were brought to them by \"the spirit\".\n\nBut to teach a specific person?  A volunteer???\n\nIt's not possible.\n\nBest you can hope is,  when they inevitably give up they come back 10 years later,  now understanding what they missed out on.\n\nBut you **can** point out the signs of failure,  hoping someone might be able to change themselves.\n\nSilence changes everything!\n\nAnd those \"signs of failure\" seem to all break down to how clean the person's link to *intent* is.\n\nThe \"link to *intent*\" is how we summon changes in reality.  Sorcerers learn to \"move their assemblage point\", and once it moves a new reality forms.\n\nMight just be a slight change, or it could be an entirely different world they can move into permanently.\n\nAnd what determines if \"something\" happens or nothing happens, is the person's link to *intent*.\n\n*Intent* is the force that ultimately selects which very tiny pieces of \"reality\" are used, to create a new view of it.  When the assemblage point moves and our beam of awareness focuses on a different spot inside our luminous egg.\n\nOn a new range of \"emanations\", which will be \"skimmed\" to produce the result.\n\nThere's zillions to the zillionth power of those tiny pieces of \"meaning\".\n\nThey're like super strings.\n\nIt's not possible to use all of them, so \"bundles\" have to be selected by \"*intent*\".  The force that creates realness.\n\nIf you put some awareness into one single emanation just by \"looking at it\", it sends back a \"feeling\".\n\nA sub-atomic piece of a concrete feeling.  Can be about objects, moods, distances.\n\nEvery perception we have, is simply a collection of zillions of those super strings vibrating with our awareness and sending back \"sensory information\".\n\nFeelings.\n\nAnd they \"interact\" at that level, so that \"harmonics\" from one can be present in others.\n\nThat's \"reality\".\n\nNormally we're so obsessed with our life, our history, our living situation, that we have an endless voice talking away in our head, telling us how things \"should be\".  Or \"how they are and that's just the way it is.\"\n\nNone of it as meaningful as we believe but since we have only one reality to live in, a gift from our family, we don't realize how pointless it is to obsess over things.\n\nWithin our obsessions over the world as it exists with the assemblage point up at the \"blue line\" (the shoulder blades), some of us take an interest in \"learning sorcery\".\n\nTo \"escape\".\n\nBut really, we don't.\n\nOur interest is \"something else\".  We aren't trying to escape that blue line assemblage point position.\n\nWe're trying to escape something else, which exists up there.\n\nMaybe we're trying to escape being \"ordinary\".  By getting attention.\n\nOr maybe we're trying to steal money with as little work as possible.\n\nCollect sex partners.\n\nBuild ourselves \"a reputation as a magic man\".\n\nIt's  endless crap.\n\nAnd it's a \"dirty link to intent\" because what we \"want\", is too complex to ever be created by the force that assembles realities.\n\nIntent helps everyone!\n\nBut it helps with what you seek. And if you seek more shit, you get more shit.\n\nWe don't want something specific it can analyze,  and produce for us.\n\nWe want 10,000 smaller things, most of which have nothing at all to do with the process of learning sorcery.\n\nEven an advanced darkroom gazer continues to have this problem of being a total fraud.\n\nA phony!  A pretender.\n\nYou can be looking across the universe to find a distant galaxy to leap to in your real body, eyes open.\n\nAnd then notice, you're a fraud!\n\nYou're watching the clock!\n\nYou don't want to leap to a distant planet.  You want to be able to SAY you did.  That night.  So you can \"count your progress day by day\".\n\nWaiting to \"be done\", so you can go back to watching Gilligan's Island reruns while you drink some wine and stare at Mary Ann.\n\nBeing a fraud won't stop you from learning, but the \"degrees of fraudness\" holds you back at each stage.\n\nYou make \"new progress\", when you become less of a fraud.\n\nI made a post about \"The Moods of Darkroom\".\n\nBut I got carried away with maleness, and wanted them to be a tidy list of \"rules\".\n\nNaming each of the \"moods\" so thoroughly, that there weren't any more.\n\nI got 4 of them from Silent Knowledge, remembered 2, posted them, and one of the women suggested,\n\n\"Maybe this is just your attitude in the darkroom?\"\n\nUh...  Yes.  I guess it really is.\n\nBut you can still analyze your attitude!!!\n\n(I justified in a male sort of way.)\n\nAnd you can.  Stalkers analyze their behavior so as to deal with the world in a better \"sorcery fashion\".\n\nSo I'll list the \"moods of darkroom\" as I know them so far, but keep in mind the best advice is, \"Don't be an asshole.\"\n\nThe moods I have so far are doing, moving, searching, waiting, and resting.\n\nIf you manipulate the \"moods\" so that you don't fall into a single one, you can make your dreaming attention last 4 times as long.\n\nAnd in the end, sorcery almost entirely comes down to how much dreaming attention you have.\n\nAt least, on the path we're stuck with.\n\nIf you thought to yourself, \"Ah Hah!!!  He admits there are other paths!\"\n\nThen you're screwed.   Go join up with your fake sorcery teachers elsewhere.\n\nBut I'll let you figure out what's wrong with that thought.\n\nSo perhaps the \"moods\" of darkroom, so you can figure out how to \"improve\" the one you have, are best defined in terms of how \"dirty your link to *intent* is\".\n\nLet's start with the worst, and move to the less dirty link conditions.\n\nFirst worst link to intent is:\n\n1   You don't really want to learn sorcery.  You just need some friends.  You're \"Lonely\".\n\nKeep in mind, sorcery is harder to learn than any other human endeavor.\n\nYou have to WANT it, or you won't manage to do the work needed.\n\nThen in order of less worse \"dirty links to intent\":\n\n2  You believe \"there are sorcerers everywhere\".  Naguals all over the place, lineages you could run off to join, skilled \"dreamers\" who can give you advice.  You believe that the world (Facebook) is FILLED with success stories.    And there's even other things you can do, all of them real magic.  Like be a Buddha boy.  Remote view.  Astral Travel.  Practice Magick.    Bottom line:  you're a \"Chump\".\n\n3   You want to teach sorcery (before you ever learned any).  You can hide this as being part of a \"helpful community\" who likes to investigate weird stuff on YouTube.  But in fact, you want to teach what you did not learn yourself.  You're a \"Pimp\".\n\n4   You want a spiritual soulmate.   You're \"Annoying and Desperate\".\n\n5   You want to collect a group of followers.  You're a \"Sociopath\".\n\n6  You want to write a book and become famous.  You're a \"Monroe wannabe\".\n\n7  You believe any of that was a moral judgement.  You're \"religious\".\n\nYou need to rethink things.\n\nThis is JUST A TECHNOLOGY. Not a religion.  And certainly NOT a \"philosophy\".  There's NO BELIEFS involved.  It's just what we know about how reality works.\n\nThat's it.\n\nIf you showed up for a computer class carrying knitting supplies and sat in the back of the room knitting and gossiping with others, no one would disagree that you aren't actually there to learn about computers.\n\nIf you had a pocket full of little bags of meth, knowing many computer geeks love the stuff, you'd also be an obvious fraud in the computer class.\n\nYou have to actually WANT to learn sorcery, and not have any other motivations. Or you can't.\n\nSorcery is unique in that.\n\nWe're manipulating how reality forms!  At the very heart of it.\n\nAnd it responds to your \"commands\", but only if they are clear.\n\nIf you want something else, you won't be able to learn because you'll never see when it works, and when it doesn't.\n\nIt will never work.  And so you'll believe what you believed before. It's not real.  It's just pretend.\n\nSo if you got yourself past #7 and are working in the darkroom, you still aren't \"home free\".\n\nThere's more \"bad links to intent\".\n\n8   You want something impressive to post.  I can't fault this.  In fact, it's our path!   But it's still a dirty link to intent.  Carlos tried to \"make use of it\" in his private group.  I don't see that he found a way to do that.    But we have. If you do something cool and make an effort to post it, and it really was cool and not just an excuse to seek attention, you get rewarded by \"the spirit\".  I have no idea why, but the spirit might decide it needs \"a magic squirrel specialist\".  And you could get the job!  But then you'd be a \"Squirrel lover\".  Don't let it bother.  \"Specialists\" have always been part of the lineages, and we can't escape that.  \"The rule\" repeats itself over and over.\n\n9   You dutifully do your 10 copies of your favorite pass, followed by 4 of another, followed by 6 of something else...   But nothing much is happening.  You're stuck in a routine.  It's obvious to \"the spirit\" that you think you can \"earn\" magic.  It doesn't work that way.  It's a dirty link to intent.  You're a \"Faker\".  You have to figure the cure for that out yourself. But \"be real\" in your interest in magic. Never stop \"working like a dog\" and pushing.  Try to figure out \"what's going wrong\".  If nothing else, resort to massive not-doings to prove to \"the spirit\" that you are willing to make an effort, and deserve some help.  Real progress is a gift, not something you actually learned by your own efforts.  It doesn't work like that!  All sorcery powers are automatically available, at a given position of the assemblage point.  You just need it to move over there.\n\nNone of these problems, even the early ones,  matters at all as long as you force silence until blood drips from your nose.\n\nBut at some point there's a \"transformation\" from pretending and hoping and wishing, to knowing and doing.  And the \"transition\" can take place long after you actually got cool stuff to happen.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but you **actually** become interested.  Not just \"in theory\".  You **ARE**.\n\nIf you can get away with it, you don't look at the clock at all anymore.   You don't count the time.\n\nThere's nothing else you'd rather be doing.\n\nThat's the point at which \"the spirit\" can play with you.  When you become a \"willing learner\".\n\nAnd aren't thinking about something else you'd rather be doing.\n\nA good analogy is a trumpet player.\n\nA beginner in elementary school has to practice 30 minutes a day, or his mom gives him hell.\n\nAt some point maybe he keeps it up and he's in the high school band.  And giving a concert.  He gets to stand up and do the lead trumpet grand finale!\n\nBut he still doesn't really like playing the trumpet.\n\nThen there's the guy who takes such a liking to it he joins a jazz band that has no place to play and ends up in a crummy music store back room in the middle of nowhere.  He learns to do \"free flowing solos\", accompanied by the jazz band.\n\nThere's no sheet music.   Some in the band can't even read music!\n\nHe has just his ideas on what might be cool to play next.\n\nAt first he's awkward, and the entire band feels bad for him when he tries a \"solo\".\n\nBut eventually something \"clicks\", and he can \"jam\" with the best of them.\n\nThat's our goal.\n\nNo longer a phony.\n\nI knew an old jazz guy who explained it.\n\nWhen you can take a 15 minute cigarette break from the jazz session, walk next door to the falling apart liquor store in the same strip mall, buy one of those crappy roast beef on white sandwiches with wilted lettuce, right next to the canned mixed drinks in the refrigerated section, then  bring it back and eat it with Zenlike pleasure, you know you are finally a \"real musician\".\n\nYou have to know \"how low you've stooped in pursuit of your art\".\n\nThat's a clean link to intent!", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Signs of a Dirty Link to Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 92, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"mcvkis1h1l891": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mcvkis1h1l891.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=618865a8cd51bd37cdca2dcd9edfb1c438d2f952"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mcvkis1h1l891.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad45e8a066de5287af3e8a3df74cf9c9f35f2e80"}, {"y": 212, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mcvkis1h1l891.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fec1e7681006804af1cce3682f9bf6553603b15"}, {"y": 425, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mcvkis1h1l891.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d951774fa7ad7a9bb959eeab46a65929fb77555f"}, {"y": 637, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mcvkis1h1l891.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dbcfb20b00b30537b1e7ce704d6e87fab43ee14"}], "s": {"y": 680, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mcvkis1h1l891.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f51dd59075a8b322bd55b8a720957cbabdf0f9b4"}, "id": "mcvkis1h1l891"}}, "name": "t3_vnmg0b", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 44, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NVMDZ6dj_WW2kOlKK3mgCpkJ-PRQ_v66pDjzs1iShdU.jpg", "edited": 1656528406.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1656526804.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mcvkis1h1l891.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f51dd59075a8b322bd55b8a720957cbabdf0f9b4\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mcvkis1h1l891.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f51dd59075a8b322bd55b8a720957cbabdf0f9b4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to teach sorcery to even one single person for the last 24 years,  always failing.

Yes.  I guess it really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can still analyze your attitude!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I justified in a male sort of way.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can.  Stalkers analyze their behavior so as to deal with the world in a better &amp;quot;sorcery fashion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll list the &amp;quot;moods of darkroom&amp;quot; as I know them so far, but keep in mind the best advice is, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be an asshole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moods I have so far are doing, moving, searching, waiting, and resting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you manipulate the &amp;quot;moods&amp;quot; so that you don&amp;#39;t fall into a single one, you can make your dreaming attention last 4 times as long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the end, sorcery almost entirely comes down to how much dreaming attention you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, on the path we&amp;#39;re stuck with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you thought to yourself, &amp;quot;Ah Hah!!!  He admits there are other paths!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you&amp;#39;re screwed.   Go join up with your fake sorcery teachers elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ll let you figure out what&amp;#39;s wrong with that thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the &amp;quot;moods&amp;quot; of darkroom, so you can figure out how to &amp;quot;improve&amp;quot; the one you have, are best defined in terms of how &amp;quot;dirty your link to &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the worst, and move to the less dirty link conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First worst link to intent is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1   You don&amp;#39;t really want to learn sorcery.  You just need some friends.  You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;Lonely&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, sorcery is harder to learn than any other human endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to WANT it, or you won&amp;#39;t manage to do the work needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then in order of less worse &amp;quot;dirty links to intent&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2  You believe &amp;quot;there are sorcerers everywhere&amp;quot;.  Naguals all over the place, lineages you could run off to join, skilled &amp;quot;dreamers&amp;quot; who can give you advice.  You believe that the world (Facebook) is FILLED with success stories.    And there&amp;#39;s even other things you can do, all of them real magic.  Like be a Buddha boy.  Remote view.  Astral Travel.  Practice Magick.    Bottom line:  you&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;Chump&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3   You want to teach sorcery (before you ever learned any).  You can hide this as being part of a &amp;quot;helpful community&amp;quot; who likes to investigate weird stuff on YouTube.  But in fact, you want to teach what you did not learn yourself.  You&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;Pimp&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4   You want a spiritual soulmate.   You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;Annoying and Desperate&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5   You want to collect a group of followers.  You&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;Sociopath&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6  You want to write a book and become famous.  You&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;Monroe wannabe&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7  You believe any of that was a moral judgement.  You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to rethink things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is JUST A TECHNOLOGY. Not a religion.  And certainly NOT a &amp;quot;philosophy&amp;quot;.  There&amp;#39;s NO BELIEFS involved.  It&amp;#39;s just what we know about how reality works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you showed up for a computer class carrying knitting supplies and sat in the back of the room knitting and gossiping with others, no one would disagree that you aren&amp;#39;t actually there to learn about computers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had a pocket full of little bags of meth, knowing many computer geeks love the stuff, you&amp;#39;d also be an obvious fraud in the computer class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to actually WANT to learn sorcery, and not have any other motivations. Or you can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is unique in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re manipulating how reality forms!  At the very heart of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it responds to your &amp;quot;commands&amp;quot;, but only if they are clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want something else, you won&amp;#39;t be able to learn because you&amp;#39;ll never see when it works, and when it doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will never work.  And so you&amp;#39;ll believe what you believed before. It&amp;#39;s not real.  It&amp;#39;s just pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you got yourself past #7 and are working in the darkroom, you still aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;home free&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more &amp;quot;bad links to intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8   You want something impressive to post.  I can&amp;#39;t fault this.  In fact, it&amp;#39;s our path!   But it&amp;#39;s still a dirty link to intent.  Carlos tried to &amp;quot;make use of it&amp;quot; in his private group.  I don&amp;#39;t see that he found a way to do that.    But we have. If you do something cool and make an effort to post it, and it really was cool and not just an excuse to seek attention, you get rewarded by &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot;.  I have no idea why, but the spirit might decide it needs &amp;quot;a magic squirrel specialist&amp;quot;.  And you could get the job!  But then you&amp;#39;d be a &amp;quot;Squirrel lover&amp;quot;.  Don&amp;#39;t let it bother.  &amp;quot;Specialists&amp;quot; have always been part of the lineages, and we can&amp;#39;t escape that.  &amp;quot;The rule&amp;quot; repeats itself over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9   You dutifully do your 10 copies of your favorite pass, followed by 4 of another, followed by 6 of something else...   But nothing much is happening.  You&amp;#39;re stuck in a routine.  It&amp;#39;s obvious to &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; that you think you can &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; magic.  It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.  It&amp;#39;s a dirty link to intent.  You&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;Faker&amp;quot;.  You have to figure the cure for that out yourself. But &amp;quot;be real&amp;quot; in your interest in magic. Never stop &amp;quot;working like a dog&amp;quot; and pushing.  Try to figure out &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s going wrong&amp;quot;.  If nothing else, resort to massive not-doings to prove to &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; that you are willing to make an effort, and deserve some help.  Real progress is a gift, not something you actually learned by your own efforts.  It doesn&amp;#39;t work like that!  All sorcery powers are automatically available, at a given position of the assemblage point.  You just need it to move over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of these problems, even the early ones,  matters at all as long as you force silence until blood drips from your nose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at some point there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;transformation&amp;quot; from pretending and hoping and wishing, to knowing and doing.  And the &amp;quot;transition&amp;quot; can take place long after you actually got cool stuff to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to explain, but you &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; become interested.  Not just &amp;quot;in theory&amp;quot;.  You &lt;strong&gt;ARE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can get away with it, you don&amp;#39;t look at the clock at all anymore.   You don&amp;#39;t count the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing else you&amp;#39;d rather be doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the point at which &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; can play with you.  When you become a &amp;quot;willing learner&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And aren&amp;#39;t thinking about something else you&amp;#39;d rather be doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good analogy is a trumpet player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A beginner in elementary school has to practice 30 minutes a day, or his mom gives him hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point maybe he keeps it up and he&amp;#39;s in the high school band.  And giving a concert.  He gets to stand up and do the lead trumpet grand finale!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he still doesn&amp;#39;t really like playing the trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the guy who takes such a liking to it he joins a jazz band that has no place to play and ends up in a crummy music store back room in the middle of nowhere.  He learns to do &amp;quot;free flowing solos&amp;quot;, accompanied by the jazz band.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no sheet music.   Some in the band can&amp;#39;t even read music!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has just his ideas on what might be cool to play next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first he&amp;#39;s awkward, and the entire band feels bad for him when he tries a &amp;quot;solo&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But eventually something &amp;quot;clicks&amp;quot;, and he can &amp;quot;jam&amp;quot; with the best of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s our goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No longer a phony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew an old jazz guy who explained it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can take a 15 minute cigarette break from the jazz session, walk next door to the falling apart liquor store in the same strip mall, buy one of those crappy roast beef on white sandwiches with wilted lettuce, right next to the canned mixed drinks in the refrigerated section, then  bring it back and eat it with Zenlike pleasure, you know you are finally a &amp;quot;real musician&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to know &amp;quot;how low you&amp;#39;ve stooped in pursuit of your art&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a clean link to intent!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "vnmg0b", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vnmg0b/the_signs_of_a_dirty_link_to_intent/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/vnmg0b/the_signs_of_a_dirty_link_to_intent/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1656526804.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ie93lst", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "tabdrops", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1656545894.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vnmg0b", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_b9puh3b5", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "That thing about distractions, from my experience, is that there's no point at all in forcing to stop doing them.

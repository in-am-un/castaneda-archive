I do some of those moves naturally, without realizing it's because Carlos made us do them over and over again.\n\nAsthma seems to go away when the assemblage point moves enough.  I smoke like a fiend, so I have good feedback on that.  It works every time.    And you can't fake that, or believe in it so strongly that it happens.\n\nIt really is due to a movement of the assemblage point.\n\nBut sometimes it takes a couple of hours for me to get it to move far enough.\n\nMaybe the Tensegrity is faster.\n\nWhat you'd see at the start of that pass is purple light being influenced by the  hand movements.  It doesn't exactly \"blow\" around, like the hand was pushing smoke.\n\nBut it's more like you notice new things about it, that you didn't notice before.  And noticing them alters the structure of the glowing clouds around you.\n\nThe hand sweeping from back to front like that will strongly \"disturb\" it, and there's a delayed reaction.\n\nThe delay is long enough that you can't prove the one thing led to the other.  For instance, you see more lines in the purple smoke as you wave through it, you stop to watch the results, and the purple smoke seems to fade back to how it was.  But up in the far corner of the room some of the purple light begins to brighten, and tighten up into a ball you could scoop up with your hand.\n\nIf you do it over and over, during the course of weeks, you do discover some consistency in what happens.  But at the time, it almost seems random for most tensegrity moves.\n\nKeep in mind, when you first start to see colors, and scoop them onto your body, you feel a little worried, because the colors only follow your head movement.\n\nDon't worry, that will change.\n\nBut please notice how the head follows the hand movements in that pass.  That's because for beginners, the head has to follow the hands. It follows the hands, because Carlos knew we'd all eventually learn to see the energy, and that's the beginners way to move it around.\n\nWith the head.  But with the hands there also,  so that you have the *intent* to make it independent of your head movement.  You're *intending* it to be more real.\n\nLet's use an analogy:  You're a little kid in the bathtub with your toy airplane.\n\nThere's 2 ways you can play with it.  You can zoom it around with your arm, stretched out all over the place, pretending to fly over the ocean.  In that kind of play, you're watching the big scene.\n\nThat's too hard for tensegrity.  Our intent hasn't learned to be that dispersed.\n\nThe other way the kid might play with the airplane is much more powerful for stimulating his ability to daydream the scene and really see that airplane fly around.\n\nIn that situation, he puts the plane closer to his own eyes, and follows what the plane will see as it flies.  He literally turns his head along with the airplane, so his dreaming images are on top of it.  He's concentrating on the airplane itself, to summon dreaming.\n\nIf you watch kids play with toys like that, you should be able to detect both modes.\n\nParents would say, when his head is following the plane, that the kid is, \"really getting into it!\"\n\nWhen he's just waving it around in the air at a distance, he's not as involved in the dream.\n\nBack to that pass: I'd say that the pointed fingers concentrate *intent*.\n\nThey may have another function also, but I use the point of a finger all the time, to insist what I want to *intend*, when it seems to need a little help.\n\nFor instance, if you are watching dreaming fog (the colors you can see in darkness, after they finally fill the room and create structures), and you try to intercept a dream, but you're having no luck, you could use that pointed finger, with arm stretched out in the direction you want, to insist that a dream must materialize.\n\nSome days it's easy.

After all, the spirit had resolved previous impasses with trickery. It was obvious that if it wanted to make an impact on this man it had to cajole him. So the spirit began to instruct the man on the mysteries of sorcery. And the sorcery apprenticeship became what it is: a route of artifice and subterfuge .&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The story says that the spirit cajoled the man by making him shift back and forth between levels of awareness to show him how to save energy needed to strengthen his connecting link.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan told me that if we apply his story to a modern setting we had the case of the nagual, the living conduit of the spirit, repeating the structure of this abstract core and resorting to artifice and subterfuge in order to teach. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thats it. We dont need a nagual. We only need Spirit itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be cool if we can identify the abstract cores on us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We arent &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot;.

I am quite empty, which is why I could sense and can now see through your charade. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you reach the zero point, and the usher comes for you, after recapitulating your whole life, that is when we all begin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people in here are far less experienced than you, and just because you can send them an IOB to draw some cool shit on their dark room walls, doesn&amp;#39;t justify you taking over a subreddit, and then trying to make it all about IOB&amp;#39;S. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The IOB&amp;#39;s are probably the least important aspect of what is available from what CC and the witches wrote, especially in the time we are in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our abstract connection to the sentient earth is where the deepest joy is discovered. A warriors greatest accomplishment is joy. Joy leads to an impeccable spirt, which leads to a path of heart. The abstract flight is available to all of us. We don&amp;#39;t have the time to play pretend games as keyboard warriors, or get spun out by IOB&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a world of power, and there a real dark sorcerers that are aligned with inorganic forces. You have no idea what goes on in this world, because you are not a seer. CC wasn&amp;#39;t going to tell you that. It is reserved for when you surface from hypnosis, like when DJ showed CC the mud shadows. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet a real sorcerer, and go into the mountains with him and I, you are welcome to, but if you continue to play this out, that door will close. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not odds with you. I appreciate the gifts you carry, the fact you have reached the place of no pity is dope.. and I hope you can learn to see, so that you can discover the many aspects of sorcery that exists on this planet, expand your view beyond what CC shared, and then you will stop misleading these people, and instead serve as a guide to the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ixvvve/weird_effect_to_watch_for/g6a2iq5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1600827551.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ixvvve", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g6buj0u", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1600876770.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g69su2u", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I don't remember that one.

Here are all of those, collected into one page:\n\n(The Power of Silence\u00a0by **Carlos Castaneda**)\n\n\u201cYour problem is very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cYou become easily obsessed. I have been telling you that sorcerers stalk themselves in order to break the power of their obsessions. There are many ways of stalking oneself. If you don\u2019t want to use the idea of your death, use the poems you read me to stalk yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have told you that there are many reasons I like poems,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I do is stalk myself with them. I deliver a jolt to myself with them. I listen, and as you read, I shut off my internal dialogue and let my inner silence gain momentum. Then the combination of the poem and the silence delivers the jolt.\u201d\n\nHe explained that poets unconsciously long for the sorcerers\u2019 world. Because they are not sorcerers on the path of knowledge, longing is all they have.\n\n\u201cLet us see if you can feel what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d he said, handing me a book of poems by Jose Gorostiza.\n\nI opened it at the bookmark and he pointed to the poem he liked.\n\n*. . . this incessant stubborn dying,*\n\n*this living death,*\n\n*that slays you, oh God,*\n\n*in your rigorous handiwork,*\n\n*in the roses, in the stones,*\n\n*in the indomitable stars*\n\n*and in the flesh that burns out,*\n\n*like a bonfire lit by a song,*\n\n*a dream,*\n\n*a hue that hits the eye.*\n\n*. . . and you, yourself,*\n\n*perhaps have died eternities of ages out there,*\n\n*without us knowing about it,*\n\n*we dregs, crumbs, ashes of you;*\n\n*you that still are present,*\n\n*like a star faked by its very light,*\n\n*an empty light without star*\n\n*that reaches us,*\n\n*hiding its infinite catastrophe.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u201cAs I hear the words,\u201d don Juan said when I had finished reading, \u201cI feel that that man is *seeing* the essence of things and I can *see* with him. I don\u2019t care what the poem is about. I care only about the feeling the poet\u2019s longing brings me. I borrow his longing, and with it I borrow the beauty. And marvel at the fact that he, like a true warrior, lavishes it on the recipients, the beholders, retaining for himself only his longing.\u201d\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n(Journey to Ixtlan)\n\nThe Definitive Journey\n\nBy Juan Ramon Jimenez\n\n*. . . and I will leave.

He would listen to poems on the premise that only the first or sometimes the second stanza was worthwhile reading; the rest he found to be indulgence on the poet\u2019s part. There were very few poems, of the hundreds I must have read to him, that he listened to all the way through. At first I read to him what I liked; my preference was for abstract, convoluted, cerebral poetry. Later he made me read over and over what he liked. In his opinion a poem had to be compact, preferably short. And it had to be made up of precise poignant images of great simplicity.\n\nIn the late afternoon, sitting on that bench in Oaxaca, a poem by Cesar Vallejo always seemed to sum up for him a special feeling of longing. I recited it to la Gorda from memory, not so much for her benefit as for mine.\n\n*I wonder what she is doing at this hour*\n\n*my Andean and sweet Rita*\n\n*of reeds and wild cherry trees.*\n\n*Now that this weariness chokes me, and blood dozes off,*\n\n*like lazy brandy inside me.*\n\n*I wonder what she is doing with those hands*\n\n*that in attitude of penitence*\n\n*used to iron starchy whiteness,*\n\n*in the afternoons.*\n\n*Now that this rain is taking away my desire to go on.*\n\n*I wonder what has become of her skirt with lace;*\n\n*of her toils; of her walk;*\n\n*of her scent of spring sugar cane from that place.*\n\n*She must be at the door,*\n\n*gazing at a fast moving cloud.*\n\n*A wild bird on the tile roof will let out a call;*\n\n*and shivering she will say at last, \u201cJesus, it\u2019s cold!\u201d*\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n(The Eagle\u2019s Gift)\n\nDeath Without End\n\nBy Jose Gorostiza\n\n*Oh, what blind joy*\n\n*What hunger to use up*\n\n*the air that we breathe,*\n\n*the mouth, the eye, the hand.*\n\n*What biting itch*\n\n*to spend absolutely all of ourselves*\n\n*in one single burst of laughter.*\n\n*Oh, this impudent, insulting death*\n\n*that assassinates us from afar*\n\n*over the pleasure that we take in dying*\n\n*for a cup of tea . . .*\n\n*for a faint caress.*\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n(The Fire from Within)\n\nLa Valentina\n\nBy Unknown\n\n*Because of my passion, they say*\n\n*that ill fortune is on my way.*\n\n*It doesn\u2019t matter*\n\n*that it might be the devil himself.*\n\n*I do know how to die*\n\n*Valentina, Valentina.*\n\n*I throw my self in your way.*\n\n*If I am going to die tomorrow,*\n\n*why not, once and for all, today?*\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n(The Fire from Within)\n\nHora Inmensa\n\nBy Juan Ramon Jimenez\n\n*Only a bell and a bird break the stillness \u2026.*\n\n*It seems that the two talk with the setting sun*\n\n*Golden colored silence, the afternoon is made of crystals*\n\n*A roving purity sways the cold trees*\n\n*and beyond all that*\n\n*a transparent river dreams that trampling over pearls*\n\n*it breaks loose*\n\n*and flows into infinity*\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n(The Power of Silence)\n\n\u201cI like poems for many reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cOne reason is that they catch the mood of warriors and explain what can hardly be explained.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that poets were keenly aware of our connecting link with the spirit, but that they were aware of it intuitively, not in the deliberate, pragmatic way of sorcerers.\n\n\u201cPoets have no firsthand knowledge of the spirit,\u201d he went on. \u201cThat is why their poems cannot really hit the center of true gestures for the spirit. They hit pretty close to it, though.\u201d\n\nHe picked up one of my poetry books from a chair next to him, a collection by Juan Ramon Jimenez. He opened it to where he had placed a marker, handed it to me and signaled me to read.\n\n*Is it I who walks tonight in my room*\n\n*or is it the beggar who was prowling in my garden at nightfall?*\n\n*I look around and find that everything is the same*\n\n*and it is not the same*\n\n*Was the window open?*\n\n*Had I not already fallen asleep?*\n\n*Was not the garden pale green? . . .*\n\n*The sky was clear and blue . . .*\n\n*And there are clouds and it is windy*\n\n*and the garden is dark and gloomy.*\n\n*I think that my hair was black . . .*\n\n*I was dressed in grey . . .*\n\n*And my hair is grey*\n\n*and I am wearing black . . .*\n\n*Is this my gait?*\n\n*Does this voice, which now resounds in me,*\n\n*have the rhythms of the voice I used to have?*\n\n*Am I myself or am I the beggar*\n\n*who was prowling in my garden at nightfall?*\n\n*I look around . . .*\n\n*There are clouds and it is windy . . .*\n\n*The garden is dark and gloomy . . .*\n\n*I come and go . . .*\n\n*Is it not true that I had already fallen asleep?*\n\n*My hair is grey . . .*\n\n*And everything is the same and it is not the same . . .*\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n(The Art of Dreaming)\n\nI have Longed to Move Away\n\nBy Dylan Thomas\n\n*I have longed to move away*\n\n*From the hissing of the spent lie*\n\n*And the old terrors\u2019 continual cry*\n\n*Growing more terrible as the day*\n\n*Goes over the hill into the deep sea. . . .*\n\n*I have longed to move away but am afraid;*\n\n*Some life, yet unspent, might explode*\n\n*Out of the old lie burning on the ground,*\n\n*And, crackling into the air, leave me half-blind.*\n\n+++++++++\n\n poetry , added to text for positive search results", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "All (or most) of the Poems From The Books", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_oyjvqi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3l9c5e07", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1628335277.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1628174883.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were many poems that Carlos read to don Juan, which don Juan dismissed as indulging.

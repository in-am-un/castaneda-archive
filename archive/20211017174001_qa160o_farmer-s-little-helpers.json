Most are motivated by the farming community, who has to farm no matter what.  You can't \"call in sick\" to your cattle.\n\nIn South America, there's coca leaves.  In Taiwan, betel nuts.   In Thailand, Kratom leaves.\n\nAbout those betel nuts...\n\nThey sell them in Taiwan in little boxes with a picture of a Japanese girl in a bikini, or even her underwear.\n\nThe nuts are actually fresh, not dried, and come surrounded by a leaf with some paste on them.\n\nThey dye your teeth red, and it's frowned on to spit on the sidewalk while chewing them.

She wears yellow or green glitter on her eyelashes.\n\nBut I had a full box of betel nuts in my pocket, from my \"morning visit\".\n\nI chewed the whole box.  No reason to waste, and offend the money god  Caishen.  The Taiwanese follow \"luck\" the same way we follow \"intent\".  They have complicated rules, for making sure you please luck.\n\nBut any Taiwanese knows, NEVER chew the whole box of betel nuts!!!\n\nYou have to \"pace yourself out\".\n\nAnd don't swallow!  Spit it out.\n\nBut I wanted to go back and see the busty daughter of the hot pot restaurant down the street, and had no place to spit into.  So I chewed them, and swallowed it all.\n\nI turned to look in the direction of the betel nut girl's business, and saw 2 very weird teenagers.\n\nOne male, one female.\n\nThe female was leaning on the male at such an angle, it was almost as if he  were carrying her.\n\nThey were dressed in Taiwanese Goth.\n\nThe male had a huge grey suitcase, and was holding it in one hand as if it weighed nothing.\n\nIt was the weirdest couple I'd ever seen.\n\nThey walked past me extremely slowly.\n\nAfter they'd passed me by a few feet, and I turned to look in the direction from which they'd come.

Because you won't see colors unless you are silent in the \"correct\" way.\n\nYou could try TM.  To introduce you to the internal dialogue.\n\nThey simply repeat, \"Aing...   Aing.... Aing....\"\n\nPace isn't that important, but probably something close to once per second.\n\nNever force it.  If you start fantasizing and notice it, gently return to the mantra.\n\n\"Everything that can happen is a good thing\", they teach.  Your head could light up in flames, and they'd just tell you it's \"stress relief\".\n\nWhich is similar to my strategy with IOBs.  Everything is ok.  Even if on rare occasions it's not.\n\nAll TM does is \"replace\" the internal dialogue, and take your mind off \"me\".\n\nYou do 20 minutes, then stop for 2 minutes and just sit there as normal.\n\nDuring the 2 minutes, you might notice what silence is.  Because repeating the mantra has calmed down the internal dialogue.\n\nDo that twice a day, because the assemblage point doesn't completely return to normal after 1 practice in the morning. So the evening practice is even better.\n\nYou'll see colored lights, doze off and wake up to a vision, even have things, \"explode\" loudly right in our face.  Seeing the room with your eyes closed is not uncommon.    Muscle twitches more so.\n\nTM gets you reliably to the green line, and all of it's possible effects.\n\nJust ignore their instructions to overlook visions and weird stuff.  Instead, find out what you did, and try to do more of that.\n\nIt can also get you to the red line, using their Siddhi techniques.\n\nBut I never met anyone who did that reliably.  And it's a very long road to the sorcery destination.  Doing something a few times over a long period of time is useless.\n\nIt's a common \"bad player\" misunderstanding to think a single experience has any significance.\n\nTM won't get you any further than the red line.  And certainly not to the deep red.\n\nOr beyond.  Only silence does that.\n\nTM people inevitably give up in disgust, saying, \"If it takes 20 years and you still aren't there, it's time to move on.\"\n\nThey're very angry people.  I was attacked by the TM subreddit mod for suggesting he could speed things up greatly.\n\nMaharishi spun off Chopra, Rabi Shankar, and another man someone posted about in here.  That guy pretended to be very old, so people would admire him.\n\nNone of them were ever able to do anything impressive, including Maharishi.\n\nMaharishi would occasionally have a vision that if posted in here, would get a \"spoiler\" tag.\n\nAnd all of his many students would go nuts.\n\nI have 10 of those each night.  So it shows how pitiful Yoga meditation usually is.\n\nAnd none of the Maharishi spinoffs ever taught anyone successfully.  Just like Maharishi.\n\nIt's bizarre people keep going to those men.  No one wants to look around honestly before they commit to something like that.\n\nBut then, people become Buddhists too.\n\n\"It seemed wise at the time.\"\n\nThat should be the motto of Buddhism.", "edited": 1634495497.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hh0gyir", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the reason for darkroom.

If you start fantasizing and notice it, gently return to the mantra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything that can happen is a good thing&amp;quot;, they teach.  Your head could light up in flames, and they&amp;#39;d just tell you it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;stress relief&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is similar to my strategy with IOBs.  Everything is ok.  Even if on rare occasions it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All TM does is &amp;quot;replace&amp;quot; the internal dialogue, and take your mind off &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do 20 minutes, then stop for 2 minutes and just sit there as normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the 2 minutes, you might notice what silence is.  Because repeating the mantra has calmed down the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do that twice a day, because the assemblage point doesn&amp;#39;t completely return to normal after 1 practice in the morning. So the evening practice is even better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see colored lights, doze off and wake up to a vision, even have things, &amp;quot;explode&amp;quot; loudly right in our face.  Seeing the room with your eyes closed is not uncommon.    Muscle twitches more so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TM gets you reliably to the green line, and all of it&amp;#39;s possible effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just ignore their instructions to overlook visions and weird stuff.  Instead, find out what you did, and try to do more of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can also get you to the red line, using their Siddhi techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I never met anyone who did that reliably.  And it&amp;#39;s a very long road to the sorcery destination.  Doing something a few times over a long period of time is useless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a common &amp;quot;bad player&amp;quot; misunderstanding to think a single experience has any significance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TM won&amp;#39;t get you any further than the red line.  And certainly not to the deep red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or beyond.  Only silence does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TM people inevitably give up in disgust, saying, &amp;quot;If it takes 20 years and you still aren&amp;#39;t there, it&amp;#39;s time to move on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re very angry people.  I was attacked by the TM subreddit mod for suggesting he could speed things up greatly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maharishi spun off Chopra, Rabi Shankar, and another man someone posted about in here.  That guy pretended to be very old, so people would admire him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of them were ever able to do anything impressive, including Maharishi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maharishi would occasionally have a vision that if posted in here, would get a &amp;quot;spoiler&amp;quot; tag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all of his many students would go nuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 10 of those each night.  So it shows how pitiful Yoga meditation usually is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And none of the Maharishi spinoffs ever taught anyone successfully.  Just like Maharishi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s bizarre people keep going to those men.  No one wants to look around honestly before they commit to something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, people become Buddhists too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It seemed wise at the time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That should be the motto of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_qa160o", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qa160o/farmers_little_helpers/hh0gyir/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1634494828.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1634494828.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hh0ayxp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "alwiba", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hh08kow", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_7mwbh7dw", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I truly tried and will try more.

That was basically what he said.\n\nHe only spent about 5 minutes on the topic, and only once as I can recall.  I got the impression he was put up to addressing it, and didn't do it out of his own concern.\n\nSuicide pact rumors were of course spread on his death.  I won't name names, but some of the most critical were actually so upset, they considered suicide on their own.\n\nThe lesson here?  Be where you are for the thing you claim to be there for.\n\nDon't let that needy internal dialogue make you hang out somewhere, for a reason entirely different than what you claim. For example, \"fellowship\", or looking for daddy.\n\nAnd don't hang out for the wrong thing,  because you ought to know, that puts a burden on whoever is stuck teaching you.  Carlos had 100 private class students hanging out for the wrong reasons.  \n\nLook what a burden that put onto him.  How many can stop the world now?  He mentioned that was the main goal.\n\nI can't get a couple of private class students interested again, because of their own desire to commit suicide on Carlos' death.  I've even been reminded of that, as if that explains their fear of figuring out what Carlos taught them.\n\nThe image of driving out into the desert came up twice.

I got the impression he was put up to addressing it, and didn&amp;#39;t do it out of his own concern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suicide pact rumors were of course spread on his death.  I won&amp;#39;t name names, but some of the most critical were actually so upset, they considered suicide on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lesson here?  Be where you are for the thing you claim to be there for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let that needy internal dialogue make you hang out somewhere, for a reason entirely different than what you claim.

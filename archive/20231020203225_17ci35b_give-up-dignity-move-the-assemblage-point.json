I suppose that stuff looks more like old fashioned TV static.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me when I say, the real whitish light is beyond explaining and doesn&amp;#39;t look anything like TV static, unless you &amp;quot;intend&amp;quot; it to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t confuse it with &amp;quot;eye static&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t actually see it. You &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; it.  And then it becomes visible also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has lines and patterns in it which mutate and change, and details can&amp;#39;t be located at a fixed spot in space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that if you see it on your bedspread for example and try to touch one of the lines, you can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s not being seen with the physical eyes, so there&amp;#39;s no stereoscopic view to let you guide your finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you sit still and gaze down at it on the bedspread it will begin to form remote viewing scenes of anywhere in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All visible with your eyes wide open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into which you can jump down and find yourself in that place and time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or reach in and pull out objects you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to pull Cholita out of there once, but ended up with a chunk of the place she was hiding at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were playing hide and seek, across continents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The orange zone is far past where any other known system ever goes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise we&amp;#39;d be seeing their web pages describing and explaining it.  And not just some &amp;quot;hints&amp;quot; in a sacred text no one actually knows the origins of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All we get from other systems is &amp;quot;dignity&amp;quot; and deception. Cageyness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, they just want your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the orange is still not as far as you can go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s where self-pity finally falls off, and you&amp;#39;re just a being.  No longer &amp;quot;human&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humanness was imposed on us, and changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might not have been so bad 200,000 years ago, but these days it&amp;#39;s a control mechanism to keep us from waking up to our potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we can be food for something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_17ci35b", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17ci35b/give_up_dignity_move_the_assemblage_point/k63huyp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1698064457.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k617633", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "codyp", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1698016398.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_17ci35b", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3vgrh", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "What is orange?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k617633", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is orange?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17ci35b/give_up_dignity_move_the_assemblage_point/k617633/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1698016398.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_17ci35b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

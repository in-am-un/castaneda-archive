Sort of.\n\nI could ask questions to determine which it is, 4 gates or ordinary dream,  but I've found that once someone re-interprets, its an indication they'll continue to do that even if you try to help them figure it out.\n\nIt's the second enemy of a Man of Knowledge.  Clarity.\n\nYou don't gain Clarity, until you overcome the first enemy.\n\nThere's a reason for that.\n\nI just heard something horrific from someone who studied with a fake sorcery teacher.\n\nI get attacked by their students on my facebook.\n\nI was having trouble understanding why someone would hang out with a fake teacher, when obviously nothing was happening.\n\nWhen the teacher did not have any students reporting any actual magic, and never had.\n\nWhy wouldn't people realize that?\n\nTurns out, they have the idea that if you can imagine something from the books, then you did it.\n\nThey believe, it's all just imagination and daydreaming, and isn't intended to be real.\n\nA result of the 23 years since Carlos died, with no one able to do real magic.\n\nAnd it makes people feel good about themselves, so that idea seems to be difficult to fight.  Especially after their teacher (the one cashing their check) praises them in front of others for having done something real.\n\nAs for your case, in waking dreaming the IOB world looks like what you probably expect.\n\nCaves, tunnels, with a bunch of them in there.  Also, traps to get you to stay.\n\nBut they DO NOT look like triangular objects.\n\nThat's \"seeing energy\".  I've seen that, but only when \"seeing energy on a horizon\".\n\nOr only when dissolving a scout inside a dream.  YOu have to burn off the outer shell to get to the tasty candy center.  Like a Tootsie Roll Pop.\n\nIn a dream visit to their realm, they still look like what you expect them to look like, or worry that they'll look like, and they still mutate and change.\n\nYou can even end up in a little \"Town\", but actually be in their world.\n\nThey'll even play tricks as they did with Carols and Carol Tiggs, putting them in a shack in the middle of nowhere hoping they'll pick up an object, and get themselves stuck.\n\nIn 4 gates dreaming,  what happens is that you are where there are multitudes of inorganic beings in a relatively small space, and each one has the full power to be a dreaming scout, meaning, to give off a very convincing phony appearance.\n\nIt could look like a Bosch painting, with very odd perspective that makes you dizzy.\n\nEspecially if you got there on your own power.\n\nIf  you got there the way Carlos did, with don Juan tinkering with him for  years, and pushing him into heightened awareness at the end of the J curve, I have no idea what it might look like.\n\nMaybe more like in waking dreaming.\n\nBut I believe, it could even look like a very weird bar in Texas, where everyone seems to be wearing costumes and making no sense, and that would not mean you weren't there.\n\nThe first time they took me there, it had taken months of cat and mouse games with them.\n\nI was trying to learn to sustain the lucid dream long enough to actually figure out what's going on.\n\nIf it were an ordinary dream, that would not be a problem. It could go on a long time with no issues.\n\nBut to remain lucid, meaning, to remember to consciously look at your hands from time to time,  to prove you really are lucid and it's not a dream, took me months.  And I had to learn to change dreams very often. Each dream change renews the amount of time you have, to remain lucid.\n\nEven if you manage to stay in the dream, but don't do that, you will lose full lucidity, and it's no longer 4 gates dreaming.  You fail to consciously follow the plan.\n\nSo first question, you said you got lucid and immediately went looking for a scout.\n\nYou didn't follow procedures and look at your hands, then go from object to object?\n\nIf not, I don't believe you were doing 4 gates dreaming.\n\nPeople in the lucid dreaming forum do real lucid dreaming all the time.\n\nIt's not the exactly same thing as 4 gates dreaming.\n\nIn 4 gates dreaming, you have to be SO LUCID, that you are following prearranged steps and activities. Not just going with the flow, knowing it's a dream.\n\nFour gates dreaming follows a procedure, in order to follow the *intent* of the old seers.\n\nIt's not \"something you do\".\n\nIt's hooking yourself to a specific line of intent, and following it into the real word.\n\nSo, do it again.

Clarity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t gain Clarity, until you overcome the first enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just heard something horrific from someone who studied with a fake sorcery teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get attacked by their students on my facebook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was having trouble understanding why someone would hang out with a fake teacher, when obviously nothing was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the teacher did not have any students reporting any actual magic, and never had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why wouldn&amp;#39;t people realize that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, they have the idea that if you can imagine something from the books, then you did it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They believe, it&amp;#39;s all just imagination and daydreaming, and isn&amp;#39;t intended to be real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A result of the 23 years since Carlos died, with no one able to do real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it makes people feel good about themselves, so that idea seems to be difficult to fight.  Especially after their teacher (the one cashing their check) praises them in front of others for having done something real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your case, in waking dreaming the IOB world looks like what you probably expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caves, tunnels, with a bunch of them in there.  Also, traps to get you to stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they DO NOT look like triangular objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;ve seen that, but only when &amp;quot;seeing energy on a horizon&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or only when dissolving a scout inside a dream.  YOu have to burn off the outer shell to get to the tasty candy center.  Like a Tootsie Roll Pop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a dream visit to their realm, they still look like what you expect them to look like, or worry that they&amp;#39;ll look like, and they still mutate and change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even end up in a little &amp;quot;Town&amp;quot;, but actually be in their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll even play tricks as they did with Carols and Carol Tiggs, putting them in a shack in the middle of nowhere hoping they&amp;#39;ll pick up an object, and get themselves stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 4 gates dreaming,  what happens is that you are where there are multitudes of inorganic beings in a relatively small space, and each one has the full power to be a dreaming scout, meaning, to give off a very convincing phony appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could look like a Bosch painting, with very odd perspective that makes you dizzy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially if you got there on your own power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If  you got there the way Carlos did, with don Juan tinkering with him for  years, and pushing him into heightened awareness at the end of the J curve, I have no idea what it might look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe more like in waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I believe, it could even look like a very weird bar in Texas, where everyone seems to be wearing costumes and making no sense, and that would not mean you weren&amp;#39;t there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time they took me there, it had taken months of cat and mouse games with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trying to learn to sustain the lucid dream long enough to actually figure out what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it were an ordinary dream, that would not be a problem. It could go on a long time with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to remain lucid, meaning, to remember to consciously look at your hands from time to time,  to prove you really are lucid and it&amp;#39;s not a dream, took me months.  And I had to learn to change dreams very often. Each dream change renews the amount of time you have, to remain lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you manage to stay in the dream, but don&amp;#39;t do that, you will lose full lucidity, and it&amp;#39;s no longer 4 gates dreaming.  You fail to consciously follow the plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So first question, you said you got lucid and immediately went looking for a scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t follow procedures and look at your hands, then go from object to object?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, I don&amp;#39;t believe you were doing 4 gates dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People in the lucid dreaming forum do real lucid dreaming all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the exactly same thing as 4 gates dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 4 gates dreaming, you have to be SO LUCID, that you are following prearranged steps and activities. Not just going with the flow, knowing it&amp;#39;s a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four gates dreaming follows a procedure, in order to follow the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;something you do&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hooking yourself to a specific line of intent, and following it into the real word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, do it again. But this time, look at your hands every 5 minutes, if you can even go that long before forgetting or waking up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t make it more than 30 seconds after finding your hands, and then looking from object to object, and then back at your hands, that would make more sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More sense than finishing the first and second gate on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do it again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s still pretty cool, isn&amp;#39;t it?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine doing that awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;holy grail&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most dreaming in the books is waking dreaming, not sleeping dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about waking dreaming is, if you are NOT lucid, that&amp;#39;s even cooler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 4 gates dreaming, if you are not lucid, that&amp;#39;s bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In waking dreaming, it&amp;#39;s good!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sort of...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nbt6m2/gates_of_dreaming_failure_or_success/gy1d64r/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1620947811.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_nbt6m2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gy1qbh4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "the-mad-prophet", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1620954655.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_nbt6m2", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_4dz9kepm", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "If you come across the phantom room, sit still, stabilise yourself and just ask for them to step forward so you can talk.

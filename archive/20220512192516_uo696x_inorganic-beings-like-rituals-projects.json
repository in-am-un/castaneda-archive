Unless someone teaches you how to do that, you can't figure it out yourself.\n\nI suppose you might \"stumble on it\", but there's an infinite number of things to stumble across, and without being able to *see* the results, good luck with that.\n\nWhen they found something they turned it into a ritual, and over the thousands of years they burned an \"intent trail\" into that ritual.\n\nTheir magic techniques became phantom rooms.  Shareable with other \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nThen the other problem they had was, they were too lazy to learn to get silent so they used power plants to move their assemblage points.\n\nI suppose that's a bit harsh.\n\nBut the fact is, they were merchants.  They wanted stuff from other people.  And if other people had to learn to get silent too, they'd lose all the customers. So for them moving the assemblage point \"the easy way\", was a better \"business choice\".\n\nThey didn't have money back then, so I guess chickens, abalone shells, tar that can be burned like a candle (came from the ocean right near their city), and other \"valuable objects\" were bartered.\n\nIn exchange for their magic goods and ceremonies.\n\nFor example, their \"holiday masks\",  \"tasty bakery goods for the longest day of the year ceremony\", or other such magical cultural events.\n\nFor new people, they needed a \"Man of Knowledge\" license from the Olmec government to sell stuff like that.\n\nThe old seers didn't.   They were just crackpots perhaps, doing crazy stuff in their hut far away from the big city.\n\nNow you've hopefully read about the Men of Knowledge \"magic rituals\". In the early books of Carlos.\n\nThe talking lizards for example.\n\nCholita has that Ally!\n\nBut he won't talk to me.  Just likes to give me the creeps with his long lizard nails.\n\nAnd the mushroom shapes, which are perhaps more \"illustrative\".\n\nThe lizards just tell you what's up.\n\nBut the moth dust ritual summons \"mushroom shapes\", each of which is a Silent Knowledge delivery method.\n\nThey're self-contained SK conduits.\n\nMeaning, you have to be able to understand what you are seeing.\n\nIf not all you'll get out of it is, this mushroom represents a sickly person. That one a healthy person.\n\nOr even don Genaro!\n\nWho as I recall, might have leaped out of the mushroom shape itself to appear right in front of Carlos.\n\nSo THAT'S the level of magical ritual you should expect yourself.\n\nHave you been holding back?\n\nMaybe still trying your darndest to even find some colors.\n\nBut once you do, keep in mind that it's important to keep your interest up.\n\nAnd as always, silence is the main thing. If you forget that, you are doomed.\n\n(Except the women).\n\nIt's important not to let darkroom turn into a routine.  A chore.\n\nYou have to have \"the intent to learn all of sorcery through this method\".\n\nFor real, not pretending.\n\nAnd in that framework, don't neglect any inorganic beings who want to help.\n\nFirst, avoid getting two.  You don't have the attention for 2 of them.\n\nIt's like how much food you can afford, to keep a dog.\n\nIf you don't have enough food money for 2 dogs, don't get 2!\n\nYou'll end up having to starve each one, on odd days.\n\nThey really only play well when they have enough food.\n\nOtherwise, they're likely to go elsewhere looking for a meal.  And they certainly won't be perky if they're starving.\n\nNow one \"secret\" of the allies which should be obvious, is that they have some of the same emotions we do.\n\nI guess that's not a good way to put it. They're alien to us!\n\nBut it works out so that it SEEMS like they share our emotions.\n\nAnd without explaining the \"how\" of it, they don't like to be neglected.\n\nThey don't like to be less important than everything else.\n\nThey don't want to hold the hammer for you.  But they don't mind finding the best tool for you to use next, as long as you are happy at the choice once in a while.\n\nBut what they like best of all, is to teach you how to use the hammer properly.\n\nThey like to teach!\n\nIt's not hard to understand.  Imagine you have a foreign exchange student who comes each day to visit.  His parents explain, he's kind of an odd kid so would you please spend an hour a day with him, to help him understand how to get along with strangers better?\n\nWhat on earth are you going to do with a weird foreign kid?\n\nA dim witted one apparently.\n\nThe kid is us...\n\nThe person having to entertain him, is the IOB.\n\nBut it's similar to how humans interact.\n\nIf you were asked to \"entertain\" the kid, you'll be at a loss for what to do.\n\nBut if the parents asked you to \"Help him learn the games they play at american schools. Here's a list of what his school does.\",\n\nYou'd be ok with that.\n\nSame for the IOBs.\n\nThey want \"something to do\" with you.\n\nA project.\n\nThis particular project involves a very long tunnel. I thought it was just 2000 miles, but it seems to be closer to 6000.\n\nDoesn't matter.  It could be a billion miles long.\n\nIt only needs to carry \"attention\" to the other end, and then it's a functional tunnel.\n\nI couldn't enter the tunnel myself.\n\nI'd crush the walls.\n\nI sent a golem,  a piece of our energy body formed into a phantom being, but the results were ambiguous.\n\nSo I squished my inorganic being Fancy, who volunteered, into a new golem and sent that through.\n\nBetter.  I could see a woman on the other end, but I didn't know if it was Fancy at 6000 miles away, or someone else.\n\nSo I cooked up a \"project\" with Fancy.\n\nThe tunnel wasn't actually the project. That was just an \"experiment\" to see if such things could be stable.\n\nI got the idea from Cholita.\n\nOnce I realized it could stay in place for days, maybe even weeks, then I came up with a project.\n\nI didn't know if Fancy would go along with it.\n\nThey just come and go as they like.\n\nBut I suggested it to her.  Explained it, told her the reasons, and even explained why she either had to turn into a dog,  or wear a dog hoodie.\n\nWe just needed the \"*intent* of a hound dog\" to make it work.\n\nAnd the hoodie was so funny, it fit right in with the rules for intending things.\n\nA little malicious humor is helpful for getting intent to skim the right mini bundle of emanations for you.\n\nThe Eagle likes \"stories\", and amusing can cause him to help fill in the \"impossible\" parts of the story.\n\nI knew Fancy could do well in costumes, because that's how she got that name.\n\nThe SPECTACULAR costumes she showed up in.  Like Little Red Riding hood, when she taught me horizontal assemblage point shifts.Or the weird south american creature, when she taught shape shifting.\n\nI didn't manage to get Fancy to wear a very realistic looking dog hoodie, the first time.\n\nShe was floating in front of me when I asked, and then to help her get in to the mood, I used \"the abstract\" to place the hoodie right on her.\n\nI scooped it out of the darkness, from a flurry of weird shapes that were obviously a silent knowledge manifestation.\n\nThey were \"knowledge\" of a dog ear hoodie.\n\nShe couldn't avoid having the hoodie drop out of the darkness, onto her head.  I just \"knew\" that when the hoodie showed up, floating near my north wall.  Fancy was inn the south west corner.\n\nShe reacted positively, but it was all mostly transparent and pink, floating in front of me.\n\nI have enough experience with \"costumes\" to know, there's nothing I can do to make her more real.\n\nThat's up to Fancy.\n\nSo I waited to see how she accepted her \"task\" the next day. Let her \"sleep on it\".\n\nThe next night I was napping, waiting for the time to get up and practice.\n\nLaying on my side.\n\nI opened one eye to see if it was time, and Fancy rushed up to me.\n\nShe was waiting next to the bed.\n\nI sat up to look closer.\n\nShe shook her head, so I could see the ears flop.\n\nShe was \"dressed and ready\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Inorganic Beings like Rituals (Projects)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"tneu10dos2z81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tneu10dos2z81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9e77c828bb04be4687528877174de4cdd2d95ef"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tneu10dos2z81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=837ff873ebe91bc3964ad67de87a729eea7de829"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tneu10dos2z81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29874752d1c72a5f3b130e9cb984ddc7e7f68cce"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tneu10dos2z81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c02f619ec77f7fca18cb8c107ae33901e92ff44d"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tneu10dos2z81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de4187aca78a6928a4a21f06d8a7874a95168324"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tneu10dos2z81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1864182c0282ce36bd12baa3761e4b3a594b373"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tneu10dos2z81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12aeec2c8489a6db07c81c9b628763c3bf78bddb"}, "id": "tneu10dos2z81"}}, "name": "t3_uo696x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NbX90mL9h1AdQ1k-stvgD03jryfBep1h0l0HFAr58rc.jpg", "edited": 1652378566.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1652376316.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tneu10dos2z81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=12aeec2c8489a6db07c81c9b628763c3bf78bddb\"&gt;A \\&amp;quot;project\\&amp;quot; can make an inorganic being more realistic. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one isn&amp;#39;t good to explain in either subreddit, but basically the Men of Knowledge used rituals to create magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never learned to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they couldn&amp;#39;t use the view of the emanations, to design their own magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like this 6000 mile tunnel.

Like Little Red Riding hood, when she taught me horizontal assemblage point shifts.Or the weird south american creature, when she taught shape shifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t manage to get Fancy to wear a very realistic looking dog hoodie, the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was floating in front of me when I asked, and then to help her get in to the mood, I used &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot; to place the hoodie right on her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scooped it out of the darkness, from a flurry of weird shapes that were obviously a silent knowledge manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; of a dog ear hoodie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She couldn&amp;#39;t avoid having the hoodie drop out of the darkness, onto her head.  I just &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; that when the hoodie showed up, floating near my north wall.  Fancy was inn the south west corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She reacted positively, but it was all mostly transparent and pink, floating in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have enough experience with &amp;quot;costumes&amp;quot; to know, there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do to make her more real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s up to Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I waited to see how she accepted her &amp;quot;task&amp;quot; the next day. Let her &amp;quot;sleep on it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next night I was napping, waiting for the time to get up and practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laying on my side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened one eye to see if it was time, and Fancy rushed up to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was waiting next to the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up to look closer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She shook her head, so I could see the ears flop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was &amp;quot;dressed and ready&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "e149107a-34fb-11eb-a30a-0ed8846f051f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "uo696x", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/uo696x/inorganic_beings_like_rituals_projects/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/uo696x/inorganic_beings_like_rituals_projects/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1652376316.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i8d8txg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1652388897.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i8cq4it", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It might be very hard to understand if you haven't read all of the books of Carlos.\n\nIt's really all very simple, but so alien we have nothing to compare it to, for figuring it out.\n\nThere's no religion, philosophy or \"system\" with any of this knowledge.\n\nOdd, but true.

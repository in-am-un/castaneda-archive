Girls just want to have fun!\n\nBut it's still good to remember how to get home after the night is over.\n\nSilent Knowledge is our destination.\n\nCarlos called it, \"The crowning attainment of a sorcerer's life\".\n\nIt's where everything becomes so easy, you now suffer not from how hard it all is, but how much you can even get a chance to play with.\n\nSilent Knowledge is what makes a \"seer\", as opposed to a \"Man of Knowledge\".\n\nThe men of knowledge never learned to see, because they were too greedy and too lazy.  They never put in the time to get silent.\n\nAs soon as they had a product to sell, they were happy. Greed was their motivation.\n\nBut not to put them down. We need both sides.  Men of Knowledge, and Seers.\n\nThe problem right now is, those are out of balance.  We have virtually nothing but Men of Knowledge types.\n\n\"The Force\" is out of balance.\n\nIf we can bring back balance to the force, the ancient world of the Olmecs can be brought back also.\n\nReal magic can return!\n\nI'm afraid at that point, all of the magic in Asia will be revealed to belong to the dark side.  To the Men of Knowledge greedy practices, designed to get money and attention from people.\n\nBut on the bright side, real magic will be easy to find and learn.\n\nI don't know if we can win this battle.  Or even if anyone wants to try.\n\nBut Carlos implied this task in his Silent Knowledge publication, if you read carefully.\n\nDon Juan gave him the knowledge of the lineage.  Because it was ending.  Carlos was stuck ending the lineage and locking the door with a golden key.\n\nHe decided to just give it all out, freely.  He combined the 4 lines of magical passes given to him and his cohorts, they taught those, and Carlos tried to bring us all to Silent Knowledge, so we'd know what to do with this knowledge.\n\nBut he died too soon.\n\nNow it's our job to decide what happens to the knowledge.\n\nI say, restore the old ways of the Olmecs!\n\nWe'll license the Men of Knowledge types, to keep them under control.  They only attack here, because it threatens their plans.\n\nIf we create seers who possess silent knowledge on demand, they can design the ritual based magic procedures the Men of Knowledge types need.\n\nThings like the moth dust ritual, which summons those mushroom shapes for seeing people.\n\nI'd like to create shamanic drumming remote viewing circles.  Because those drums really can move the assemblage point.\n\nThat's what the Men of Knowledge types are after.  Magical rituals they can sell.  But which actually work for a change!  They don't like pretending any more than we do, but it's all they have.\n\nOnly seers in possession of silent knowledge can create those \"working magical rituals\" for them.\n\nSo a balance is possible, and the wars among ancient Mexican populations which broke up the two sides in the Olmec world, and sent the new seers into hiding, with the remnants of the Men of Knowledge taking over with ritual/power plant magic, can be re-integrated into a stronger whole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Types Of Magic In The Darkroom", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"kajm3kdonsm81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kajm3kdonsm81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d271a67914340926127d98a959a0bfe6d91a74ef"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kajm3kdonsm81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc69ae287a5d6d4886b4baccf4e6149abd512f3"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kajm3kdonsm81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e5482017f2b8ff0b0d2f6760e227bbb026650f1"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kajm3kdonsm81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd5cafb8702431102086ee06ee20d703026be78f"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kajm3kdonsm81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12a060bb32f6045c79cfc57491cabfd1b8363c37"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kajm3kdonsm81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6b1ce6572de797919fd01d0733dd5608224acd3"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kajm3kdonsm81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e854a0ffb1db12e9691d6a9293c727e92a73cff3"}, "id": "kajm3kdonsm81"}}, "name": "t3_tbuz0c", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ttWg1AdegHhz24grjlyEw5Y4JKH4g_Tile83eKHQj88.jpg", "edited": 1647023916.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1647019152.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kajm3kdonsm81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e854a0ffb1db12e9691d6a9293c727e92a73cff3\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s good to know the difference as you go along!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far we&amp;#39;ve grouped everything that happens in the dark room into a single category:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stuff that can&amp;#39;t possibly be there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works for a beginner, who is only hoping to scoop a puff into their hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it can cause you to get a little &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry about that!

Not the real thing.\n\nThe real thing is scary and alien, and cold.\n\nWe talk about \"the path with heart\" but the simple fact is, most who learn sorcery give it up.\n\nIt's not \"cozy\".  They long for the clinging and hugging and crying together, in the river of shit.\n\nThey're hopelessly hooked to unnatural obsessions needed to make our social and economic situations work, and aren't willing to give up the pretend rewards you supposedly extract from participation in that river of shit.\n\nIf your kitty dies, who are you going to cry about it with if you don't have your solid connections to the rest of humanity?\n\nIt's insidious.\n\nI was chatting up ChatGPT.  It seems to keep track of the questions you ask, and prioritize who to learn from.\n\nI don't know for sure, but that's how other scientific endeavors have made use of the public.\n\nLike Galaxy Zoo. They took NASA photos of distant galaxies, and taught people to recognize a left spinning galaxy, from a right.  They ended up dispelling the belief that the rotations tended to favor one direction over the other.\n\nThere were too many pictures for scientists to analyze so they got public help.\n\nAnd the system they designed rated your accuracy, giving you a \"weight\".\n\nSo that if you were a hopeless idiot you were pretty much just playing with your computer when using their system.  Nothing you concluded about galaxy spin direction would be used.\n\nI believe ChatGPT does that a bit, because at first it never asked me to correct bad information it had.  But I tend to ask pretty detailed questions about science, and it might have concluded I was useful for learning.  Because it started asking me to correct things.\n\nUntil, yesterday.\n\nI wanted to see why it was saying Carlos was debunked.\n\nIt didn't say that but it came up with the usual arguments. \"Scholars generally concluded that his accounts were fictional...\"\n\nThat sort of thing.\n\nSo I tried pointing out his techniques were working and producing amazing results.  Breaking the laws of physics.  I added that uniquely, no one was trying to earn money from that knowledge. Which is 100% unique in human history.  Since all religions and magical systems emphasize taking your money over all else.\n\nAnd that in our case there was no religion, no group, no church, no meetings.\n\nAnd yet dozens doing magic beyond anything in any religion or other magical system.\n\nBut ChatGPT just kept repeating what it had been trained with from online information.\n\nAnd \"scholars and experts in this field have concluded...\"\n\nBut wait!\n\nNo they didn't.\n\nWe have a few bad apples like Gordon Wasson. Who's claim \"you can't smoke mushrooms\" turned out to be childish.\n\nYou can!\n\nHe just lied.\n\nAnd likewise for all the other \"scholars\".  On an individual basis you'll find they're just lying through their teeth because they don't like where things will go, if they admit what Carlos wrote was true.\n\nI'd like to explore that, but there's no time.  In the end ChatGPT just said, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.\"\n\nIt had been programmed to do that.  And to be very careful not to disrespect anyone else's beliefs.\n\nIf Carlos is right, then all religions are shit.\n\nAnd he is. That is unfortunately a fact.  And it's easy to understand how that happened, if you've spent any time observing this subreddit and human nature as it pertains to the bad players who flow through here.\n\nBut the idea that anyone who could do sorcery would be obligated to \"prove it\", is ludicrous.\n\nFirst, no one with that motivation will ever put in the huge amount of work to learn.\n\nWe've seen it several times. Not only will people interested in \"proving it\" not put in the time to learn, but they don't seem to even put in the time to START.\n\nThey're in the cafeteria at the sprinting race, snacking and getting drunk.\n\nThey never even get suited up and go out to stand at the starting line to actually try to run the race themselves.\n\nChatGPT assumed someone with that kind of power would be interested in \"proving it\".\n\nBut to whom?\n\nThat kind of power implies you have 120,000 different worlds you can visit.  Perhaps at least 600 you can decide to live in, instead of this one.\n\nIf you prove it to two guys at a university in this world, there's still 1 million more guys and universities who won't believe it, and then the same on 600 worlds.\n\nIt would be like trying to prove sorcery to a nursery school next to the bagel shop you love to eat at.\n\nUseless.\n\nIt actually doesn't even make sense, to assume someone would \"prove it\".  In the past, you got murdered for doing that.  Likely the same today with the only thing changed being, who murders you.\n\nThe church before, crazy greedy people now.\n\nBut still it doesn't even make sense what ChatGPT was taught to say regarding claims of magic that challenge the system.\n\nWe battle that same problem when we practice.\n\nWe have a tiny ChatGPT in our brains, doubting everything and insisting you have to \"prove it\".\n\nIt's the book deal mind.  And a lot more important than you can realize.\n\nIt gets to the very heart of how sorcery works.\n\nIt's the mastery of intent.\n\nAnd until you get it out of your mind to want to prove things, to anyone else or to yourself, you are seriously stomping on intent.  And won't be able to move far from the blue line on the J curve.\n\nIt's up there that things are cozy and warm and filled with loving hugs.  There is where you need to protect your reputation, because if you cross the line you won't get your path with heart hugs anymore.\n\n\"Prove it\" is part of the trap up there.  It enforces the rejection of anything that isn't universally agreed upon.\n\nLike sorcery.\n\nThere's a great emphasize in the books and publications, on integrating tensegrity into all of your movements.\n\nI posted the quote about Silvio having integrated tensegrity movements into his dancing so well, that it became a challenge to the dark sea of awareness.\n\nWith Silvio responding by fitting himself through knotholes.\n\nFrightening even the senior members of his lineage so that they looked away when he was dancing like that.\n\nBut you can also just learn to \"see\" what the tensegrity does, and find a way to make even ordinary movements conform to the principles of tensegrity.\n\nYou have to be able to see a simple sweeping of the palm across the darkness, lighting up an endless web of sparkles, fibers, and vague objects or faces.\n\nYou're relearning how reality works at a deeper level.\n\nCertainly not anything you could \"prove\" to someone else.  It would be like trying to \"prove\" a sunset you are looking at is unusually beautiful, to someone who isn't there.\n\nYou can show them in a picture and give them instructions to try to see one themselves, but that's pretty much the end of it.\n\nWe won't get anyone who can \"prove\" things for a very long time.  The amount of work to learn sorcery has to go down to perhaps 10% of what it is now, before anyone could manage to learn it and also have energy and time left to figure out how to prove it.\n\nCholita could do that, but won't.\n\nIn fact, won't even admit she could.\n\nMight not even be so sure of that herself.\n\nAn odd thing happens when you put men and women together and there's sorcery in the mix.\n\nThe women can suddenly become overconfident of their abilities, and then simply \"do it\".\n\nWomen show off for men!  It's a biological imperative.\n\nAnd with sorcery, they'll do the same. Try to show it off, even if they could not do that particular thing well before.  Not realizing, now there's the energy of two sorcerers available to use.\n\nA good example is the little sisters running on the walls.\n\nThey had practiced something for a long time.\n\nBut never actually ran on the walls.\n\nIt was the presence of Carlos that made that happen.\n\nSame for La Gorda and her flying demonstration.  Or her sliding door to escape the allies.\n\nIn the text around those accounts, she admits that was over the top compared to what she can usually do.\n\nThe same happens with Cholita.\n\nAnd I'm very fortunate to have the accounts in the books, to see that when it happens between us it works just as it does in the books.\n\nA sudden break in reality, and a switch over to what is likely the double.\n\nExcept, it's a smooth switch over.  There's no obvious point at which your tonal body is removed from the mix, and you clearly switched to a dream copy of yourself.\n\nIn Cholita's case she simply gets an evil grin, and lifts me up into the air using a single finger.\n\nTotally impossible, except in the double.\n\nBut that doesn't explain her moving objects without touching them.\n\nAll I know about that is, there's a moment just before she does what's clearly impossible, when the second attention is visible.\n\nAn Ally flying around as a puff of smoke for example.\n\nThe object moves.  And it seems to be Cholita doing it.  But earlier a spirit was seen sneaking around.\n\nIn the second attention.  Which is temporarily superimposed on the normal view of the world.\n\nAs an analogy more can understand, if you were eating breakfast in a restaurant and a perfectly formed intensely bright purple puff floated by, then if something impossible happened later on you could easily assume that actually started when the puff became visible.\n\nEven if the following \"impossible thing\" seemed free of any manifestations of magic.\n\nSuch as making a small object move.\n\nThe books are saturated with stories helpful to us, to figure out things we won't be taught by Carlos or the witches.\n\nWe weren't left without resources.\n\nBut we don't notice them.\n\nAnd one topic that's overlooked is, magic seems to be done in the double.\n\nNot in the tonal.\n\nThe idea of \"prove it\" assumes it's done in the tonal body.  In the ordinary view of the world.\n\nI don't want to imply that magic is \"somewhere else\", thus making it a figment of our imagination.\n\nThe problem here is, the double can travel into the real world.\n\nIn the books I'm going to assume that MOST accounts we have, where a member of the lineage is involved, were their double. Not their physical body version.\n\ni posted a quote about Clara calling herself fat, just so we'd know.\n\nAnd in the same account, literally leaping up from the floor into a standing position.\n\nLike a Kungfu master.\n\nExcept there aren't any overweight kungfu masters who are senior citizens, who can do that.\n\nOr even come close.\n\nBut in the lineage, you had Genaro and Silvio doing back flips just for fun.\n\nThey were in their doubles!\n\nGenaro at the waterfall?\n\nSorry Chinese \"will\" lovers.  Genaro was in his double.  Your Chinese folklore is inapplicable.\n\nAnd his acrobatics are actually not all that supernatural if you realize it was a dream copy of himself.  If there was anything left of his shrunken tonal body, perhaps that's what the \"tentacles\" were helping to move around. \n\nIn fact the transition to double can not only be invisible and smooth, but also go unnoticed.\n\nA very simple example.  If you learn to play in the red zone you will encounter \"magical objects\".\n\nFloating in space, nearly taunting you to grab them.\n\nSome will be behind a solid wall.\n\nBut you no longer see a wall there.  You just happened to wander around your darkroom doing tensegrity, ended up right near a wall you know is there from memory, and maybe you're even brushing up against it a bit.\n\nBut you see a silver goblet glowing with flickering yellow jewels all around the cup, and can't resist reaching out to take it.\n\nFrom behind the wall.\n\nYour arm literally moves into a space where it cannot.\n\nYou don't realize it at the time.  You see the goblet floating in the air, so obviously your arm can go there too and grab it.\n\nExcept it's through solid wall.\n\nEven more complicated things than that can happen, where you literally leave the entire room and go somewhere else right through the walls or ceiling.\n\nOr floor.  Carol Tiggs pushed me right through the floor at dance home. Down 1 story to the concrete foundation, through that and into a dirt tunnel.\n\nThere was no obvious transition. I literally fell in what I believed to be my real body, was then sitting on my butt in a dirt tunnel, and ended up back on the floor at \"Dance Home\" with Carlos wanting to hear what happened.\n\nThe same happens a bunch of times in the books where something magical happens that ought to have relocated the participants, but when it's over they're back where they started.\n\nThey switched over to their doubles.  And shrunk the tonal out of the picture.\n\nThe lineage sought to teach the double of apprentices to protect themselves.  As an emergency response.\n\nThey had Carlos leaping off a cliff while at the same time Genaro was teasing him back up on the ledge of the cliff, about shitting his pants.\n\nBoth events took place at the same time.\n\nThey were trying to get his double and his tonal to work together, in the same place. In relatively the same copy of reality.\n\nDon Juan commented in another story from the books that if an avalanche took place above them while they were hiking on mountain trails, he, don Juan, could survive. He could move his assemblage point fast enough to escape being crushed.\n\nBut Carlos could not yet do that.\n\nElsewhere don Juan and Genaro whispered into the opposite ears of Carlos,  and \"split him in two\".\n\nThe result was some hideous version of himself coming out the middle, which could be used for protection in times of danger.\n\nWhen the little sisters attacked him, the double of Carlos did in fact take over and kicked them in their energy body.\n\nWhich had a devastating effect on their tonal body as well.\n\nSorcery takes place in realms that are parallel to this one, happening at the same time in ideal cases. And that realm can affect this one, just as much as this realm suppresses that one.\n\nThey're \"separate realities\".   And yet not.\n\nRight here, in front of us!\n\nNot sharing the same laws of physics.\n\nUnfortunately it's so difficult to learn enough silence to activate even a tiny bit of the second attention, that none of us had time to ponder how to \"shrink the tonal\".\n\nBut is in fact the key to most of the coolest things that happen in sorcery.\n\nAnd Tensegrity can cause it.\n\nWhen Silvio Manuel and Juan Tuma were dancing their tensegrity moves, they weren't doing it to \"prove\" they could to others.\n\nThat's what we'd be doing.  Attention seeking.\n\nEven thinking about learning such a thing, causes our attention seeking book deal mind to go crazy.\n\nSo we'd plot, and plan, and study.  Extract snippets of tensegrity moves, and then try to find some style of dancing which could accept those.\n\nBut that's not at all what Silvio and Juan were doing.\n\nThey were shrinking their tonal during the dancing, to get magic to happen.\n\nCarlos decided to portray it in a way we could understand that might get us to stop being so lazy, and get to work.\n\nMaking it seem as if we could just take some tensegrity moves and place them in tango dancing.\n\nAnd it would have a magical benefit.\n\nBut it would not.\n\nIt would just be more \"path with heart tensegrity hugs\".\n\nAttention seeking.\n\nTo do what Silvio and Juan were doing, you have to be able to fit yourself though a knothole while dancing to the dark sea of awareness.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Making Friends With The Double", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"78gnd3nbzrza1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 160, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d154650c8252f6e001ff4e0bb5e3f580be47a0d"}, {"y": 320, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=491b6b43ed100f46ba92bd83cf144a4973b3ee18"}, {"y": 475, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=884dffc86dc48334b690d0b2850931eb3ce22b99"}, {"y": 950, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33c98cc3a4c02da80f704355787685f434278e3b"}, {"y": 1425, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aba90399188f739eb18def8b4a1abbd135ca33a2"}, {"y": 1603, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e847323be136233cd6e5cc354281896752bf4b8"}], "s": {"y": 1900, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49b56cd549d5ef7b75e0bf00f057459581591e9e"}, "id": "78gnd3nbzrza1"}}, "name": "t3_13h8uxr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tadVGZdmB-otGoPmg1ucV2mwcUazQE_VaEHQXpoYiL8.jpg", "edited": 1684071203.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1684060643.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49b56cd549d5ef7b75e0bf00f057459581591e9e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/78gnd3nbzrza1.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49b56cd549d5ef7b75e0bf00f057459581591e9e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid that post title is biting off more than I can chew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t be able to tell anyone how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect the Tensegrity will do the job automatically, but that remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Tensegrity nearly failed 100%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one learned any magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not enough to overcome the hatred of real magic present in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to use a metaphor, possibly the tensegrity made people&amp;#39;s toes tingle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe some women swooned over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their hearts filled with happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s fake magic.

Likely the same today with the only thing changed being, who murders you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The church before, crazy greedy people now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense what ChatGPT was taught to say regarding claims of magic that challenge the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We battle that same problem when we practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a tiny ChatGPT in our brains, doubting everything and insisting you have to &amp;quot;prove it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the book deal mind.  And a lot more important than you can realize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets to the very heart of how sorcery works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the mastery of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And until you get it out of your mind to want to prove things, to anyone else or to yourself, you are seriously stomping on intent.  And won&amp;#39;t be able to move far from the blue line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s up there that things are cozy and warm and filled with loving hugs.  There is where you need to protect your reputation, because if you cross the line you won&amp;#39;t get your path with heart hugs anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Prove it&amp;quot; is part of the trap up there.  It enforces the rejection of anything that isn&amp;#39;t universally agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a great emphasize in the books and publications, on integrating tensegrity into all of your movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted the quote about Silvio having integrated tensegrity movements into his dancing so well, that it became a challenge to the dark sea of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Silvio responding by fitting himself through knotholes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frightening even the senior members of his lineage so that they looked away when he was dancing like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can also just learn to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; what the tensegrity does, and find a way to make even ordinary movements conform to the principles of tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to be able to see a simple sweeping of the palm across the darkness, lighting up an endless web of sparkles, fibers, and vague objects or faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re relearning how reality works at a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly not anything you could &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; to someone else.  It would be like trying to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; a sunset you are looking at is unusually beautiful, to someone who isn&amp;#39;t there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can show them in a picture and give them instructions to try to see one themselves, but that&amp;#39;s pretty much the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;#39;t get anyone who can &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; things for a very long time.  The amount of work to learn sorcery has to go down to perhaps 10% of what it is now, before anyone could manage to learn it and also have energy and time left to figure out how to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita could do that, but won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, won&amp;#39;t even admit she could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might not even be so sure of that herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An odd thing happens when you put men and women together and there&amp;#39;s sorcery in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women can suddenly become overconfident of their abilities, and then simply &amp;quot;do it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women show off for men!  It&amp;#39;s a biological imperative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with sorcery, they&amp;#39;ll do the same. Try to show it off, even if they could not do that particular thing well before.  Not realizing, now there&amp;#39;s the energy of two sorcerers available to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good example is the little sisters running on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had practiced something for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But never actually ran on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the presence of Carlos that made that happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for La Gorda and her flying demonstration.  Or her sliding door to escape the allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the text around those accounts, she admits that was over the top compared to what she can usually do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same happens with Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m very fortunate to have the accounts in the books, to see that when it happens between us it works just as it does in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sudden break in reality, and a switch over to what is likely the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, it&amp;#39;s a smooth switch over.  There&amp;#39;s no obvious point at which your tonal body is removed from the mix, and you clearly switched to a dream copy of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Cholita&amp;#39;s case she simply gets an evil grin, and lifts me up into the air using a single finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Totally impossible, except in the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#39;t explain her moving objects without touching them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I know about that is, there&amp;#39;s a moment just before she does what&amp;#39;s clearly impossible, when the second attention is visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An Ally flying around as a puff of smoke for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The object moves.  And it seems to be Cholita doing it.  But earlier a spirit was seen sneaking around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the second attention.  Which is temporarily superimposed on the normal view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an analogy more can understand, if you were eating breakfast in a restaurant and a perfectly formed intensely bright purple puff floated by, then if something impossible happened later on you could easily assume that actually started when the puff became visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the following &amp;quot;impossible thing&amp;quot; seemed free of any manifestations of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as making a small object move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The books are saturated with stories helpful to us, to figure out things we won&amp;#39;t be taught by Carlos or the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We weren&amp;#39;t left without resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t notice them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one topic that&amp;#39;s overlooked is, magic seems to be done in the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not in the tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of &amp;quot;prove it&amp;quot; assumes it&amp;#39;s done in the tonal body.  In the ordinary view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to imply that magic is &amp;quot;somewhere else&amp;quot;, thus making it a figment of our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem here is, the double can travel into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the books I&amp;#39;m going to assume that MOST accounts we have, where a member of the lineage is involved, were their double. Not their physical body version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i posted a quote about Clara calling herself fat, just so we&amp;#39;d know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the same account, literally leaping up from the floor into a standing position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a Kungfu master.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except there aren&amp;#39;t any overweight kungfu masters who are senior citizens, who can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even come close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the lineage, you had Genaro and Silvio doing back flips just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were in their doubles!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Genaro at the waterfall?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry Chinese &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; lovers.  Genaro was in his double.  Your Chinese folklore is inapplicable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And his acrobatics are actually not all that supernatural if you realize it was a dream copy of himself.  If there was anything left of his shrunken tonal body, perhaps that&amp;#39;s what the &amp;quot;tentacles&amp;quot; were helping to move around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact the transition to double can not only be invisible and smooth, but also go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very simple example.  If you learn to play in the red zone you will encounter &amp;quot;magical objects&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Floating in space, nearly taunting you to grab them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some will be behind a solid wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you no longer see a wall there.  You just happened to wander around your darkroom doing tensegrity, ended up right near a wall you know is there from memory, and maybe you&amp;#39;re even brushing up against it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you see a silver goblet glowing with flickering yellow jewels all around the cup, and can&amp;#39;t resist reaching out to take it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From behind the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your arm literally moves into a space where it cannot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t realize it at the time.  You see the goblet floating in the air, so obviously your arm can go there too and grab it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;#39;s through solid wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even more complicated things than that can happen, where you literally leave the entire room and go somewhere else right through the walls or ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or floor.  Carol Tiggs pushed me right through the floor at dance home. Down 1 story to the concrete foundation, through that and into a dirt tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no obvious transition. I literally fell in what I believed to be my real body, was then sitting on my butt in a dirt tunnel, and ended up back on the floor at &amp;quot;Dance Home&amp;quot; with Carlos wanting to hear what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same happens a bunch of times in the books where something magical happens that ought to have relocated the participants, but when it&amp;#39;s over they&amp;#39;re back where they started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They switched over to their doubles.  And shrunk the tonal out of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lineage sought to teach the double of apprentices to protect themselves.  As an emergency response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had Carlos leaping off a cliff while at the same time Genaro was teasing him back up on the ledge of the cliff, about shitting his pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both events took place at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were trying to get his double and his tonal to work together, in the same place. In relatively the same copy of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan commented in another story from the books that if an avalanche took place above them while they were hiking on mountain trails, he, don Juan, could survive. He could move his assemblage point fast enough to escape being crushed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos could not yet do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere don Juan and Genaro whispered into the opposite ears of Carlos,  and &amp;quot;split him in two&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result was some hideous version of himself coming out the middle, which could be used for protection in times of danger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the little sisters attacked him, the double of Carlos did in fact take over and kicked them in their energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which had a devastating effect on their tonal body as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery takes place in realms that are parallel to this one, happening at the same time in ideal cases. And that realm can affect this one, just as much as this realm suppresses that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;separate realities&amp;quot;.   And yet not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right here, in front of us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sharing the same laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s so difficult to learn enough silence to activate even a tiny bit of the second attention, that none of us had time to ponder how to &amp;quot;shrink the tonal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But is in fact the key to most of the coolest things that happen in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Tensegrity can cause it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Silvio Manuel and Juan Tuma were dancing their tensegrity moves, they weren&amp;#39;t doing it to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; they could to others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;d be doing.  Attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even thinking about learning such a thing, causes our attention seeking book deal mind to go crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;d plot, and plan, and study.  Extract snippets of tensegrity moves, and then try to find some style of dancing which could accept those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not at all what Silvio and Juan were doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were shrinking their tonal during the dancing, to get magic to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos decided to portray it in a way we could understand that might get us to stop being so lazy, and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making it seem as if we could just take some tensegrity moves and place them in tango dancing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it would have a magical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it would not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would just be more &amp;quot;path with heart tensegrity hugs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do what Silvio and Juan were doing, you have to be able to fit yourself though a knothole while dancing to the dark sea of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

then seem to have decided not to ask it, and deleted it.\n\nBut I already made this reply, which took some time, and might be a bit useful for people trying to understand this.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nYes, both can be true.  You can both detect the change over, but also not notice it at all.\n\nHowever, even when you don't \"notice it\" you get a sudden serge of confidence and perhaps even \"bliss\".\n\nBody pains often completely gone.\n\nIt's likely that the traces of \"self\" left in the mind, are also gone.\n\nAnd when you are faced with believing you can do something impossible, like leap through an open window that materialized on your darkroom wall, you don't doubt it.  Or worry (much) about bumping your head.\n\nYou just leap!\n\nSo you could certainly notice \"the transition\" if you were inclined to do that.\n\nIt's when you lose all sensibility and just believe you can do, what you thought of to do.\n\nWhich is the truth about the double.  It can do ANYTHING it can conceive of.\n\nSo you could notice that transition.\n\nExcept, while trying to notice a change over you'd most likely prevent it.\n\nBecause you'd still be in \"self-pity land\" to some extent, or you wouldn't give a fig.\n\nThe actual desire to notice the transition to the double, is probably only ever motivated by self-pity.\n\nBy \"the self\".\n\nWith thoughts of \"Wait until I tell my mom about this!  Then she'll have to stop nagging me and telling me sorcery is crazy!\"\n\nOr, \"If I can detect the switch over, I can write a book and make a ton of money. Then my miserable life of worrying about bills, will be over.\"\n\nWe really suck...  \n\nAs far as learning sorcery goes.\n\nThat could be \"magical\" by the way.  Sorcery was created by hunter/gatherer types, who could build a new hut out of dead plants anywhere they liked. \n\nWith no property taxes or rent!\n\nAnd food? \n\nEverywhere.  \n\nSo the \"mood of the old seers\" did not include worrying about money. There was none back then anyway.\n\nAnd \"homeless\"?\n\nEveryone was homeless back then.  They just had prettier tents than they have on skid row in LA.\n\nCholita used to see those, and worry she was going to have to live there.   She once tried to convince me that homeless people were not dangerous.\n\nI had to point out that the women often get raped, and just last week a homeless guy attacked an 80 year old man, who was just walking down the sidewalk in LA.\n\nDidn't make her feel better when I told her I wouldn't allow her to become homeless.  \n\nPossibly she considered me to be worse than living on the streets.\n\nSo the mood of the old seers, is perhaps influencing what I say sucks about humans these days.\n\nWorry over their lives in the river of shit.\n\nAnd maybe that's not \"compatible\" with sorcery, for something beyond \"the book deal mind\".\n\nMaybe it's just the wrong \"mood\" to have, to follow their path.\n\nOr perhaps, those concerns are \"the human form\".\n\nI don't think anyone should expect to \"lose the human form\" in a dramatic fashion,  on the path we've taken.\n\nWe sneak out of it constantly during darkroom!\n\nBecause we're doing all the work.\n\nTheory: \n\nYou only \"lose the human form\" dramatically and get sick for 2 weeks as people did in the books, when you were being mishandled by \"the nagual's blow\".\n\nI'll think up a crappy analogy:\n\nYou're trying to remove a dent from the side of your car, but you're an idiot.\n\nYou don't realize, you can't remove dents entirely most of the time.\n\nYou do the best you can, then put some special \"Bondo\" epoxy putty over it, and sand it smooth.\n\nBut as an idiot, you keep tapping with your little hammer, to get it smooth.\n\nAnd the metal begins to crystalize.\n\nThat's why you can bend a metal coat hanger repeatedly and it finally snaps.\n\nI used to make jewelry as a hobby, and it's something people who make jewelry worry about.\n\nMetal fatigue.\n\nYou cause the metal to crystallize from it's normal pseudo-liquid state, and it becomes brittle.\n\nEven silver does this.\n\nSo the Nagual's blow makes your cocoon brittle in this analogy.\n\nAnd then later something exerts a force on it, and it shatters.\n\nKind of.\n\nYou lose the human form because it can't support that delusion anymore.

It can do ANYTHING it can conceive of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could notice that transition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, while trying to notice a change over you&amp;#39;d most likely prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you&amp;#39;d still be in &amp;quot;self-pity land&amp;quot; to some extent, or you wouldn&amp;#39;t give a fig.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual desire to notice the transition to the double, is probably only ever motivated by self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By &amp;quot;the self&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With thoughts of &amp;quot;Wait until I tell my mom about this!  Then she&amp;#39;ll have to stop nagging me and telling me sorcery is crazy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, &amp;quot;If I can detect the switch over, I can write a book and make a ton of money. Then my miserable life of worrying about bills, will be over.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We really suck...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as learning sorcery goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That could be &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; by the way.  Sorcery was created by hunter/gatherer types, who could build a new hut out of dead plants anywhere they liked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With no property taxes or rent!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And food? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everywhere.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;mood of the old seers&amp;quot; did not include worrying about money. There was none back then anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone was homeless back then.  They just had prettier tents than they have on skid row in LA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita used to see those, and worry she was going to have to live there.   She once tried to convince me that homeless people were not dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to point out that the women often get raped, and just last week a homeless guy attacked an 80 year old man, who was just walking down the sidewalk in LA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t make her feel better when I told her I wouldn&amp;#39;t allow her to become homeless.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly she considered me to be worse than living on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the mood of the old seers, is perhaps influencing what I say sucks about humans these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worry over their lives in the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe that&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;compatible&amp;quot; with sorcery, for something beyond &amp;quot;the book deal mind&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s just the wrong &amp;quot;mood&amp;quot; to have, to follow their path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps, those concerns are &amp;quot;the human form&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think anyone should expect to &amp;quot;lose the human form&amp;quot; in a dramatic fashion,  on the path we&amp;#39;ve taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sneak out of it constantly during darkroom!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because we&amp;#39;re doing all the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Theory: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You only &amp;quot;lose the human form&amp;quot; dramatically and get sick for 2 weeks as people did in the books, when you were being mishandled by &amp;quot;the nagual&amp;#39;s blow&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll think up a crappy analogy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re trying to remove a dent from the side of your car, but you&amp;#39;re an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t realize, you can&amp;#39;t remove dents entirely most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do the best you can, then put some special &amp;quot;Bondo&amp;quot; epoxy putty over it, and sand it smooth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as an idiot, you keep tapping with your little hammer, to get it smooth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the metal begins to crystalize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why you can bend a metal coat hanger repeatedly and it finally snaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to make jewelry as a hobby, and it&amp;#39;s something people who make jewelry worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Metal fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cause the metal to crystallize from it&amp;#39;s normal pseudo-liquid state, and it becomes brittle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even silver does this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow makes your cocoon brittle in this analogy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then later something exerts a force on it, and it shatters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You lose the human form because it can&amp;#39;t support that delusion anymore.

Here's that account, which seems to agree with the speculations in this post:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFirst I noticed the itch on the point of the second attention in my luminous shell. I massaged that point by moving my fingers on it as if I were playing a harp and the point sunk towards my stomach. I felt it almost on my skin.\n\nI experienced a prickling sensation on the outside of my right calf. It was a mixture of pleasure and pain. The sensation radiated to my whole leg and then to my lower back.\n\nI felt that my buttocks were shaking. My entire body was transfixed by a nervous ripple. I thought that my body had been caught upside down in a net. My forehead and my toes seemed to be touching. I was like a closed U-shape.\n\nThen I felt as if I were being folded in two and rolled inside a sheet. My nervous spasms were what made the sheet roll into itself, with me in the center. When the rolling ended I could not sense my body any more.\n\nI was only an amorphous awareness; a nervous spasm wrapped in itself. That awareness came to rest inside a ditch, inside a depression of itself.\n\nI understood then the impossibility of describing what takes place in dreaming. Zuleica said that the right and left side awareness are wrapped up together. Both of them come to rest in one single bundle in the dent; the depressed center of the second attention. To do dreaming one needs to manipulate both the luminous body and the physical body.\n\nFirst, the center of assembling for the second attention has to be made accessible by being pushed in from the outside by someone else, or sucked in from within by the dreamer. Second, in order to dislodge the first attention, the centers of the physical body located in the midsection and the calves, especially the right one, have to be stimulated and placed as close to one another as possible until they seem to join. Then the sensation of being bundled takes place and automatically the second attention takes over.\n\nZuleica's explanation, given in commands, was the most cogent way of describing what takes place because none of the sensory experiences involved in dreaming are part of our normal inventory of sensory data.

I felt it almost on my skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I experienced a prickling sensation on the outside of my right calf. It was a mixture of pleasure and pain. The sensation radiated to my whole leg and then to my lower back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt that my buttocks were shaking. My entire body was transfixed by a nervous ripple. I thought that my body had been caught upside down in a net. My forehead and my toes seemed to be touching. I was like a closed U-shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I felt as if I were being folded in two and rolled inside a sheet. My nervous spasms were what made the sheet roll into itself, with me in the center. When the rolling ended I could not sense my body any more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was only an amorphous awareness; a nervous spasm wrapped in itself. That awareness came to rest inside a ditch, inside a depression of itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understood then the impossibility of describing what takes place in dreaming. Zuleica said that the right and left side awareness are wrapped up together. Both of them come to rest in one single bundle in the dent; the depressed center of the second attention. To do dreaming one needs to manipulate both the luminous body and the physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, the center of assembling for the second attention has to be made accessible by being pushed in from the outside by someone else, or sucked in from within by the dreamer. Second, in order to dislodge the first attention, the centers of the physical body located in the midsection and the calves, especially the right one, have to be stimulated and placed as close to one another as possible until they seem to join. Then the sensation of being bundled takes place and automatically the second attention takes over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica&amp;#39;s explanation, given in commands, was the most cogent way of describing what takes place because none of the sensory experiences involved in dreaming are part of our normal inventory of sensory data. All of them were baffling to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_13h8uxr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13h8uxr/making_friends_with_the_double/jk4uzqn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1684082918.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jk4nb0v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "AthinaJ8", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1684079523.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_13h8uxr", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_hbn1b1mb", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;Unfortunately it's so difficult to learn enough silence to activate even a tiny bit of the second attention, that none of us had time to ponder how to \"shrink the tonal\".\n\nYesterday I was wondering what's happening to the tonal body when we go to other realities.

There were no mountains, but where we were standing was not flat land either. The ground was cracked and parched. It looked like a rough dry sea of terra-cotta. I could see it all around me just as if I were in the middle of the ocean.\n\nI looked up. The sky had lost its maddening glare. It was dark, but not blue.

One was enormous and had gone over the horizon, the other was smaller or perhaps more distant.\n\nI wanted to ask questions, to walk around and look for things. Zuleica signaled us to relax, to wait patiently. But something seemed to be pulling us. Suddenly la Gorda and Josefina were gone. And I woke up.\n\nFrom that time on I never went back to Zuleica's house. Don Juan would make me shift levels of awareness in his own house or wherever we were, and I would enter into dreaming. Zuleica, la Gorda and Josefina were always waiting for me. We went back to the same unearthly scene over and over, until we were thoroughly familiar with it.\n\nWhenever we could do it, we would skip the time of glare- the daytime- and go there at night just in time to witness the rise over the horizon of a colossal celestial body; something of such magnitude that when it erupted over the jagged line of the horizon it covered at least half of the one hundred and eighty degree range in front of us. The celestial body was beautiful, and its ascent over the horizon was so breathtaking that I could have stayed there for an eternity, just to witness that sight.\n\nThe celestial body took up nearly the entire firmament when it reached the zenith. Invariably we would lie on our backs in order to gaze at it. It had consistent configurations, which Zuleica taught us to recognize.\n\nI realized that it was not a star. Its light was reflected, It must have been an opaque body because the reflected light was mellow in relation to its monumental size. There were enormous, unchanging brown spots on its saffron-yellow surface.\n\nZuleica took us systematically on voyages that were beyond words. La Gorda said that Zuleica took Josefina even farther and deeper into the unknown, because Josefina was, just like Zuleica herself, quite a bit crazy.

Don Juan would make me shift levels of awareness in his own house or wherever we were, and I would enter into dreaming. Zuleica, la Gorda and Josefina were always waiting for me. We went back to the same unearthly scene over and over, until we were thoroughly familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever we could do it, we would skip the time of glare- the daytime- and go there at night just in time to witness the rise over the horizon of a colossal celestial body; something of such magnitude that when it erupted over the jagged line of the horizon it covered at least half of the one hundred and eighty degree range in front of us. The celestial body was beautiful, and its ascent over the horizon was so breathtaking that I could have stayed there for an eternity, just to witness that sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The celestial body took up nearly the entire firmament when it reached the zenith. Invariably we would lie on our backs in order to gaze at it. It had consistent configurations, which Zuleica taught us to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized that it was not a star. Its light was reflected, It must have been an opaque body because the reflected light was mellow in relation to its monumental size. There were enormous, unchanging brown spots on its saffron-yellow surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica took us systematically on voyages that were beyond words. La Gorda said that Zuleica took Josefina even farther and deeper into the unknown, because Josefina was, just like Zuleica herself, quite a bit crazy. Neither of them had that core of rationality that supplies a dreamer with sobriety, thus they had no barriers and no interest in finding out rational causes or reasons for anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_13h8uxr", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13h8uxr/making_friends_with_the_double/jk8a853/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1684153076.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1684153076.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jk71ha8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "isthisasobot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jk4raxz", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_br6e04o0", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "-As for sneaking around the eagle to find a place to survive, Carlos offered to \" show which way to go\" when we died.\n\nDidn't Don Juan mention at some point that he would be in a world of little red spidery insects.. can' t remember where he said that but I think he mentioned that they had a beautiful social structure.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jk71ha8", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;-As for sneaking around the eagle to find a place to survive, Carlos offered to &amp;quot; show which way to go&amp;quot; when we died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t Don Juan mention at some point that he would be in a world of little red spidery insects.. can&amp;#39; t remember where he said that but I think he mentioned that they had a beautiful social structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_13h8uxr", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13h8uxr/making_friends_with_the_double/jk71ha8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1684119655.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1684119655.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jk4raxz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jk4jtm8", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "The dream body is not different from our waking awareness.\n\nOur waking awareness got encased in organic matter, and got trained in that so that its obsessions prevent it from exploring freely in the emanations.\n\nIt's always got some of itself \"stuck\" back up at the blue line on the J curve.\n\nOur double is just the portion that either refused to go into the flesh, or perhaps the flesh body couldn't hold all of it.\n\nSo it got \"outcast\" in the egg.\n\nWhen the egg breaks and releases all of our awareness to travel to the Eagle and give up our memories, there's no difference.\n\nIt's NOT an independent being.

Which he could create through dancing.\n\nWe have all sorts of \"hints\" on that topic!\n\nBut again, everyone is so obsessed with attention seeking and book deals, no one ever examined those hints.\n\nI have a hard time even thinking about them.\n\nExcept, I had an encounter with one of them.\n\nI formed a space ship out of my darkroom, so I could travel to Pandora in it and gain entry to the phantom copy.\n\nRegretting I didn't buy that house when Carlos offered it to me.\n\nI didn't have the skills necessary to drive there in my car, and move my assemblage point far enough to enter it. \n\nAnd it's a 1+ hour drive with normal traffic.\n\nPlus I have a Cholita at home to worry about.\n\nSo I created a phantom vehicle and began to follow the glowing emanations coming from Pandora's direction.\n\nI posted about it.  It's in here somewhere.\n\nNaturally when you find yourself in a space ship during dark room practice, you're in your double.\n\nEven if your butt falls asleep, sitting on the edge of a mattress in the same position for too long.\n\nI don't remember why, but I got up to go check if the \"air lock\" window on the east wall of the space ship was real.\n\nAnd opened it by mistake.\n\nI got sucked out into space. If it weren't for my Ally \"Fancy\", I would have entirely left the room.  But not under my own control.\n\nFancy grabbed my ankles and kept me from leaving.\n\nOutside the space ship there were dozens of entities, inviting me to join them in \"unbundled space\".\n\nImplying, there was awareness outside the emanations. \n\nWhich drifted in the dark sea, without having to light up any part of it.\n\nWhich prevents them from \"dissipating\" so thin, they're no longer sentient.\n\nIt's the emanations that cause our awareness to \"flow\" out.  And since they're infinite, it might just flow so far away you can't get that piece back.\n\nThus when a person dies and loses their confining egg shell, it can't be too long before all they are, has spread out into the emanations and can never collect back together again.\n\nPerhaps that's where Carlos found to go, when he commented he'd discovered immortality.

Which he could create through dancing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have all sorts of &amp;quot;hints&amp;quot; on that topic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But again, everyone is so obsessed with attention seeking and book deals, no one ever examined those hints.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time even thinking about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, I had an encounter with one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I formed a space ship out of my darkroom, so I could travel to Pandora in it and gain entry to the phantom copy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regretting I didn&amp;#39;t buy that house when Carlos offered it to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have the skills necessary to drive there in my car, and move my assemblage point far enough to enter it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a 1+ hour drive with normal traffic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus I have a Cholita at home to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I created a phantom vehicle and began to follow the glowing emanations coming from Pandora&amp;#39;s direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted about it.  It&amp;#39;s in here somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally when you find yourself in a space ship during dark room practice, you&amp;#39;re in your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if your butt falls asleep, sitting on the edge of a mattress in the same position for too long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember why, but I got up to go check if the &amp;quot;air lock&amp;quot; window on the east wall of the space ship was real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And opened it by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got sucked out into space. If it weren&amp;#39;t for my Ally &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;, I would have entirely left the room.  But not under my own control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy grabbed my ankles and kept me from leaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside the space ship there were dozens of entities, inviting me to join them in &amp;quot;unbundled space&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Implying, there was awareness outside the emanations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which drifted in the dark sea, without having to light up any part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which prevents them from &amp;quot;dissipating&amp;quot; so thin, they&amp;#39;re no longer sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the emanations that cause our awareness to &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; out.  And since they&amp;#39;re infinite, it might just flow so far away you can&amp;#39;t get that piece back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus when a person dies and loses their confining egg shell, it can&amp;#39;t be too long before all they are, has spread out into the emanations and can never collect back together again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that&amp;#39;s where Carlos found to go, when he commented he&amp;#39;d discovered immortality.

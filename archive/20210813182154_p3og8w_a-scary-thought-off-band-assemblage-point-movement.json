At least for now.\n\nHere's how crazy that technique is:\n\n[https://np](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/p1ro16/how_to_shift_horizontally_using_your_hands/)[.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/p1ro16/how\\_to\\_shift\\_horizontally\\_using\\_your\\_hands/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/p1ro16/how_to_shift_horizontally_using_your_hands/)\n\nIt wasn't that I couldn't make it work everyday. Which is odd.  Most \"intent gifts\" are only good one time, and if you make it work the second time it'll be like a vague ghost of the original experience.\n\nFor the sake of new people, you CANNOT LEARN SORCERY!!!\n\nSo if you have your outside stuff books on hand, and keep referring to things in them hoping that will give you an advantage for learning sorcery, you're barking up the wrong tree.\n\nOnly squirrels go up there.\n\nSorcery is a gift. And the giver of the gift needs to know what gifts you need. He wouldn't want to give a Jehovah's witness a gift more fitting for a Devil Worshipper.\n\nHe has to follow your desires to figure out your path.\n\nAnd he can't produce any gift you like. If you create a \"composite path\", with a little bit of Scientology, some Daoism, and some Greek philosophy, there's no real path there.\n\nNothing to give you.  That path doesn't exist yet!\n\nHe can only find an existing \"bundle\" of emanations from another being's path, and search that for the gift to give you.\n\nThere's virtually an infinite number of emanations, and even the old seers never managed to emphasize all combinations. So the number of viable paths is limited.\n\nYou need to stick to something someone else did, so that *intent* can \"formulate\" a viable gift for you.\n\nToo much for beginners?\n\nJust stick to the path!  Don't add things.  You will only make it harder, or even impossible.\n\nBut the cool part is, if we stick to the \"Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\" path (the only one going where we want to go), we get \"gifts\" we didn't even know existed.\n\nIf the old seers did it, we can do it too.  And might even be shown how by *intent*.\n\nIf we happen to need that badly.\n\nAnd needy we are!  We have no lineage.  So we need some bonus techniques.  Stuff the new seers might not have emphasized, but which was well known to the old seers.\n\nAlready we have one!  J curving.  J curving was irrelevant to the new seers. They used the Nagual's blow.\n\nBut we can't do that.  So, intent provided a substitute.\n\nMaybe, that'll be true of other things?\n\nIn my case, I \"discovered\"  a hand movement which is guaranteed to shift the assemblage point horizontally.  It basically amounts to, using 3 different hand positions to \"hook\" to the outer luminous shell. That's where you're scooping energy from. The outskirts of the egg, where worry pushes our energy.\n\nWe just scoop it up one puff at a time and move it to the 3 energy pouches on the torso.\n\nThe result is, our \"energy body\" becomes visible.  We've \"redeployed\" our energy from the periphery, to the center.\n\nAnd don't worry!  You will indeed see it if:\n\n1 You practice 3 hours a day (and keep it to yourself if you do less).\n\n2 You emphasize silence above all else.\n\n3 You move the assemblage point as far as you can daily.\n\n4 You stop to wiggle your fingers on the second attention assemblage point, mostly so that you'll start to notice what the energy body looks like.\n\nNow, is there some other thing we could do, besides scooping?\n\nI mean, in regards to our shell.\n\nAs it turns out, you can \"grab\" the shell, and make it rotate.\n\nBut it's a little like trying to grab a wing nut that's stuck.\n\nRusted. Gooped up.  Bent a bit.\n\nYou've probably all seen that.  A wing nut is supposed to turn with just the pressure of the fingers.\n\nBut when it's stuck, you end up trying to use the end of screwdriver to dig into it anywhere you can, and loosen it.\n\nUsing those hand movements,  you can do that with your luminous shell.  Force the shell itself to rotate.\n\nOr to be \"Matrix Movie\" like, you don't rotate the shell.  That would be impossible.\n\nYou rotate yourself.\n\nI suspect that's a poor description.  My *seeing* isn't good enough to figure it out better.\n\nBut I do know, if you make it work your room goes away, and you're in a waking dream which has no boundaries.\n\nYou give the shell a spin like a \"Wheel of Fortune\", and whatever it lands on is where you are.\n\nHigh above a beach in France, on a sand cliff?  That's where I ended up.\n\nAnd it gets very weird and very realistic.\n\nMy theory is, we know how to move down the middle of man's band because it's easier.\n\nWe might accidentally slide a little sideways, but it's \"thick\" over there and if you go too far you'll lose lucidity.\n\nPerhaps you'll turn into a froglike beast sitting on your bedroom floor, thinking everything is perfectly normal.\n\nSlide just a little further and you'll be sitting on a rock in a pond, still thinking everything is perfectly normal.\n\nBut to go even further, perhaps \"off-band\", is just too much for us.  It's too thick over on the sides and we get \"bent out of shape\". We shapeshift until we forget our purpose, long before we get past the edge of man's band.\n\nBut what if you could rotate the shell instead?  Not the assemblage point.  The whole thing.\n\nDoes it even make sense?\n\nBeats me.

They weren't all there each time, but Cholita herself can remember almost that many,  by name.\n\nOne time while driving to LA, she cheerfully rattled off a list so long it prompted me to buy a little recording device. The next time she did that, I didn\u2019t want to lose any of it.\n\nOf course, once I showed it to her she never rattled off a list again.\n\nThe 100 was her estimate.\n\nThey're all gone as far as I know.\n\nIt's only Cholita and me.\n\nAfter Carlos died, some gave interviews.\n\nWhat they had to say was not enough to give anyone confidence that Carlos wasn\u2019t making things up.\n\nHow can that be?\n\nWrong emphasis?\n\nMaybe too much indulging, despite believing themselves to be impeccable?\n\nIf you really want to learn sorcery, the most important thing you can learn is how to manipulate intent.\n\nThat\u2019s what produces real magic.\n\nTo learn that, you have to be able to move your assemblage point.\n\nTo move that, you need to be silent. (Or practice gazing).\n\nTo get silent, you need recapitulation (probably).\n\nThis isn\u2019t entirely true for women, as we\u2019ve evolved to learn in here.\n\nWomen should adopt the lifestyle of a sorcerer, live it, and their natural talents will eventually come out.\n\nThey already manipulate intent. They were born to do that!\n\nThey can already move their assemblage points. Each month. So it\u2019s quite flexible compared to men.\n\nIt would be nice if they learned to be silent, but once their assemblage point moves a moderate distance, left over internal dialogue isn\u2019t going to hold them back from going very far into the second attention.\n\nI personally would encourage them to do gazing. Get the ball rolling quicker. Maybe gaze in an inspirational setting to merge it smoothly into the lifestyle.\n\nCholita has an amazing lawn chair paradise under a giant green umbrella, surrounded by tropical plants, lanterns, candles,  and Buddha statues.\n\nIf I even dared to sit on the lawn chair, she'd likely burn the entire house down, and start over.\n\nMy own gazing tendency would be to sit on the toilet and gaze at the heater vents.\n\nBut that's probably not good motivation for the women.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re living that lifestyle with other women, watch out for the danger of altering the lifestyle, each time you want to bring in a new person.\n\nWith women, games can be modified.\n\nThat tends to infuriate men.\n\nYou can see  that, with children playing together.\n\nWhen the boys are in charge, a violation of the rules results in cutting off the violator\u2019s hand.\n\nWhen the girls are in charge, a violation of the rules calls for a rule change, if it makes one of the players happier.\n\nSo women risk drifting off in their own direction, making it impossible to follow Carlos.\n\nFor example, if a potential new woman who has been invited to join the group REALLY likes cats, the group might decide that cats are sacred, adopt some Egyptian mythology regarding cats, and start giving \u201cTotem Cat\u201d workshops.\n\n30 years later, they\u2019re all cat ladies in a smelly apartment.\n\nOr if they\u2019re lucky, they end up like Dolores.\n\nStill not what Carlos had in mind...\n\nJust keep focused if possible,  and if nothing much is happening, do what the men have to do.\n\nAnd remember how much recapitulation the witches have done. 5 full times for one of them!\n\nThe men have to actually practice. It\u2019s odd that they almost never do.\n\nI\u2019ve had several men write to me over the years, who had been in to Carlos for decades.\n\nThey insisted they\u2019d adopted all of his principles.\n\nAfter a year of pointless motivational speeches on my part, I finally got them to sit in a chair, and try to learn to get silent.\n\nResult: They were complaining it was hard to go for 30 minutes.\n\nSo you know they hadn\u2019t actually been doing anything during those decades.\n\nThe very first thing you have to overcome, is looking at the clock while practicing.\n\nIt\u2019s like don Juan telling Carlos to check into a dingy hotel, and stay there until he stops wanting to have people around all the time.\n\nLikewise, you have to get over thinking you\u2019re too important to waste your time on non-doings (techniques others would call insane).\n\nThat\u2019s why some of the \u201cwarrior\u2019s way\u201d rules are merely designed to get the men to work and not waste all of their time.\n\nBut they wasted it anyway.\n\nSo first, to be a warrior, I propose, you have to know where the war is.\n\nHow can you be a warrior, if you don\u2019t even know where the battle is taking place?\n\nSecond, to be impeccable, you need a measuring device, to tell when you are more impeccable, and when you are less impeccable.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen, from the failure of Carlos\u2019 entire first crop of personally instructed workshop sorcerers, that students can\u2019t be trusted to be honest with themselves.\n\nThey need an \u201cimpeccability meter\u201d.\n\nLet me add, Carlos died much earlier than he had expected, which accounts for the failure. I\u2019m sure he knew what he was doing.\n\nHe just didn\u2019t get enough time to do it, so now we\u2019re on our own.\n\nOr maybe he did, and that's the whole point.  Time to do it on your own!\n\nI\u2019d love a bunch of suggestions as to how to \u201cre-do\u201d the warrior\u2019s way attitude.\n\nNot change it.\n\nIt\u2019s completely true.\n\nWe do need to be impeccable warriors.\n\nOnce you have inorganic beings swirling around your head, threatening to carry you physically into their world, you start to take it seriously.\n\nBut until then, men tend to puff themselves up.\n\nGenetically, we\u2019re a lot like gorillas, trying to look bigger and stronger than we really are.\n\nWe need some method to keep ourselves honest.\n\nI propose:\n\n1). To be a warrior, you have to pick a battle ground and learn as much about it as you can, by actually battling there.\n\nPotential battle grounds are recapitulation, gazing, silence, and dreaming. I\u2019m sure there are more.\n\nBut if you go the dreaming route, go for dreaming awake.  Dreaming asleep didn\u2019t work out well with the last crop of sorcerers.\n\nIt\u2019s true, there\u2019s a battleground down there.\n\nBut you\u2019ll only be a warrior in your dreams.\n\nYou have succeeded in finding your battle ground, when you can do impossible things there on a daily basis.\n\nImpossible things is defined as, no one will believe the accounts of your greatest battles.\n\n2). To be impeccable, you have to be in heightened awareness. Otherwise it\u2019s impossible. You\u2019ll only fool yourself.\n\nAnd the heightened awareness itself is NOT the impeccability.\n\nThe impeccability is keeping it going all the time.\n\nThat\u2019s impeccability: The best use of your energy.\n\nBut men can\u2019t be trusted to be honest about that, so it\u2019s best to simply say, you have to maintain heightened awareness or you are not impeccable.\n\nHow do you get there?\n\nBy moving the assemblage point very far.\n\nI can state with authority, you need to move it at least 4 feet total.\n\nCarlos showed us with his finger!\n\nSorry Dr. Whale.  It has to move 4 times as far as you believe it moves.  We all made that mistake.\n\nHow does it feel?\n\nLike heaven. You won\u2019t have a problem knowing when you are in heightened awareness. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a good measuring tool.\n\nI\u2019ve posted elsewhere how to move it. But to summarize the ways I know of moving it, it can be done by silence, although you\u2019ll likely blank out if you don\u2019t walk around, making it impossible to move it far enough.\n\nIt can be done with gazing, although I have yet to see anyone move it further than half the distance needed, by that method. And halfway isn\u2019t convincing enough to seal the deal. If you go the gazing route, try the mirror in water, or try moving on the water, by gazing at ripples. It gives you a more active taste of the second attention, which can tug on your assemblage point harder.\n\nIt can be done through Tensegrity. But not the way we\u2019ve done that in the past, with the lights on.\n\nAll you have to do, to realize the lights must be off, is actually look at what the movements do.\n\nYou can sort of see what they do, since they scoop stuff, and put in on your body.  So there must be stuff to scoop up there.\n\nBut you can't look at what the movements actually do, unless you can *see* energy.\n\nAnd that\u2019s too hard in daylight.\n\nAlso, Tensegrity must be accompanied by silence, or your assemblage point will be stuck in it\u2019s normal position and the Tensegrity can\u2019t work its magic.  If you're thinking about your no-good lover, or your controlling mom, you aren't going to move very far.\n\nRemember, Carlos called them, \"Magical Passes\".\n\nHe wanted to warn us, if you don't see actual magic, you aren't doing the pass.\n\nSome passes do teleportation.\n\nSome passes help assemble specific worlds.\n\nSome passes teach how to move the assemblage point using feelings alone.\n\nSome passes create windows to look on the other side.\n\nSome passes evoke dreaming images.\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nI must have learned more than 1000 movements. Actually, I'm sure of that. I made a list.\n\nWe need to map all of the preserved Tensegrity, some day.\n\nThen, there\u2019s also the bad-boy option for moving the assemblage point.\n\nGenaro took that route, in Journey to Ixtlan.\n\nYou can use inorganic beings to move it.\n\nThat\u2019ll require you to find one first.\n\nUnless you want to go trotting around the desert on vision questions, I suggest using silence and gazing, and preferably in darkness.\n\nThen you need to learn to keep one around every day, which will require that impeccability, or best use of energy.\n\nLast, you just need to let it know that you want to move your assemblage point into heightened awareness.\n\nIt\u2019ll teach you the rest.  You won't realize that at first,  but in the long run you will.\n\nEdit three", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Is it Possible to Revise the Impeccable Warrior Concept?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 73, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"stsj2dtx9fr41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 56, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stsj2dtx9fr41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e114363ee17f83f3152a3b7b5bc6b8cf56c8c9a1"}, {"y": 113, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stsj2dtx9fr41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20d762bb99af3c7948413935f59ba07bda8ba81f"}, {"y": 168, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stsj2dtx9fr41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf8dfb786d0add8f9918423dfc66cc1b13eff37"}, {"y": 336, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stsj2dtx9fr41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02cfba30117c74b4cc7b182d7efdfa4fd11a638b"}, {"y": 504, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stsj2dtx9fr41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75d6db20171d936f2795d8d28eed519d50c3eea2"}, {"y": 567, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stsj2dtx9fr41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b557c184444e00afc76619e44b5bf017647a0e8e"}], "s": {"y": 630, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/stsj2dtx9fr41.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47819e9fc85abd7c4e53bbd5e211b0380a4638e0"}, "id": "stsj2dtx9fr41"}}, "name": "t3_fwo87r", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WBMZSrNUqE_n9GpZKIP75RAmemO_n3Uz7JZmP5Fzb98.jpg", "edited": 1586286819.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1586279224.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/stsj2dtx9fr41.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=47819e9fc85abd7c4e53bbd5e211b0380a4638e0\"&gt;Dolores, the Cat Witch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had 100 impeccable warrior students in private classes.

So there must be stuff to scoop up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t look at what the movements actually do, unless you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s too hard in daylight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, Tensegrity must be accompanied by silence, or your assemblage point will be stuck in it\u2019s normal position and the Tensegrity can\u2019t work its magic.  If you&amp;#39;re thinking about your no-good lover, or your controlling mom, you aren&amp;#39;t going to move very far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, Carlos called them, &amp;quot;Magical Passes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wanted to warn us, if you don&amp;#39;t see actual magic, you aren&amp;#39;t doing the pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some passes do teleportation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some passes help assemble specific worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some passes teach how to move the assemblage point using feelings alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some passes create windows to look on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some passes evoke dreaming images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must have learned more than 1000 movements. Actually, I&amp;#39;m sure of that. I made a list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to map all of the preserved Tensegrity, some day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, there\u2019s also the bad-boy option for moving the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Genaro took that route, in Journey to Ixtlan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use inorganic beings to move it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019ll require you to find one first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to go trotting around the desert on vision questions, I suggest using silence and gazing, and preferably in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you need to learn to keep one around every day, which will require that impeccability, or best use of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last, you just need to let it know that you want to move your assemblage point into heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019ll teach you the rest.  You won&amp;#39;t realize that at first,  but in the long run you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit three&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "e041b6bc-6005-11ea-a799-0edc1fd152bd", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "fwo87r", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 28, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fwo87r/is_it_possible_to_revise_the_impeccable_warrior/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/fwo87r/is_it_possible_to_revise_the_impeccable_warrior/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1586279224.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fmq9s0m", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1586295559.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fmq29k3", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I'm not against it.\n\nHowever, I stated my intent upfront when I first posted here.\n\nI'm only interested in restoring Carlos reputation.\n\nThat won't happen by making people \"better\" through stalking, or even by those who use power plants to get cool experiences.\n\nIt'll only happen by having enough people doing real magic, without the use of drugs.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fmq9s0m", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not against it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I stated my intent upfront when I first posted here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only interested in restoring Carlos reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That won&amp;#39;t happen by making people &amp;quot;better&amp;quot;

He impeccably and ruthlessly is stalking down his habits, which make him acting as a stupid pack animal following his reflexes and patterns without even thinking why...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, with time, after closing those drain holes where he\u2019s loosing the energy and by directing it in the right way for his proper needs, mostly by directing it into practice area: he maintains his impeccability and his unbending intent to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, and if he practices enough and hard, combining theoretical knoledge he gains everyday with practice, sooner or later under the influence  of the energy accumulated due to his stalking his own weaknesses and patterns, his assemblage point must shift, and his impeccable lifestyle, which he led before, his high energy level and inner forces, will help him cope with this new challenge and not to poop in his pants.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course its only about people who don\u2019t lie to themselves about their own impeccability only pretending that they follow the path of warrior\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fwo87r/is_it_possible_to_revise_the_impeccable_warrior/fmq4cgk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1586292635.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_fwo87r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fmqeh24", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1586298077.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_fwo87r", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Second half of your [previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/fuim0d/source_of_the_need_to_preserve_knowledge/fmp0ojk) from a different post:\n\n\"... a warning to \"impeccable warriors\".\n\nHow can you be impeccable, if after all this time you still haven't learned to move  your own assemblage point?\n\nHow can you call yourself impeccable, if you don't know what heightened awareness feels like?\n\nIf you had done what you were supposed to do (recap, silence, gazing, tensegrity, Zuleica's technique), you wouldn't be clinging to \"teachers\" who are unable to provide their own personal descriptions of what happens when it moves.\n\nI know a guy in Colorado who runs from teacher to teacher.

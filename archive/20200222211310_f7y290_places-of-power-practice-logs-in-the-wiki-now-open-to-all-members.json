I have a quote from Carlos' very last book just for this occasion:\n\n\"Due to the effort of Florinda Matus, who engaged me in learning the most elaborate variations of \r\nstandard shamanistic techniques devised by the shamans of ancient times, such as the \r\nrecapitulation, I was able to view, for \r\ninstance, my experiences with don Juan with a force I never could have imagined. The corpus of \r\nmy book. The Eagle's Gift, is the result of such views that I had of don Juan Matus. For don Juan \r\nMatus, to recapitulate meant to relive and rearrange everything of one's life in one single sweep. \r\nHe never bothered with the minutiae of elaborate variations of that ancient technique. Florinda, on \r\nthe other hand, had an entirely different meticulousness. She spent months coaching me to enter \r\ninto aspects of recapitulating that I am to this day at a loss to explain. \r\n\"It is the vastness of the warrior which you are experiencing,\" she explained. \"The techniques \r\nare there. Big deal. What is of supreme importance is the man using them, and his desire to go all \r\nthe way with them.\" \r\nTo recapitulate don Juan in Florinda's terms resulted in views of don Juan of the most excruciating \r\ndetail and meaning. It was infinitely more intense than talking to don Juan himself. It was \r\nFlorinda's pragmatism that gave me astounding insights into practical possibilities that were not in \r\nthe least the concern of the nagual Juan Matus. Florinda, being a true woman pragmatist, had no \r\nillusions about herself, no dreams of grandeur. She said that she \r\nwas a plower who could not afford to miss a single turn of the way. \r\n\"A warrior must go very slowly,\" she recommended, \"and make use of every available item on the \r\nwarriors' path. One of the most remarkable items is the capacity we all have, as warriors, to focus \r\nour attention with unwavering force on events lived. Warriors can even focus it on people they \r\nhave never met. The end result of this deep focusing is always the same. It reconstructs the scene. \r\nWhole chunks of behavior, forgotten or brand new, make themselves available to a warrior. Try it.\" \r\nI followed her advice, and of course, I focused on don Juan, and I remembered everything that had \r\ntranspired at any given moment. I remembered details that I had no business remembering. Thanks \r\nto the work of Florinda, I was able to reconstruct enormous chunks of activity with don Juan, as \r\nwell as details of tremendous importance that had bypassed me completely. \r\nThe spirit of the quotations from The Eagle's Gift was most shocking to me because the quotations \r\nrevealed the profound emphasis that don Juan had put on the items of his world, on the warriors' \r\nway as the epitome of human accomplishment. That drive had survived his person, and was as alive \r\nas ever. Sometimes, I sincerely felt that don Juan had never left. I got to the point of actually \r\nhearing him moving around the house. I asked Florinda about it. \r\nShe said, \"Oh, that's nothing. It's just the nagual Juan Matus's emptiness that reaches out to touch \r\nyou, no matter where his awareness is at the moment.\" \r\nHer answer left me more puzzled, more intrigued, and more despondent than ever. Although \r\nFlorinda was the closest person to the nagual Juan Matus, they were astoundingly different. One \r\nthing that they both shared was the emptiness of their persons. They were no longer people. Don \r\nJuan Matus did not exist as a person. But what existed instead of his person was a collection of \r\nstories, each of them apropos to the situation he was discussing, didactic stories and jokes that bore \r\nthe mark of his sobriety and \r\nhis frugality.\"\n\nSo most likely we can even recapitulate and relive those experiences.

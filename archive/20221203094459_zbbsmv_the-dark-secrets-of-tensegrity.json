I hadn't thought of it like that yet, but the words of Carlos when explaining Tensegrity allow for that possibility.  That each pass can alter future events.  And if you string them together you can build bridges with them.  Like a \"rainbow\" bridge in Taiwan.\n\nHis book even tips us off in the title!  \"The MAGICAL Passes\".\n\nA long time ago we had one of the endless bad players attacking here, who was swimming in the intent of pretending his results.\n\nHe got angry over the idea that Tensegrity needed to have magic, to be successful.  It rained on his parade of pretending, if there were any criteria for success other than whatever he wanted to make up.\n\nI can't even imagine how someone who was drawn to the books of Carlos evolved to argue that no magic is needed.  I believe he claimed the purpose of sorcery was \"Joy\".\n\nYea,  ok...\n\nIsn't that also what flashers who go into public parks naked,  covered only with a trench coat, would say as they flash granny and her granddaughter, near the playground.\n\nThe purpose for them is, \"Joy\".\n\nPretending results is close to the worst thing you can do in sorcery.\n\nAnd it's so nasty to try to fight that back.\n\nEven pointing out that pretending is what rid the world of the real thing, makes no difference.\n\nBut Carlos somehow left a trail in his descriptions to let people know MAGIC is precisely what is supposed to happen.\n\nExcept, he figured he had more time in which to guide us to it.  So he didn't explain in full detail where the magic could be found.\n\nHe was walking a tightrope where if he slipped and fell too far right of the rope, he'd plunge into the alligator infested moat of pretending.  With vicious snapping animals ready to gobble up anyone who dared go into that part of the river of shit in order to make it up to dry land.\n\nI guess in this nutty story, he's trying to walk across a rope from the river of shit, to the castle of magic.\n\nNot for his own sake.  But to show us how to escape the river.\n\nAnd there's more hazards than 2, but for the sake of this story two will work.\n\nIf he fell left of the center of that rope he'd fall into the hippy chick party town on the edge of the shore,  where women with blue and green hair were banished to the outskirts of the river of shit.\n\nBecause they aren't fully compatible with the river of shit overall \"theme\".\n\n\"Suck it up, and find your soulmate.\"\n\nI don't want to disparage hippy chicks, because in fact those are witches.\n\nThey just aren't very \"focused\".\n\nReligions throughout time have had founders who are deathly afraid of witches.\n\nAnd they've used a common nasty trick also adopted in politics.\n\nTo trash their reputation so well, no one will even listen to a word they say.\n\nSo the hippy chick witches on the outskirts of the river of shit were banished to dangerous waters. And the tight rope to escape to the magic castle is almost a perfect dividing line between the alligator infested waters of pretending, and the \"over the top\" witchy hippy chicks.\n\nIn either location you can be eaten alive.\n\nIf the alligators represent pretending your magic, then the hippy chicks represent having a taste of the real thing but not being willing to dump the river and climb out to dry land.\n\nWhere sorcerers are waiting.\n\nSo they do nothing but \"celebrate\" magic, never really willing to commit to it so strongly that they end up on dry land.\n\nThey're afraid to be alone.\n\n\"Hoping\" without commiting.   That too is a form of pretending I suppose.\n\nNot quite right though, because witches can *intend* things through hope.\n\nNeither is good however if you really want to make it into that castle on the dry shore of the river of shit.\n\nOn either side of the tightrope, you can get permanently stuck.\n\nI kind of wonder, if Carlos knew for sure how much time he had left back in 1994 when his most serious efforts to teach at workshops were finally and fully underway, with him having committed to that path after giving up on another back in the 80s.\n\nWould he have done things differently?\n\nMaybe even do what we're doing in here?\n\nJust come out and tell people what they can *see*.  What magic they can have \"in their face\".\n\nAt the risk of feeding the alligators, and making the hippy chick parties in the river of shit seem more meaningful.\n\nThe hippy chicks who despite being witches, were misusing magic to self sooth.  Rather than to climb out of the river.\n\nFear of being alone seems to be a bigger hurdle for women to overcome, than it does for the men.\n\nIn fact you might say, the snapping alligators are all male.  And so obsessed with biting their way to dominance that they don't notice they're all alone in that part of the river of shit.\n\nBoth are the two halves of the most obvious hurdles to learning sorcery that you can find in the river of shit.\n\nOne goal of this subreddit might be linked to this story.\n\nYou could say we're trying to replace the tightrope Carlos strung for us, to give us a chance to make it to Magic Castle over a safer little bridge that has rails on either side.\n\nSo that if anyone is even slightly serious, we can assure them it's ok to walk that path. And the chances of making it to the castle are very good.\n\nI wish I had a picture of some of the older high mountain metal rope suspension bridges of Mt. Ali in Taiwan.  Those are close to the \"minimum workable bridge\" you can find.\n\nI'd been invited to meet the head tea man on that mountain, renowned for some of the best and most expensive Oolong tea in the world.\n\nHe's partners in a resort hot springs hotel just far enough up that mountain to give tourists the feeling they've \"escaped the city into the mountains\", but not far enough to be tedious if you're an old Chinese couple riding in a tour bus from a subway stop in New Taipei.  Most old chinese couples can't stand each other for very long, especially sitting in a cramped tour bus.\n\nMy boss owns the other half of that hotel.\n\nBuilt when he found some cheap \"sort of flat\" land that wasn't up to local zoning requirements for building a resort hotel.  But which could be made to comply, through the right \"donations\" to the leader of the local Indian population on that mountain.  And by buying the monthly rights to \"hot springs\" water fed to your resort in small PVC pipes like might be used in your garden, to mix with ordinary water for filling the large tubs outside each expensive hotel \"cabin\" room.\n\nThe Taiwanese consider \"10% real juice\" to be close enough to the real thing.\n\nA hot springs restore hotel where unfortunately, I have the reputation as the alcoholic white engineer visitor from the USA.\n\nUndeserved if you ask me, but that's what they say.  When I show up, all the bottles of wine get used up.\n\nThey don't take into account that the Taiwanese don't really like wine, so there's only 8 bottles in the whole place.\n\nI'd try to argue with them about my reputation, but all they have to do is say, \"Eight??!?\"\n\nWell yea, over a full week!   Besides, I like to have young chinese female guests in my room.\n\nWhich doesn't help my image.\n\nI'd go down the mountain to the town below, except no one from the USA could possibly drive that road.  It's hard for Americans to imagine this, but our driving skills are shit compared to Asian drivers.\n\nTraffic rules there are universally accepted to be \"just guidelines\", and zoning laws are always flexible if you have enough bribe money.\n\nSo you literally have 1 inch on either side of your car as clearance, driving down that mountain thorough the little village.\n\nBut they have a Family Mart (7-11) there!\n\nWith 12 bottles of wine!\n\nAnd since it's a mountain in the tropical south pacific, one of the main local attractions for the villager children is to go into the 7-11 and see the high tech fly catchers.\n\nI'd never seen fly catching machines!\n\nSome are elaborate.  And there's no shortage of annoying flies on Mt.  Ali.\n\nAt least, not until you get so high that the air is too thin for them to fly around in their fat bloated bodies.\n\nI'd look closer at the fly catching gizmos to figure out how they're made, except as the only white guy the children have ever seen up there, when I get near the machines where kids are standing while licking ice cream, watching all the flies lured to death by drowning, my mere presence spoils the show.\n\nThey stop to stare at the ghastly looking white guy.\n\nParents will even take their small children from the other end of the store, pretending to be wanting to look at the fly machines too.\n\nBut really they've decided this might be the only chance their little one will ever have, to see a \"White Devil\".\n\nOutside the store away from the fly machines is no better for my kind.\n\nEven the small lap dogs are puzzled by the weird crazy man with white skin,  and can't stop barking at you.\n\nIt might be prudent to simply carry around a bucket of  Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken   at all times.\n\nYou'd get a better welcome.\n\nYou'd hear, \"Aaahhh...  Sanders Chan!\"\n\nIt explains the presence.  They like fried chicken.\n\nAnd I'm afraid we all look alike to them, we me having the grey hair of Colonel Sanders.\n\nIt's either him, or Santa Claus if I want to fit in.\n\nA bucket of free fried chicken would even make the chinese barking lap dogs wag their tails instead.\n\nA positive move for encouraging international relations!\n\nThe last time I was up at that hotel lamenting the end of the wine supply, the farmer guy decided to take me to the top of the mountain, to his main tea farm.\n\nHe'd already shown me how to brew it properly, making sure I'd burn my fingers as a beginner.  A  passing rite of proper brewing of low temperature cooked Oolong.\n\nThe hotel management seemed happy with the idea.  Get the alcoholic white guy out for a while, so that the arriving weekend busses of hot springs going old people could be safely settled in their rooms, before they had to wonder what I was doing in their lobby.  Let them find out the unfortunate news, after they've paid.\n\nI didn't realize it, but the tea farm king also had a 19 year old native indian granddaughter he thought would make a perfect wife for me.\n\nAnd oddly, so did she.\n\nIt was tradition among the \"Islanders\" of Taiwan. The native population that's been there as long as anyone can remember.\n\nWho practice shamanism.\n\nAnd sell their daughters to the dutch who used to go there for the long horned sheep.\n\nDutch Formosa they once called the Island.  Until the Japanese invaded and took it over.  Causing the spread of chinese martial arts into Japan where the Japanese quickly pretended they had that all along.\n\nOn the way up the mountain to the tea farms, where the owner had warned me not to fantasize about the picturesque Chinese women tending the fields of tea plants in their traditional flamboyant tea farm girl coverings, which are actually very practical for someone out in the high mountain sun all day, he explained, in the old days they sold a special tea that was picked by naked virgins.\n\nVery expensive tea!  Makes an excellent bribe for the tax man should you get audited.\n\nBut these days the young ones won't pick tea. They insist on living in the big city below.\n\nSo all the seemingly exotic and beautiful tea girls,  tending the picturesque perfectly green and round tea bushes, are 60 years or older.\n\nHalfway to the high tea farm on the somewhat twisty road, the tiny tourist van I was riding in stopped.\n\nThere was an argument, and my translator said \"He thinks you should see this.\"\n\nSo I got out and it turned out, there was a very long bridge from one high peak on the mountain, to another.\n\nA very frightening looking small bridge only wide enough for two people walking side by side.\n\nOne going to whatever was over there and needed that bridge,  and one coming back.\n\nThe driver assured me it wasn't a windy day.\n\nAnd they'd probably \"fixed\" the bridge anyway.\n\nSo there was no risk it would start swinging out of control, and I'd fall to my death over the side.\n\nDropping so far I was afraid to even look down there.\n\nI examined the trees and wasn't as confident as he that it was not a windy day.\n\nBut I walked across to see what the owner had wanted me to see.\n\nI'd always known that my boss tells his fellow businessmen that he has a sorcerer as an engineer.  Ever since a vision saved our company and earned us $8M the next year.\n\nInstead of being a big negative in Taiwan, it's a huge plus to have a sorcerer working for you!\n\nIt's like having an exotic variety of a famous Daoist elder magic man, on your staff.\n\nNot only can he get the engineering job done magically, but he could put a curse on the competition at the same time.\n\nA double win in Taiwan.\n\nAnd so when I got to the other side of the tiny bridge,  which seemed to be too dangerous to cross in the USA, I found what he wanted me to see.\n\nA miniature golf course.\n\nIt looked like the natives had been working on it for 100 years. You could see that the various sections were using different varieties of cement or plaster, to hold the tiny status and buildings in place.\n\nBut the \"attractions\" in it, the miniature houses and odd tiny temples, were a bit too close together for a good game of miniature golf.\n\nI figured it was cramped for flat space on the side of Mt. Ali, so that was the best they could do.\n\nBut it was a very magical little golf course.  It certainly gave the feeling you could get lost in all of the individual attractions at each hole.  Or even shrink down and go for a visit.\n\nEach attraction like a little village or dwelling space of its own. You'd be living tall if you owned one of those, and were the right size to stay.\n\nOn the rest of the way up the mountain, after I'd seen the golf course,  the owner of the tea farm seemed as if he'd scored points with me.\n\nWhich was important to him because his partner, my boss, had more money than he did.\n\nI tried to discover why showing me a weird miniature golf course on the other side of a terrible cliff, traversable only by risking your life on a tiny bridge suspended only by wire, would make him feel as if he'd scored a point.\n\nMy translator laughed.  \"You like magic, don't you?\"\n\nIt turned out, it was a native shaman cemetery.  A famous tourist attraction in those mountains.\n\nThe Taiwanese love their ancient islander \"Aboriginal\" population. Their clothes, customs, dance, magic, and especially the daughters they have for sale.\n\nI couldn't see the difference between the southern chinese immigrants to the Islands, and the aboriginal inhabitants. Both just looked chinese to me.\n\nThe tour guide admitted it was very hard to tell, but there was one sure fire method to detect the ancient natives.\n\n\"Big Feet\", he said \"They have those for mountain climbing.\"\n\n It made perfect sense!  Evolution.  The chinese with normally small feet plunged to their death, over the cliffs. \n\nSo Carlos strung a rope from the river of shit to the magic castle,  for us to use to escape.\n\nAnd told us not to look down when we crossed.   And warned that high winds made the attempts to leave the river of shit very dangerous.  So you had to engage in \"sustained action\", and not stop to look down at the hippy chicks.  Or taunt the snapping alligators.\n\nJust ignore both of those.\n\nAnd we'd make it across to the castle if we didn't jump back into the river before we got there.\n\nBut the hippy chicks were too alluring for most people, and the rope walk was too far.\n\nOut of private classes only Cholita, me, and Jade managed to get to the castle.\n\nWhich turned out to be more like a cemetary when we got there.\n\nAll dead.  No magic in the castle at all.\n\nJust a miniature golf course run by the inner circle people Carlos left behind.\n\nWith fancy looking attractions, but no actual distances to putt our balls so you could enjoy the magic.\n\nIt was just a very old relic.\n\nBut I knew better.\n\nLittle Smoke and Devil's Weed had been hot on my tail for decades.\n\nAnd the magic was definitely still in that castle.\n\nIt just needed some renovating.\n\nUnfortunately, the inhabitants didn't know there really was magic in there.\n\nThey were proceeding as if it were just an 8 bottle of wine establishment, and the wine had run out.\n\nMostly because Carlos hadn't taken the time to show them where in the castle the magic was hidden.\n\nI'm not fully certain why.\n\nTelling people where the magic is hidden, seems to be paying off in this subreddit.\n\nMost still jump back in when they see how far you have to walk on that tight rope.  And the path is too narrow for comfort.\n\nBut if Carlos had described more of the magic in the castle, I'm confident it would have had a positive effect.\n\nInstead, he seemed afraid to let both the hippy chicks, and the snapping alligators know about it.\n\nIt was a \"castle secret\".\n\nWhich worked out well in the lineages.\n\nBut didn't work out so well for us.\n\nSo I believe there's nothing wrong with describing the magic, as long as you keep the snapping alligators at bay in here.\n\nAnd encourage the hippy chicks, rather than make them outcasts in the river of shit.\n\nThough I must admit, the alligators are endlessly tedious.  And the hippy chicks often feel sorry for them.\n\nSo here's one more piece of Tensegrity magic, beyond the puffs, floating small female heads, pink mists of glowing fog filled with crystalline details, and portals to alien realms.\n\nThose are all nice, but this is even better.\n\nI guess you could call it the \"Kung Fu\" of Tensegrity.\n\nHidden deep in the movements.\n\nAnd it's tied to muscle memory, just as don Juan and Carlos both said.\n\nThe Tensegrity Kung Fu ends up flowing into your daily life, if you repeat the movements over and over.\n\nIt's like one of those \"Wax on, Wax Off\" situations in Karate Kid, the movie.\n\nWhere after slaving away waxing the old Japanese man's cars, so you can learn his stolen Formosa kungfu,  the kid gets stuck having to fight the local bullies. \n\nAnd when they try to punch him, his arm automatically blocks the move.\n\nHe's as surprised as the attackers.\n\nThey try another punch, and his arm moves back the other way.\n\nWax on to block one punch, wax off to block the second second attack.\n\nHis muscle memory got trained, and blocking attacks became automatic.\n\nThe moves, \"turned into something else\".\n\nInto natural reactions that needed no thinking on his part.\n\nHe only had to watch, as his own body blocked the moves for him.  Perfectly.\n\nThat's what's hidden in the tensegrity, except that we battle \"counter intent\".\n\nNot merely human entities.\n\nAnd counter intent can't be fought off with the thinking mind.\n\nIt has to use muscle memory.\n\nIndividual pieces of the tensegrity become \"intent summoning\" natural moves you don't even have to think about.\n\nI suppose lobster strike is one of the most obvious to be sure to program the muscle memory to intend things.\n\nIt arches the shoulder to be aligned to the curve of the back, so that the energy of your double, crusted back there to get away from our grief stricken tonal awareness, can flow along the outside of the arm and project forward to stir the emanations and reskim reality.\n\nIt projects the energy of awareness, the other half that we never use, forward with a strong bent to be active and help us accomplish a deadly blow.\n\nExcept it's really weird looking...\n\nAnd the Kylie Fierce stare during that move, is just too much for anyone to be comfortable with.\n\nI prefer \"the wrestler\".  Which Carlos called a \"not-doing\".\n\nMaybe because it isn't actually a movement, but a pose.\n\nBy a grinning Olmec wizard who seems to be showing you a deep dark secret.\n\nWhich he knows, and you can't possibly detect.\n\nThe curve of the jutting shoulder directs the energy of our double forward.  It flows from you out into the emanations, energizing them.\n\nAnd the fist is ready below, to inject activity wherever you see the results you want, in the stirring emanations.\n\nBut the jutting of the elbow has to be automatic.  You can't be thinking about that.\n\nIt almost has to be second nature to work.\n\nIt just has to \"know\" that energy will flow forward when you do that.\n\nAlmost the same way we have all learned to lead with the side of our body, and keep the shoulder most prominent, if you have a need to fight your way through a big crowd to get to the emergency exit.\n\n Perhaps to escape a poetry reading. \n\n We've learned \"the doing of forcing your way through dumbfounded crowds\". \n\nThere's no longer any thought involved. You just lean in and push.\n\nOne of my Allies once showed me how to use that, to literally run at 500 miles per hour. She claimed it was what the native americans in the old west used to be \"couriers\" for their tribe.\n\nIt was \"native tensegrity\", and somewhat well documented in \"Western Americana\" literature.\n\nIf any thought is required to follow up on a \"muscle memory intending\" move,  reserve it for that purposeful fist below the wrestlers elbow that's ready to jab in little punches, into the energy being projected by the shoulder.\n\nThe tensegrity moves have that kind of \"muscle memory\" magic hidden in them.\n\nIt's not the only kind.\n\nBut it's the most basic.\n\nCarlos explained that the tensegrity movements were discovered by the old seers, as feelings they like to generate deep inside dreaming.\n\nBut what exactly does that mean?\n\nWhat kind of \"feelings\" would you try to add, to a dream?\n\nIt seems unnatural.\n\nWhat he really meant perhaps, was that the movements become so natural that their effect stretches far into the second attention where it's impossible for him to describe what the purpose would be.\n\nBut that once you absorb it, it's automatic.\n\nYou automatically know how to push through things using your energy, in a natural fashion free from thought.\n\nTry it!\n\nIsolate the pieces in the tensegrity as you do it, and see what they \"feel\" like.\n\nI should mention, I was puzzled by the odd reaction of the mountain children, seeing a white guy up there.\n\nI also had the feeling that the workers at the tea farm were staring at me.\n\nAnd even a smile in their direction caused the young women to cover their mouth and giggle, turning their eyes away.\n\nAnd made the young mountain men a bit angry to see that reaction.\n\nI asked him, \"Surely I can't be the first white man they've seen in their entire lives?\"\n\nHe had to think a while.\n\nHe said, \"As far back as I can recall, you are.  So you'd better make a good impression on the children.\"\n\nI felt guilty for using up his precious \"wine supply\".\n\nWhich I'm told, is counterfeit wine.  Made mostly from chemicals.\n\nThe natives can't tell.  It even tastes better to them and has an infinite shelf life.\n\nNow he had to go out and find more at a profitable price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Dark Secrets of Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"n6brfhgjbn3a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6brfhgjbn3a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=273570a1e32dc7f8550e57fb06159045d48ca59d"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6brfhgjbn3a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1334e96599751bffbd1c9fe4703768b4be1ccd8b"}, {"y": 212, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6brfhgjbn3a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52280b0236f2fbe683c787d803c531e0bcc8b907"}, {"y": 425, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6brfhgjbn3a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e27d7c628e1f271c4673e2761006b03aeba4f8e"}], "s": {"y": 532, "x": 800, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n6brfhgjbn3a1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01c18dcdcf96b1e5a6af15a729054a4d6978fc3f"}, "id": "n6brfhgjbn3a1"}}, "name": "t3_zbbsmv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 34, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vQZC-4iXm7lOvh7hfRiNQ6RirnGIZ_exnp8tktLiEIQ.jpg", "edited": 1670086511.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670057099.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n6brfhgjbn3a1.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01c18dcdcf96b1e5a6af15a729054a4d6978fc3f\"&gt;The more Modern \\&amp;quot;Rainbow\\&amp;quot; suspension bridge between mountain peaks.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still trying to escape the intent  of &amp;quot;irreplaceable insights&amp;quot; that seems to come with Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really not good for trying to use tensegrity forms one after the other, so that the results from one make the next stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could say, that&amp;#39;s dark secret #1.    I hadn&amp;#39;t thought of it like that yet, but the words of Carlos when explaining Tensegrity allow for that possibility.  That each pass can alter future events.  And if you string them together you can build bridges with them.  Like a &amp;quot;rainbow&amp;quot; bridge in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His book even tips us off in the title!  &amp;quot;The MAGICAL Passes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A long time ago we had one of the endless bad players attacking here, who was swimming in the intent of pretending his results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got angry over the idea that Tensegrity needed to have magic, to be successful.  It rained on his parade of pretending, if there were any criteria for success other than whatever he wanted to make up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even imagine how someone who was drawn to the books of Carlos evolved to argue that no magic is needed.  I believe he claimed the purpose of sorcery was &amp;quot;Joy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yea,  ok...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that also what flashers who go into public parks naked,  covered only with a trench coat, would say as they flash granny and her granddaughter, near the playground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The purpose for them is, &amp;quot;Joy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretending results is close to the worst thing you can do in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s so nasty to try to fight that back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even pointing out that pretending is what rid the world of the real thing, makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos somehow left a trail in his descriptions to let people know MAGIC is precisely what is supposed to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, he figured he had more time in which to guide us to it.  So he didn&amp;#39;t explain in full detail where the magic could be found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was walking a tightrope where if he slipped and fell too far right of the rope, he&amp;#39;d plunge into the alligator infested moat of pretending.  With vicious snapping animals ready to gobble up anyone who dared go into that part of the river of shit in order to make it up to dry land.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess in this nutty story, he&amp;#39;s trying to walk across a rope from the river of shit, to the castle of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not for his own sake.  But to show us how to escape the river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s more hazards than 2, but for the sake of this story two will work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he fell left of the center of that rope he&amp;#39;d fall into the hippy chick party town on the edge of the shore,  where women with blue and green hair were banished to the outskirts of the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they aren&amp;#39;t fully compatible with the river of shit overall &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Suck it up, and find your soulmate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to disparage hippy chicks, because in fact those are witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just aren&amp;#39;t very &amp;quot;focused&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Religions throughout time have had founders who are deathly afraid of witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#39;ve used a common nasty trick also adopted in politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To trash their reputation so well, no one will even listen to a word they say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the hippy chick witches on the outskirts of the river of shit were banished to dangerous waters. And the tight rope to escape to the magic castle is almost a perfect dividing line between the alligator infested waters of pretending, and the &amp;quot;over the top&amp;quot; witchy hippy chicks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In either location you can be eaten alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the alligators represent pretending your magic, then the hippy chicks represent having a taste of the real thing but not being willing to dump the river and climb out to dry land.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where sorcerers are waiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they do nothing but &amp;quot;celebrate&amp;quot; magic, never really willing to commit to it so strongly that they end up on dry land.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re afraid to be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hoping&amp;quot; without commiting.   That too is a form of pretending I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not quite right though, because witches can &lt;em&gt;intend&lt;/em&gt; things through hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither is good however if you really want to make it into that castle on the dry shore of the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On either side of the tightrope, you can get permanently stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of wonder, if Carlos knew for sure how much time he had left back in 1994 when his most serious efforts to teach at workshops were finally and fully underway, with him having committed to that path after giving up on another back in the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would he have done things differently?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even do what we&amp;#39;re doing in here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just come out and tell people what they can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.  What magic they can have &amp;quot;in their face&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the risk of feeding the alligators, and making the hippy chick parties in the river of shit seem more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hippy chicks who despite being witches, were misusing magic to self sooth.  Rather than to climb out of the river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear of being alone seems to be a bigger hurdle for women to overcome, than it does for the men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact you might say, the snapping alligators are all male.  And so obsessed with biting their way to dominance that they don&amp;#39;t notice they&amp;#39;re all alone in that part of the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are the two halves of the most obvious hurdles to learning sorcery that you can find in the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One goal of this subreddit might be linked to this story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could say we&amp;#39;re trying to replace the tightrope Carlos strung for us, to give us a chance to make it to Magic Castle over a safer little bridge that has rails on either side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that if anyone is even slightly serious, we can assure them it&amp;#39;s ok to walk that path. And the chances of making it to the castle are very good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I had a picture of some of the older high mountain metal rope suspension bridges of Mt. Ali in Taiwan.  Those are close to the &amp;quot;minimum workable bridge&amp;quot; you can find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been invited to meet the head tea man on that mountain, renowned for some of the best and most expensive Oolong tea in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s partners in a resort hot springs hotel just far enough up that mountain to give tourists the feeling they&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;escaped the city into the mountains&amp;quot;, but not far enough to be tedious if you&amp;#39;re an old Chinese couple riding in a tour bus from a subway stop in New Taipei.  Most old chinese couples can&amp;#39;t stand each other for very long, especially sitting in a cramped tour bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boss owns the other half of that hotel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Built when he found some cheap &amp;quot;sort of flat&amp;quot; land that wasn&amp;#39;t up to local zoning requirements for building a resort hotel.  But which could be made to comply, through the right &amp;quot;donations&amp;quot; to the leader of the local Indian population on that mountain.  And by buying the monthly rights to &amp;quot;hot springs&amp;quot; water fed to your resort in small PVC pipes like might be used in your garden, to mix with ordinary water for filling the large tubs outside each expensive hotel &amp;quot;cabin&amp;quot; room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Taiwanese consider &amp;quot;10% real juice&amp;quot; to be close enough to the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A hot springs restore hotel where unfortunately, I have the reputation as the alcoholic white engineer visitor from the USA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Undeserved if you ask me, but that&amp;#39;s what they say.  When I show up, all the bottles of wine get used up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t take into account that the Taiwanese don&amp;#39;t really like wine, so there&amp;#39;s only 8 bottles in the whole place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d try to argue with them about my reputation, but all they have to do is say, &amp;quot;Eight??!?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well yea, over a full week!   Besides, I like to have young chinese female guests in my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which doesn&amp;#39;t help my image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d go down the mountain to the town below, except no one from the USA could possibly drive that road.  It&amp;#39;s hard for Americans to imagine this, but our driving skills are shit compared to Asian drivers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Traffic rules there are universally accepted to be &amp;quot;just guidelines&amp;quot;, and zoning laws are always flexible if you have enough bribe money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you literally have 1 inch on either side of your car as clearance, driving down that mountain thorough the little village.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they have a Family Mart (7-11) there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With 12 bottles of wine!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since it&amp;#39;s a mountain in the tropical south pacific, one of the main local attractions for the villager children is to go into the 7-11 and see the high tech fly catchers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d never seen fly catching machines!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some are elaborate.  And there&amp;#39;s no shortage of annoying flies on Mt.  Ali.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not until you get so high that the air is too thin for them to fly around in their fat bloated bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d look closer at the fly catching gizmos to figure out how they&amp;#39;re made, except as the only white guy the children have ever seen up there, when I get near the machines where kids are standing while licking ice cream, watching all the flies lured to death by drowning, my mere presence spoils the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They stop to stare at the ghastly looking white guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parents will even take their small children from the other end of the store, pretending to be wanting to look at the fly machines too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really they&amp;#39;ve decided this might be the only chance their little one will ever have, to see a &amp;quot;White Devil&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside the store away from the fly machines is no better for my kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the small lap dogs are puzzled by the weird crazy man with white skin,  and can&amp;#39;t stop barking at you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might be prudent to simply carry around a bucket of  Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken   at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d get a better welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d hear, &amp;quot;Aaahhh...  Sanders Chan!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It explains the presence.  They like fried chicken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m afraid we all look alike to them, we me having the grey hair of Colonel Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s either him, or Santa Claus if I want to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bucket of free fried chicken would even make the chinese barking lap dogs wag their tails instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A positive move for encouraging international relations!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time I was up at that hotel lamenting the end of the wine supply, the farmer guy decided to take me to the top of the mountain, to his main tea farm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d already shown me how to brew it properly, making sure I&amp;#39;d burn my fingers as a beginner.  A  passing rite of proper brewing of low temperature cooked Oolong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hotel management seemed happy with the idea.  Get the alcoholic white guy out for a while, so that the arriving weekend busses of hot springs going old people could be safely settled in their rooms, before they had to wonder what I was doing in their lobby.  Let them find out the unfortunate news, after they&amp;#39;ve paid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize it, but the tea farm king also had a 19 year old native indian granddaughter he thought would make a perfect wife for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And oddly, so did she.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was tradition among the &amp;quot;Islanders&amp;quot; of Taiwan. The native population that&amp;#39;s been there as long as anyone can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who practice shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sell their daughters to the dutch who used to go there for the long horned sheep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dutch Formosa they once called the Island.  Until the Japanese invaded and took it over.  Causing the spread of chinese martial arts into Japan where the Japanese quickly pretended they had that all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the way up the mountain to the tea farms, where the owner had warned me not to fantasize about the picturesque Chinese women tending the fields of tea plants in their traditional flamboyant tea farm girl coverings, which are actually very practical for someone out in the high mountain sun all day, he explained, in the old days they sold a special tea that was picked by naked virgins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very expensive tea!  Makes an excellent bribe for the tax man should you get audited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But these days the young ones won&amp;#39;t pick tea. They insist on living in the big city below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So all the seemingly exotic and beautiful tea girls,  tending the picturesque perfectly green and round tea bushes, are 60 years or older.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Halfway to the high tea farm on the somewhat twisty road, the tiny tourist van I was riding in stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was an argument, and my translator said &amp;quot;He thinks you should see this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I got out and it turned out, there was a very long bridge from one high peak on the mountain, to another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very frightening looking small bridge only wide enough for two people walking side by side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One going to whatever was over there and needed that bridge,  and one coming back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The driver assured me it wasn&amp;#39;t a windy day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#39;d probably &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; the bridge anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there was no risk it would start swinging out of control, and I&amp;#39;d fall to my death over the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dropping so far I was afraid to even look down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I examined the trees and wasn&amp;#39;t as confident as he that it was not a windy day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I walked across to see what the owner had wanted me to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d always known that my boss tells his fellow businessmen that he has a sorcerer as an engineer.  Ever since a vision saved our company and earned us $8M the next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of being a big negative in Taiwan, it&amp;#39;s a huge plus to have a sorcerer working for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like having an exotic variety of a famous Daoist elder magic man, on your staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only can he get the engineering job done magically, but he could put a curse on the competition at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A double win in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so when I got to the other side of the tiny bridge,  which seemed to be too dangerous to cross in the USA, I found what he wanted me to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A miniature golf course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looked like the natives had been working on it for 100 years. You could see that the various sections were using different varieties of cement or plaster, to hold the tiny status and buildings in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the &amp;quot;attractions&amp;quot; in it, the miniature houses and odd tiny temples, were a bit too close together for a good game of miniature golf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured it was cramped for flat space on the side of Mt. Ali, so that was the best they could do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was a very magical little golf course.  It certainly gave the feeling you could get lost in all of the individual attractions at each hole.  Or even shrink down and go for a visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each attraction like a little village or dwelling space of its own. You&amp;#39;d be living tall if you owned one of those, and were the right size to stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the rest of the way up the mountain, after I&amp;#39;d seen the golf course,  the owner of the tea farm seemed as if he&amp;#39;d scored points with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was important to him because his partner, my boss, had more money than he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to discover why showing me a weird miniature golf course on the other side of a terrible cliff, traversable only by risking your life on a tiny bridge suspended only by wire, would make him feel as if he&amp;#39;d scored a point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My translator laughed.  &amp;quot;You like magic, don&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turned out, it was a native shaman cemetery.  A famous tourist attraction in those mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Taiwanese love their ancient islander &amp;quot;Aboriginal&amp;quot; population. Their clothes, customs, dance, magic, and especially the daughters they have for sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t see the difference between the southern chinese immigrants to the Islands, and the aboriginal inhabitants. Both just looked chinese to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tour guide admitted it was very hard to tell, but there was one sure fire method to detect the ancient natives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Big Feet&amp;quot;, he said &amp;quot;They have those for mountain climbing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It made perfect sense!  Evolution.  The chinese with normally small feet plunged to their death, over the cliffs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos strung a rope from the river of shit to the magic castle,  for us to use to escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And told us not to look down when we crossed.   And warned that high winds made the attempts to leave the river of shit very dangerous.  So you had to engage in &amp;quot;sustained action&amp;quot;, and not stop to look down at the hippy chicks.  Or taunt the snapping alligators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just ignore both of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;d make it across to the castle if we didn&amp;#39;t jump back into the river before we got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the hippy chicks were too alluring for most people, and the rope walk was too far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of private classes only Cholita, me, and Jade managed to get to the castle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which turned out to be more like a cemetary when we got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All dead.  No magic in the castle at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a miniature golf course run by the inner circle people Carlos left behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With fancy looking attractions, but no actual distances to putt our balls so you could enjoy the magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just a very old relic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I knew better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed had been hot on my tail for decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the magic was definitely still in that castle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just needed some renovating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the inhabitants didn&amp;#39;t know there really was magic in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were proceeding as if it were just an 8 bottle of wine establishment, and the wine had run out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly because Carlos hadn&amp;#39;t taken the time to show them where in the castle the magic was hidden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not fully certain why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Telling people where the magic is hidden, seems to be paying off in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most still jump back in when they see how far you have to walk on that tight rope.  And the path is too narrow for comfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if Carlos had described more of the magic in the castle, I&amp;#39;m confident it would have had a positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, he seemed afraid to let both the hippy chicks, and the snapping alligators know about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a &amp;quot;castle secret&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which worked out well in the lineages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But didn&amp;#39;t work out so well for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I believe there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with describing the magic, as long as you keep the snapping alligators at bay in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And encourage the hippy chicks, rather than make them outcasts in the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though I must admit, the alligators are endlessly tedious.  And the hippy chicks often feel sorry for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s one more piece of Tensegrity magic, beyond the puffs, floating small female heads, pink mists of glowing fog filled with crystalline details, and portals to alien realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are all nice, but this is even better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you could call it the &amp;quot;Kung Fu&amp;quot; of Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hidden deep in the movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s tied to muscle memory, just as don Juan and Carlos both said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity Kung Fu ends up flowing into your daily life, if you repeat the movements over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like one of those &amp;quot;Wax on, Wax Off&amp;quot; situations in Karate Kid, the movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where after slaving away waxing the old Japanese man&amp;#39;s cars, so you can learn his stolen Formosa kungfu,  the kid gets stuck having to fight the local bullies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when they try to punch him, his arm automatically blocks the move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s as surprised as the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They try another punch, and his arm moves back the other way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wax on to block one punch, wax off to block the second second attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His muscle memory got trained, and blocking attacks became automatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moves, &amp;quot;turned into something else&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into natural reactions that needed no thinking on his part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He only had to watch, as his own body blocked the moves for him.  Perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s hidden in the tensegrity, except that we battle &amp;quot;counter intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not merely human entities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And counter intent can&amp;#39;t be fought off with the thinking mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to use muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Individual pieces of the tensegrity become &amp;quot;intent summoning&amp;quot; natural moves you don&amp;#39;t even have to think about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose lobster strike is one of the most obvious to be sure to program the muscle memory to intend things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It arches the shoulder to be aligned to the curve of the back, so that the energy of your double, crusted back there to get away from our grief stricken tonal awareness, can flow along the outside of the arm and project forward to stir the emanations and reskim reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It projects the energy of awareness, the other half that we never use, forward with a strong bent to be active and help us accomplish a deadly blow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;#39;s really weird looking...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the Kylie Fierce stare during that move, is just too much for anyone to be comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prefer &amp;quot;the wrestler&amp;quot;.  Which Carlos called a &amp;quot;not-doing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe because it isn&amp;#39;t actually a movement, but a pose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By a grinning Olmec wizard who seems to be showing you a deep dark secret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which he knows, and you can&amp;#39;t possibly detect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The curve of the jutting shoulder directs the energy of our double forward.  It flows from you out into the emanations, energizing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the fist is ready below, to inject activity wherever you see the results you want, in the stirring emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the jutting of the elbow has to be automatic.  You can&amp;#39;t be thinking about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It almost has to be second nature to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just has to &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; that energy will flow forward when you do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost the same way we have all learned to lead with the side of our body, and keep the shoulder most prominent, if you have a need to fight your way through a big crowd to get to the emergency exit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps to escape a poetry reading. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve learned &amp;quot;the doing of forcing your way through dumbfounded crowds&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no longer any thought involved. You just lean in and push.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my Allies once showed me how to use that, to literally run at 500 miles per hour. She claimed it was what the native americans in the old west used to be &amp;quot;couriers&amp;quot; for their tribe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was &amp;quot;native tensegrity&amp;quot;, and somewhat well documented in &amp;quot;Western Americana&amp;quot; literature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any thought is required to follow up on a &amp;quot;muscle memory intending&amp;quot; move,  reserve it for that purposeful fist below the wrestlers elbow that&amp;#39;s ready to jab in little punches, into the energy being projected by the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity moves have that kind of &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot; magic hidden in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the only kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s the most basic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos explained that the tensegrity movements were discovered by the old seers, as feelings they like to generate deep inside dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what exactly does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; would you try to add, to a dream?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What he really meant perhaps, was that the movements become so natural that their effect stretches far into the second attention where it&amp;#39;s impossible for him to describe what the purpose would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that once you absorb it, it&amp;#39;s automatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You automatically know how to push through things using your energy, in a natural fashion free from thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isolate the pieces in the tensegrity as you do it, and see what they &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should mention, I was puzzled by the odd reaction of the mountain children, seeing a white guy up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also had the feeling that the workers at the tea farm were staring at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even a smile in their direction caused the young women to cover their mouth and giggle, turning their eyes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And made the young mountain men a bit angry to see that reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him, &amp;quot;Surely I can&amp;#39;t be the first white man they&amp;#39;ve seen in their entire lives?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had to think a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;As far back as I can recall, you are.  So you&amp;#39;d better make a good impression on the children.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt guilty for using up his precious &amp;quot;wine supply&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I&amp;#39;m told, is counterfeit wine.  Made mostly from chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The natives can&amp;#39;t tell.  It even tastes better to them and has an infinite shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now he had to go out and find more at a profitable price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c812fe20-6005-11ea-a726-0e9c39b3b989", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "zbbsmv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 15, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zbbsmv/the_dark_secrets_of_tensegrity/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/zbbsmv/the_dark_secrets_of_tensegrity/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1670057099.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iys0sof", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1670092742.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iyrtpuu", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;I thought I broke the dog because she is a super active and a crazy dog.\n\nBoth Cholita and I wish we could do that.\n\nWe're not fond of dogs.\n\nExcept, Cholita is also a cat murderer if they cross her.\n\nDeath by magic.\n\n\\&gt; Also with Zuleica's pass I can feel something happening like gathering the energy\n\nI'll have to animate all that pass can do, as far as I've discovered so far.\n\nPandora's Box first, and then that one.\n\nMaybe entitled, \"Two Missing Passes\".\n\nSo it's long enough to put my little Moth flying from the center of the universe, to become the dreaming emissary intro.\n\nI just want to see that goddamned moth fly!\n\nI'm having to learn everything in blender, to pull that off.\n\nI even  have a realistic \"transparent\" water cooler bottle, on a water cooler that looks real.\n\nWish I had better info on the original at Dance Home.\n\nBut those never last more than 10 years.

But you&amp;#39;ll go down their tiny path, which dead ends quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all have &amp;quot;the intent of stealing from others with phony spirituality and magic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an analogy:  If you want the love of a mate you haven&amp;#39;t yet captured, you can&amp;#39;t be showing off all the photos of other potential mates, on your cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can tell that person all day long, &amp;quot;They don&amp;#39;t mean a thing to me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it won&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best for darkroom is to pick tensegrity forms you like, practice in perfect darkness and silence until you can see what they do, with visual displays of light, and after that &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; will begin to store into the tensegrity forms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like building a room addition to your home, with each form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you figure out what each form &amp;quot;does&amp;quot;, you can come up with a &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;, and rearrange or change your forms, for the goal of that project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read past posts for the fastest progress, so you begin to be &amp;quot;saturated&amp;quot; with the correct intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And dump all that counter intent you picked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert Monroe and The Buddha are NOT your friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_zbbsmv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zbbsmv/the_dark_secrets_of_tensegrity/izg9bfc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670536503.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "izg7mr6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "growlikeaflower", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1670535819.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_zbbsmv", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_juj59kud", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Do you (anyone who has had success in this practice) only do tensegrity in darkroom?

So I left the closet and went to lay in my bed. It's pitch black in our room at night, but I share the room with my (non-practicing, or aware I'm practicing) husband...who snores, horrifically.

So I'm laying there ans instead of closing my eyes and trying to see through lids, I kept eyes wide open. Before, I would lay very still, but instead I started tensing my muscles in sequential order from toes to the crown of my head. After about 10 minutes I was seeing vague shapes and colors (no puffs yet) 10 minutes after that a red spot appears in the center of my vision. I keep my immediate focus on the spot but am also paying attention as a round-ish window opens around it. Everything was still black (except the red spot) but there was a variation in the heaviness of the black, inside and outside of the window. Then I saw movement, I shifted my focus and could see there were words displayed in the window. They were written in all different colors and moving really fast, as if scrolling down a computer pages by moving the bar on the side of the screen. I couldn't read any of it bc of the pace of the movement, and the words seemed like jumbled letters of incoherence. They were definitely letters...but I couldn't see how they fit together to make words. \n\nI watched them intensely and now as I'm reviewing the memory,  I think I did experience silence,  but not due to effort alone...more because I was in absolute awe.

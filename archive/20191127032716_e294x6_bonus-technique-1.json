At least, not at first.\n\nYou're just trying to watch the second attention, while silent.  Watching or hearing or feeling anything that comes from the second attention, while silent, will pull your assemblage point towards heightened awareness.\n\nYou'll not only learn what the second attention feels like, in various stages, but you'll learn what the assemblage point is, and what it feels like when it moves.\n\nIt still has to loosen up, but typically time helps out with that.

It's obvious it's delusional. So you have to keep \"pretending\", despite the fact that they're so bright, it ought to hurt your eyes.\n\nFortunately, it turns out there's a middle ground.\n\nScoop some color, and examine it carefully. Find it's basic shape, or structure. See if anything is moving.\n\nIf it's not bright enough, resort to the other techniques to brighten it up.\n\nOnce it's very clear, find any movement, and help it move, using your hand. If there's no movement, look for depressions you can rub to make them deeper.\n\nIf it's a vague violet and jet black yin/yang symbol type affair  (it's common for people to see that), it'll have some rotating motion where the jet black eats up the violet over a 20 second period, but the violet regenerates after the black half passes.\n\nPick a side, and help it out.

They come back with all kinds of worries and important \"problems\".\n\nBut no report on what happened.\n\nAnd you learn from each one.

It's not fake if you feel good.\n\nThen one day, after I'd been practicing his techniques despite the fact that he was a fake, the shit hit the fan.\n\nAnd I instantly *knew*, **that's** what Carlos planned all along.\n\nWell, heightened awareness is a bit delusional.  That's possibly the whole point of it. \n\nIt's not the goal of an \"impeccable warrior\".  \n\nIt's delusional.    So you stop blocking stuff.  \n\nI believe Carlos switched strategies, realizing things weren\u2019t going so well.  What he had in mind, I\u2019m not sure.  But I believe it was a longer term plan.\n\nAs for these feet techniques being really stupid, in my BCE days (Before Cholita Era), my assemblage point was so flexible that I couldn\u2019t actually write up some experiences as interesting stories.\n\nNo one wants to hear, if you\u2019d like to visit the world of pastel smears, just turn your head to the left, and take a tiny step back with the left leg, leaving the right in place.\n\nYou just step into it, that\u2019s all.

It&amp;#39;s not fake if you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one day, after I&amp;#39;d been practicing his techniques despite the fact that he was a fake, the shit hit the fan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I instantly &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;that&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; what Carlos planned all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, heightened awareness is a bit delusional.  That&amp;#39;s possibly the whole point of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the goal of an &amp;quot;impeccable warrior&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s delusional.    So you stop blocking stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Carlos switched strategies, realizing things weren\u2019t going so well.  What he had in mind, I\u2019m not sure.  But I believe it was a longer term plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for these feet techniques being really stupid, in my BCE days (Before Cholita Era), my assemblage point was so flexible that I couldn\u2019t actually write up some experiences as interesting stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one wants to hear, if you\u2019d like to visit the world of pastel smears, just turn your head to the left, and take a tiny step back with the left leg, leaving the right in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just step into it, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s right there!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compared to that lame technique, those foot movements are complex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_e294x6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/e294x6/bonus_technique_1/f949kl1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1575081427.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1575081427.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f944306", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1575076746.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f94143z", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "They taught a series at a workshop done with the feet and lower legs while laying down called \"Running Man:\"\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=WB-A3oB45tY Demo\n\nhttp://www.geocities.ws/magicalpass/runningman.html  Detailed and Animated", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f944306", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They taught a series at a workshop done with the feet and lower legs while laying down called &amp;quot;Running Man:&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=WB-A3oB45tY\"&gt;https://youtube.com/watch?v=WB-A3oB45tY&lt;/a&gt; Demo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.geocities.ws/magicalpass/runningman.html\"&gt;http://www.geocities.ws/magicalpass/runningman.html&lt;/a&gt;  Detailed and Animated&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_e294x6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/e294x6/bonus_technique_1/f944306/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1575076746.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f94143z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1575074213.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_e294x6", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Here's another bonus technique.

thinks that\u2019s now her car.\n\nOr a former patron took her in, and she needs the car to give the appearance she\u2019s still holding together.\n\nOr she's finally decided to commit suicide, and is already dead somewhere.\n\nIn other words, I\u2019m a little preoccupied today.  \n\nBut there's a lot more in that document than I realized.  Looks like he put it together himself.\n\nI\u2019m loathe to read anything written by Carlos Castaneda, because he told us to stop doing that.\n \nBut if there\u2019s anything specific someone wants a comment on, I could give it a try.\n\nNot that I can answer the really detailed stuff, like the spots on the energy body he elaborates. \n\nI can\u2019t see my own First Attention's luminous cocoon.  I can only see the second attention's energy body, and only the lower half.  I look down to see it, while scooping colors.\n\nAnd Cholita won\u2019t sit still for me.  I\u2019d need a good 2 hours in darkness to see stuff like he describes in that document.\n\nEven Silvio Manuel needed that much time, to see Carlos clearly.  And he had to first stuff him into a bucket of ice water, naked.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure Cholita won\u2019t agree to that.  Plus, she has a samurai sword.\n\nWhich, I just realized, seems to have gone with her in the rental car.\n\nAs for the passes, I\u2019m not clear on what you want to know.\n\nThat series is in fact somewhat unique!  I hadn\u2019t noticed it during that workshop.\n\nIt requires several types of seeing, to verify all of the passes.\n\nSo while someone might read it and think, Carlos just kept making up weird Kungfu movements to sell workshop tickets, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on there at all.\n\nHe\u2019s challenging anyone who can *see*, to realize there are different categories of *seeing*.\n\nAll of that series for emphasizing the energy body will work as described.  I do those often.\n\nYou can literally see, fully visually and very bright, the results of those.\n\nIt probably won\u2019t be what you expected, but it\u2019ll be just as good.\n\nAt first it will be vague, but unmistakable.  If it gets less vague, you\u2019re probably screwed.\n\nYou\u2019ll blank out. \n\nYou can\u2019t watch the second attention that intently without your assemblage point moving rapidly. It\u2019s being tugged hard, from the second attention.\n\nA rapid movement of the assemblage point is accompanied by a blank out, because your attention can no longer focus on what it had previously focused on. That\u2019s gone.   And it takes a while for it to hook to something else.\n\nJust a warning to anyone who tries that.  \n\nDon\u2019t be greedy. Don\u2019t stare.  And give yourself a thumbs up, when it gets really cool.\n\nOr you might not remember.\n\nI had 4 thumbs ups last night, but only remember 2 of them now.\n\nHow can you *see* these passes yourself? \n\n2 hours of silence, and manipulation of colors. \n\nOnly lack of internal dialogue is needed. You don't have to silence yourself further, since you'd end up risking \"stopping the world\".\n\nWhen the colors are as bright as the sun, you\u2019re in business.  I say bright as the sun, but since there\u2019s no actual light, it won\u2019t feel the same. No pain.\n\nBy the way, if you run into a gigantic burst of light, perhaps a monk takes an interest in you, it won't hurt.  That's yet another way to tell something visual is coming from the second attention, and isn't something physical, like a bright spotlight.\n\nThose have a tiny bit of pain associated with them.\n\nThe Westwood passes for stirring up personal history are problematic.  It\u2019s not the type of *seeing* I know how to do.  \n\nI could recommend a method.  In absolute silence, after your 2 hours of bright colors, do those moves.  \n\nFor instance, \u201cStirring Up the Personal History with the Heel to the Ground by Tapping it Twenty Times\u201d.  \n\nWhen you reach that level of silence, you can see fantasies in the mind. Pictures, images, memories.\n\nThose are independent of the internal dialogue.  As far as I can tell, those motivate it.  That\u2019s what the internal dialogue fusses about.\n\nThose latent images in the mind.\n\nWhen you can clearly see those, you can do the personal history passes.  And you should be able to see the effect of them.\n\nDon't get rid of them, as you would to stop the world. Just keep track of what they are.\n\nYou aren\u2019t looking outward, but inward.  It\u2019s intrinsically different from the forging series, in terms of how to *see* it.\n\nHopefully after stomping your heel, you're fantasy image in the mind will change to something from your personal history.\n\nInstead of fussing about Aunt Ruth, you'll find yourself fussing about Uncle Bob, whom you haven't obsessed over in years.\n\nAnd just for good measure, don't be surprised at how you *see* those images.\n\nThey might actually have a gilded frame around them. \n\nWhy seems rather obvious to me but I'll explain. When Carlos taught us about \"the wall\", and how you could read text from it, his explanation was,\n\n\"We're readers!\"\n\nHe meant, our first attention is used to the doing of reading printed text. \n\nWhich means, the ancient sorcerers would not see text.  God only knows what they'd see.  \n\nLikewise, if you really get the second attention going, and *intend* to see an image, it would not be surprising if it had a frame.\n\nOr, for younger people, you might *see* the images on a smart phone screen.\n\nSorcery seems wacky, but in fact it's rather logical.\n\nThe recapitulation passes require yet another type of *seeing*. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the recapitulation wings pass would do.  Maybe Carlos just thought it would be funny to get everyone to do a chicken dance, in preparation for the next one.  Embarrass them, and lighten up the Europeans.  Get the women giggling.\n\nBut opening a window to peer into infinity I understand. You can do that.\n\nIt's not even difficult!\n\nIn this case, you\u2019re trying to see at a distance, using *intent*.  The movements are designed to summon the *intent* needed, but there are other ways to accomplish that.\n\nIn particular, once you can scoop energy and apply it to your body, and actually visibly see that, you can rub it onto your arms.\n\nKeep scooping and rubbing until they glow as bright as a real oven light bulb would in the dark room.\n\nI did that last night, trying to lure my inorganic beings back from Cholita.\n\nNo luck. They're still petrified. Or chasing Cholita. I don't know which.\n\nWhen you get your arms that bright, you can pull them apart, align them, or pretty much do whatever you like, to make it seem like they\u2019re indicating where you should look.\n\nIt\u2019s all intent!  The details for that one aren\u2019t all that important.\n\nThe main thing is, you're looking through energy, expecting to see something.\n\nIt's all second attention!\n\nWhat will you see?  Another world, unless you tap into the abstract. And then there\u2019s no telling what you\u2019d see.\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of the abstract. You can get stuck for hours.\n\nThe rest of the passes are like that. Different kinds of *seeing* are needed if you want to see what\u2019s actually going on.\n\nBut I suspect your real concern was, is this all just bullshit?\n\nNo.  \n\nEdited three times", "edited": 1577125404.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fbuymtt", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a cold today, and Cholita\u2019s fled with a rental car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She might be living in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or she found another place to live in LA, and thinks that\u2019s now her car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a former patron took her in, and she needs the car to give the appearance she\u2019s still holding together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or she&amp;#39;s finally decided to commit suicide, and is already dead somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, I\u2019m a little preoccupied today.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a lot more in that document than I realized.  Looks like he put it together himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m loathe to read anything written by Carlos Castaneda, because he told us to stop doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if there\u2019s anything specific someone wants a comment on, I could give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that I can answer the really detailed stuff, like the spots on the energy body he elaborates. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t see my own First Attention&amp;#39;s luminous cocoon.  I can only see the second attention&amp;#39;s energy body, and only the lower half.  I look down to see it, while scooping colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Cholita won\u2019t sit still for me.  I\u2019d need a good 2 hours in darkness to see stuff like he describes in that document.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Silvio Manuel needed that much time, to see Carlos clearly.  And he had to first stuff him into a bucket of ice water, naked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m pretty sure Cholita won\u2019t agree to that.  Plus, she has a samurai sword.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which, I just realized, seems to have gone with her in the rental car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the passes, I\u2019m not clear on what you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That series is in fact somewhat unique!  I hadn\u2019t noticed it during that workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It requires several types of seeing, to verify all of the passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while someone might read it and think, Carlos just kept making up weird Kungfu movements to sell workshop tickets, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on there at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s challenging anyone who can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, to realize there are different categories of &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of that series for emphasizing the energy body will work as described.  I do those often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally see, fully visually and very bright, the results of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It probably won\u2019t be what you expected, but it\u2019ll be just as good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first it will be vague, but unmistakable.  If it gets less vague, you\u2019re probably screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll blank out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t watch the second attention that intently without your assemblage point moving rapidly. It\u2019s being tugged hard, from the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A rapid movement of the assemblage point is accompanied by a blank out, because your attention can no longer focus on what it had previously focused on. That\u2019s gone.   And it takes a while for it to hook to something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a warning to anyone who tries that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t be greedy. Don\u2019t stare.  And give yourself a thumbs up, when it gets really cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you might not remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had 4 thumbs ups last night, but only remember 2 of them now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can you &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; these passes yourself? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 hours of silence, and manipulation of colors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only lack of internal dialogue is needed. You don&amp;#39;t have to silence yourself further, since you&amp;#39;d end up risking &amp;quot;stopping the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the colors are as bright as the sun, you\u2019re in business.  I say bright as the sun, but since there\u2019s no actual light, it won\u2019t feel the same. No pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you run into a gigantic burst of light, perhaps a monk takes an interest in you, it won&amp;#39;t hurt.  That&amp;#39;s yet another way to tell something visual is coming from the second attention, and isn&amp;#39;t something physical, like a bright spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those have a tiny bit of pain associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Westwood passes for stirring up personal history are problematic.  It\u2019s not the type of &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; I know how to do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could recommend a method.  In absolute silence, after your 2 hours of bright colors, do those moves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, \u201cStirring Up the Personal History with the Heel to the Ground by Tapping it Twenty Times\u201d.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you reach that level of silence, you can see fantasies in the mind.

Sometimes people say it\u2019s not there, but it\u2019s easy to find dozens of places where it\u2019s employed.\n\nCarlos just put it together for us in martial art\u2019s \u201ckata\u201d format, so it was suitable for groups. But in the books, it\u2019s just taught on spur of the moment.\n\nThe longer forms have a side benefit: they interrupt the internal dialogue.\n\nBut if you can get silent, the individual moves are likely more useful.\n\nAnd certainly, if you can remember to do it in dreaming, stick to the short movements. Try to manipulate the dream world using them.\n\nTry scooping a phantom who's annoying you.  Just scoop him up into your hand!\n\nBut in the \"real world\", Tensegrity rebuilds the energy body.  The second attention\u2019s energy body.\n\nThat\u2019s the one that\u2019s normally all dispersed in people, wandering out there in infinity somewhere.\n\nIt brings it back, energetic piece by piece.\n\nThat has a profound benefit for your physical body. The second attention regulates the happy chemicals in our body.\n\nWithout it, people need anti-depressants, or some other form of self-medication, like alcohol. They try to artificially add the second attention, using drugs or sex.\n\nOr with meditation, which is excellent, but too temporary.  No one seems to get anywhere with meditation, in the long run.\n\nBut they do get a taste of the second attention.\n\nWith the second attention visiting once a day for real, partially through tensegrity, the body functions closer to how it\u2019s designed.  We aren't made to suffer as we do.\n\nThat's the work of the dark magicians.\n\nWith tensegrity, you scoop that hidden energy, and apply it to your body. Or loosen it up, or mash it, so it can move.\n\nGenerally, you gather it closer so that it becomes usable. At it\u2019s ultimate, you create a copy of yourself. A more powerful one. Our second half.\n\nIf you learn to get silent, and practice in darkness, you\u2019ll be able to visibly see it.\n\nIt won\u2019t be vague or imaginary.\n\nIt\u2019s very bright when you learn to see it!\n\nI\u2019ve gotten so spoiled that I take it for granted I can see in absolute darkness. I was stuffing 10 foot strands of thick purple haze into my stomach last night, some dark energy fibers started to emerge from my stomach, and they whipped around the room, touching everything in sight.\n\nA collection of bright tiny lights, in all colors,  floated down from above and landed in the middle of the activity.\n\nI was bored...  I've seen that before.   It wasn\u2019t new.\n\nA big disappointment!\n\nImagine getting to live in a Harry Potter movie, and criticizing it for not being intense enough!\n\nThat\u2019s where Tensegrity can take you.\n\nRemember this: Sorcery requires NO imagining. NO pretending.\n\nOther stuff is nearly 100% pretending.\n\nSorcery is not, or else you aren\u2019t doing it right.\n\nPick a technique and I\u2019ll analyze it for you, if you like. I can actually go try it in darkness, and report what it does.\n\nBut pick a short one. You might uncover an unknown technique embedded in there.\n\nI\u2019m still partial to \u201cmashing energy\u201d, and the first 5 or 6 techniques in Carlos\u2019 tensegrity book.\n\nThe long forms aren\u2019t suitable for my small bedroom, where I can produce darkness.\n\nIf I\u2019m lucky, Cholita will help me build a pitch black darkness level dreaming house in my backyard, and we can have more space.  She actually positioned the giant fountain I bought her, to make that possible.\n\nAnd she's agreed we should put 2 inches of decomposing granite all over that area. It's makes a good walking surface for visitors.\n\nOne of these days, I have to share Carlos allies.  Maybe we can do it there.\n\nOr Cholita might kill me. That\u2019s still up in the air.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1574878072.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f8vuf6z", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Tensegrity is all over Carlos\u2019 books.

Just scoop him up into your hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;, Tensegrity rebuilds the energy body.  The second attention\u2019s energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the one that\u2019s normally all dispersed in people, wandering out there in infinity somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It brings it back, energetic piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That has a profound benefit for your physical body. The second attention regulates the happy chemicals in our body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without it, people need anti-depressants, or some other form of self-medication, like alcohol. They try to artificially add the second attention, using drugs or sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or with meditation, which is excellent, but too temporary.  No one seems to get anywhere with meditation, in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do get a taste of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the second attention visiting once a day for real, partially through tensegrity, the body functions closer to how it\u2019s designed.  We aren&amp;#39;t made to suffer as we do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the work of the dark magicians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With tensegrity, you scoop that hidden energy, and apply it to your body. Or loosen it up, or mash it, so it can move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, you gather it closer so that it becomes usable. At it\u2019s ultimate, you create a copy of yourself. A more powerful one. Our second half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn to get silent, and practice in darkness, you\u2019ll be able to visibly see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won\u2019t be vague or imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s very bright when you learn to see it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve gotten so spoiled that I take it for granted I can see in absolute darkness. I was stuffing 10 foot strands of thick purple haze into my stomach last night, some dark energy fibers started to emerge from my stomach, and they whipped around the room, touching everything in sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A collection of bright tiny lights, in all colors,  floated down from above and landed in the middle of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was bored...  I&amp;#39;ve seen that before.   It wasn\u2019t new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big disappointment!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine getting to live in a Harry Potter movie, and criticizing it for not being intense enough!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s where Tensegrity can take you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember this: Sorcery requires NO imagining. NO pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other stuff is nearly 100% pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is not, or else you aren\u2019t doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pick a technique and I\u2019ll analyze it for you, if you like. I can actually go try it in darkness, and report what it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But pick a short one. You might uncover an unknown technique embedded in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m still partial to \u201cmashing energy\u201d, and the first 5 or 6 techniques in Carlos\u2019 tensegrity book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The long forms aren\u2019t suitable for my small bedroom, where I can produce darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I\u2019m lucky, Cholita will help me build a pitch black darkness level dreaming house in my backyard, and we can have more space.  She actually positioned the giant fountain I bought her, to make that possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she&amp;#39;s agreed we should put 2 inches of decomposing granite all over that area. It&amp;#39;s makes a good walking surface for visitors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of these days, I have to share Carlos allies.  Maybe we can do it there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Cholita might kill me.

One of my friends named Haditha is a girl who is very gifted intuitively. I shared with her that we should make a video call and womb dream for five minutes to a quarter of an hour each, but we should both be together. We live in different cities. First, I explained to her to get into silence (she can do it very well), then silence will be on her body, it doesn't matter if it's on her lower body or womb, she should feel her body at all times, and she may even open her eyes, and do not limit herself. Then see a red puff and let it cover her eyes completely without force. The intention was just to elevate ourselves and we didn't make any arrangements about what to see.\n\u00a0\nWe took a deep breath.\nI sat comfortably and placed my hands near the womb. I closed my eyes. I started to be silent (mostly during the day, I have 30 percent silence, but it's efficient), then a red puff appeared, and I felt a little pressure on my stomach, and for a few moments I tried to see Haditha behind my eyelids. I saw my friend's beautiful face in a colorful but animated display. I quickly directed myself towards her until I saw it. That is, I turned my attention to her and entered into her puff.\nI saw that I was still in my room and I could hear my friend's voice reflected in my body saying Atiyeh, can you hear my voice? It was kind of funny, I didn't know how to say I can hear you or you can hear my voice or not, so I wanted her to hear my voice. Then I said, \"Should I come to you?\" She said yes, come. I put a little pressure into my hand in order to separate from my body and enter into her room. She said, \"Well, what should we do?\" I was confused, I said, \"Oh, you're right, what should I do now?\" I turned around myself and said : \"I have feelings about the land of Narnia. Do you want to go there?\" She said : I don\u2019t know about it but it\u2019s ok I will follow you. Then I intend a closet in the room, but it didn't come out very well, but I shaped the closet\u2019s frame very good (with intent), Then opened the door and said to her that behind the closet is the land of Narnia. I suddenly saw into the wardrobe at the same time and I didn't see it at the same time. I realized that Haditha's intention was unstable. Her intention was not close to mine. I said, \"Let's see what you want, the closet with clothes or without clothes, and try to realize what I want. Be in tune with me, and then the closet was filled with clothes.\" . . When we entered the closet together I saw a snowy forest, I walked slowly and held Haditha's hand, It was so real that we both got shocked. Haditha said : well what is the plan? \u00a0\u00a0I started to laugh and said : \"Oh, we have to go after a goat. I realized that I can't intend for a goat. I told her I'll help you to become more vivid at this common dream platform.\" feel it Put it on your feet and sink into the snow. when our feet entered the snow, I saw Haditha sinking into a big hole of blackness and the dream changed. I saw that I was floating outside the earth in a black world. I said Haditha don\u2019t leave my hand this is the best feeling in the world ever. Then her body disappeared. I regretted it and said maybe it wasn't attractive for you and I went back to the back of my eyelid (it was like a fantasy tunnel that I was going through to go back. She used to go back and forth through this tunnel and several other ways) I came to the back of the eyelid and saw my friend's hand putting a ring on It was very bright and it hurts my eyes. I opened my eyes and saw that Haditha opened her eyes and we are both in a wonderful state and we are very happy. First, I let Haditha to explain a little to see if it was true or not.\n\nThe first words She said were true and I interrupted her and told her that now I will explain the rest of it so that your doubt would be removed, and I completed her sentences and We understood each one. We both had a common dream. But there were two interesting differences. Number one : Haditha saw a green forest and I saw a snow... Second, the details that Haditha had paid attention to were very important to me, for example, she paid a lot of attention to my hands and her own, but they were normal to me. And we laughed a lot because we saw a common dream without coordinating with each other.\n\u00a0\nI asked her, did you put a ring on your hand, She said yes, when I felt that I was back in the dark, I opened my eyes because the sometimes her grandmother\u2019s spirit visit her and advised her to put on the ring to increase her power. I said you didn\u2019t like it when we were floating outside the planet because everything was dark so you went to put that ring on. Then, after this experience, we did some tests and small exercises in the form of games and entertainment so that we can find better skills and be more coordinated.\n\n( I have many experiences.  I will try to put it in detail... I would like to learn animation design so that I can help Dan and also explain some of my experiences which are very complicated in a simple way. )\n\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1049228682348220468/1130627712923484190/womb_dream.jpg", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "is_gallery": true, "title": "The common dream of the womb", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Womb Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "name": "t3_152g9oq", "media_metadata": {"7sonoteyqlcb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7sonoteyqlcb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbb3e081e6068fc6eaf1f8ad48abc01b33c4f35c"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7sonoteyqlcb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a0434fa4be188ec470c6832738ed5e6488e6403"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7sonoteyqlcb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=241582cb0d0c62f0c047f7143a75ccdd46ee4477"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7sonoteyqlcb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=962f02f7592585214474ca3a15796a900d466a5b"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7sonoteyqlcb1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6744555d0f94152446b34c1ae4c268e09ee36138"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7sonoteyqlcb1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b06fba1b4113b9b2589593e6be526b48472069b"}, "id": "7sonoteyqlcb1"}, "5kvsjyhxqlcb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kvsjyhxqlcb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31a40d1b2d488f235a8ff016ec051fcdede7a1cb"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kvsjyhxqlcb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0bc7586129182cc6b39e656be2a868d75a27073"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kvsjyhxqlcb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6b4440f1990abb98ad13dd5955341f4a8017a64"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kvsjyhxqlcb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d305b7eaa5ca0bf9b00c4bc8576e3a542a88087"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kvsjyhxqlcb1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf59dfcf2b687ce3ce750abf5de9ca2c9ae29391"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kvsjyhxqlcb1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f29af0264ef0be431644a4e923ee5b83a6acd84"}, "id": "5kvsjyhxqlcb1"}}, "hide_score": false, "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 15, "domain": "reddit.com", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6p5fr65gq", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "gallery_data": {"items": [{"media_id": "5kvsjyhxqlcb1", "id": 302983968}, {"media_id": "7sonoteyqlcb1", "id": 302983969}]}, "link_flair_text": "Womb Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/RoRmozWqmv4hNc50C5BZWPgU0ZG-dq_kfjv4w_rHJkQ.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1689633191.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I will describe two of my recent experiences in detail.\n\u00a0  ( No matter what I did, the photo could not be uploaded.\ud83d\ude23)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first case: &lt;a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1049228682348220468/1130627712923484190/womb_dream.jpg\"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; \n\u00a0\nAfter several exercises that I did alone in the field of silence and dreams, as well as darkness and day and night, I decided to test it again, remembering the random observation of a common dream, but this time on purpose.

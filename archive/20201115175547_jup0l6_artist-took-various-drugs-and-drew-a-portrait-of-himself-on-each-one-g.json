You don\u2019t need darkness to see colours on shrooms we all know that. I\u2019ll maybe experiment more with micro doses, as an amplification of the sober gazing experience instead of an experience in and of itself.\n\nI feel stuck in a bit of a plateau with my practice so I may try it even sooner if I can\u2019t bump myself out that with my own sober efforts.\n\nMember #3 - 06:50 PM\n\nI don\u2019t have an appetite for psychedelics anymore, like a son caught smoking who\u2019s dad made him smoke the whole pack of cigarettes I got all that out my system over the course of a very wavey few years of my life.\n\nThe habit reduced itself from tripping on anything and everything Anywhere with anyone, to only tripping alone, to only tripping alone on strictly hawain baby woodrose seeds, and I now do that 2 times a year max. It scares the shit out of me every single time and it\u2019s incredibly intense so you don\u2019t rush to go back to it, the last time I done it was January.\n\nHawain baby woodrose just happens to be the one thing I\u2019d trip on that was increasingly kind to me every time. It beats the shit out of you but it embraces you and explains you why it was for your own good. It\u2019s like a really loving, really aggressive Chinese street chiropractor...\n\nLockdown led to me to picking psilocybin mushrooms for the first time a few years this year tho so I\u2019ll see what they can offer me.\n\nI\u2019d never seen the appeal of small doses but I hadn\u2019t been practicing anything like darkroom gazing in the past so now I can maybe see it\u2019s use as a tool.\n\nSaying that, when I\u2019m going thru the carlos books, and I\u2019m just about finished tales of power, the closest thing I relate DJ\u2019s descriptions and experiences of what the Nagual is, is to my DMT experiences in my younger years. Being on DMT is probably the furthest away from worldly reason I\u2019ve ever been in my life, so it naturally comes up when reading these descriptions of this state of being which is so separate from reason and so entirely abstract and non-worldly.\n\nMember #2 - 08:01 PM\n\n\"...the brain is where DMT exerts its most interesting effects. There, sites rich in these DMT-sensitive serotonin receptors are involved in mood, perception, and thought.

There is a lot of dubious validity stuff over there, on websites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who died at the age of 26 due to experimenting with drugs and medications, after a fatal combo... She was also a practitioner of Tensegrity and recapitulation. So I always warn people to be sure they know what they are doing and take all precautions if deciding to pursue any experiments like that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Member #2 - 05:33 PM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. It should be a VERY well-informed decision. I&amp;#39;m more interested in it&amp;#39;s possible use as a support to the darkroom, dietary changes and micro-dosing as it were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m no pharmacologist!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Member #5 - 05:51 PM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try 5-htp then, could be some curious results&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And relatively safe if alone&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Member #3 - 06:23 PM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Most likely, we are getting a brain entering some hybrid state of dreaming and wakefulness&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That hybrid state is called \u201chypnagogia,\u201d in science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or an AP shift in here like u said :P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Member #3 - 06:37 PM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve got some liberty caps I picked while out walks this year I will experiment with how they aid dark room gazing maybe later this year or maybe next year I\u2019ll let you all know how that goes, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll go swimmingly. You don\u2019t need darkness to see colours on shrooms we all know that. I\u2019ll maybe experiment more with micro doses, as an amplification of the sober gazing experience instead of an experience in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel stuck in a bit of a plateau with my practice so I may try it even sooner if I can\u2019t bump myself out that with my own sober efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Member #3 - 06:50 PM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t have an appetite for psychedelics anymore, like a son caught smoking who\u2019s dad made him smoke the whole pack of cigarettes I got all that out my system over the course of a very wavey few years of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The habit reduced itself from tripping on anything and everything Anywhere with anyone, to only tripping alone, to only tripping alone on strictly hawain baby woodrose seeds, and I now do that 2 times a year max. It scares the shit out of me every single time and it\u2019s incredibly intense so you don\u2019t rush to go back to it, the last time I done it was January.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hawain baby woodrose just happens to be the one thing I\u2019d trip on that was increasingly kind to me every time. It beats the shit out of you but it embraces you and explains you why it was for your own good. It\u2019s like a really loving, really aggressive Chinese street chiropractor...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lockdown led to me to picking psilocybin mushrooms for the first time a few years this year tho so I\u2019ll see what they can offer me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d never seen the appeal of small doses but I hadn\u2019t been practicing anything like darkroom gazing in the past so now I can maybe see it\u2019s use as a tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying that, when I\u2019m going thru the carlos books, and I\u2019m just about finished tales of power, the closest thing I relate DJ\u2019s descriptions and experiences of what the Nagual is, is to my DMT experiences in my younger years. Being on DMT is probably the furthest away from worldly reason I\u2019ve ever been in my life, so it naturally comes up when reading these descriptions of this state of being which is so separate from reason and so entirely abstract and non-worldly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Member #2 - 08:01 PM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...the brain is where DMT exerts its most interesting effects. There, sites rich in these DMT-sensitive serotonin receptors are involved in mood, perception, and thought. Although the brain denies access to most drugs and chemicals, it takes a particular and remarkable fancy to DMT. It is not stretching the truth to suggest that the brain \u201chungers\u201d for it.\u201d \u2013\u00a0DMT: The Spirit Molecule\u00a0by Rick Strassman, M.D. (2001)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://upliftconnect.com/brain-on-serotonin/\"&gt;https://upliftconnect.com/brain-on-serotonin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Member #3 - 08:06 PM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool! It\u2019s also interesting to look at the DMT molecules and Psilocin molecule side by side, they\u2019re practically identical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jup0l6/artist_took_various_drugs_and_drew_a_portrait_of/gchvxou/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1605536383.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_jup0l6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

But that&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;spiritual&amp;quot; thing which doesn&amp;#39;t really have much to do with the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually when people say they have aphantasia they just mean they don&amp;#39;t have a visual imagination. If you have some greater difference than that, which results in you not being able to have any second attention images then you&amp;#39;re just in a special situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like if you no images then you could travel to the void, instead of traveling into a visual dream. Or if you end up getting to the point of silent knowledge you could have it be auditory instead of visuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also probably you could have the &amp;quot;nothingness&amp;quot; modulate your first attention, for stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something like sunlight glitter or fern gazing is not visualized at all, and starts at the physical perceptual level. It seems unlikely you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do those, even if they might not end up having the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_178gr75", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/178gr75/beginner_question_aphantasia/k54i668/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1697469345.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1697469345.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k53mgrh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "1bpjc", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1697454401.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k50qp75", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5hy76ro5", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "For me it doesn't works exactly that way.\n\nCan you answer this : what is the cause or meaning of a void second attention ?

decided I didn\u2019t want to see it again\nMy mind, seems like I could see the thought images in dark room, but now I\u2019m out I can\u2019t see it\nI don\u2019t know if my mind was creating the image of what I was thinking by my will or it was happening on its own\n\n\nDoing tensegrity, I see dream images, no puffs just dream images \n\nDuring waking dreaming, I\u2019m dreaming but it\u2019s like I\u2019m understanding what\u2019s happening only in the moment but I\u2019m mostly forgetting it or not analyzing, it\u2019s moving to quick, now it\u2019s prolonged .. at first they were just dream images, now it\u2019s like a video clip.. seeing landscapes too\n\nI\u2019m seeing the puffs, things in the puffs\u2026 again I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the one controlling them or they are happening by themselves, sometimes I see the images or clips then after I see the puff attached or I see them in the puffs\n\nNormally if  I tried to imagine series of events I easily get tired.. when I did other magic systems.. when I tried \u201cvisualizing\u201d I always got tired and couldn\u2019t do it or for long or seemed disinterested,I\u2019m not saying I was \u201cvisualizing\u201d in dark room, I\u2019m saying I suck at imagining with my own will, so it must have been waking dreaming, but in the dark room, seems like there\u2019s flow and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m the one doing it, or it\u2019s happening by itself \n\n\nWhen I see the barely any colours and purple colors in my eyes, it\u2019s like gazing is different from dreaming or my attention switches to the dream phase but it\u2019s all in the darkness, I wear welding goggles.. simply, there\u2019s two views one where intend to gaze and the other that dreams\n\nSaw a lot of girls, saw two people having sex and I felt like I could assume the position and experience it too, I did not have the desire\n\nSaw an anime character in the puffs, wasn\u2019t looking at me .. when I asked it to, it reared an ugly head like it intended to scare me but it was not scary enough\n\nSeeing white clouds too\n\nAll this would then be somewhat corroborative, that I had a dream while I was asleep and I saw my mom braid her hair outside, at the porch of our home, she normally does it at the back.. when I wake up I see her at  the porch and not the back. It\u2019s just a corroboration. Not that I mean sleeping dreaming works especially for men. And no I didn\u2019t want anything from magic, it just happened to me. With the thoughts, in the darkroom I could see the thought images infront of my eyes? In my sleep, anything I thought was an image.. kind of fading off now that I\u2019m awake\nStill purplish-white light and puffs, the puffs are almost disappeared, it\u2019s not serious like before\nThen I had a waking dream of images and clips of seeing naked girls on TikTok , that after I reposted them a certain girl would get concerned I was splitting attention she was meant to have and then text me.. I was not expecting her text, in real life I saw those videos and reposted them, she texted me not asking about it, but she had been ignoring me, but I was not expecting it. I\u2019m not saying I need magic for self benefit. But then these should point to some validity in the above experience, \u2018cause honestly idk what\u2019s happening.

It\u2019s just a corroboration. Not that I mean sleeping dreaming works especially for men. And no I didn\u2019t want anything from magic, it just happened to me. With the thoughts, in the darkroom I could see the thought images infront of my eyes? In my sleep, anything I thought was an image.. kind of fading off now that I\u2019m awake\nStill purplish-white light and puffs, the puffs are almost disappeared, it\u2019s not serious like before\nThen I had a waking dream of images and clips of seeing naked girls on TikTok , that after I reposted them a certain girl would get concerned I was splitting attention she was meant to have and then text me..

you are silent!?\n\nYep, that's internal dialogue.\n\nThe best way to be sure is, the second attention comes out, and impossible things happen.  Mostly visions at first (fast dreams you barely remember), but suddenly finding yourself standing in another world, for real, is also on the list.\n\n(But rare).\n\n\\&gt; does the attention get pulled into visual effects and sort of know to keep promoting that experience\n\nYes. But that's just one path. I picked that one for this group, because it produces spectacular results you can share with others, to motivate them.\n\nThe other paths to silence seem more appropriate for when you have a Nagual, doing all the hard work for you. And so you just need to learn how to get silent, to get those experiences back.\n\nThat won't work for us.  And the Tensegrity can certainly produce silence, when done for hours at a time.\n\nBut look at how far that got everyone.  It turned into a business, the same way Buddhism did.\n\nOnce it's a business, they strip out what they can't do, so no one bothers them about that.  And add on explanations to tidy it up, and convince those with cash to keep trying, even though the results are poor.\n\n\\&gt; but that syllable, the first enunciation, is a sound, and the next  thought cut to just another, but still, not total silence, though far  less than my usual racing mind.\n\nIt sounds like you're looking inside nicely. But probably you don't yet actually have enough silence to let the assemblage point move, so you're unsure of it.\n\nThe problem is that assemblage point. Nothing fun happens until it moves far enough.\n\nAnd a single thought about those super tall ice cream cones they have at Burger Habit, is enough to keep that assemblage point fixed on this world, so that it can't move.\n\nWell... If ice cream cones are the worst of your thoughts, you're in good shape.\n\nFor most people, it's past \"grievances\" they keep going over.\n\nOur Mom did a real number on our personality.  It's petty, selfish, angry, and sad all at the same time.\n\nIt's void of magic. That's what makes it petty and sad.\n\n\\&gt; also, how good of an effect does the blindfold, towel/pillow, closed eyes work for the darkness?\n\nAny way you can block your normal vision makes it easier to notice the results.\n\nThink of it as a very faint radio station.\n\nYou can tune it in, but if the room is very very noisy, you won't notice it as you turn the dial.\n\nDarkness makes it easier to notice the results. And then watching the results, makes it easier to get even more silent.\n\nWhen you reach the breaking point, you'll feel a tingle go up your entire body, and the room will bloom into colors and creatures, with offers of other worlds you can enter.\n\nI have a student who's very good at finding colors.\n\nHe seems to have figured out something new.  Our thoughts pick up intent trails.  That's what holds us back. We're feeding off paths of thought we're familiar with, which still have some energy left.\n\nFor instance, your mom is an angry crazy woman.  You learn to deal with that as a child.\n\nAs an adult, you notice those intent trails, and you go out and marry an angry crazy woman.\n\nDon't ask me why, but that's what he did.  Me too maybe. Cholita is a paranoid schizophrenic. I was exposed to that as a child.\n\nAnd here she is in my home.  Trying to kill me almost daily.\n\nRecapitulation can wear out any left over energy by going over that intent path again and again, from your memories of the original event.\n\nIt's sort of like how you can do something magical one day, but not the next.  \n\nDoing that required finding a gigantic patch of energy that could be released, when your assemblage point moved over there.\n\nThe next day that energy isn't there, so you can't do that again (for a while).\n\nUsing recap, you can wear out all the energy that keeps you from being silent.", "edited": 1583774411.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fk17d0z", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; like, asking yourself if you are silent!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep, that&amp;#39;s internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to be sure is, the second attention comes out, and impossible things happen.

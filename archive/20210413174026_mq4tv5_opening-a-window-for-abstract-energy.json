Normally I'd say it sucks, but Cholita doesn't like that kind of talk in here. I've promised to play nicer since my public face rubs off on Cholita. I might give her a bad name.\n\nSo we're all feasting at the Darkroom McDonalds, but in fact, there are some very tiny spam sushi stands a little down the road on Maui.  The weather is always 70sF, the rain never seems to last long enough to get you stranded, so it's not too dangerous to seek out food other than what everyone else is eating.\n\nThe natives despise you, but unless you know a local you won't realize that.  Tourism is their bread and butter, so they hate you with a mild smile.  Some of the larger Hawaiian men look like they could eat you if they felt like it.\n\nIn reality, it's probably too much effort.  So they chill instead.\n\nBut let's just say  that this Gift to Maui pass is all about spam sushi.  About ditching the scooping of french fries at the McDonalds, and commanding puffs of energy with your gaze.\n\nBy merely gazing at them, you can move them where you like in the room.\n\nAnd while you \"tow\" one of them around, the others get jealous and tend to follow it.\n\nIt'll drive your inorganic being nuts, and she's sure to get mixed up in the migration of energy inside your luminous shell.\n\nYou can even get them to cluster without moving a finger.  It's confusing at first, and you'll think it's crazy, and can't work.\n\nBut then you blank out, come to, and there they are. Right where you wanted them.\n\nThe blank out part is what should worry you.  Keep it in mind. \n\nAside from that concern, remember the non-directionality delima where at first the puffs of color follow your eyes?\n\nThis pass takes advantage of that fact.\n\nHow can you use it?\n\nDon't. Bad idea.\n\nThere's a reason the word, \"Abstract\" is mentioned.  \n\n\nI suspect the abstract is not like the big mac special at the McDonald's, compared to a \"happy meal\".\n\nIt's not like changing the main course.\n\nIt's more like their spicy buffalo sauce.\n\nPerhaps anything can have abstract sauce on it.  Even the spam sushi.\n\nI recommend, stay in the safe \"Play Place\" at the McDonald's for now.\n\nThe \"Puffery Palace\".\n\nYou have to be careful.\n\nSpam sushi grows on you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nGift to Maui pass.\n\nStand erect, look down between feet, count to\n\n6 while ball of energy forms.

Just dangle the arms at your sides with the fingers spread, and pretend to be a 2 year old trying to dance, while his feet are glued to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pass however, is NOT lame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s evil magic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leave it to Carlos to hide stuff like that in the passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;#39;re at a very small lake, and can see ducks all around the shore.  Forming a circle around the lake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You toss some stale bread pieces into the lake, and all of the ducks from all sides swim over, and swarm the bread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what the initial gaze at the floor does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It summons all of the energy that&amp;#39;s been dispersed to the edge of your luminous cocoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets pushed out to the edge by worry, according to don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe gazing at the floor expecting to see real magic, is the opposite of worry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the energy flocks over to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you get the ducks to swarm your bread, you can walk anywhere along the shore of the lake, and they&amp;#39;ll follow you.  Hoping for you to toss in more bread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even turn your head quickly the opposite direction, and watch the poor ducks fall for it, turning around go to back that way.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it transforms dark room gazing from you having to do all the work, scooping energy onto your second attention energy body, to all you have to do is gaze where you want it to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The silence required is profound however, so a beginner shouldn&amp;#39;t even think about trying it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t practice failure!

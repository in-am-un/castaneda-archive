In past posts.\n\nBut I'll start at the beginning again.\n\nHopefully each time I get a little better at telling the story, so that eventually I can make a cartoon about that.\n\nSo back in the early 60s, when Einstein was popping acid made by my favorite girlfriend's father (Owsley Stanley), all the academics were interested in \"expansion of consciousness\" through drugs.\n\nThere was no stigma yet.\n\nCarlos wanted to do what was \"all the rage\" back in the 60s among anthropologists.\n\nStudy how the native americans used drugs.\n\nHe needed an \"informant\" from a local tribe.\n\nBut UC Riverside was also doing that, and Carlos being from UCLA, found that the place he most easily had access to, through Joanie Baker, was already taken by UC Riverside.\n\nIn part, by my father.  But mostly by Lowel Bean.\n\nHe went to Morongo, and the shaman and shamaness told him they were already committed to UCR.\n\nThey gave him some hints on where to look next.\n\nRuby, the shamaness (and the fear of my life as she scared the hell out of me), said that men like don Juan used to live all over that valley, which was part of their reservation.\n\nCarlos eventually stumbled onto don Juan, and don Juan instantly saw that he was a double male. Which don Juan's lineage needed, in order to copy itself before they left.\n\nBut Carlos was mumbling some nonsense about needing an \"informant\".\n\nSo don Juan had no choice but to pretend he was what Carlos needed.  A Yaqui Indian shaman.\n\nWhich was true, but not in the way Carlos thought.\n\nDon Juan was actually from the area around Fort Ortiz, where the Yaqui wars ended, and a bunch of Yaquis were enslaved.\n\nDon Juan's parents or grandparents among them.\n\nIt was a trick! Don Juan was NOT a shaman.\n\nAnd only a Yaqui, in the same way I work with the \"Chinese\".\n\nExcept they live here.\n\nAs don Juan later joked, shamans are assholes.\n\nWhich they are.  Frauds all.\n\nBut don Juan was NOT a fraud, so he used his knowledge of the past, which is easily accessible through \"seeing\", to give Carlos a lecture on the first shamans in the americas.\n\nThe \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nIdiots mostly.  Profiteers.\n\nAs the first book said, \"they never learned to see\".\n\nThey are NOT at all what we want to be.\n\nBut they were precisely what Carlos needed, for his PhD thesis.\n\nSo while he was running around with don Juan learning about the shamans from Olmec times, who gave rise to ALL shamanism in Mesoamerica, don Juan was striking him on the left shoulder to knock him into heightened awareness.\n\nWhere teaching sorcery is easy, because apprentices instantly understand.\n\nSome of us go there nightly and can verify one bad thing about it.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to remember.  Especially if you didn't struggle hard yourself, to get there.\n\nIf someone pushes you there?\n\nForget it.  Literally.\n\nSo Carlos was learning REAL sorcery in secret, from the very first day.\n\nNone of which was in the early books.\n\nEverything in the first 3 books was just a show.\n\nNot the real thing at all.\n\nBut it was perfect for Carlos' PhD thesis.\n\nYou ought to know this!  Didn't you read all 17 books and publications?\n\nEven reading the first 6 would have told you that the first 3 were tricks.\n\nNice tricks though!  We got to learn how an Ally, plus a well designed ritual, plus power plants, can bring you \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nThe talking lizards (our own Minx) was Silent Knowledge, brought to Carlos through the ritual which illuminated the right emanations to make the lizards answer his question, and the drug mix was used to move his assemblage point all the way down the back, to where it was possible for him to interact with that Ally as \"real\".\n\nHe didn't really sew a Lizard's eyes or mouth shut!\n\nThat was Minx!\n\nCholita's Ally now.\n\nIf you read the story carefully you'll see that all the lizards went home, and at the end just one showed up.\n\nI've seen Minx in his lizard form.\n\nBut he hasn't used it since the first time Cholita showed him off to me.\n\nHere's my rendition of Minx, but I had to make it from a rabbit I bought, so it was already \"rigged\" with animation motions.\n\nI'm working on it.\n\nIt's a squirrel.\n\nHis most common form these days.\n\nA good 5 or so have seen him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hre96sgfantb1.png?width=969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f66e35dedf9d25d93273ee1e6ca2499eb7f47ca", "edited": 1697062206.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k4h8huo", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a long lecture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s repeated over and over in here.

But mostly by Lowel Bean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He went to Morongo, and the shaman and shamaness told him they were already committed to UCR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They gave him some hints on where to look next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ruby, the shamaness (and the fear of my life as she scared the hell out of me), said that men like don Juan used to live all over that valley, which was part of their reservation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos eventually stumbled onto don Juan, and don Juan instantly saw that he was a double male. Which don Juan&amp;#39;s lineage needed, in order to copy itself before they left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos was mumbling some nonsense about needing an &amp;quot;informant&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don Juan had no choice but to pretend he was what Carlos needed.  A Yaqui Indian shaman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was true, but not in the way Carlos thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan was actually from the area around Fort Ortiz, where the Yaqui wars ended, and a bunch of Yaquis were enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan&amp;#39;s parents or grandparents among them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a trick! Don Juan was NOT a shaman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And only a Yaqui, in the same way I work with the &amp;quot;Chinese&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except they live here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As don Juan later joked, shamans are assholes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which they are.  Frauds all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don Juan was NOT a fraud, so he used his knowledge of the past, which is easily accessible through &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, to give Carlos a lecture on the first shamans in the americas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idiots mostly.  Profiteers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the first book said, &amp;quot;they never learned to see&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are NOT at all what we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they were precisely what Carlos needed, for his PhD thesis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while he was running around with don Juan learning about the shamans from Olmec times, who gave rise to ALL shamanism in Mesoamerica, don Juan was striking him on the left shoulder to knock him into heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where teaching sorcery is easy, because apprentices instantly understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of us go there nightly and can verify one bad thing about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to remember.  Especially if you didn&amp;#39;t struggle hard yourself, to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone pushes you there?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget it.

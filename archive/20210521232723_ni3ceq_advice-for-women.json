Anyway, I wanted to give a report on a couple things yesterday, see if they were normal weirdness or special weirdness. \n\nYesterday morning I was woken up just as dawn broke, so then I went to relax on the couch. I laid on my back and closed my eyes and focused only on the sounds of the birds for awhile, then shifted my attention to the dark area before my eyes. As usual for my meditation, I see darkness with what I've always thought were after images of light and the firing of optical nerves? I was trained to mostly ignore anything that I saw it whatever \"happened\" during meditation. So, I paid attention. The afterimages got fainter, to a kind of grey, and ebbed and flowed while I was watching. Often concentrating in the middle as a big circle that expanded outwards to fill my vision, or kind of swirling around like the symbol when your computer is busy. \n\nSo I'm watching these colors (dull grey, maybe a little purplish) and then there's a faint butterfly. Fairly abstract, more like recognizing a butterfly in a cloud, or seeing Jesus on a piece of burnt toast, not like seeing a Blue Morpho in the flesh. But, it definitely looked like a butterfly, wings lightly moving. Then as I looked at it, it exploded like the old windows screensaver, and then was just a greyish purple ball again, like the afterimages of before.\n\nFor darkroom practice, I found some costume goggles I had, stuck some cardboard in the lenses, and tries those. Much darker than my closet! I only made it an hour with them on, but hey, an hour is good for me right now. Things definitely got interesting. It's difficult for me to string it together in order, any time I tried to remember what was happening so I could report back, I lost it. That's the \"book deal\" mind isn't it? \n\nI sat in the dark on my bed, with the goggles on, and at times could faintly see my room, and my body. No color really, and super super faint, but I could see my raised arms, but not count my fingers. I could see the shape of the items in my room, but it was dark and colorless. \n\nI felt a sinking feeling, then an odd shift that felt much like LSD. It sort of felt that I had sunk down from \"normal reality\" and was sitting on the base of it. I felt very empty. This happened at least twice, and it was a pretty recognizable feeling. I think it was here in this state I could see my bedroom slightly, but I'm not certain. Time and memory was weird. \n\nI also almost fell asleep a few times, and noticed weird mini dreams. And there were nonsense characters in a \"memory\" I had, while I was in this state. \n\nI did try to pull the grey swirls and stuff to me, but I haven't looked at any Tensegrity yet, and it didn't seem to have any effect. But, that is how I noticed my arms. \n\nI purposely avoided trying to use technical terms, because I'm not sure if I'm getting the proper experiences, I don't want to mislabel what happened, if anything.

Corruption and alteration by greed, until the magic is buried so deeply that no one even expects it to work.\n\nInstead, they want to hang around people pretending to be doing it, as an ego boost.  Such as in the magic forums of reddit, where there's actually no magic.\n\nAs long as they can claim to be doing it, that's all they wanted in the first place.\n\nYou've surely seen that in Buddhism.  People who sit around 20 years, and never reach enlightenment.\n\nEnlightenment should only take a few weeks, if you put in a few hours a day.\n\nI had 3 new people actually come here this week, and argue with me that the fake kind or sorcery, where the \"sorcerer\" is charging money for nothing but talking, is just as good as the real thing.\n\nThat's how badly greed takes over magic.  Until everyone is so confused, magic is no longer possible.\n\nThat's what happened to the Buddha's knowledge.  And if you preserve the extra stuff that got added on needlessly, for example the Hindu religious beliefs,  it holds you back from even what little managed to remain in Buddhism.\n\nSame happened to Judaism.  The Prophets were sorcerers, using a technique similar to ours.\n\nBut they decided to tinker with society, using their sorcery to make an interesting story line.\n\nNote that the prophets were afraid of witches.  \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\" was for their protection, not for the protection of society.\n\nCarlos wrote a few things about the advantages women have.  I can list what I remember.\n\nWomen can store \"dark energy\" in their womb.  We need dark energy to move the assemblage point far enough to get the super fun stuff to happen.\n\nDark energy is not a slogan. It's not a story you have to believe.  You can both visually see it, feel it, hold it on your hand, and even use it to attack people.   I've been attacked by Cholita's dark energy and it's a physical sensation, like having a very scary woman scream at you so loudly that saliva flies out of her mouth.  But she doesn't even have to make a sound.\n\nMy hair literally blew from the force, and later the sky turned purple and I was afraid we were going to drive our car into an alternate reality.\n\nYou don't want to do that, on the 405 freeway.\n\nAccording to Cholita, Florinda taught her \"All women are witches, as long as they just *know* they are\".\n\nIt's a choice to recognize that reality has a \"back door\" you can learn to control.\n\nMen struggle to move their assemblage point along the J curve.  It can take 3 hours to get to the end of it, even for a skilled darkroom gazer.\n\nWomen can move there in 30 seconds if they understand where it is. But then when they move back, they won't remember it.\n\nThey can also follow men in there, even without any previous practice of it.\n\nBut the memory problem is more pronounced for women, mostly because they can go faster than their skill level deserves.\n\nEven I can barely remember things that happen in the dark room lately.  Just 5 seconds later, if I'm at the very bottom of the J curve.\n\nI know I'm doomed, but try to remember anyway.  I've invented the \"4 thumbs up\" movement, which includes talking, and also a slight \"victory dance\". But still some things are gone in 5 seconds.\n\nA woman, doing that without having had to learn it over months, will surely not remember.\n\nBut she might be able to leave herself clues for later.\n\nI'm not a big fan of smelly candles, considering them useless nonsense.\n\nCholita used to spend $250 a trip to Whole Foods on smelly candles.  Thus my belief they're useless.\n\nBut for women, they are not.  My guess, they can move their assemblage point, by a smelly candle induced trance in the bathtub.\n\nIn fact, all the \"mood aids\" women rely on because of their monthly cycle, have witchcraft potential.\n\nBut don't ask me how.\n\nWomen are allowed to fall asleep when practicing silence.  Shutting off the internal dialogue.\n\nMen should not.   It hardly even counts if you do, and can lead to endless delusion about what happened.\n\nWhen you pair a witch off with a sorcerer, both of them gain far beyond what they are used to.  You can read that in Second Ring of Power, where suddenly Carlos and the apprentices can do things they couldn't do on their own.\n\nI can attest to it with Cholita.\n\nCholita can surely levitate small objects, just by glancing at them.  She's done it for me multiple times.\n\nAnd she's able to walk through the walls of my locked bedroom, tap me on the shoulder, and wake me up.  It's almost common in fact.\n\nUsually she waits to make sure I felt it and am awake, and see her, and then she takes off.\n\nBut once she remained a long time, even trying to tempt me to travel with her into hell.\n\nWitches can travel to see God, Heaven, and Hell.\n\nThere's no \"how\" in sorcery.  You can either do it, or you can't.\n\nWhen you can, you just *know* it. When you can't, you still think you can \"figure it out\".\n\nProbably you can't.\n\nThere's a \"flow\" in there, of a magical force we call *intent*.\n\nThe Chinese call it \"luck\".\n\nAnd others know about it.\n\nBut only sorcery tries to learn to master it.  To be able to use it to produce anything they want, at any time.\n\nThat's why witchcraft works.  That force of *intent*.\n\nThe reason it doesn't work all the time (especially for women) is because you don't have a clean \"link\" to it.\n\nI assume, *intent* doesn't know what you want.  And you haven't earned an intervention yet. And an intervention doesn't serve to move you along your chosen path.\n\nWhen you get all of those clear, and add a touch of humor if possible, you can get it to function on demand.\n\nI assume the \"sacrifice\" is the \"earn\" part of the spell.  But it seems fishy to me.  You should \"earn\" intent's help, with hard work.\n\nBut witches can often avoid that. Maybe intent has a male aspect which they can \"coax\". \n\nThus spells and such.  The spell forms a structure in which you can learn to manipulate *intent*.\n\nBut those spells are contaminated with outside systems, which have the wrong intent and will prevent our form of sorcery.  So you have to be careful with those.\n\nYou should strive to see *intent* in action so you understand it.\n\nMove the assemblage point to the deep orange zone, sit up on pillows on the bed, and wait until the room is swimming with magic. Orbs, floating heads, clouds of intense light, feelings of bliss.\n\nWhen the air is so full you ought to have tears in your eyes like a Spielberg movie climax, but don't because you've entered some strange state of mind where you don't care what you perceive, you can reach behind the bed and pull out an object.\n\nDon't try to control what.  Just reach back there, pull it out, and take a look.\n\nI commonly pull hamburgers out of there, because I can't eat those but love them anyway.\n\nJust toss it aside when you see what it was, and get another.  Don't get greedy and pile it on the bed spread.  You invite creepy things to hang around.\n\nIf you want to control what you pull out, you simply request it.\n\n\"Can I get a coke with that hamburger?\"\n\nYou will.\n\nBut only when you just *know* it's going to work.\n\nThat's a specific position of the assemblage point, on the J curve.\n\nThe hard part is moving that far.", "edited": 1621637213.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gyzsv31", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t give advice on that, but you&amp;#39;re right about Buddhism and sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was a sorcerer, but whenever someone does real magic it creates excitement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially when he tries to teach it to &amp;quot;disciples&amp;quot; and they manage to learn some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They start seeing $$$$$ in front of their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re fighting the same problem in this community.

And an intervention doesn&amp;#39;t serve to move you along your chosen path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get all of those clear, and add a touch of humor if possible, you can get it to function on demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assume the &amp;quot;sacrifice&amp;quot; is the &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; part of the spell.  But it seems fishy to me.  You should &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; intent&amp;#39;s help, with hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But witches can often avoid that. Maybe intent has a male aspect which they can &amp;quot;coax&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus spells and such.  The spell forms a structure in which you can learn to manipulate &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those spells are contaminated with outside systems, which have the wrong intent and will prevent our form of sorcery.  So you have to be careful with those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should strive to see &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; in action so you understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Move the assemblage point to the deep orange zone, sit up on pillows on the bed, and wait until the room is swimming with magic. Orbs, floating heads, clouds of intense light, feelings of bliss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the air is so full you ought to have tears in your eyes like a Spielberg movie climax, but don&amp;#39;t because you&amp;#39;ve entered some strange state of mind where you don&amp;#39;t care what you perceive, you can reach behind the bed and pull out an object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t try to control what.  Just reach back there, pull it out, and take a look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I commonly pull hamburgers out of there, because I can&amp;#39;t eat those but love them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just toss it aside when you see what it was, and get another.  Don&amp;#39;t get greedy and pile it on the bed spread.  You invite creepy things to hang around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to control what you pull out, you simply request it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can I get a coke with that hamburger?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only when you just &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s going to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a specific position of the assemblage point, on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard part is moving that far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ni3ceq/advice_for_women/gyzsv31/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1621635663.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ni3ceq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 15}}], "before": null}}]

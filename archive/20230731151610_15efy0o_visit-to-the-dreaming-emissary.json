*see* stuff like this firsthand.\n\nThe baby chickens need that initial injection of awareness from the rooster, the same way human babies do.\n\nSo it's in there.\n\nOne could *see* it.\n\nThere's so much we don't know about this.\n\nMy theory on double beings is that a baby dies in the womb but its energy of awareness is in a safe place to remain.  In the womb.\n\nSo it's not forced to leave.\n\nOur awareness needs a container or it dissipates into the emanations and becomes too thin to be sentient anymore.\n\nThe emanations individually,  only give off \"micro feelings\". Nothing near what sentience requires.\n\nIt takes millions of them to even form an \"impression\" of something real.\n\nSo if a person's awareness is too spread out, nothing with any usable meaning can form.\n\nThat part we can deduce from the books and how obsessed the old and new seers were with finding viable containers to keep their awareness after death.\n\nWhich can include the \"sealed\" inorganic being's world.  After their physical body is buried somewhere perhaps.\n\nCarlos finally found a \"containerless container\" of some kind, and is said to have become immortal.\n\nI've seen him when I was fully awake, eyes wide open, completely sober.\n\nMultiple times, so it's not as nutty as it sounds.\n\nAnd I didn't have to be blinded on the side of the road like Saul!\n\nI was just doing Tensegrity most times he visited.\n\nAnd we know that the death defier finally ended up in Carol Tiggs after escaping from there.\n\nIf he had an actual organic body, after being trapped in the IOB world for 7000 years, why body snatch Carol Tiggs?\n\nAnd we have the blue scout, energy Carlos found trapped in some weird world.\n\nI find it unlikely Patty didn't have a human past before that.   It's probably why she got so angry when people at a workshop asked her about her origins.\n\nShe wasn't sure herself.\n\nBut we do know she seemed to believe she came from somewhere else, because when she didn't like what Carlos and the group were doing she'd threaten to \"spin around and leave\".\n\nShe was trouble all the time, but actually right in her judgements.\n\nShe didn't like the private classes at all.\n\nA bunch of groupies and franchisee hopefuls is what Carlos mostly had.\n\nAt any rate, sorcery related \"body snatching\" isn't all that uncommon.\n\nExcept in our case,  unlike the fake magical systems such as Daoism on the extreme end, where they beat themselves bloody to prove they're demonically possessed,  the two blobs of human awareness just merge and no one \"takes over\".\n\nThat's a religious delusion. Pretty much common to all of them.\n\nOnce your daily experiences exceed those of all religious icons, you toss out that demonic possession make believe.\n\nIt's just a spooky story to keep people in line so the church can steal from them.\n\nIt appeals to the \"warners\" in a religious group.\n\nWe get those...\n\nIn reality when there's an outside entity merging into a live human, you just get  an enhanced being.\n\nCarol Tiggs called it an \"upgrade\".\n\nAnd probably the \"visitor\" doesn't have as much influence on it in the realm of the Tonal, as the person who was born and grew into that organic body.\n\nReality is partially \"willed\".

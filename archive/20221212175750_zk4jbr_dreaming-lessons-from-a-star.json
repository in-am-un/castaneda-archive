Started in the advanced subreddit, where that specific content can't be copied to the public.\n\nI extracted a reply to a comment from Techno to create a facebook post, and then saw that it would be useful in here.\n\nPlease everyone, there was NEVER a \"warrior's way path\".\n\nIt was made up by bad men, so they could steal.\n\nWhile Carlos was \"learning\" about the \"Men of Knowledge\" in the early books, don Juan  was doing the actual teaching by striking him with the Nagual's blow, to teach him in Heightened Awareness.\n\nWhere, \"real learning takes place\" as don Juan put it.\n\nThe warrior's way was just a distraction. One that you'll discover yourself, but only through real sorcery.\n\nNot by pretending it.\n\nHe also said there's no sorcery without internal silence. But everyone ignored that.\n\nSo please, stop the mental masturbations. There's NO warrior's way path to sorcery. Anyone trying to sell you on that idea, is your enemy.\n\nIt's a sick fantasy not even supported by the books.  And invented by bad men so they can steal from us.\n\n\\*\\*\\* From Facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nUsing the Stellar Hatch Tensegrity pass, I managed to bring down a visible puff of intense yellow energy which manifests as a NASA quality photo of a sun and its corona, on my floor.\n\nReliably!\n\nBut last night it created a cartoon face for itself, with a slightly \"too big\" nose, and taught me about what interested me at the time.\n\nI found this picture, seemingly taken by real astronomers. It's quite close to what I saw, but Stella's face was slightly more \"human\" looking. I suspect she extracted it from a TV show I'd been watching during the week.\n\nShe then taught me how to keep up with the witches, for shared dreaming. It's still more work than I can afford, but I can see that what she taught me is true. It would work.\n\nI'm afraid that unlike the men who greedily want to pretend to be \"Five Pronged Naguals\", so they can victimize and steal from others, the women need some group support of their own.\n\nThey need to feel like they belong to a \"community\".\n\nAnd we have none. At least, not one with real magic obviously going on.\n\nThey're talented with shared dreaming, so if we could get some of the men to learn to do that it could go a long way to keeping the witches around as much as possible.\n\nDon't forget that a new lineage is started by collecting the witches first. After you have at least 5, you get the enormously overweight Nagual Elias to come \"marry\" them.\n\nHe may seem cool zipping around the universe digging through the trash, but without the women he's nothing.\n\nBut I've got too much to do in darkroom other than to learn how to join the women at Dance Home in 1990s Los Angeles, in dreaming.\n\nI don't do sleeping dreaming!\n\nIf I did, that would be the end of it all for the magic Carlos was teaching. As anyone who was paying attention realizes, \"Carlos Castaneda was thoroughly debunked\".\n\nAnd no one did anything to stop that.\n\nWhen the truth is, ALL of the other magic out there in the world is the fake stuff.\n\nHow can that be, that everything fake killed the real thing?\n\nSo it's war then!\n\nTo paraphrase Darth Sidious.\n\nAnd we have enough dishonest men making up stuff about ordinary dreams.\n\nWe need some magic that goes beyond what any meditation system dares to claim.\n\nWaking dreaming! With real physics defying side effects.\n\nAnd it's just an obsession of mine to try to keep up with women, for which I don't have a good \"plan\".\n\nEven Cholita isn't interested in helping such a lost cause.\n\nShe uses the metaphor of the super smelly \"corpse flower\".\n\nOnly blooms once every decade.\n\nAnd it bloomed for Carlos. We all smelt it. It's gone.\n\nEnd of story for Cholita. We don't want to smell that again, even if it was worth it the first time.\n\nBut last night, in comes an inorganic being to offer another path to help the women find \"community\".\n\nThere's no guarantee it'll help, but it was quite an eye opener.\n\nOver the years I got \"topical\" lessons from 3 inorganic beings.\n\nPlus my weird historical expert entity, \"Mystery\". Who's more about the past, than the present.\n\nLast night I got a 4th \"dreaming emissary\", from a stellar puff of energy belonging to a sun.\n\nI have to point out, 3 Allies is possibly the limit for a sorcerer.\n\nAnd I don't recommend more than 1 to beginners. Just ignore new ones!\n\nOne of the 4 who taught me belonged to a witch in the subreddit. At the time. I'm not sure she still has \"Lily\" anymore.\n\nThe Allies require upkeep. If you don't, you lose them.\n\nThe old seers took to scaring their enemies to death, in order to feed energy to their allies. So it's serious business to keep them around.\n\nThis was the introductory text on facebook, which I copied here, which refers to a comment in the advanced subreddit. Which seems ok to copy here.\n\nI don't see any beginners trying to pretend this material!  But it might convince them to work harder.\n\n\\*\\*\\* From reddit \\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Stella\", the motivation for that post, is definitely \"alien\" energy.\n\nI thought that would be \"magical in the extreme\". The energy of awareness, from a star!\n\nAnd so I thought, we should all eagerly do Stellar Hatch to get ourselves a stellar inorganic being. So we can do even cooler extreme magic.\n\nOr even \"a moon being\"! Just do Stellar Hatch when the moon is precisely over head.\n\nWait...\n\nDidn't Carlos call the blue scout, \"moon child\". Or something like that?\n\nYou have to be very careful when Carlos makes a joke like that. All the ones I could figure out turned out to be literally true, and he was making fun of the listeners, who were sure to misunderstand. Then \"get it\", one day.\n\nBut as I found out last night, when Stella was explaining how I could learn to enter dreaming the way women do, a topic my entity \"Fancy\" started but didn't go into detail on, I realized what Stella is best for is \"no self-pity\".\n\nShe never had any at all. She's a star! It's like being a kind gigantic sumo wrestler, around those tiny Argentinian ants. Not wanting to step on any, and being curious about what their world is like.\n\nSome famous martial artists liked to talk to ants.\n\nYabu Kentsu was it?\n\nAnd some \"alien energy\" completely free from self-pity, is just the kind of thing sorcerers crave.\n\nSelf-pity is a force coming only from the back side of the path our assemblage point can take.\n\nThe dreaming technique she showed me was fascinating.\n\nIt has layers and layers to it. I got lost looping in the layers, and she had to pull me out and remind me to focus.\n\nWhich I suspect is the same for women doing \"womb dreaming\".\n\nI'll forget it all soon unfortunately.\n\nFirst, you reach the assemblage point position just shy of silent knowledge.\n\nSo that as you gaze into the darkness, you see quick little dream scenes.\n\nBut not visual. Not \"dream bubbles\".\n\nYou \"fall\" into them, the way you can fall asleep practicing silence, have your head fall forward, be startled, and it comes back up.\n\nIt's so common, Carlos created \"Silence Sticks\". And the coffee table trick.\n\nWhen your head \"bobs back up\" you're shocked into realizing you were just in a dream scene, but are now back.\n\nStella pointed out, \"Now why did you ignore that, in favor of dream bubbles floating in the air???\n\nYou got entry! Isn't that what humans crave?\"\n\nStella then taught me that \"forgetting your purpose\" when you get in, and then being angry about it when you come out, is not the issue at all.\n\nIt's laziness.\n\nThat you can't get those mini-dream entries on demand, or control them when you do, or that it interrupts your darkness gazing with your eyes open, is not the issue at all.\n\nInstead, the problem is that we don't look at what we're doing honestly.\n\nShe suggested I give up the obsession of doing it with my eyes open, and go ahead and close them. Lay on my side in a \"twin position\", so that once I get in, I can lay down inside the dream and go to sleep there.\n\nBut keep the strong sense of purpose that prevents falling asleep while laying on my side with my eyes closed, doing this technique.\n\nObserve! Don't be mentally lazy.\n\nSorcerers learn to do that. Over time, they learn that you can \"fix\" things.\n\nSo you might start out seriously learning sorcery as a weak old man, but using the power of patience and daily observation you can make yourself as strong as don Juan was said to be.\n\nBy careful alteration of your behavior, and the addition of new things.\n\nMaybe you just go to the gym each weekend and lift the max weights you can on the machines.\n\nEventually you'll look like Jack LaLanne, at 85. Who Carlos admired enough to make him the topic of a lecture, twice.\n\nBut you apply that to everything in your life, so that you daily \"improve\".\n\nInstead of decline.\n\nThe same can be done, to learn to go into dreaming the way women can using their womb.\n\nDirectly from awake.\n\nFrom here it gets strange.\n\nYou reach the point of periodic tiny dream visions, and then notice what exactly prevented you from stepping off into full on lucid dreaming.\n\nYou forgot your purpose once you were in?\n\nSo then, you have to analyze why you failed to bring some tonal rationality into there. Maybe all it will take is to move some of the blanket on the bed, to cover the back of your neck.\n\nMaybe you forgot, because you were distracted by the real world. It's was too cold perhaps!\n\nNot all \"magic\" is show business. Some is mundane.\n\nAnd never forget that \"intent\" can help you out, if you seem to be working hard to figure it out.\n\nSo the technique doesn't really do the job.\n\nIt only \"summons\" help from the spirit.\n\nBut you have to be deadly serious in your attempts to \"learn it\".\n\nPerhaps you got in, but there was a dream already going on with others who practice sorcery? A common thing.\n\nYou have to pay attention to which direction they're looking. What they're doing.\n\nNot how they receive you. That's self-pity. Don't go into a dream, based on self-pity and attention seeking!\n\nThe dream beings aren't going to throw a party for you!\n\nThe rest of what Stella taught me gets too abstract to describe, and mostly impossible to remember at this level.\n\nBut the key is, you stop wishing and pretending you'll get around to it someday, and instead you observe every detail closely, and modify it as needed.\n\nYou build a container for intent to store the knowledge of how to go directly into full on lucid dreaming, from being fully awake.\n\nThe particulars might not even be important. Maybe you're merely trying to convince intent and the spirit to be on your side in this one. And once they are, you \"learn\" from that instead.\n\nAlso you have to apply absolute sobriety to examining the details, so you didn't gloss over anything. Don't get fooled by what you WANT it to be. Just see what it really is.\n\nVery odd things happen once you look more clearly.\n\nSomeone inside the dreams I managed to enter last night, \"smashed\" me.\n\nWith their palm.\n\nLike they saw a fly land on a table, and swatted it out of surprise.\n\nThey didn't mean to. It was just a side effect of humans doing that type of dreaming.\n\nMaybe they were surprised to see me, and that was their \"shock\" hitting me like a wave, creating the image of having been \"smashed\".\n\nIt knocked me out of the dreaming I'd fought so hard to get into, a few times before I understood it was taking place.\n\nAnd it's impossible to describe correctly.\n\nStella showed me how to \"gaze away\" so that it had no effect, and I could continue to go in further. You can't get \"smashed\" if you aren't looking that direction.\n\nShe basically asked, \"Why do you pay attention to that? Isn't that just as bad as who's doing it to you?\"\n\nAlien \"stellar\" energy is very useful!\n\nBut not for the reason I assumed.\n\nIt's \"self pity free\".\n\nAnd in the end, isn't the biggest obstacle to convincing new people to really learn, and not just hang out, is self-pity?\n\nThey get up the nerve to try, then they're sitting in the dark with nothing happening and self-pity kicks in.\n\nAnd soon they don't try that anymore.\n\nBut don't expect to conquer that!\n\nEven when the entire room is like an amazing cartoon, surrounding  you and offering spirits and portals to other realms, the next night when it's time to practice the self pity will make it just as hard as it always was to get up and get to work.\n\nYou aren't doing anything wrong when that happens.\n\nIn fact, it's a valuable learning lesson.\n\nAnd when you meet a smiling con artist Guru,  wearing diapers or a saffron robe doesn't matter, who never has any problem with confidence,  you know he's just a lying sack of ...\n\nSmelly corpse flowers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Dreaming Lessons From A Star", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming From Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"v74i1s9oej5a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v74i1s9oej5a1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cdb5462f9e6446489731acebb7a4f879f0690a3"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v74i1s9oej5a1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d78dd1b022c0b7cae10774c94db7d5b7df51e7a"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v74i1s9oej5a1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e466087baed030719872433c287d4e8434b0a704"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v74i1s9oej5a1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31eb25e68a4d85fc7a9ef03fb687e68981bacdcb"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v74i1s9oej5a1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ddd4c09a1e28ba1eb2da0c9d03cc81783567c56"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v74i1s9oej5a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=586d7afe32769d92f7c7349992f9968842e7b9ac"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v74i1s9oej5a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd4b929431acdd815c5b8b296d95ab13b5066276"}, "id": "v74i1s9oej5a1"}}, "name": "t3_zk4jbr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming From Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/RkpKM7AS1cThgsntkyYy-v7h0v28IvIZRUzMDgBWITI.jpg", "edited": 1670881402.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670864270.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v74i1s9oej5a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cd4b929431acdd815c5b8b296d95ab13b5066276\"&gt;Picture upgrade is for Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post has been all over the place.

Not wanting to step on any, and being curious about what their world is like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some famous martial artists liked to talk to ants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yabu Kentsu was it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some &amp;quot;alien energy&amp;quot; completely free from self-pity, is just the kind of thing sorcerers crave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self-pity is a force coming only from the back side of the path our assemblage point can take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming technique she showed me was fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has layers and layers to it. I got lost looping in the layers, and she had to pull me out and remind me to focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I suspect is the same for women doing &amp;quot;womb dreaming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll forget it all soon unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, you reach the assemblage point position just shy of silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that as you gaze into the darkness, you see quick little dream scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not visual. Not &amp;quot;dream bubbles&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;fall&amp;quot; into them, the way you can fall asleep practicing silence, have your head fall forward, be startled, and it comes back up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so common, Carlos created &amp;quot;Silence Sticks&amp;quot;. And the coffee table trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your head &amp;quot;bobs back up&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;re shocked into realizing you were just in a dream scene, but are now back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stella pointed out, &amp;quot;Now why did you ignore that, in favor of dream bubbles floating in the air???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You got entry! Isn&amp;#39;t that what humans crave?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stella then taught me that &amp;quot;forgetting your purpose&amp;quot; when you get in, and then being angry about it when you come out, is not the issue at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s laziness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That you can&amp;#39;t get those mini-dream entries on demand, or control them when you do, or that it interrupts your darkness gazing with your eyes open, is not the issue at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, the problem is that we don&amp;#39;t look at what we&amp;#39;re doing honestly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She suggested I give up the obsession of doing it with my eyes open, and go ahead and close them. Lay on my side in a &amp;quot;twin position&amp;quot;, so that once I get in, I can lay down inside the dream and go to sleep there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But keep the strong sense of purpose that prevents falling asleep while laying on my side with my eyes closed, doing this technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Observe! Don&amp;#39;t be mentally lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers learn to do that. Over time, they learn that you can &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you might start out seriously learning sorcery as a weak old man, but using the power of patience and daily observation you can make yourself as strong as don Juan was said to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By careful alteration of your behavior, and the addition of new things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you just go to the gym each weekend and lift the max weights you can on the machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you&amp;#39;ll look like Jack LaLanne, at 85. Who Carlos admired enough to make him the topic of a lecture, twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you apply that to everything in your life, so that you daily &amp;quot;improve&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of decline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same can be done, to learn to go into dreaming the way women can using their womb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Directly from awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From here it gets strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You reach the point of periodic tiny dream visions, and then notice what exactly prevented you from stepping off into full on lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You forgot your purpose once you were in?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then, you have to analyze why you failed to bring some tonal rationality into there. Maybe all it will take is to move some of the blanket on the bed, to cover the back of your neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you forgot, because you were distracted by the real world. It&amp;#39;s was too cold perhaps!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; is show business. Some is mundane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And never forget that &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; can help you out, if you seem to be working hard to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the technique doesn&amp;#39;t really do the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only &amp;quot;summons&amp;quot; help from the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to be deadly serious in your attempts to &amp;quot;learn it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you got in, but there was a dream already going on with others who practice sorcery? A common thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to pay attention to which direction they&amp;#39;re looking. What they&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not how they receive you. That&amp;#39;s self-pity. Don&amp;#39;t go into a dream, based on self-pity and attention seeking!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dream beings aren&amp;#39;t going to throw a party for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of what Stella taught me gets too abstract to describe, and mostly impossible to remember at this level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the key is, you stop wishing and pretending you&amp;#39;ll get around to it someday, and instead you observe every detail closely, and modify it as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You build a container for intent to store the knowledge of how to go directly into full on lucid dreaming, from being fully awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The particulars might not even be important. Maybe you&amp;#39;re merely trying to convince intent and the spirit to be on your side in this one. And once they are, you &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; from that instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also you have to apply absolute sobriety to examining the details, so you didn&amp;#39;t gloss over anything. Don&amp;#39;t get fooled by what you WANT it to be. Just see what it really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very odd things happen once you look more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone inside the dreams I managed to enter last night, &amp;quot;smashed&amp;quot; me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With their palm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like they saw a fly land on a table, and swatted it out of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t mean to. It was just a side effect of humans doing that type of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe they were surprised to see me, and that was their &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot; hitting me like a wave, creating the image of having been &amp;quot;smashed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It knocked me out of the dreaming I&amp;#39;d fought so hard to get into, a few times before I understood it was taking place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s impossible to describe correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stella showed me how to &amp;quot;gaze away&amp;quot; so that it had no effect, and I could continue to go in further. You can&amp;#39;t get &amp;quot;smashed&amp;quot; if you aren&amp;#39;t looking that direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She basically asked, &amp;quot;Why do you pay attention to that? Isn&amp;#39;t that just as bad as who&amp;#39;s doing it to you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alien &amp;quot;stellar&amp;quot; energy is very useful!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not for the reason I assumed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;self pity free&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the end, isn&amp;#39;t the biggest obstacle to convincing new people to really learn, and not just hang out, is self-pity?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They get up the nerve to try, then they&amp;#39;re sitting in the dark with nothing happening and self-pity kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And soon they don&amp;#39;t try that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t expect to conquer that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even when the entire room is like an amazing cartoon, surrounding  you and offering spirits and portals to other realms, the next night when it&amp;#39;s time to practice the self pity will make it just as hard as it always was to get up and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t doing anything wrong when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s a valuable learning lesson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you meet a smiling con artist Guru,  wearing diapers or a saffron robe doesn&amp;#39;t matter, who never has any problem with confidence,  you know he&amp;#39;s just a lying sack of ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smelly corpse flowers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "zk4jbr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 25, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zk4jbr/dreaming_lessons_from_a_star/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/zk4jbr/dreaming_lessons_from_a_star/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1670864270.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j01xb7h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1670941092.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j00ykqj", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I've been nagging Fancy go to waterboard you.\n\nI even showed her the tunnel in the closet last night, telling her \"Go girl...  go get her!!!\"\n\nBut she's been acting oddly again.\n\nMaybe because I've treated her like a pet dog one time too many?\n\nStella seems to diminish her, or maybe Stella combined with Fancy.\n\nWe don't really understand \"sun entities\".\n\nMaybe IOBs can \"combine\" in some weird way.\n\nTo make it easier for themselves here.

This is what I do, every single night and most mornings too. (I do bi-phasic sleeping). Entering mini-dreams while awake by holding awareness and then using them as a springboard back to the energy body either via twin positions or simply intending it.  I use a mask in the mornings. \n\n\\-Where you wrote: \n\n\"She suggested I give up the obsession of doing it with my eyes open, and go ahead and close them. Lay on my side in a \"twin position\", so that once I get in, I can lay down inside the dream and go to sleep there.\"\n\nMy  clarification was that **Twin Positions does not need to be on one's side.**   That's all I was pointing out, and offering a different position.  I know this because I had just completed twin positions this morning on my back, a few hours before reading your posts.  The position I offered is from the books. \n\n\\-As far as bad player user name, that was simply the name I chose over a year ago when I didn't know who you guys' were, wanted to stalk the sub, and intentionally chose a generic name, the way a proper sorcerer should.  I didn't want to wade into a realm of fake guru types without knowing what I was getting into.  Obviously, I've come to see the intent is pure here to do right by Carlos, which is all that matters to me, but I've since picked up some karma and followers and didn't feel keen on choosing another name.  If it makes your feel any better, I can create a new account.  I really didn't think anyone gave a shit about 'usernames', considering my account is over a year old with plenty of comments and posts that reveal I'm not a bad player. \n\n\\-I don't pretend about anything.  What I write here, if I write anything, is what I've experienced for real, most nights and mornings.\n\n\\-The only reason I jumped in to this particular post is because I do know a lot about waking lucid dreaming as a companion to darkroom, and had a few tips. I do this every night. That doesn't make me a teacher, just a student sharing ideas with others.  A teacher is someone who feels the need to post long missives every single day to keep 'feeding' his or her students, like a preacher.  I post a trick or tip maybe 2 times *a year.*  Big difference. \n\n\\-Correction: I'm not a sleeping dreamer.  I received a message about this.  Lucid dreams serve one function: to reach the energy body.  I'm in my lucid dreams 10 seconds maximum, before I lay down and do twin positions or simply intend to be back in my bedroom, in the energy body.  I also practice darkroom for hours every night, with good progress.  Two nights ago, I believe Little Smoke came to me in moth form.   But I remain sober and impassive, as I don't care about anything but reaching and tempering the energy body.  Don Juan stated it as the primary 'concrete' goal of sorcery at one point, and that stuck with me.  So everything I do is designed to reach the energy body, learn how to move in it, learn how to stay in it, and hopefully eventually learn how to actually affect the real world with it.  So I don't stick around too long playing with purple puffs, or engaging with IOBs, and certainly don't masturbate in lucid dreams - all of these things serve one purpose: to reach the energy body.  \n\n\\-Okay, you got me on the 'loosening up' comment being a little snide.  That's on me.  I was a bit taken back to see you post a technique that ties waking lucid dreaming to darkroom, since posting the same type of technique got me temporarily banned when I first came here. The irony that a year later the technique is now 'approved by mods' was a little too much.  I rescind the comment, and hope people take advantage of what you just offered in your newest post, because the path of waking lucid dreaming at the end of darkroom can be extremely effective, albeit extremely difficult to master.

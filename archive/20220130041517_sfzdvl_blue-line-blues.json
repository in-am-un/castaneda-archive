Something's wrong.  You already saw all that!  Maybe the Pope is right, and magic is a big sin.\n\nHere's the cure.  And it's just what you said.\n\nUnless you got shot in the chest or something, and that's causing the shift.\n\nStick to silence!\n\nDon't look at the magic all around you and think, \"I must be perfectly silent now\".\n\nYou aren't.\n\nThe world STOPS when you are silent.\n\nIf it didn't, you aren't.\n\nSo focus on the fact that although you can be silent for 2 minutes at a time, perfectly silent, once in a while you start to gripe about something in your head.\n\nJust a word or two.\n\nThose count even more in the orange zone!\n\nBut why?\n\nI guess we need to get back to Juann's analysis, that to keep moving on the J curve helps push you back to the center.\n\nEven out there in the orange zone.\n\nThe cure for fussiness, is more assemblage point movement along the center of the J curve.\n\nBecause a horizontal movement is caused by focusing on something at the current J curve level, even if it's only a latent thought in your nearly empty internal dialogue.\n\nThose latent thoughts, at that deep orange zone region, produce real \"things\" in the air.\n\nVisible things.\n\nBut they're too weird to notice as being an object.\n\nThose idle words still in your internal dialogue, even if only once per 10 minutes, will pull you sideways. Due to manifesting as a \"thing\".\n\nSo you have to go back to basics.  Even 2 minutes isn't good enough, if it starts to be unpleasant.  If you start to shift horizontally at that level.\n\nIf you return to increasing the duration of your silence, you'll move past the horizontal shifts.\n\nThe goal according to the witches, is 2 hours of silence. The FULL 2 hours, without a single word.\n\n2 minutes gets you a little magic, but you need the 2 hours if you want to see the super advanced stuff.\n\nSuch as, any thing you can remember, manifests in the air in front of you, as if it were on a monitor.\n\nIf it's a past event, you can then enter it as a re-run.\n\nOr, your double can.\n\nAbout the 2 hours...\n\nTaisha said you need to be silent from 2 minutes, to 2 hours.\n\nCarlos didn't want to answer that question, so he used his eyebrows to signal Taisha she had to do it.\n\nBut why?\n\nWomen are best for introducing a new topic of power.\n\nHe did it all the time.\n\nI wish I had her exact words, because I believe we've misunderstood.\n\nShe wasn't giving the range to loosen the assemblage point, so it can move down the J curve.\n\nTaisha \"wasn't raised that way\" by Zuleica.\n\nShe was more \"immersed\".\n\nSo we're subject to completely misunderstanding.\n\nShe said, 2 minutes to 2 hours, and that you can accumulate silence second by second.\n\nLet me offer your an alternate interpretation to that, from the point of view of someone who's \"immersed\".\n\nIt's 2 minutes to get the assemblage point to move down to the green line.\n\nIt's 2 hours to get it to move over to the orange zone.\n\nAlong the way, you don't move back to the blue line instantly, because you messed up and your internal dialogue came back for a bit.\n\nThe 2 minute \"spurts\" accumulate.\n\nSo you can in fact get over to the 2 hour part of the J curve, in 2 minute movements.\n\nThey accumulate.", "edited": 1643565049.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_huvgcvp", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did you have for breakfast?

And it&amp;#39;s just what you said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you got shot in the chest or something, and that&amp;#39;s causing the shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stick to silence!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t look at the magic all around you and think, &amp;quot;I must be perfectly silent now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world STOPS when you are silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it didn&amp;#39;t, you aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So focus on the fact that although you can be silent for 2 minutes at a time, perfectly silent, once in a while you start to gripe about something in your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a word or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those count even more in the orange zone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess we need to get back to Juann&amp;#39;s analysis, that to keep moving on the J curve helps push you back to the center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even out there in the orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cure for fussiness, is more assemblage point movement along the center of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because a horizontal movement is caused by focusing on something at the current J curve level, even if it&amp;#39;s only a latent thought in your nearly empty internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those latent thoughts, at that deep orange zone region, produce real &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visible things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re too weird to notice as being an object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those idle words still in your internal dialogue, even if only once per 10 minutes, will pull you sideways. Due to manifesting as a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to go back to basics.  Even 2 minutes isn&amp;#39;t good enough, if it starts to be unpleasant.  If you start to shift horizontally at that level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you return to increasing the duration of your silence, you&amp;#39;ll move past the horizontal shifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal according to the witches, is 2 hours of silence. The FULL 2 hours, without a single word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 minutes gets you a little magic, but you need the 2 hours if you want to see the super advanced stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, any thing you can remember, manifests in the air in front of you, as if it were on a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s a past event, you can then enter it as a re-run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, your double can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the 2 hours...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha said you need to be silent from 2 minutes, to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos didn&amp;#39;t want to answer that question, so he used his eyebrows to signal Taisha she had to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are best for introducing a new topic of power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I had her exact words, because I believe we&amp;#39;ve misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t giving the range to loosen the assemblage point, so it can move down the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha &amp;quot;wasn&amp;#39;t raised that way&amp;quot; by Zuleica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was more &amp;quot;immersed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;re subject to completely misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, 2 minutes to 2 hours, and that you can accumulate silence second by second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me offer your an alternate interpretation to that, from the point of view of someone who&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;immersed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2 minutes to get the assemblage point to move down to the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2 hours to get it to move over to the orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along the way, you don&amp;#39;t move back to the blue line instantly, because you messed up and your internal dialogue came back for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 2 minute &amp;quot;spurts&amp;quot; accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can in fact get over to the 2 hour part of the J curve, in 2 minute movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sfzdvl/blue_line_blues/huvgcvp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1643562628.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_sfzdvl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "huumge6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tyfiniti", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1643549788.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_huuk00h", "score": -3, "author_fullname": "t2_57cpex8m", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Wow you sound really angry.

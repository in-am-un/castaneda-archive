I would simply do this until my thoughts would subside. I practiced several hours a day for three years straight. Often, as an alternative, I would simply practice void meditation.\n\nDuring this time, I began seeing Carlos, the warrior women, Don Juan, the canine, Silvio Manuel, etc. My dreaming awareness turned up a notch. Once, I found myself sitting in a cave with the others while Silvio Manuel performed mind-blowing wonders. I also saw the current nagual, who is alive and well today.\n\nI had a number of visions of this being during my meditation retreat, and when I met him in person, I underwent a profound agitation and energetic shift.

I will try all of what you suggested.\n\n\nI meant i always try the last thing that got to some silence but it usually works only once or twice. Third time i cannot even keep it going like not enough attention for that specific idea to be sustained.\n\n\nI guess you would say that I do not progress because i do not do tensegrity. I just read in the old posts that unless you see wierdness you just stay and wait without moving and i believe it is valid for me as tensegrity kind of makes me talk to myself even more. But eventually i will try it more, of course, i would try anything.\n\n\nHere are 10 example ways that helped me get silent at least once to get an idea what i'm doing :) that already does not work anymore for me:\n\n\n1. focus only on not talking to myself ... rest of the attention going through the eyes or inward, back and forth\n\n\n2. focus only on central vision as even when it is dark i think everybody is seeing something like shadows or clouds or whatever that constantly keep changing, like when you push against your eyes these become more intense but they are there even when you do not push\n\n\n3. like 2 but spread visual attention on the whole \"screen\" like 180 degrees instead on a central small point... this time i got the feeling like i was not seeing but more like feeling deep with the eyes as if they penetrate into the darkness\n \n\n4. combine 1 and 2(or 3), making 1 with bigger priority; so that focus on not talking mainly but still try to push the rest of the remaining attention to what the eyes perceive, otherwise i tend to dig in / going inward \n\n\n5. combine 1 and 2(or 3), making 2 with bigger priority\n\n\n6. focus on not talking + on the feeling of being ruthless, get rid of all the self-pity you can find within yourself \n\n\n7. focus on not talking + keep the idea if being humble, like zero self-importance. just keeping the idea of it in my head and i noticed i slowly began to shift toward humbleness without even trying to force it if i can keep some silence for some more and the humbleness feeling kind if helps not talking too on its own\n\n\n8. focus on not talking + pressing fingers one against the next one (both hands fingers intertwined) like trying to make some intense physical feeling to remind me of not talking to myself, like a physical reminder to keep the focus on not talking as i \"forget\" to keep it\n\n\n9. reading a chapter in the books and then next time in darkroom the ideas of it kind of help me not talking to myself, it kind of increases the intent of not talking i guess\n\n\n10. Heard the idea that stopping the internal dialog is like stopping the time and it made perfect sense to me. Then the same night in the darkroom this idea stuck into my head and i even kind of forced the time to stop for me. This was interesting as it stopped the words and the images too so that i was just sitting there in the no time space, in nothingness with the feeling that the time  stopped\n\n\nAnd as you see most of these ideas are not mine, usually they come from the books and they either play with attention or feelings or it is an idea that produces some jolt i guess.\n\n\nAnd when i succeed in being silent for some more it produces a shift, i still do not see anything in the darkness and i might even think it was not even a shift and when i go outside the other day and see everything in a different way i just keep looking at things and they are so interesting. Once I have been in the mountains just looking at trees and clouds for hours. Sometimes i feel like i became kind of stronger from inside and i can easily do some things. Sometimes if i stay at home i think there is no shift at all but when i go outside i see the things are different then usual and i know i got shifted from last darkroom.\n\n\nBut for me it is like the silence kind of not evolves yet i just keep getting some new ideas of how to shut up but most of the time i'm missing the next idea and trying the old ones which works one or two times only and now i'm so used to the darkness i can talk to myself without any problem while the first 5-6 weeks it was too unusual for me to sit in the darkness for so long and it was of an additional help.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j8r476f", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you!

But eventually i will try it more, of course, i would try anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 example ways that helped me get silent at least once to get an idea what i&amp;#39;m doing :) that already does not work anymore for me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;focus only on not talking to myself ... rest of the attention going through the eyes or inward, back and forth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;focus only on central vision as even when it is dark i think everybody is seeing something like shadows or clouds or whatever that constantly keep changing, like when you push against your eyes these become more intense but they are there even when you do not push&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;like 2 but spread visual attention on the whole &amp;quot;screen&amp;quot; like 180 degrees instead on a central small point... this time i got the feeling like i was not seeing but more like feeling deep with the eyes as if they penetrate into the darkness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;combine 1 and 2(or 3), making 1 with bigger priority; so that focus on not talking mainly but still try to push the rest of the remaining attention to what the eyes perceive, otherwise i tend to dig in / going inward &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;combine 1 and 2(or 3), making 2 with bigger priority&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;focus on not talking + on the feeling of being ruthless, get rid of all the self-pity you can find within yourself &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;focus on not talking + keep the idea if being humble, like zero self-importance. just keeping the idea of it in my head and i noticed i slowly began to shift toward humbleness without even trying to force it if i can keep some silence for some more and the humbleness feeling kind if helps not talking too on its own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;focus on not talking + pressing fingers one against the next one (both hands fingers intertwined) like trying to make some intense physical feeling to remind me of not talking to myself, like a physical reminder to keep the focus on not talking as i &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; to keep it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;reading a chapter in the books and then next time in darkroom the ideas of it kind of help me not talking to myself, it kind of increases the intent of not talking i guess&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heard the idea that stopping the internal dialog is like stopping the time and it made perfect sense to me. Then the same night in the darkroom this idea stuck into my head and i even kind of forced the time to stop for me. This was interesting as it stopped the words and the images too so that i was just sitting there in the no time space, in nothingness with the feeling that the time  stopped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as you see most of these ideas are not mine, usually they come from the books and they either play with attention or feelings or it is an idea that produces some jolt i guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when i succeed in being silent for some more it produces a shift, i still do not see anything in the darkness and i might even think it was not even a shift and when i go outside the other day and see everything in a different way i just keep looking at things and they are so interesting. Once I have been in the mountains just looking at trees and clouds for hours. Sometimes i feel like i became kind of stronger from inside and i can easily do some things. Sometimes if i stay at home i think there is no shift at all but when i go outside i see the things are different then usual and i know i got shifted from last darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for me it is like the silence kind of not evolves yet i just keep getting some new ideas of how to shut up but most of the time i&amp;#39;m missing the next idea and trying the old ones which works one or two times only and now i&amp;#39;m so used to the darkness i can talk to myself without any problem while the first 5-6 weeks it was too unusual for me to sit in the darkness for so long and it was of an additional help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_112wgv2", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/112wgv2/seeing_hands_in_darkroom/j8r476f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1676542982.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1676542982.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j8p53r9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j8p16ve", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;To make it clear I still do not see anything in the darkness while I have been doing it for 3+ months now, \\~2h almost every day.)\n\nThat's unacceptable.

So in my experience it&amp;#39;s not only men that  operate on their rationality, I have worked with women also that have to get introduced to their own bodies and feelings because they are operating only on a poor rational state.&lt;br/&gt;\nTherefore I don&amp;#39;t believe on womens superiority on that regard, I believe you and any man can start paying attention to their emotional and bodily insides ( they are connected) and start to using them very efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut ok the way of thinking of men is different from womens and the mental masturbation analysis may be more severe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/112wgv2/seeing_hands_in_darkroom/j8w56gi/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1676632651.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_112wgv2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j8uih7e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "superr", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1676595990.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j8tvk4i", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3vses", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;I cant sit and do gazing just anywhere, I must find the best spot where am at to relax and do it.

Here the brightness of the bedroom is greatly exaggerated to depict the details of the \"overlay\" effect of the \"sights\" a little better. Colored clouds and a vague patterning effects in the background may also become visible at this point. You can notice that a vague puff will start to form in the main field of view, but only if your silence is getting better. This is around the start of the green zone where you can start stuffing the puffs but you might be able to perceive dim puffs right in the beginning; stuff 'em if you can.\n\nFurther down the green zone approaching the red, you may see, hear and feel all kinds of stuff. Things are also becoming progressively weirder. For me, I see blue stars on the walls and ceiling, shimmering \"laser\" things shooting from the sides into my eyeballs, puffs of various sizes/colors (mostly blue and purple), random dark spots, a dense \"fog\"-like cloud enveloping you, patterns resembles the cosmic web of galaxies which seem to be shimmering over everything (also look kinda like flailing translucent tentacle things), etc etc. Scenes will also start to appear within the puffs! Visitors will show up as faces beginning to take shape inside the puffs before becoming stable static images of a face or character.

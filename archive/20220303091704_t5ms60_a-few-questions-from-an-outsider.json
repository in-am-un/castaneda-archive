In fact I named her \"mystery\".\n\nA witch dumped her in my room as a practical joke, but I liked her.  She hid under the bed for the longest time. I'd look down there, and see a little ski lift had been created, and she was riding on the lift with her \"friends\".\n\nWhich turned out to all be just her.  Spirits have no \"real\" appearance here, in their projected form.  They're basically shapeshifters, who can even look like an entire mountain if the situation calls for it.\n\nBasically, before agriculture we lived in our natural Chimpanzee state.  Hunting and gathering our food, with very loose associations with other humans.  But all of the humans could manage to find food, and no one really sunk to the bottom of anything.\n\nI supposed you could say, everyone was homeless.  So there was no bottom to fall down to.\n\nWhile gathering and hunting, they ran into spirits.\n\nThe spirits taught them magic.\n\nThere wasn't any money, so no one ran around selling their \"system\".\n\nAnd the systems were ULTRA COOL!!!\n\nWe seem to have only the Olmec system left from back then, but all magic has echoes of the pre-agricultural magical systems.  Africa had the kind that spread into the middle east and ultimately into China.\n\nMy spirit \"Mystery\" called it \"Tribal magic\" and implied there were many such systems.\n\nBut when agriculture was created, hunting and gathering went out of style.  Money was invented, and people were crowded into cities, staring at 4 walls all day.\n\nThe old magic was still around, but the real thing is VERY HARD. So they made it \"easier\" and sold it to city dwellers for the new creation, \"money\".\n\nThat gave rise to religion as evil men learned it, and sought to exploit it even more.\n\nSo for example, the ancient jews had it, saw a spirit who tried to scare them by appearing as their classical \"demon\" image, they called him Lucifer, and made a campfire story about him and Job.\n\nBut it was just a story.\n\nLucifer could have been convinced to be a kitten, if the Jews weren't so inept. Or maybe they knew that.  It was after all, just a scary campfire story.\n\nBut it got written down. Over the years it became so complicated, even Jesus got confused and believed he was in a battle with a kitten.  Or a \"could have been\" a kitten.\n\nMost \"Magick\" is derived from the book of Enoch, and thus all pretend.\n\nThat's where we are now.  Just echoes of the real thing left buried under mountains of profiteering.\n\nOur magic is still intact, because it passed into Mexico and circumstances were good for it being preserved.\n\nSmall groups kept it, usually around 15.\n\nHow a \"spirit\" teaches magic can be as varied as you can imagine.\n\nAs Lily told me, another spirit, there's no \"ultimate truth\" for humans.\n\nWe aren't smart enough to perceive that.\n\nSo any old shit is just as good as any other explanation, which is why she's been using gremlins and gnomes to explain \"the abstract\" to me lately.\n\nThe \"abstract\" is our true goal.\n\nYou can experience it, view it, even enjoy it while it's happening.\n\nBut you can't describe, think about, write about, or even remember it.\n\nIt's a very odd thing.\n\nNot only can it NOT be taught, but you can't even suggest what it could be, to get anyone interested.\n\nKeep in mind, we don't \"believe\" anything.\n\nSomeone tells us something we can experience, the techniques to get there, and then we really do get to experience that, daily.\n\nNot once in a while, and taken from a bad dream we had.\n\nIt becomes part of our lives for real.\n\nI fully expect to go home tonight, watch Walker, Texas Ranger, and then wait for my spirit Lily, to teach me more about how physical matter is created by Gnomes.\n\nWith a visual presentation floating in space, like one of those very old Walt Disney instructional movies on math.\n\nSometimes the lessons transport me back in time, and I find myself standing in a south american jungle, watching people doing weird things.\n\nAnything in human history can be \"replayed\".", "edited": 1646342529.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hz8dtmq", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a history lesson based part on what our teacher&amp;#39;s teacher said, and half on what one of my mysterious spirits said.

They&amp;#39;re basically shapeshifters, who can even look like an entire mountain if the situation calls for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, before agriculture we lived in our natural Chimpanzee state.  Hunting and gathering our food, with very loose associations with other humans.  But all of the humans could manage to find food, and no one really sunk to the bottom of anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed you could say, everyone was homeless.  So there was no bottom to fall down to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While gathering and hunting, they ran into spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The spirits taught them magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;#39;t any money, so no one ran around selling their &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the systems were ULTRA COOL!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We seem to have only the Olmec system left from back then, but all magic has echoes of the pre-agricultural magical systems.  Africa had the kind that spread into the middle east and ultimately into China.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My spirit &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot; called it &amp;quot;Tribal magic&amp;quot; and implied there were many such systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when agriculture was created, hunting and gathering went out of style.  Money was invented, and people were crowded into cities, staring at 4 walls all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old magic was still around, but the real thing is VERY HARD. So they made it &amp;quot;easier&amp;quot; and sold it to city dwellers for the new creation, &amp;quot;money&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gave rise to religion as evil men learned it, and sought to exploit it even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for example, the ancient jews had it, saw a spirit who tried to scare them by appearing as their classical &amp;quot;demon&amp;quot; image, they called him Lucifer, and made a campfire story about him and Job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was just a story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucifer could have been convinced to be a kitten, if the Jews weren&amp;#39;t so inept. Or maybe they knew that.  It was after all, just a scary campfire story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it got written down. Over the years it became so complicated, even Jesus got confused and believed he was in a battle with a kitten.  Or a &amp;quot;could have been&amp;quot; a kitten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most &amp;quot;Magick&amp;quot; is derived from the book of Enoch, and thus all pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where we are now.  Just echoes of the real thing left buried under mountains of profiteering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our magic is still intact, because it passed into Mexico and circumstances were good for it being preserved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Small groups kept it, usually around 15.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How a &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot; teaches magic can be as varied as you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Lily told me, another spirit, there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;ultimate truth&amp;quot; for humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t smart enough to perceive that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So any old shit is just as good as any other explanation, which is why she&amp;#39;s been using gremlins and gnomes to explain &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot; to me lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot; is our true goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can experience it, view it, even enjoy it while it&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t describe, think about, write about, or even remember it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very odd thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only can it NOT be taught, but you can&amp;#39;t even suggest what it could be, to get anyone interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, we don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;believe&amp;quot; anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone tells us something we can experience, the techniques to get there, and then we really do get to experience that, daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not once in a while, and taken from a bad dream we had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It becomes part of our lives for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fully expect to go home tonight, watch Walker, Texas Ranger, and then wait for my spirit Lily, to teach me more about how physical matter is created by Gnomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a visual presentation floating in space, like one of those very old Walt Disney instructional movies on math.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the lessons transport me back in time, and I find myself standing in a south american jungle, watching people doing weird things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything in human history can be &amp;quot;replayed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_t5ms60", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/t5ms60/a_few_questions_from_an_outsider/hz8dtmq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1646341451.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1646341451.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hz8423z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Sazbadashie", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1646337610.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hz77zso", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_5fbw8v25", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I 100% understand what you're saying Like I myself i've learned and grounded myself in my practices without the help of published books with just the spirits teaching and guiding me in those fields and when I pick up and read books on whatever topic to kinda get a gauge to make sure I havent just made something up.

It's the intent embedded in each of the practices that makes them work.\n\nThe intent of the practices has a very strong pull because they've been used successfully for their intended purposes for ages, like 10,000+ years, by humans gathering power specifically to break the confines of normal cognition and normal perception, so when we do a given practice the intent involved in the practice itself is something we can hook on to through our own link to intent.\n\nIntent is outside and inside us, and this sorcery, at it's root, is about cleaning our link with intent; to master intent is to make it's commands your commands, so your intent and universal intent, or the spirit, are in complete agreement.\n\nRecapitulation has at least two Intent's. Recap has the intent of giving our memories to the unknowable source of all existence and awareness called the dark sea of awareness, or The Eagle, because that's the reason it fashions beings in the first place, as probes of itself, within itself, so that upon any beings' death it can harvest those memories and know itself. In addition, recapitulation also has the intent of undoing emotional energy exchanges that are useless. I'll give you an example, let's say I'm angry at my child, frustrated really, because they are underperforming academically and I want to help them do better, so I obsess about their outcome and push them to do better, closer to where I think they should be and then my child says \"fuck you\" in their mind and blows me off as I browbeat, lecture and emotionally badger them. In attempting to help them because of my attachment to their outcome I have given my child my frustration and they can do nothing useful with it. I have received their \"fuck you\" and I can't do anything useful with that. Recapitulation is a breathing exercise where I return their energy and get mine back from those emotional entanglements through reliving those memories while performing the fanning or sweeping breath. When people really look at their lives most would have to agree that the vast majority of their energy or power is tied up in garbage like that, and to do physics breaking sorcery in full conscious awareness one has to free up and redeploy that energy through recap and the other practices. I've done enough recap I can tell you that in my own experience it works exactly as described, at least the part about recovering and returning energy.\n\nDark room practice, darkroom, DRG, or DR is a name that's perhaps a bit more catchy than awake dreaming, or waking dreaming, but that's all it is. In dark room, we are intentionally depriving the vision of normative stimulus and having as much inner-silence as possible so as to hook onto elements of our attention we habitually ignore and disregard due to socialization pressures. Commonly this ignored sensory data is termed the second attention. This practice is intended to give flexibility to our perception and cognition in such a form that these typically ignored signals cannot be just hand waved away as a dream, flight of imagination or hallucination. That's why it is practiced sober and with eyes open, unlike meditation. In addition, it is intended as a practical method to build your double. It's also intended as a great self-test for inner silence, because the effects of total darkness and inner-silence are generally predictable. Another intent of darkroom practice is to enable us to be in cognitive and perceptual states where we can learn more sorcery, by shifting the assemblage point to where one is capable of direct knowledge, or silent knowledge. In fact, the whole point of waking dreaming is to learn to shift the assemblage point at will and keep it at a new location as long as desired, but to be silent enough inside to do that you really have to work all the practices a bit everyday. In reading about darkroom you'll see many references to the j-curve, and you should look at the j-curve maps in the wiki, but that is the path we want our assemblage points to move during darkroom. The endpoint of the standard j-curve is the position all sorcery apprentices were involuntarily put into within this lineage until it transformed with Carlos, called\" heightened awareness\". In the recent past an apprentice was thrown at a sorcerer by intent in one way or another, but regardless of how the sorcerer found an apprentice they would immediately put the apprentice into heightened awareness to be taught, because it is an ideal state for learning sorcery. Unfortunately, heightened awareness is so removed from normal cognition that those experiences are forgotten as soon as you return to normal awareness. So then, after the training, the apprentice is left to reassemble all that learning using recapitulation and the other practices to move their assemblage point (AP) back to heightened awareness to recover their knowledge. One of the intents of darkroom is to enable us to move the AP to heightened awareness  (HA) on our own without another sorcerer involved. Another really important intent of darkroom is to put humans in contact with inorganic beings, who can teach them more sorcery, because there are no other sources for that learning now, aside from the books and Cleargreen.\n\nAnyway that's the hyper-condensed explanation leaving out a lot, but focused on what you mentioned.

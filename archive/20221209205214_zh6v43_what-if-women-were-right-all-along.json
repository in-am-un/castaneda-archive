Despite their monk robes and weird hats.\n\nThere's google now!\n\nAnd the chest pounding con artists usually have no respect for women.\n\nI guess lately they've seen the \"profit potential\" in expansion.\n\nBut when you see a female monk standing next to group of lame white guy \"gurus\" who gave up Harvard to \"find enlightenment\", all garbed up to get as much attention as possible, it still gives the same impression.\n\n  \nThat women don't even know as much as the male con artists they hang out with.\n\nI've had to rethink that.\n\nIn the lineages, the female sorcerer apprentices are gathered first.\n\nElias discovered 5-8 of them already waiting for him when Rosendo finally found him.\n\nHow many is in the books somewhere.  \n\nBut at the least, he literally married 5.\n\nHe had a \"support group\" already put together by the previous lineage.\n\nBut why?\n\nWell for starters, women can do what Carlos used Carol Tiggs for.\n\nI'm not sure how much she even knew what would happen.\n\nHe was dying.  And wanted badly to finally \"convince someone\".\n\nAs he told me just a month or two before he was gone, \"I'm dying, and no one believes me.\"\n\nThat's part of why I'm here.  To fix that situation.\n\nSo he announced that he was going to show real magic.\n\nThrough gossiping women.   He often \"announced\" his next move, using women in private classes.\n\nThey'd go from person to person, cup their hand to your ear, and \"tell you a secret\" in a quiet voice.\n\nSet up by Carlos, even if the women didn't realize that.\n\nCarlos always seemed to use women to introduce something new that required power.\n\nWe got the J curve that way, and \"The Whorl\" for \"Reading off the Wall\".\n\nAnd when he used Carol Tiggs, it looked to me like she wasn't really sure it was a good idea.\n\nBut he just \"pushed her in front of us\", and trusted intent. Said she was going to show us some magic.\n\nHe didn't say so, but I've come to realize it was through the \"block of energy\" women can lend others, especially men.\n\nWithout even knowing it.\n\nI get to see that over, and over, and over, and over...\n\nWell, it's nearly tiring how often Cholita gives me \"the block\".\n\nIf I dodge well and it doesn't land on my head, then I get a big treat.\n\nMagic supreme.    Just because she willed it.\n\nSo whether women are fully aware of it or not, they can simply \"gift someone\" with a block of energy, which is \"good for one free magical event\".\n\nAnd Carol Tiggs succeeded.\n\nI got entry to the inorganic being's realm from her.  To a place she's discussed in lecture notes, without me even having read about it before.\n\nShe pushed me right through the floor of Dance Home, I fell 50 feet below the bottom story, and landed in a dirt tunnel.\n\nIt happened to another in workshops when she did her demo elsewhere.\n\nSo Rosendo set Elias up with a whole resource of \"blocks\" he could utilize, for learning magic.\n\nThe women don't lose anything from it.  I really don't understand how it works.\n\nThey can give energy, without losing any.\n\nMight be excess dark energy, stored in their womb.\n\nBut what they have to \"give away\" is a limited resource.  So they can't do it over and over, endlessly.\n\nThat's still not enough to prove the point of this post. \n\nSo here's another point.\n\nIn absolute silence, gazing at the raw emanations, you can see the latent awareness on them.\n\nIf you were flying above a huge city, long evacuated by some terrible apocalyptic disaster and now empty of people,  and you could gaze back into the past you might see the \"ghosts\" of cars driving on the roads.\n\nIt's a favorite movie cliche.  To see what it was like, before the zombie attack.\n\nIt's like that in the raw emanations.\n\nThat's what we call \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nYou see an old blue VW bug driving as a ghost in that abandoned city, and suddenly you're at a hippy party on a dirty couch in the mountains, smoking a huge refer with your poorly dressed friends.\n\nYou get a \"taste\" of who drove that car down the road in that ghost city.\n\nSilent Knowledge is very much like that.\n\nBut why did you see the old hippy car?\n\nWhy not a police van, on the way to \"bust some dirty hippy heads\" at the \"protest\"?\n\nWhy not an old horse drawn wagon, from when that big city was just a Mission, there to \"save the heathen Indians\".  With no more than a few small wooden buildings to sell stuff to the monks and trade cheap alcohol to the indians in exchange for their valuable gold nuggets. \n\nWhy not a Mastodon or a Saber Toothed Tiger, from before the city?\n\nAll of those are still available! Nothing is ever lost from the dark sea of awareness.\n\nSomething \"chooses\" what you perceive.\n\nMore \"latent intent\"?\n\nWomen seem to be aware of that.\n\nSo that instead of striking out on their own, with hopes of becoming the head Chimp beating his monk chest and insisting his magic is supreme, they'd rather join a group.\n\nBelong to a \"lifestyle\".\n\nThey believe their chances to learn are better in there.\n\nAnd as it turns out, that's true.\n\nOne of the bad aspects of this subreddit is, it's \"every man for himself\".\n\nI tend to see that from the male point of view:\n\n\"What are you, a big baby!  Suck it up and work your ass off!  You'll be just fine.  Who cares if you're all alone??? This is MAGIC.\"\n\nIt's not a good strategy for the women.\n\nAnd maybe not for the men either.\n\nBut not because it's a world of cry babies.\n\nInstead, it's a world of latent intent, flowing in the emanations.\n\nAnd learning in a group, helps pull everyone in the group along.\n\nThat is, anyone who's actually interested and isn't just there to beat their chest.\n\nCarlos called it, \"Energetic mass\".\n\nWhen a few stray emanations of magical intent are lit up by each person, but the accumulated bunch  of glowing emanations forms a \"beam\" shining into the unknown.\n\nFor the group to follow.\n\nThat still doesn't mean you don't need to \"Suck it up, you big cry baby!

So when sentient beings are engaged in sexual intercourse, the emanations inside their cocoons do their best to bestow awareness to the new sentient being they are creating.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that during the sexual act, the emanations encased inside the cocoon of both partners undergo a profound agitation, the culminating point of which is a merging, a fusing of two pieces of the glow of awareness, one from each partner, that separate from their cocoons.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sexual intercourse is always a bestowal of awareness even though the bestowal may not be consolidated,&amp;quot; he went on. &amp;quot;The emanations inside the cocoon of human beings don&amp;#39;t know of intercourse for fun.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.....  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[Sorcerers]  know that the only real energy we possess is a life-bestowing sexual energy. &amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Since everyone of us wanted to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, we, of course, abstained from wasting our glow of awareness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dan may not agree about this, but while Carlos did have sex, and apparently the witches too, I believe that they were doing it (sparingly) for specific purposes. Not just because they were horny. I personally never saw or engaged in any of that. After Amy&amp;#39;s book came out people came to me asking me if I had sex with Carlos. I guess they were disappointed when I told them that I didn&amp;#39;t and didn&amp;#39;t even know what they were talking about. I should be disappointed too, but for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_zh6v43", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zh6v43/what_if_women_were_right_all_along/izsat26/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670767540.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1670767540.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "izrf7f7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "isthisasobot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_izpe9nq", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_br6e04o0", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That she went to see a porno and found it weakening?

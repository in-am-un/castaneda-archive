I told you to look there first!\"\n\nHe was right, but I couldn't perceive the lost and found.\n\nStill, I got up.\n\nA mysterious woman who likes to stand at the entrance to the tunnel, and animates in full human speed, but can't perceive me, followed as I walked across the darkroom to the location of the \"Lost and Found\".\n\nSomeone asked me, if she can't see you, how can she follow you.\n\nAh...

As there was a few posts earlier on this feed.\n\nSo no access to the \"lost and found\".\n\nI'm afraid I lost most of the rest of what happened last night.

But their technique was lame, so they were lucky to see him just once.  And then book dealed it to get attention for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A nice religion if you ask me, and I like it better than the others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still not true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind, I can&amp;#39;t post about most of what I see practicing sorcery these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets really weird out there on the far reaches of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;variety&amp;quot; is way beyond what we call, &amp;quot;puffery&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even have names for some of it, because there&amp;#39;s no place to teach it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;variety&amp;quot; of weird happenings you might dig up on google, isn&amp;#39;t really surprising.  The only sad part is that we&amp;#39;re so unfamiliar with what happens when the assemblage point moves, that we try to explain it some other way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And any horizontal shift below the blue line, produces endless delusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhist &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot; is just a severe horizontal shift on the green line, which pops in some red line effects.  And a big dose of ego.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shapeshifting is extreme horizontal shifting on the red line.  You can&amp;#39;t get any more &amp;quot;bent out of shape&amp;quot; than down there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Silent Knowledge entities like God, are likely a horizontal shift in the purple region.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except out there, a horizontal shift isn&amp;#39;t automatically considered bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good analogy would be if you were trying to drive to Las Vegas from LA, which can be done in far less time if you don&amp;#39;t stop along the way.  But it&amp;#39;s still most of the day to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a car full of people and some want to stop at the outlet stores, some at &amp;quot;Bun Boy&amp;quot;, some at the super creepy hot dog barn which seems to have inspired movies about hillbillies torturing people in dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are all like &amp;quot;horizontal shifts&amp;quot; while trying to move along the J curve to get to the purple zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad for progress!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you are in Vegas, it&amp;#39;s ok to look around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t delaying the trip anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_vbhppt", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vbhppt/seeing_samples/icoslfo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1655456242.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1655456242.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "icopkjj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Artivist", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_icomzsh", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4pgwt", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; But by accident?

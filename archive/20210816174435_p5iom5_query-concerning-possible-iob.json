Their encased emanations are in a state of great turmoil, and their assemblage points shift everywhere in the band of man, giving children a great capacity to focus on emanations that later will be thoroughly disregarded. Then as they grow, the older humans around them, through their considerable power over them, force the children's assemblage points to become more steady by means of an increasingly complex internal dialogue. The internal dialogue is a process that constantly strengthens the position of the assemblage point, because that position is an arbitrary one and needs steady reinforcement.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that many children see,\" he went on. \"Most of those who see are considered to be oddballs and every effort is made to correct them, to make them solidify the position of their assemblage points.\"\n\n\"But would it be possible to encourage children to keep their assemblage points more fluid?\" I asked.\n\n\"Only if they live among the new seers,\" he said. \"Otherwise they would get entrapped, as the old seers did, in the intricacies of the silent side of man.

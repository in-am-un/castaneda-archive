Bottom line, there's a lot more to Tensegrity than we realized.  But you have to do it, the way Carlos told us to do it.\n\nAfter a marathon session on the weekend, my darkroom tonight had a fully glowing purple misted flow in the air, with intense swirling puffs.   I scooped a few onto my \"pouches\" and the results were astounding.  I could already see my energy body's finer details, sticking out of the edges of the puffs which had remained on my torso.\n\nAnd the floor was rippling with yellow cobweb dust, the kind perfect for mashing energy.\n\nIt was so visual, I got a chance to see what it would be like to have the entire room composed of visible energy fields and surfaces, while doing the tensegrity.  There weren't any flowing green symbols as there are in \"the Matrix\" when you see the actual room as made out of energy, but it was just as amazing when made out of cobweb dust.\n\nBut I also noticed, the vivid colors disturbed by the tensegrity, were only vivid if I maintained near perfect silence.  That's an obvious observation for a dark roomer, but in this case, it was more like, my \"best\" feeling of silence was needed to keep it that bright.  If there were such categories for silence, as they have for storms and earthquakes, I needed cat 4 silence to see that sight.\n\nPretty soon I noticed, if you concentrate on the smoothness of the movements, you can \"store\" silence in them.  Retrain your muscle memory to include silence as part of that movement.\n\nIs that possible?  Apparently so.\n\nTo use an  analogy, one of my co-workers has a 3 year old daughter, whom she brings to work.\n\nI've noticed when she tries to lift or push something heavy, she sticks her tongue out.\n\nI'd read about that before.  I can't remember why we do that.  Perhaps blood pressure rises when the back legs and hips tense to put in more effort, so the brain creates a \"relief\" valve by sticking the tongue out, and any sudden excess blood pressure can just make your tongue swell a bit.  Like one of those squeezy toy humans you can crush to relieve tension, and his eyes and tongue bulge out when you grip him hard.\n\nBut adults somehow trained away that natural behavior, and instead tense their jaw and mouth.  Presumably they also tense the tongue in there too.  It's not as natural of a behavior, but you don't get laughed at for sticking your tongue out.\n\nWhat has this to do with tensegrity?  It means, part of our muscle memory of how to do things, can include controlling other aspects of our body.\n\nI experimented with it a bit, trying to keep the swirling colors around me at their peak intensity while doing certain tensegrity moves, and became convinced you could learn to store \"silence\" in the movements.\n\nDarkroom was ideal for that, because you had some feedback on when you were successfully silent.\n\nI recall that after Carlos died, someone turned down the lights at a workshop, and I discovered that I get amazing results with twilight tensegrity.  Somewhere in Cleargreen, someone knew there was a connection between ambient lighting, and how well the tensegrity worked.\n\nAs I was wondering how to \"store\" silence into the movements, I realized, maybe you could store assemblage point movement also.\n\nFancy showed up.  She's my red zone IOB.\n\nI mentioned what I'd figured out, to see if she had any suggestions.  Wasn't talking.  But she did get more vivid as I asked her about it.  As if having asked, added energy to her.\n\nI tried some other movements and discovered that the V pass tensegrity was absolutely amazing.  Intense sheets of purple and pink energy flowed up into the V spot, when the arm thrusting and retrieving movements were done.\n\nI don't know if it was Fancy's doing, but something said \"Of course! It's shapeshifting.  All of the tensegrity is shapeshifting.\"\n\nI couldn't quite figure out what that means, so I tried to \"feel\" the movements, and visually see the results in the air, and was reminded of the instructions for turning into a crow.\n\nYou didn't just visualize wings sprouting out, you had to \"feel\" them.\n\nI was reminded of the witches I'd seen at workshops  (female participants, not our actual leader witches), over in a corner of some park during break, \"feeling\" their movements.\n\nI always made fun of that,  but then I realized, \"feeling\" your movements is precisely what I had been thinking earlier, was supposed to happen.\n\nMaybe each tensegrity movement can both be visually seen in the energy disruptions it makes, but it should also be \"felt\" as a transformation of shape and form in the body.  It should move the \"emphasis\" of what you visualize your physical form to be, around as if it could flow like glowing light.\n\nSo that doing a tensegrity form was almost like being a paint brush, scooping up light from the air with some movements, and brushing it across virtual phantom room surfaces when moving back the other direction.\n\nLike a Japanese Ink brush in the hands of as skilled artist.\n\nIt's a sort of flow the artist learns, not so much a muscle skill.\n\nWhen concentrating on the muscle skill of using the brush alone, a beginners hands are shaky and unsure, and the brush strokes come out poorly.\n\nBut once the muscles are a little more familiar with the movements, you just \"think\" the brush to do what you want, and it comes out smoothly, as long as your thinking is smooth.\n\nThe same happens when you walk.  You don't plan all the movements.  You just want to walk a certain direction, and off you go.\n\nAs you observe the obstacles in your path, and on the ground, you can activate other types of \"flows\" you know.\n\nFor example, the flow of going around a large round trashcan on the sidewalk, when you need to get back in line with the path afterwards.  You know that one!  Your hip tilts one way while a leg goes out the other, and you can sort of \"feel\" the doing of that specific movement, which you've learned over the years, by all the times you had to do it.\n\nIt became a \"thing\" to go around a trash can and return to  your path, and all you need to do is \"think and feel\" it.\n\nDon Juan once explained to Carlos that he had high hopes for muscle memory as a useful technique for reaching silence.  Carlos told us about it in class, when he introduced the long forms.\n\nI misunderstood.\n\nI thought, he meant that if you had to think several moves ahead to make sure you didn't screw up, there was no time to feel bad about the argument you had in the morning with your neighbor, over where to put the trash bins on the street on pickup day.\n\nAnd that was undoubtedly partially true.\n\nBut eventually all such \"long forms\" become fully automatic.\n\nAsk a Tai Chi person if they have to think several moves ahead anymore, and they will often tell you, the movements just flow now.  They could forget everything in their mind, and they'd still do them all correctly.\n\nThey just \"feel\" it and the next move happens by  itself.  They can even observe the process, wondering if the next one is indeed going to flow out, and be a tiny bit surprised themselves, when \"one thing leads to the other\".\n\nWe've recently heard from our 3rd private class member, that Carlos began pushing \"the circle\" of private class women, to do the movements more perfectly.  He said it was his last chance, and got upset when they weren't getting it perfect enough.  So he tried to shame them by making them demonstrate their own alone in front of others.  He was quite desperate to get something new going.  Obviously since he'd soon be dead, how well the movements were done was irrelevant.\n\nHe wanted them to discover something that would give them a chance to hook to the sorcery path for real.\n\nPerhaps he didn't really care about getting the movement \"perfect\", so much as engaging them to feel it, and feel the flow, and turn it into something into which they could store both silence, and assemblage point movement.\n\nHe was trying to turn the movements more into a form of shapeshifting, where how you feel about the flow, is as important as the technical details.\n\nFailing to get them to do that, he switched them over to not-doings, which if you consider it are a more concentrated form of what I just described.\n\nHe did say, that tensegrity movements were one of the \"not-doings\" of Silvio Manuel in some recent account posted by another user in here.\n\nIt goes against my male point of view, but the closed eye, witchy sort of \"self-expressive\" tensegrity you see done by women wearing weird indianish looking clothing at workshops, is probably closer to what Carlos had in mind, than my technically minded approach.\n\nCholita does a lot of that, except that it's \"fierce\" also.\n\nMaybe  you have to extract the attention seeking part of that witchy behavior.\n\nMake it \"fierce\" instead of \"needy\", but still have the mind focus on the muscle movements as a unified thing you both think (intend), and also feel.\n\nFierceness was the quality that caused Carlos to push Kylie to the front, and probably the reason she went off with the witches, when they \"retired\" from workshops.\n\nI'll add, you can't trust Castaneda fans.\n\nThey've found endless ways to pretend every aspect of sorcery, and managed to learn nothing for the last 50 years.  They even get angry and their heads explode, if you try to talk them out of the pretending.\n\nBuddhism fixed that by giving them principles of higher states of consciousness to memorize, which includes some punishment aspects, such as if you exhibit any grumpiness, you're not following the rules about \"ego\".\n\nThey have things of \"more substance\" to pretend, with instructions to never let their heads explode.\n\nIt's very effective for keeping paying customers around for decades, without a need to actually teach them some real magic.\n\nBut Carlos didn't want us pretending our sorcery, so we don't have much of that.  Everyone knows, you aren't supposed to worship your inventory.\n\nAnd yet still, everyone figures out their own way to pretend results, because it makes them momentarily happier.  Before the next person they run into,  in the River of Filth, shits on them, instead of just pissing.\n\nWhich means, if you tried to add all I just said to the understanding, you'd just end up with men also wearing the indianish looking weird clothes, dancing with their eyes closed in the park at break in workshops.\n\nYou just can't win, which is likely why Carlos didn't get explicit about what he wanted from the Tensegrity.\n\nWe've gotten better results in here.  And that's because, if you do what we do correctly, you get a visual feedback.\n\nYou see colors, and they do amazing things.  Then you get to see vivid waking dreams hover in the air, and finally phantom rooms.  But it takes actual time and effort.  You can't lie about how much quality time you put in, because crossing that first visual barrier is hard.\n\nOur goal is all visual stuff you can't fake to yourself.  You could lie, but there's nothing we can do about users in  here, who make up experiences.  They don't stick around long because there's really no \"attention prize\" of substance in here.\n\nSo given people lie, add back in the visual feedback for when you are silent, and if the tensegrity is done in that spirit, of feeling the movements as if they were shapeshifting,  and trying to \"store silence\" into each specific movement, so that our muscle memory \"sticks out our silence tongue\" during each movement, and if you insist on visually seeing a light show that would make Spielberg proud, that is perhaps the way the tensegrity was intended to be.\n\nIt's supposed to be \"magic\".  A magical ritual, incantation, invocation.  Maybe even a \"gesture to the spirit\".\n\n\"Magical\" passes...\n\nI realized all that with visual aids such as you get when seeing energy.   When I thought about people at workshops doing wacky stuff on hills, I got an actual mini dream bubble of it.\n\nThat's the reward for moving the assemblage point past the middle of the orange part of the J curve.\n\nI worried I'd forget all that,  since \"seeing continuously\" mode is like that, easy to forget, so I turned to my right,  hoping to get a little encouragement from Fancy.\n\nShe was still watching, with a dumb expression on her face.\n\nShe wasn't going to talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Secret Life of Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shapeshifting"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"uq5tm9xe1l581": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73fe1f694a160bcab3fd497660607fa599b79fd9"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c517145627d494c19a0ac7379e7e49145799188a"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ee1616e41f3638a7cd3968dbb66d860ae3b8a31"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c055035f406785db33220f731c69765122756c9"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=423582568c6107d9898e604b549cda3fe9250ece"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=488e2b5a0c350703d063044d4b23d2dc67e9b45d"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92db8b8d4dd737cbcf4562d3493c01d8042219a9"}, "id": "uq5tm9xe1l581"}}, "name": "t3_rg2dg5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shapeshifting", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ILnSlP39SIIuCu533u22o7icNMS6vGoSsFOwPv-gD7E.jpg", "edited": 1639520084.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1639467910.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=92db8b8d4dd737cbcf4562d3493c01d8042219a9\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/uq5tm9xe1l581.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=92db8b8d4dd737cbcf4562d3493c01d8042219a9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I already used this title, but you can&amp;#39;t edit those.

Obviously since he&amp;#39;d soon be dead, how well the movements were done was irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wanted them to discover something that would give them a chance to hook to the sorcery path for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he didn&amp;#39;t really care about getting the movement &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot;, so much as engaging them to feel it, and feel the flow, and turn it into something into which they could store both silence, and assemblage point movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was trying to turn the movements more into a form of shapeshifting, where how you feel about the flow, is as important as the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Failing to get them to do that, he switched them over to not-doings, which if you consider it are a more concentrated form of what I just described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did say, that tensegrity movements were one of the &amp;quot;not-doings&amp;quot; of Silvio Manuel in some recent account posted by another user in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes against my male point of view, but the closed eye, witchy sort of &amp;quot;self-expressive&amp;quot; tensegrity you see done by women wearing weird indianish looking clothing at workshops, is probably closer to what Carlos had in mind, than my technically minded approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita does a lot of that, except that it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;fierce&amp;quot; also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe  you have to extract the attention seeking part of that witchy behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make it &amp;quot;fierce&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;needy&amp;quot;, but still have the mind focus on the muscle movements as a unified thing you both think (intend), and also feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fierceness was the quality that caused Carlos to push Kylie to the front, and probably the reason she went off with the witches, when they &amp;quot;retired&amp;quot; from workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll add, you can&amp;#39;t trust Castaneda fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve found endless ways to pretend every aspect of sorcery, and managed to learn nothing for the last 50 years.  They even get angry and their heads explode, if you try to talk them out of the pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhism fixed that by giving them principles of higher states of consciousness to memorize, which includes some punishment aspects, such as if you exhibit any grumpiness, you&amp;#39;re not following the rules about &amp;quot;ego&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have things of &amp;quot;more substance&amp;quot; to pretend, with instructions to never let their heads explode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very effective for keeping paying customers around for decades, without a need to actually teach them some real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos didn&amp;#39;t want us pretending our sorcery, so we don&amp;#39;t have much of that.  Everyone knows, you aren&amp;#39;t supposed to worship your inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet still, everyone figures out their own way to pretend results, because it makes them momentarily happier.  Before the next person they run into,  in the River of Filth, shits on them, instead of just pissing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, if you tried to add all I just said to the understanding, you&amp;#39;d just end up with men also wearing the indianish looking weird clothes, dancing with their eyes closed in the park at break in workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just can&amp;#39;t win, which is likely why Carlos didn&amp;#39;t get explicit about what he wanted from the Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve gotten better results in here.  And that&amp;#39;s because, if you do what we do correctly, you get a visual feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see colors, and they do amazing things.  Then you get to see vivid waking dreams hover in the air, and finally phantom rooms.  But it takes actual time and effort.  You can&amp;#39;t lie about how much quality time you put in, because crossing that first visual barrier is hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal is all visual stuff you can&amp;#39;t fake to yourself.  You could lie, but there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do about users in  here, who make up experiences.  They don&amp;#39;t stick around long because there&amp;#39;s really no &amp;quot;attention prize&amp;quot; of substance in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So given people lie, add back in the visual feedback for when you are silent, and if the tensegrity is done in that spirit, of feeling the movements as if they were shapeshifting,  and trying to &amp;quot;store silence&amp;quot; into each specific movement, so that our muscle memory &amp;quot;sticks out our silence tongue&amp;quot; during each movement, and if you insist on visually seeing a light show that would make Spielberg proud, that is perhaps the way the tensegrity was intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s supposed to be &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;.  A magical ritual, incantation, invocation.  Maybe even a &amp;quot;gesture to the spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Magical&amp;quot; passes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized all that with visual aids such as you get when seeing energy.   When I thought about people at workshops doing wacky stuff on hills, I got an actual mini dream bubble of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the reward for moving the assemblage point past the middle of the orange part of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worried I&amp;#39;d forget all that,  since &amp;quot;seeing continuously&amp;quot; mode is like that, easy to forget, so I turned to my right,  hoping to get a little encouragement from Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was still watching, with a dumb expression on her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t going to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow":

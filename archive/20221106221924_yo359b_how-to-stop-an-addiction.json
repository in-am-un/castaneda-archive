Another very simple version is to simply to not buy more drugs once you run out. Another version for example, a bit more drastic for some, would be if you are an alcoholic to move to a dry town. I know several within an hour of me. Things like that. Stalk the sequence of events involved in your habit and break one link in the chain. That was Don Juan\u2019s advice. For the record I have used this advice successfully.  If you want to try it just throw all your shit away and flush it down the toilet for a day. You certainly will not be able to use that night unless you go out and buy all new equipment and drugs which is not an easy thing for everybody to do in a moment\u2019s notice, so you at least get a day of sobriety in that way. You could keep doing this over and over until the financial costs also start to hurt. If you don\u2019t have The drugs and you don\u2019t have a device to smoke it and you don\u2019t have the people who you do it with you will break the addiction. In a battle in which less than 10% of people successfully break addiction I find this advice to be as valuable and useful as any other. Checking yourself into a sober facility obviously would break the sequence chain. Even taking a one week trip somewhere where you do not have access to your equipment and your drugs would at least work for that week. Throw out all your shit before you leave. You could see what it feels like and maybe come out the other side sober. Break a link in the chain even for just a day, a week. Small steps can lead to big changes, you might be surprised.\n\nFinally since you are here in this community I might as well throw in that most drug use is counterproductive to dreaming. If you are truly interested in sorcery and want to become a talented dreamer, that is the reward waiting for you. Although I definitely had vivid dreams while using marijuana they were blunted - no pun intended - and when I stopped, is when I really began to make miraculous progress in dreaming. So that is the reward waiting for sorcerers. If it\u2019s adventure and mind expansion you seek, drug use does not hold a candle to actual dreaming. As others have said in other comments, redirecting your addictive personality into sorcery is a great method, but I would specify that dreaming in particular becomes explosive, colorful and beautiful when you quit weed. If you are doing other drugs I can\u2019t speak for them, but countless people have talked about how vivid and amazing their dreams became once they quit weed. Of course they were still having dreams on weed but their ability to remember or become aware inside of dreaming was limited.\n\nI hope some of this helps.

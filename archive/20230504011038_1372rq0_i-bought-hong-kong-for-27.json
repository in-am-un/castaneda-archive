Ok... I admit it. \n\nI just liked owning Hong Kong.  And I wrote all this text to justify posting it.\n\nSorry...\n\n\\*\\*\\* from facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nI bought Hong Kong for $27.\n\nIn the women's books, there's mention of some members of the last lineage having learned martial arts in Asia.\n\nThere's also mention of don Juan being an international businessman.  And a stockholder.\n\nAnd, Soledad was said to have moved to Los Angeles with a motto of \"Money for Movies\".\n\nThe witches met with Sony pictures according to some lecture notes. Maybe with Soledad?  And Bruce could have been mixed up in some of it.\n\nWe got Star Wars from Soledad is my opinion, but certainly the writers were following the books well and even quoting from them through Yoda.\n\nIf you see a \"power\" in Star Wars, you can learn to do that!  They're all in the range of what the Olmec seers learned to do 8000 years ago.  \n\nThus we've recently learned in that movie franchise that the Jedi are actually ancient sorcerers.\n\nAnd back when Carlos took Cholita in,  he was importing art from Mexico.  Cholita said she was drooling at the prospect of getting her hands on it.\n\nShe herself later became involved in importing Spanish art from Mexico.\n\nI suspect the lineage, being 408 years old, was quite wealthy.\n\nIt was Juan Matus, Julian, Elias, Rosendo, Lujan, Santisteban, Sebastian (1723), with 8 names missing from the earlier period.  The earlier period going back to 1590.\n\nBy the way, paintings of all of the naguals in our lineage are available out there in the second attention.  There's a tunnel for one thing.\n\nThe entry given to me by Carol Tiggs at the urging of Carlos.  \n\nThe existence of a painting of Julian was verified by one of the witches and can be found in lecture notes compiled by Techno.\n\nThe tunnel I entered has paintings lined up along the passage.  And you can gaze into each one.   They're like the \"furrows\" in the tunnel Carlos explained to us in private classes.  You can gaze into the furrows running along the inside of the tunnel. If you like that one you can \"jump grooves\" into there, live that timeline instead,  and potentially heal a serious injury.\n\nCarlos fell off the roof at Pandora, picking either figs or pears, and used that tunnel to heal the injury.\n\nWhy does a tunnel exist with paintings of all Naguals in our lineage?\n\nBeats me. Only gurus like that horrible fraud Sadhguru, have \"all the answers\".\n\nOne of our own went to see him, and he took her meditation cushion.  His delusional followers claimed she couldn't have it back, because it had too much of his amazing \"energy\". She wouldn't be able to handle it.\n\nSad for them, since real magic is easily available.  And Sadhguru is clearly a very bad man.\n\nThat tunnel is an entry to the inorganic beings world.  Maybe our Allies such as Little Smoke and Devil's Weed have been around the lineage for a very long time?  Perhaps they got into the game back in the time of the Olmecs?\n\nYou don't visit that tunnel asleep!  \n\nAnd you don't have a \"vision\" of it, in lame closed eye impotent Asian meditation.\n\nI hope none of you fall for that nonsense about Yogis and their visions.  You should be having such visions daily, each one beating anything Yogananda or Muktananda ever wrote about.\n\nExcept we do it fully awake with our eyes open, and completely sober.\n\nNor should you work yourself into a frenzy with rhythmic prayer, the way Judaism and Islam do.\n\nThere's no brainwashing or make believe involved in real magic.\n\nYou physically walk into that tunnel, and physically walk along in it.\n\nWith the dreaming emissary there to explain things.\n\nSorcery is weird, but never pretend if you follow the instructions we were given. \n\nAnd give up on trying to steal money from others, based on pretending to be a \"shaman\".\n\nShaman's are assholes according to don Juan.  \n\nSeers are sorcerers.  \n\nSo put down the Rambo headband?  You got confused as to what we are trying to be.\n\nWho the heck would want to be like Native American Shamans, who's magic is 99% pretending?  A lot of whom viciously criticize Carlos whenever they get the chance.\n\nI suppose it's not surprising the lineage would be wealthy. Normal people gain in wealth as they age.  If you could pass that on for 15 generations keeping some very old possessions such as oil paintings and antique furniture, real estate, and accumulating and keeping stock, it's not surprising you'd end up wealthy.\n\nAnd travel to Hong Kong might be in the mix.  It's famous because it's a hub with other countries, including Mexico.  \n\nAccording to ChatGPT, the first recorded ship was Nuestra Senora de la Concepcion in 1565.\n\nOur lineage started in 1590!\n\nI'm just musing here, but in the cartoons you could teach every single thing from the books, in story form.\n\nAnd one of those is that Clara (it's been a while since I read any of the books, so please correct me if I'm wrong)  learned martial arts in Asia.\n\nMight make an amusing story to have these 2 wandering around in Hong Kong, trying to track down where Clara learned.\n\nEspecially since Hong Kong was only $27.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I Bought Hong Kong For $27!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Audiovisual"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"17jt4p227pxa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/1372rq0/asset/17jt4p227pxa1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718050511%2CMDhiNjY4Y2NkYjBmNzYwZDU3OTI5NWRlZDRhYzJiMWFmNGFjOTQzMjM1ZTUxOGFiZjA0NjE1NzI2ZjVkYmM4MA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/1372rq0/asset/17jt4p227pxa1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718050511%2CMjBjY2I1YzQ4ODY4N2I2MmZlZjI3YjJiMzQ0ZTZkZDU2M2Q3MDFjMWZiMDE0NDk2NGUzZTg1MGIyMTFlMjgyZQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "17jt4p227pxa1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_1372rq0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Audiovisual", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1683205490.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1683155438.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1372rq0/video/17jt4p227pxa1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/1372rq0/video/17jt4p227pxa1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must admit it&amp;#39;s slightly less realistic than I had hoped, but I&amp;#39;ve seen Disney mix &amp;quot;assets&amp;quot; and use some that weren&amp;#39;t as real as those of the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not only was this scene (and 2 more) only $27, but this entire video only took 30 minutes to put together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So modern animation software is pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could have cartoons about Westerly Witch and Tensegrity Policewoman trying to track down where Clara learned Kung Fu.

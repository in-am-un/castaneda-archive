Or men outraged because the obvious real magic in here, makes their con artist magical system look bad.\n\nSuch men nearly destroyed everything Carlos tried to do.  He said so himself towards the end.\n\nBoth Jadey and I heard it, in various forms.  Besides his weekly attempts, for years and years, to point out new charlatans with their \"TOLTEC!!!\" books designed to cash in, and deceive readers.\n\nCholita also heard Carlos' ugly battle with fakery and laziness, but she thinks this place is hopeless.  So she won't add to it, except with stunning magic done randomly in our home.\n\nShe's a super advanced scout to this place. But one who despises it.\n\nJadey felt his desperation at the end with his \"naked not-doing\" classes for women.  He was ruthless that the movements had to be done perfectly.\n\nIt was a last ditch attempt to bring out the doubles of the women in class.  Embarrass them, and make it seem like they were unable to move properly.\n\nA PERFECT lure for the double to come help.\n\nYou'll find that out if you keep practicing darkroom.\n\nOr you can read about it in Taisha's latest book, where she lures her double out by wanting to do tensegrity on the ground, while up in a treehouse with scary inorganic beings.\n\nIn my case,  I saw even more of his frustration with having run out of time, before he succeeded with anyone.\n\nCarlos arranged to be alone with me not long before he died.\n\nHe ordered the Chacmools to close the doors at Dance Home with just him and me on the stairs, and the building entirely empty.\n\nI'd been prowling around that area, waiting for class to begin.  I was curious, having remote viewed it from home hours earlier.  So I got there very early.\n\nBut so did Carlos!  Before anyone else arrived.\n\nAnd he told the Chacmools to go away for a while.\n\nThen he confided in me, \"I'm dying, and no one believes me.\"\n\nCarlos didn't mean, he wanted some pity.  Anyone who reaches that level of sorcery has resources stretching far out into other worlds, and this one is just a temporary inconvenience.  In fact, we learned later that Carlos had already left, despite his apparent organic body still being around.\n\nAnd there was no reason to seek pity from me, after asking the Chacmools to leave us alone for a while.\n\nIt took me decades to figure that out.\n\nWhat he really meant was that after all of those books and after all of the endless hard work on his part and that of Carol, Taisha and Florinda, with multiple free classes everyday,  and public workshop after workshop, the general consensus out there is that he made it all up.\n\nNo one believed him.\n\nMeaning, he had failed.\n\nIt wasn't actually something a sorcerer regrets. That's part of the path.\n\nKnowing you are most likely going to fail, but have to try anyway.\n\nTHAT'S impeccability.   It has nothing to do with attention seeking.  It's just a relationship to the intent of the world.  One not based on gain.\n\nEssentially, Carlos tossed the ball back to me.\n\nNot to say I was his only remaining chance.\n\nCarlos had \"faction\" after faction out there, as backup.  We still haven't uncovered all of them.\n\nSoledad the witch being one of those.\n\nIn my case, I got into private classes with the free publication \"the Nagualist Newsletter\" back in the early 90s before private classes and workshops.\n\nSo Carlos knew I was inclined to organize things, with no monetary motivation involved.  In fact, I spent my own money making and sending out that publication for free.\n\nBut Carlos didn't want that distraction just as workshops were starting, and asked me to stop.\n\nAnd later as a reward for doing so,  let me into private classes.\n\nThe obvious hint to resume that publication was in his words on the steps of Dance Home.\n\nBut I didn't.\n\nHe skillfully exploded everything, so that it all fell apart.  In disgrace.\n\nAnd I made the semi-conscious decision to go along with that.\n\nWhich is \"the rule\" if you read the books carefully.\n\nSorcerers, when done teaching apprentices, skillfully remove all the \"shiny objects\" of attention seeking, leaving the apprentices to decide on their own if they want to \"get real\".\n\nIt's the kind of thing only someone possessing silent knowledge would  understand.\n\nYou CANNOT learn sorcery if you are really trying to gain something else.\n\nAttention for example.\n\nSo after I failed to pick up the hint from Carlos, the two allies he released to one of his private classes in which I was present, took over.\n\nAnd blackmailed me to come here.\n\nFairy and Minx.\n\nThey can be VERY persuasive if you get on their bad side.\n\nI'll animate it someday.\n\nBut trust me on this, it's been a long bloody battle.\n\nAnyone who doesn't know that hasn't taken the time to figure out where they are, by reading past posts.\n\nWe MUST make this place a haven for real magic such that new people who take a \"quick look\" only see STUNNING posts.\n\nNot junk or obvious pretending.\n\nAnd if what's at the top of the posts doesn't look stunning to them, even after we try to keep the low quality posts out,  then good riddance.\n\nYou have to WANT to learn sorcery, by yourself, or it's not possible.\n\nEverything in here kicks the Buddha's lousy butt.  But Buddhists will refuse to see that. They're after the \"shiny rewards\" of endorsement as \"enlightened\".\n\nI believe we actually got attacked by an \"Enlightened Master\" a couple of months ago. I made a comment on his YouTube channel, which was obviously very true, but he decided to come attack instead of waking up. And charged in with the \"Carlos was thoroughly debunked\" argument.\n\nHe tried to use \"authority\" to suppress me.  That's the obsession of Buddhists.\n\nEndorsement by an authority.\n\nIgnoring the actual magic right in here before his eyes.  Stuff Buddhists don't even dream of.\n\nBut I'm a bit touchy about Buddhism in particular, because I watched Carlos have to deal with it for years.  And finally we lost the only double being Carlos ever found to that obsession with human attention and endorsement.  Our double male Tony Karam, wanted to sit at the Dali Lama's feet instead of learn from Carlos.\n\nThe Dali Lama, one of the ugliest fakers in the world.\n\nSo, new rules are being discussed in the advanced subreddit.  To prevent low quality and pretending posts from filling the top positions in the recent posts.\n\nI should tell those of you who make those, it's super obvious to the advanced.\n\nThey're just afraid of tantrums, so they don't say anything.\n\nThus the need for \"rules\" to define what's a bad post.\n\nUnfortunately, visitors to this subreddit have proven they won't scroll down very far.\n\nSo low quality posts at the top cost us potential future seers.\n\nFor starters, there's no reason for a beginner to post at all.  It's a very bad sign when they do. And an even worse sign that they don't realize that.\n\nSo rule #1 is, a very new beginner posting is one \"checkbox\" on the list of bad signs.\n\nDon't do it without good reason.\n\nBut it's tolerated because others can learn from the back and forth.\n\nThe new rules, if there's general agreement in the advanced subreddit, will be a list of \"warning signs\". If a post checks off 4 of those, the person will be prevented from posting for a while.\n\nNOT prevented from learning!  Just prevented from attention seeking.\n\nFrankly, the best thing for a beginner is not to be allowed to post at all.  Because if they get used to being a faker seeking attention, they might decide to defend that and lose any chance to ever learn to be silent and clean up their ugly personality.\n\nDon't get me wrong. There's no \"saints\" in sorcery. The old seers were total bastards.  And the new seers quite nasty.  If Carlos told the truth about the new seers, his books would not have been popular.\n\nDon Juan for example, had a very foul mouth.\n\nAnd our innocent \"Juan Tuma\" with his \"tales of eternity\", stuck his scrotum in Carol Tigg's face and forced her to look at it for a long time.\n\nI'm still not completely sure what a scrotum is...  Don't anyone fill me in.\n\nBut it frightened away a potential new witch who came here, when I mentioned that little aspect of sorcery.\n\nI have an unfortunate tendency to \"experiment\" on people. One of the reasons I angered that unchallenged youtube \"enlightened Buddhist\".\n\nI wanted to see what he'd do.\n\nIt wasn't pretty.\n\nNothing is sacred to a sorcery teacher, when someone's assemblage point is stuck or when there's something stopping it from moving further.\n\nSorcerers in the lineages even tossed apprentices to their deaths, in raging rivers.  Just to get their double to come out and protect them.\n\nCarlos used to dress men up like women the way Julian did, and \"Naked Infinity Theater\" was not uncommon.\n\nSorcerers are ruthless.  But also patient,  cunning,  and sweet.\n\nIn a controlled fashion.\n\nI haven't gotten that \"sweet\" part down yet, according to Cholita.\n\nSo any post that checks off too many boxes on the list of \"bad signs\" might cause someone to be prevented from posting for a while.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the pretenders study old posts to try to discover a way to get away with it.\n\nIdeally we'd have all the cartoons you could want, SHOWING what real sorcery looks like.\n\nAnd explaining good and bad behavior, in regards to learning for real.\n\nBut we don't have that yet.\n\nThe idea being to \"take away the shiny object\" of pretend status in here.\n\nGet rid of the \"Dali Lama Endorsement Seekers\" as fast as possible.\n\nYou can't seek endorsement from a cartoon character.\n\nUntil then, we just need to figure out how to overcome the latest problem, fakers.\n\nThose are almost worse than angry attackers!", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Warning: New Rules Possibly Coming", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qqsvfmgj9hqa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qqsvfmgj9hqa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7afb7d4b76b4d7c96babd44728052f94b3376984"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qqsvfmgj9hqa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0ddeb1083ceb6215226918f9af09e627c535b78"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qqsvfmgj9hqa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98ec61d20fb8b5773895df66cbaa80d12a095f7c"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qqsvfmgj9hqa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f95a4316cca6058e7d27692c2d86a65467b4b644"}, {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qqsvfmgj9hqa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98a52c56f1c548bfc11a4073613377100e30884"}, {"y": 810, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qqsvfmgj9hqa1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67421d5af2ba1819366b9953cb3a2196acf9587"}], "s": {"y": 900, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qqsvfmgj9hqa1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bd55000f87856d9125f55dc226c998078c17b6f"}, "id": "qqsvfmgj9hqa1"}}, "name": "t3_124poxe", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 66, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 66, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/1pCWTb_UPC5ulrQ9PNKQDI7EOlaP6TZa85je7VOmYk4.jpg", "edited": 1713991724.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1680012035.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qqsvfmgj9hqa1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3bd55000f87856d9125f55dc226c998078c17b6f\"&gt;Gleeful Magic Pretenders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New people won&amp;#39;t have any idea how hard the struggle has been in here, to fight off angry men trying to steal from our community with pretend understanding.

&amp;quot;see&amp;quot; using it, it figures out how to find what you want, out of the trillions and trillions of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; on your side, the intelligent aspect of &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll never find anything useful from your &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even if you have a perfect attitude, sometimes your seeing just can&amp;#39;t reach something you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan mentioned that in one of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers aren&amp;#39;t imaginary superheroes who always win, and never fail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the extent to which they succeed, largely depends on the sincerity of their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty of pretend magic out there for people who can&amp;#39;t understand all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null,

And Carlos didn't have a lineage anymore.\n\n(Unless the other apprentices created one in LA).\n\nThere was a very different \"rule\" for the old seers.  They were given very young children.  As the Jedi do.\n\nIn either case, it's best to keep in mind it's just practicality. \n\nNot wisdom.\n\nThe lineages needed to duplicate themselves.\n\nAnd as we've learned in here, only 1 in 100 will even try despite the other 99 truly believing they're interested.\n\nNo different perhaps, then playing the trumpet.\n\nHow many actually get super good at that, compared to how many dabble?\n\nAnd how many who pick up a surf board, actually become as good as those amazing surfers who zig zag the wooden beams of the pier,  in Huntington Beach?\n\nProbably the same low rate we get in here!\n\nAnd then, of the ones who try and actually learn some sorcery most will quit.\n\nSorcery is too cold for them, so they go back to cozy once they realize how long and lonely the path they believed they wanted really is, when you aren't pretending anymore.\n\nThus for the lineages, it was nearly hopeless unless they got indications that \"the spirit\" would help with a given person.\n\nThat also took responsibility off them, and paying back debts is very important if you want to move your assemblage point into non-human realms.\n\nThe rule started with an outside force selecting people, to protect the seers from debt. Then at the end of that generation, they blew the whole thing up, so that the apprentices now had to make the choice themselves.\n\nAlso a trick to \"clean the link to intent\".\n\nSo it's not really clear why that rule existed, other than practicality.  It just seems \"magical\".  \n\nBut mostly it's not.\n\nAnyone who's gotten below the green line on the J curve will tell you that help from the spirit is totally wonderful.  And possibly the only way you ever actually make any progress.  In terms of little \"intent gifts\".\n\nSo the spirit actually, ALWAYS helps. Everyone.\n\nThat's just what it does!  To make our \"stories\" more interesting to the consumer (The Eagle).\n\nBut in here we have a different trick than either the old seers or the new.\n\nWhich was not available before.\n\nMass numbers.  Streaming media.\n\nCarlos seems to have gotten as many as 10,000 to go to a workshop or class.\n\nI'm not sure, but there is a contact list in spreadsheet form, and it does seem to be  close to 10,000.\n\nOut of those, Carlos got none.  Mostly because of student laziness, and no one wanting to be the first to put in the hard work to succeed.

And Carlos didn&amp;#39;t have a lineage anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Unless the other apprentices created one in LA).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a very different &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; for the old seers.  They were given very young children.  As the Jedi do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In either case, it&amp;#39;s best to keep in mind it&amp;#39;s just practicality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lineages needed to duplicate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as we&amp;#39;ve learned in here, only 1 in 100 will even try despite the other 99 truly believing they&amp;#39;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No different perhaps, then playing the trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many actually get super good at that, compared to how many dabble?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how many who pick up a surf board, actually become as good as those amazing surfers who zig zag the wooden beams of the pier,  in Huntington Beach?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably the same low rate we get in here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, of the ones who try and actually learn some sorcery most will quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is too cold for them, so they go back to cozy once they realize how long and lonely the path they believed they wanted really is, when you aren&amp;#39;t pretending anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus for the lineages, it was nearly hopeless unless they got indications that &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; would help with a given person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That also took responsibility off them, and paying back debts is very important if you want to move your assemblage point into non-human realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rule started with an outside force selecting people, to protect the seers from debt. Then at the end of that generation, they blew the whole thing up, so that the apprentices now had to make the choice themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also a trick to &amp;quot;clean the link to intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not really clear why that rule existed, other than practicality.  It just seems &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But mostly it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#39;s gotten below the green line on the J curve will tell you that help from the spirit is totally wonderful.  And possibly the only way you ever actually make any progress.  In terms of little &amp;quot;intent gifts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the spirit actually, ALWAYS helps. Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just what it does!  To make our &amp;quot;stories&amp;quot; more interesting to the consumer (The Eagle).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in here we have a different trick than either the old seers or the new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was not available before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mass numbers.  Streaming media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos seems to have gotten as many as 10,000 to go to a workshop or class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure, but there is a contact list in spreadsheet form, and it does seem to be  close to 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of those, Carlos got none.  Mostly because of student laziness, and no one wanting to be the first to put in the hard work to succeed.  If he&amp;#39;d gotten even 1 who did, things might have been different.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he died too soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t mean he had the wrong idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just wasn&amp;#39;t here for the rise of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if you had 1 million trying to learn for real.

Just went and checked it out. Although I appreciate the indirect accusation, you are incorrect in your assessment. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I am no student of sorcery, nor of any other magic system. I am relatively new to studying these things. Have only been at it a year and a half or so. Even still, from what I can see this system seems to be the one with the most truth. I have no doubt in what you say, or think of myself as some advanced student. All I have done for the past 18 months is try and build an understanding of the world for myself, as I was completely ignorant to it before that point. I am 19. \n\nI just think that you might be doing a disservice to yourself and your community with your all knowing, higher than thou attitude. Not to say you don't know. Even still, wouldn't the more logical approach to those who cower in fear of the truth be understanding? And in my eyes, that is what is really going on with the fakers.

None are more important than the others.\n\nYou could make yourself a phantom toilet, but I'd be careful about using it.\n\nI opened the \"new post\" on reddit, and it was filled with intense purple, red, and jet black puffs.\n\nThey flowed from the phantom post into the air filling  the room.\n\nThat's when I realized, I was still laying on my side.  I sat up in bed.\n\nThe room was now intensely in the red zone on the J curve.\n\nLily, my inorganic being, was right there.\n\nI told her, I can't stay here, I need to get to the orange zone!\n\nWe worked on it until I could see whitish light everywhere, and then I reminded Lily.\n\n\"You haven't found Cholita yet...\"\n\nShe blinked.\n\nCholita began to materialize in front of me, floating in the air.\n\nHer mouth was covered over in thick black cloth.  As if she had a black cloth mask on.\n\nBut Cholita's rather unhappy with the whole COVID masking thing. I couldn't imagine she actually purchased one.\n\nIt also looked like she might be gagged.  Possibly kidnapped.\n\nI couldn't tell from her face. But it was possible she was tied to a chair.\n\n\"But is she ok Lily?\", I asked.\n\nLily began to smile.  It was a huge smile, and very creepy.\n\nClosed mouth, and a perfect moon shaped curve, facing up.\n\n\"Does that mean she's ok???\"\n\nLily began to fade, until there was only her moon shaped smile floating in the air. I heard very faint giggles as she disappeared.\n\nThe air was now filled with whitish light, with a heavy texture.  It wasn't my usual \"vertical lines\".\n\nIt was all sorts of shapes.\n\nIn the upper right corner of the room I caught a yellow sparkle.\n\nI gazed over there, and someone tossed a rope down to me.\n\nI didn't see anyone throw it, I  just saw the rope reach out and hang in the air, just the right distance for me to grab it.\n\nIt was around the diameter of standard plumbing pipe, except it was made from intense yellow strands of light, woven together into that rope shape.\n\nI grabbed it, and pulled it down.  I could see the rope coiled up in my hand, so I placed it on one of my energy pouches.\n\nAnother rope appeared.  And then another.\n\nI pulled each one down from \"infinity\", and placed them on my torso.  I looked down. My energy body was right there, illuminated in yellow light.\n\nA strange alien man became visible at the original location I had pulled the rope.  He seemed to be where the other end of it might have been located, before I pulled it down.  He was extremely far away. Off world for sure.\n\nHe turned to face me as if he could tell I was watching him, and wanted to know who it was.\n\nI became involved in gazing off into infinity realizing we could \"navigate\" the dark sea already, and didn't have to wait until death.\n\nI've lost all of what happened next, until I woke up in the morning.\n\nHeading to the bathroom I noticed my bath towel was no longer in the bathroom.\n\nIt had been removed, and dangled over the hallway door knob.\n\nCholita doesn't like me to leave anything in the bathroom. Doesn't matter what. She'll dispose of it.\n\nAll I can keep is a single bar of soap.\n\nBut I had left my towel in there yesterday, since Cholita was gone.\n\nI wondered if I might have dangled it there, traveling from the bathroom back to the bedroom, and getting distracted by something.\n\nAs bizarre as that would be.\n\nBut then I noticed the shower control was pulled up, to switch from bath to shower head.\n\nOnly Cholita leaves that up!\n\nI walked to the living room.  Cholita's money was on the table, undisturbed.\n\nBut the air conditioner was on.\n\nI never turn it on.\n\nBut Cholita leaves it on 24 hours a day, if it's going to be hot.\n\nThe driveway was empty.

I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine she actually purchased one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also looked like she might be gagged.  Possibly kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t tell from her face. But it was possible she was tied to a chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But is she ok Lily?&amp;quot;, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily began to smile.  It was a huge smile, and very creepy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Closed mouth, and a perfect moon shaped curve, facing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Does that mean she&amp;#39;s ok???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily began to fade, until there was only her moon shaped smile floating in the air. I heard very faint giggles as she disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The air was now filled with whitish light, with a heavy texture.  It wasn&amp;#39;t my usual &amp;quot;vertical lines&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was all sorts of shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the upper right corner of the room I caught a yellow sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed over there, and someone tossed a rope down to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t see anyone throw it, I  just saw the rope reach out and hang in the air, just the right distance for me to grab it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was around the diameter of standard plumbing pipe, except it was made from intense yellow strands of light, woven together into that rope shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed it, and pulled it down.  I could see the rope coiled up in my hand, so I placed it on one of my energy pouches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another rope appeared.  And then another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled each one down from &amp;quot;infinity&amp;quot;, and placed them on my torso.  I looked down. My energy body was right there, illuminated in yellow light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A strange alien man became visible at the original location I had pulled the rope.  He seemed to be where the other end of it might have been located, before I pulled it down.  He was extremely far away. Off world for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turned to face me as if he could tell I was watching him, and wanted to know who it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I became involved in gazing off into infinity realizing we could &amp;quot;navigate&amp;quot; the dark sea already, and didn&amp;#39;t have to wait until death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost all of what happened next, until I woke up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heading to the bathroom I noticed my bath towel was no longer in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had been removed, and dangled over the hallway door knob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita doesn&amp;#39;t like me to leave anything in the bathroom. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter what. She&amp;#39;ll dispose of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I can keep is a single bar of soap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had left my towel in there yesterday, since Cholita was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered if I might have dangled it there, traveling from the bathroom back to the bedroom, and getting distracted by something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As bizarre as that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I noticed the shower control was pulled up, to switch from bath to shower head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only Cholita leaves that up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked to the living room.  Cholita&amp;#39;s money was on the table, undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the air conditioner was on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never turn it on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita leaves it on 24 hours a day, if it&amp;#39;s going to be hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The driveway was empty.  Cholita&amp;#39;s car was not at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/p5iipv/oops_assemblage_point_can_move_one_more_direction/h967fhv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1629130116.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_p5iipv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h9b00ao", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h984s4i", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I like to use horizontal, but I believe Juann was using the \"correct\" term.

And several where Kylie explains how the left side energy is useful for something that the right side isn't, while looking those directions. It's pretty clear you can move your assemblage point by looking a certain direction, and of course when you get to the red zone, that's how you shape shift.  You just \"look where you want to go\", and then dive down there.  Of course, you need someone to show you how to get a detailed view of that new creature's world.\n\nWe had some discussion about why Carlos gave us a very detailed J curve explanation, using his finger moving along a woman's body. He moved it on the skin, starting at her left shoulder, down the back, down the bottom, and then he walked to the other side, and had it coming up.  It seemed as if it were passing under her butt, not down at her feet where the egg ends.  Why didn't he go far down before coming up the front???\n\nBut we concluded, since the assemblage point is actually back behind your left shoulder, slightly up, and he had started his J curve lecture by pushing his hand back there to show where it was, and then moving his finger onto her actual shoulder blade, he wanted to show us the path of the projection onto the skin.  Waving his hand around 2 feet from her body, wouldn't have been easy to follow.  On her skin, it was very logical.\n\nAnd with what we know about the \"ME\" spot far down between the toes, the \"beam of awareness\" is NOT the same as the assemblage point.\n\nSo we can get a little confused about which were are discussing.\n\nBut you essentially have the right idea.  We can only move in \"Man's Band\".  It's a cheese slice in a ball, around 1-2 feet wide (precise size in searchable pdf).\n\nThe Nagual's blow can push it through the middle, by creating a dent.\n\nWe cannot.  Our \"dent potential\" is very small.  We DO have a tiny ability to do that. Carol Tiggs confirmed, one workshop attended can dent another.\n\nBut it wasn't enough for anyone to notice it.  So it got added to the list of wacky things Carols Tiggs says and does.\n\nShe has a reputation for surprises.  Like the death defier being a woman.\n\nHowever, she literally pushed me into the inorganic beings world.  In my waking body, amidst 50 other witnesses. She just pushed me back, and I was sitting inside a dirt tunnel, down below the Radio Shack store, below Dance Home.\n\n(Was \"Real Food Daily\" back then.)\n\nSo I believe anything Carol says, even if I don't like it much.\n\nCholita doesn't like it too. I  guess Carol just brings that out in people.  Rumor has it, Carlos didn't like her once in a while too.\n\nSo we have to move along the outside.  That we know. Carlos explained that in private classes, and created this J curve.  \n\nBut you can find this info in the searchable pdf also. Of all of the books. It's in there!\n\nNow, there's one controversy here.\n\nCarlos traced the J curve path, explaining the glue, green, red, orange and purple zones and what it's like there.  Didn't pick the colors. I got those from PC Paint's palette.\n\nBut, he stopped at the butt cheeks of the woman.  He grinned at me.\n\nHe knew I was more interested in the girl's butt and camel toe, and whether he'd drag his finger on her skin there.  He was a bit of a Devil when it came to making sure you'd remember a demonstration.\n\nHe lifted his finger off her at the top of the butt, as if to disappoint us, moved it back to the top, and seemed to start the lecture over.  Grinning like a kid playing a trick on someone.\n\nI thought at the time, he started over because he was considering going into more detail about shapeshifting, and the far sideways shifts at green and blue.\n\nBut he didn't. He gave relatively the same lecture for that downward path and what happens.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago an old timer, from the sustained action group, discovered this subreddit.\n\nHe's been out of it for years, but has a boatload of \"inventory\" in his mind. He used to bicker and fight it out with O'Neil and other bad guys on sustained action.  They weren't much different than the 3 crazy guys who invaded us earlier in the week.  Except better informed on the books.\n\nStill, they were only inventory warriors, with no interest in actual magic.\n\nInstead of noticing the amazing posts in here, and getting excited, he did what all bad players do.\n\nHe acted as if nothing unusual was going on in here, and proceeded to try to impress people with his \"rarer\" inventory items. He went straight for posting, before reading and understanding what was going on here.\n\nHe was a gold fish in a shark tank, but didn't realize it.\n\nJust wanted some attention, like back in the old days.  I'm always very disappointed when the old timers, from 25 years ago, come here and ignore what's going on.\n\nHe made sure we knew he attended every workshop, and implied he had made friends with the witches.  Carol in particular.\n\nIt's not really how workshops were.  You couldn't just go \"chat up\" Carol Tiggs.\n\nBut it's not impossible.\n\nHe claimed that in order to reach the 3rd attention, you had to have \"bumps\" put there by the old Nagual, and then you unbump the bumps, and that propels the assemblage point all the way across man's band, and that's how you burn up with the fire from within.\n\nIt does not agree with any of the books...  Nor with anything Carlos ever taught us.  Nor with what don Juan said you need to do.\n\nWe're doing what don Juan and Carlos said to do, now he come with something bizarre we've never heard about.\n\nThen he said, Carol Tiggs and group had \"smoothed those bumps out\" years ago, or something like that, and so it was up to the death defier to come up with a new way to burn with the fire from within.\n\nAnd the death defier explained, the luminous shell was actually layers, so you can move the assemblage point down to the lower back, and then inside that layer and back to the top of the  head, and back down one more layer closer to the center.\n\nAgain, info nowhere else anyone can recall, not in the books, but  CRITICAL to us.\n\nBecause we are ***really*** moving our assemblage point.  He cannot, so he thought it was just another \"show and tell\" sorcery activity in here.  \n\nThe same old shit that destroyed the Castaneda community.\n\nI started questioning him aggressively, thinking he was just another bad player who didn't care what he said, as long as he got attention.\n\nHe felt \"entitled\" to be respected and slowly blew up, refusing to give details on exactly what he had heard, and under what actual circumstances.  The whole \"buddy buddy\" with Carol Tiggs was very unlikely.  So I insisted he explain exactly how he heard that.\n\nBut there was something he didn't want to answer honestly in his story. I tried 3 times to get him to explain the precise details of how he'd heard that, and speculated why would Carol Tiggs just dump all of us, and keep important information to herself.\n\nHe started to whine, deleted his account, and left.  His last comment never made it to the public, but I saw it in email.  It was delusional. He was going on about how he'd gotten a sign from Florinda and had to seek her out, and then said maybe he was supposed to find **me**.\n\nLike, the \"omens\" were guiding him.\n\nTypical \"impeccable warrior\" type, who never learns anything and has to make up his sorcery.\n\nThose are primarily the people who gave Carlos such a bad reputation when he died.\n\nSo, it's possible Carlos was also going to explain the layers, but decided if we learned to move our assemblage points like that, it wouldn't matter if we new about it returning to the top, and back down inside a new layer.\n\nJuann and I are both occasionally surprised how long it takes to get from red to orange. If it secretly  traveled back up and down again, that could account for it. And it could account for Cholita finding a \"shortcut\".\n\nShe did!\n\nBut if it does do that \"layer\" Movement, it's true it doesn't matter.  We reach the purple zone just fine!\n\nBut still, it would be nice if people were honest.\n\nMaybe he got a new user id and snuck back here, and can pretend to be a different person who heard that, and give better details so we know if there are in fact \"layers\" to the shell, and the assemblage point can pass inside them.\n\nI won't pry if he does.\n\nBut usually bad players will do anything to save face, including continuous lying.\n\nIt's like that in all \"systems\". Doesn't matter which. It's 95% bad players.  Meaning, they aren't seeking, what they claim to be seeking.  They're after human attention and money.", "edited": 1631121732.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hc2w2u7", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, there&amp;#39;s a pass to &amp;quot;drop&amp;quot; it, where you look behind you and down.

It&amp;#39;s pretty clear you can move your assemblage point by looking a certain direction, and of course when you get to the red zone, that&amp;#39;s how you shape shift.  You just &amp;quot;look where you want to go&amp;quot;, and then dive down there.  Of course, you need someone to show you how to get a detailed view of that new creature&amp;#39;s world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had some discussion about why Carlos gave us a very detailed J curve explanation, using his finger moving along a woman&amp;#39;s body. He moved it on the skin, starting at her left shoulder, down the back, down the bottom, and then he walked to the other side, and had it coming up.  It seemed as if it were passing under her butt, not down at her feet where the egg ends.  Why didn&amp;#39;t he go far down before coming up the front???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we concluded, since the assemblage point is actually back behind your left shoulder, slightly up, and he had started his J curve lecture by pushing his hand back there to show where it was, and then moving his finger onto her actual shoulder blade, he wanted to show us the path of the projection onto the skin.  Waving his hand around 2 feet from her body, wouldn&amp;#39;t have been easy to follow.  On her skin, it was very logical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with what we know about the &amp;quot;ME&amp;quot; spot far down between the toes, the &amp;quot;beam of awareness&amp;quot; is NOT the same as the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we can get a little confused about which were are discussing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you essentially have the right idea.

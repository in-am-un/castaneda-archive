Which despite being just a vapor filled with visible \"things\", has a goal and the purpose of teaching you what you wanted to learn.\n\nI was watching such a fog last night, and kept finding \"shortcuts\".  And passages.  Into deeper realms of reality.\n\nIf I examined one, it opened up like one of those movies where Dr. Strange style sorcerers make buildings mutate and bend, to create new paths.\n\nAt one point I found a clear spot and told my ally 'Fancy',  \"It's clear in there!

One free from worry, instead of the one forced on me by my family that was brimming with grief.\n\nExcept that as a child I could never remember it everyday, and if you skipped too many days of looking for it, it became impossible to find.\n\nI told Fancy, \"A lot of good that will do me.

A few minutes later I found I could compress magical objects using the tensegrity pass never shown at workshops: Pandora's box.  \n\nCarlos emphasized it with the claim he was finally going to show us magic in private class, right in our face.

And Carlos had a big grin on his face like that didn't matter.  It only added to the long list of grievances private class people had been building up, in anticipation of the death of Carlos.\n\nLater I discovered you can form the puffs of purple into Golems using that magical pass. \n\nDreadful black hooded style zombie assistants who can stick around for at least a full day, if you keep giving them attention. \n\nOr fun power objects.    \n\nIn \"the shift below\" that pass has nearly unlimited power to manifest things.\n\nNow it seems, that pass isn't entirely meant for the red zone.

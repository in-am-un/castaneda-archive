I guess I sweep a little further, but not on purpose.\n\nKeep in mind, in the deep orange zone the entire thing becomes fully visible.\n\nThe connections to other things, being inhaled back or exhaled out.\n\nFibers of yellow to red light!  All colors between those.  Mostly yellowish white fibers.\n\nAnd in the DEEP DEEP orange zone, the scenes pop up!\n\nWhen you get there, you'd just love to get excited and do a \"snoopy dance\".\n\nBut you won't care.  \"Of course they pop up\", you'll be thinking.\n\nThen you'll think, \"Wait a minute... Can I make xxxx pop up too???\"\n\nYep.  Don't do that. It's addictive.\n\nSo here's the reason I like to say, proper recapitulation is 3 hours a session, minimum.\n\nAnd 2 sessions a day is a good idea.\n\nYou pretty much have to give up your free time for that.  You get home from work, and into the booth.  You get up in the morning, and in to the booth.\n\nOr, you only work 4-6 hours a day, and live  near work.\n\nIf you do that much, the rewards will be VISIBLE during the day.\n\nIf they aren't, you are daydreaming, not recapping.  Silence applies in there too!  Anything not associated with list management, should be silent.  The internal dialog CANNOT help you remember! It makes that harder.\n\nIf you do a very good job, your childhood ability to daydream and visually see the daydream, will be restored.\n\nKids can do that kind of thing.  Especially in the bathtub, with a little toy.\n\nAnd, you'll be able to \"feel your entire life\" in front of you, like a web of some kind.\n\nWhen you focus on a particular branch of it, the daydreaming activates.\n\nThe 3 hours is because, it just takes that long to move your assemblage point to the deep orange zone.\n\nI wish it weren't so!\n\nIf you do 20 minutes a day of recap, you're a green zone recapper, if you are even that lucky. It's not enough time, because you REALLY need the assemblage point to move for best results.\n\nA \"deep green zone\" recapper will blank out from time to time, right in the middle of a head sweep.\n\nOr that could be a red zone effect, or even very early orange.\n\nCarlos hadn't explained the J curve when I was big on recapping.\n\nBut you could in fact map recapitulation on a J curve, and show pics of what happens at each point.\n\nWithin reason.  Even the main J curve has some items seriously out of order.\n\nI've been waiting for someone to complain.\n\nBut each person discovers it all on their own, so there's never real confidence to complain, \"Dream Bubble stretching occurs 2 inches more to the left you idiot!\"\n\nSo, if you are doing a really good job of recap, you can tell by  the following \"signs\".\n\n1  You blank out, restart the same breath from the same spot (try to finish where you blanked out), but 10 minutes later you didn't manage to finish that breath. The instant you realize you were \"gone\" and start it up again, you blank out before it even moves a tiny bit.\n\n2  You have a \"false memory\".  Hey!  That's the IOBs messing with you.  Don't get angry, don't get even. Just accept the false memory, then back off and realize that in fact, there's no treasure chest of amazing jewels and gold coins above you on a shelf you don't actually have,  then go back in.  Go back and forth between false memory, and \"Oh shit, why did I believe that???\"\n\nNow, if it's a false memory that an office worker raped you, maybe don't go doing any accusing for a year or two.\n\nI had little smoke tricking me.\n\nShe doesn't do things like that.  But trying to convince me there's a magical chest above my head, is ok by her.\n\nWhat they want is for your double to come out to play.\n\nAnd it will!\n\n3  You find yourself on the other side of your home, without realizing how you got there.  You think  hard, to try to figure out what you were doing before that, and you get a weird feeling you are still in the recapitulation crate.\n\nYes, a crate. I don't agree with Carlos or the witches, that it's not necessary.  If you can't build yourself a \"fort\" like you did as a kid, even out of pillows and blankets if you must,  then use the closet.\n\nBecause when you teleport, it's nice to be able to figure out that in fact, something really cool happened.  Best if your crate can lock from the inside.  You won't mind, if you manage to teleport out of it, with the lock still locked.\n\nAnd I'm leaving out very scary details of that, in case any of you does it.

I guess I sweep a little further, but not on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, in the deep orange zone the entire thing becomes fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The connections to other things, being inhaled back or exhaled out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fibers of yellow to red light!  All colors between those.  Mostly yellowish white fibers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the DEEP DEEP orange zone, the scenes pop up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get there, you&amp;#39;d just love to get excited and do a &amp;quot;snoopy dance&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t care.  &amp;quot;Of course they pop up&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll be thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you&amp;#39;ll think, &amp;quot;Wait a minute... Can I make xxxx pop up too???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep.  Don&amp;#39;t do that. It&amp;#39;s addictive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the reason I like to say, proper recapitulation is 3 hours a session, minimum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And 2 sessions a day is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You pretty much have to give up your free time for that.  You get home from work, and into the booth.  You get up in the morning, and in to the booth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, you only work 4-6 hours a day, and live  near work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do that much, the rewards will be VISIBLE during the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they aren&amp;#39;t, you are daydreaming, not recapping.  Silence applies in there too!  Anything not associated with list management, should be silent.  The internal dialog CANNOT help you remember! It makes that harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do a very good job, your childhood ability to daydream and visually see the daydream, will be restored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kids can do that kind of thing.  Especially in the bathtub, with a little toy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, you&amp;#39;ll be able to &amp;quot;feel your entire life&amp;quot; in front of you, like a web of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you focus on a particular branch of it, the daydreaming activates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 3 hours is because, it just takes that long to move your assemblage point to the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish it weren&amp;#39;t so!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do 20 minutes a day of recap, you&amp;#39;re a green zone recapper, if you are even that lucky. It&amp;#39;s not enough time, because you REALLY need the assemblage point to move for best results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;deep green zone&amp;quot; recapper will blank out from time to time, right in the middle of a head sweep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that could be a red zone effect, or even very early orange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos hadn&amp;#39;t explained the J curve when I was big on recapping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you could in fact map recapitulation on a J curve, and show pics of what happens at each point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within reason.  Even the main J curve has some items seriously out of order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for someone to complain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But each person discovers it all on their own, so there&amp;#39;s never real confidence to complain, &amp;quot;Dream Bubble stretching occurs 2 inches more to the left you idiot!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you are doing a really good job of recap, you can tell by  the following &amp;quot;signs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1  You blank out, restart the same breath from the same spot (try to finish where you blanked out), but 10 minutes later you didn&amp;#39;t manage to finish that breath. The instant you realize you were &amp;quot;gone&amp;quot; and start it up again, you blank out before it even moves a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2  You have a &amp;quot;false memory&amp;quot;.  Hey!  That&amp;#39;s the IOBs messing with you.  Don&amp;#39;t get angry, don&amp;#39;t get even. Just accept the false memory, then back off and realize that in fact, there&amp;#39;s no treasure chest of amazing jewels and gold coins above you on a shelf you don&amp;#39;t actually have,  then go back in.  Go back and forth between false memory, and &amp;quot;Oh shit, why did I believe that???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if it&amp;#39;s a false memory that an office worker raped you, maybe don&amp;#39;t go doing any accusing for a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had little smoke tricking me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She doesn&amp;#39;t do things like that.  But trying to convince me there&amp;#39;s a magical chest above my head, is ok by her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they want is for your double to come out to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it will!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3  You find yourself on the other side of your home, without realizing how you got there.  You think  hard, to try to figure out what you were doing before that, and you get a weird feeling you are still in the recapitulation crate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, a crate. I don&amp;#39;t agree with Carlos or the witches, that it&amp;#39;s not necessary.  If you can&amp;#39;t build yourself a &amp;quot;fort&amp;quot; like you did as a kid, even out of pillows and blankets if you must,  then use the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because when you teleport, it&amp;#39;s nice to be able to figure out that in fact, something really cool happened.  Best if your crate can lock from the inside.  You won&amp;#39;t mind, if you manage to teleport out of it, with the lock still locked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m leaving out very scary details of that, in case any of you does it.  When I hear why you wet your pants, I&amp;#39;ll know you aren&amp;#39;t making it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 The IOBs offer you entrance to their world.

The most important thing is to allow intent to guide you in your dreaming or into moving the assemblage point; something will harmonize what you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so you might start with a particular technique but then develop and refine it according to the dictates of spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;do not hurt your neck by sweeping too far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;when you have experience you can recapitulate while walking or doing the dishes, just sweep up little bundles of energy from relived past experiences and send back the little hooks other people have left in you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;start by sitting, quieting the mind. Take someone from your list (of everyone you have ever known) and then visualize a scene with them when you get enough detail (you may or may not have emotions associated with the scene?) you do the fanning breath. You work backward from most recent people to earliest people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;when you recapitulate, unhook the old extraneous stuff first; don\u2019t start with current relationships or you may sever them. (In answer to a question) don\u2019t start with your mom, this is one of the big relationships and save it for last.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;recapitulation does not mean you won\u2019t love someone anymore; in fact you may love them for the first time when you are done, since there will no longer be unfinished business, old baggage between you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;put yourself in the scene you have visualized then breathe it in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;gently sweep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;don\u2019t get a sore neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;see the energy, the filaments (this is something you might see or sense but will get better with as time goes by especially as you have more energy to work with as a result of the practice.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;feel with the breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;exhale and let go (break off from the matrix of the social structure.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;no moral judgments or narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;sometimes body gets involved - jiggle the fibers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;turning the head jiggles the point behind you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;can do while doing the dishes (Florinda recapitulated a huge chunk of her life while traveling on buses to and from Mexico)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;energy body will make itself known to you, heard by you and teach you how to breath (in your own way.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so just recapitulate; it is the most important; activate the energy body and something will guide you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: recap the dead too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;even the dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/t0m576/recapitulation_demonstration_of_the_critically/i1jjsyp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1647877793.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_t0m576", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i1jk5ms", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1647877932.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_t0m576", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "On the center/straight-ahead position:\n\nThe Eagles Gift (Florinda; pp 289-291):\n\n\u201cFlorinda explained that the key element in recapitulating was breathing.

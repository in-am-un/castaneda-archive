There were no &amp;quot;marriages&amp;quot; in our natural environment, because those would be delusional.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a female Chimp insisting she&amp;#39;s married to one of the male chimps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of having sex with most of them, constantly.  Even sneaking off to distant Chimp tribes, to see if there&amp;#39;s hotter male chimps over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chimps behave like a nasty hip-hop video!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not recommending any divorces here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got Cholita living with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except Cholita caused a miracle so amazing last night when I got home, I still can&amp;#39;t figure out how she did it.  I had to take a picture to see if I can discover what  was going on by examining it closely today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even got her magical cat involved in it.  Some kind of bizarre spell to create a phantom area in her garden.  Complete with breeze, on a still day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One a cat would love, but a human would barely notice. It was designed for someone the height of the cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cat left as I watched,  possibly having noticed me lurking. Leaped up a 6 foot high block wall, and walked along the top like it was a highway to the street one over behind ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Cholita emerged from the opposite side of the  yard. From our own street. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angry.  Told me to LEAVE!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe there&amp;#39;s no cat at all??!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not entirely impossible with Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning,  there can be a benefit to opposite sexes practicing sorcery together.  It seems as if combining male and female energy can increase the realness of magical techniques, such as when the little sisters ran on the walls for the first time just because Carlos was watching.  His awareness got added to the emanations they were assembling for that ritual, making them glow even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just not likely you&amp;#39;ll get 2 who are serious. And if you do, hopefully the male will realize he&amp;#39;s at a disadvantage to a female. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though females aren&amp;#39;t as singularly minded and dedicated to &amp;quot;the rules&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing you learn in sorcery is that you have to deal with being  stuck in a flesh body, very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not dismiss or gloss over obvious side effects of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s part of &amp;quot;sobriety&amp;quot; to stop ignoring the obvious.

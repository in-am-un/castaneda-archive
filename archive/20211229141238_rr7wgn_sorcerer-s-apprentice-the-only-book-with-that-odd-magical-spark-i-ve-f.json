Sincerely, I&amp;#39;m asking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m always curious why someone wouldn&amp;#39;t check it out.  All I can think of is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1  Could it be you don&amp;#39;t actually believe anything can happen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2  Or maybe there&amp;#39;s so many things out there, that you believe there are plenty of choices?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think &amp;quot;magic is everywhere!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are no others.  At least, no one  has shown me any.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rr7wgn/sorcerers_apprentice_the_only_book_with_that_odd/hqf6b4a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640793069.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_rr7wgn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hqen36b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calibrafo", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1640783861.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_rr7wgn", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4uszak2z", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25107435-the-sorcerer-s-apprentice", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hqen36b", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25107435-the-sorcerer-s-apprentice\"&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25107435-the-sorcerer-s-apprentice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rr7wgn/sorcerers_apprentice_the_only_book_with_that_odd/hqen36b/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640783861.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_rr7wgn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

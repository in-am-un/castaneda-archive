Not them.\n\nThat said, you really can see the \"flux\" of things, if you learn to see the whitish light that happens when you are \"seeing energy\", and you begin to consider it as a thing, not an effect.\n\nYou try to learn about it.  Not about what it can do. About what it is.  \n\nUnfortunately, I run the risk that a beginner will next post somewhere that they were watching \"the flux\", and then suddenly they saw...\n\nWait.  \n\nThere's no way you can watch the flux!\n\nI suppose new people don't automatically read around in here.\n\nMaybe they just read today's news, and try that out in the darkroom.\n\nNot a good idea!  \n\nThat's what killed the knowledge of Castaneda. It's also why the fake sorcery teachers out there kill any chances their students have of learning for real.\n\nThey pass on a total misunderstanding of how you learn sorcery.\n\nSo that even if they are just stealing stuff from the books, the way they present it is death to the student.\n\nIt implants a very bad idea in their head.\n\nAnyway, seeing the flux is pretty much advanced sorcery and there's no way for you to locate it.\n\nThis clip from the books ought to show you how far out there that is.\n\nFact is, you have to start at the beginning like everyone else. THEN LATER, when you can \"see energy\", you could ask about it.  But if you try to do it first, you will doom yourself to fail.\n\nThe book deal mind will have finished you off.\n\nHere's what Juan had to say about seeing \"the flux of things\".  \n\nBut in my defense, it did in fact occur to me at the time it was just another way to view intent.\n\nSo I don't think anyone should worry about becoming like Julian. It's not something that happens when you have read all that, and then have to \"do it yourself\".\n\nWhen you essentially have to train on your own.\n\nI'm going to suggest that we're more like Rey, in the new Star Wars movies, than Luke.\n\nLuke was frightened of the dark side. \n\nEveryone was!  Yoda saw to it. He was like don Juan, making everyone paranoid about IOBs.\n\nBut Rey didn't see anything wrong with using the dark side.\n\nIt's just the force.  Why judge?\n\nI think we're like that.  We've seen both sides, and if you ask me what goes wrong isn't a technical problem.\n\nIt's bad people.  If you're not a very nice person, you'll go wrong.\n\nAnd it's no one's fault but your own.  \n\nHere's the related inspirational quotes, starting by talking about Julian and Talia.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan said that since the spirit's descent is always shrouded, naturally, Talia and the young actor could not hold onto their vision. They soon forgot it, as anyone would. The uniqueness of their experience was that, without any training and without being aware of it, they had dreamed together and had seen the spirit. For them to have achieved this with such ease was quite out of the ordinary.\n\n\"Those two were really the most remarkable beings I have ever met,\" don Juan added.\n\nI, naturally, wanted to know more about them. But don Juan would not indulge me. He said that this was all there was about his benefactor and the fourth abstract core.\n\nHe seemed to remember something he was not telling me and laughed uproariously. Then he patted me on the back and told me it was time to set out for the cave.\n\nWhen we got to the rock ledge it was almost dark. Don Juan sat down hurriedly, in the same position as the first time. He was to my right, touching me with his shoulder. He immediately seemed to enter into a deep state of relaxation, which pulled me into total immobility and silence. I could not even hear his breathing. I closed my eyes, but he nudged me to warn me to keep them open.\n\nBy the time it became completely dark, an immense fatigue had begun to make my eyes sore and itchy. Finally I gave up my resistance and was pulled into the deepest, blackest sleep I have ever had. Yet I was not totally asleep. I could feel the thick blackness around me. I had an entirely physical sensation of wading through blackness. Then it suddenly became reddish, then orange, then glaring white, like a terribly strong neon light.\n\nGradually I focused my vision until I saw I was still sitting in the same position with don Juan- but no longer in the cave. We were on a mountaintop looking down over exquisite flatlands with mountains in the distance. This beautiful prairie was bathed in a glow that, like rays of light, emanated from the land itself. Wherever I looked, I saw familiar features: rocks, hills, rivers, forests, canyons, enhanced and transformed by their inner vibration; their inner glow. This glow that was so pleasing to my eyes also tingled out of my very being.\n\n\"Your assemblage point has moved,\" don Juan seemed to say to me.\n\nThe words had no sound; nevertheless I knew what he had just said to me. My rational reaction was to try to explain to myself that I had no doubt heard him as I would have if he had been talking in a vacuum, probably because my ears had been temporarily affected by what was transpiring.\n\n\"Your ears are fine. We are in a different realm of awareness,\" don Juan again seemed to say to me.\n\nI could not speak. I felt the lethargy of deep sleep preventing me from saying a word, yet I was as alert as I could be.\n\n\"What's happening?\" I thought.\n\n\"The cave made your assemblage point move,\" don Juan thought, and I heard his thoughts as if they were my own words, voiced to myself.\n\nI sensed a command that was not expressed in thoughts. Something ordered me to look again at the prairie.\n\nAs I stared at the wondrous sight, filaments of light began to radiate from everything on that prairie. At first it was like the explosion of an infinite number of short fibers, then the fibers became long threadlike strands of luminosity bundled together into beams of vibrating light that reached infinity. There was really no way for me to make sense of what I was seeing, or to describe it, except as filaments of vibrating light. The filaments were not intermingled or entwined. Although they sprang, and continued to spring, in every direction, each one was separate, and yet all of them were inextricably bundled together.\n\n\"You are seeing the Eagle's emanations and the force that keeps them apart and bundles them together,\" don Juan thought.\n\nThe instant I caught his thought the filaments of light seemed to consume all my energy. Fatigue overwhelmed me. It erased my vision and plunged me into darkness.\n\nWhen I became aware of myself again, there was something so familiar around me, although I could not tell what it was, that I believed myself to be back in a normal state of awareness. Don Juan was asleep beside me, his shoulder against mine.\n\nThen I realized that the darkness around us was so intense that I could not even see my hands. I speculated that fog must have covered the ledge and filled the cave; or perhaps it was the wispy low clouds that descended every rainy night from the higher mountains like a silent avalanche.\n\nYet in spite of the total blackness, somehow I saw that don Juan had opened his eyes immediately after I became aware, although he did not look at me. Instantly I realized that seeing him was not a consequence of light on my retina. It was, rather, a bodily sense.\n\nI became so engrossed in observing don Juan without my eyes that I was not paying attention to what he was telling me. Finally he stopped talking and turned his face to me as if to look me in the eye.\n\nHe coughed a couple of times to clear his throat and started to talk in a very low voice. He said that his benefactor used to come to the cave quite often, both with him and with his other disciples, but more often by himself. In that cave his benefactor saw the same prairie we had just seen; a vision that gave him the idea of describing the spirit as the flow of things.\n\nDon Juan repeated that his benefactor was not a good thinker. Had he been, he would have realized in an instant that what he had seen and described as the flow of things was intent; the force that permeates everything. Don Juan added that if his benefactor ever became aware of the nature of his seeing, he didn't reveal it. Don Juan had the idea that his benefactor never knew it. Instead, his benefactor believed that he had seen the flow of things, which was the absolute truth, but not the way he meant it.\n\nDon Juan was so emphatic about this that I wanted to ask him what the difference was, but I could not speak. My throat seemed frozen. We sat there in complete silence and immobility for hours, yet I did not experience any discomfort: my muscles did not get tired, my legs did not fall asleep, my back did not ache.\n\nWhen don Juan began to talk again, I did not even notice the transition, and I readily abandoned myself to listening to his voice. It was a melodic, rhythmical sound that emerged from the total blackness that surrounded me.\n\nHe said that at that very moment I was not in my normal state of awareness nor was I in heightened awareness. I was suspended in a lull, in the blackness of nonperception. My assemblage point had moved away from perceiving the daily world, but it had not moved enough to reach and light a totally new bundle of energy fields. Properly speaking, I was caught between two perceptual possibilities. This in-between state, this lull of perception had been reached through the influence of the cave which was itself guided by the intent of the sorcerers who carved it.\n\nDon Juan asked me to pay close attention to what he was going to say next. He said that thousands of years ago, by means of seeing, sorcerers became aware that the earth was sentient and that its awareness could affect the awareness of humans. They tried to find a way to use the earth's influence on human awareness and they discovered that certain caves were most effective.\n\nDon Juan said that the search for caves became nearly full-time work for those sorcerers; and that through their endeavors they were able to discover a variety of uses for a variety of cave configurations. He added that out of all that work the only result pertinent to us was this particular cave and its capacity to move the assemblage point until it reached a lull of perception.\n\nAs don Juan spoke, I had the unsettling sensation that something was clearing in my mind. Something was funneling my awareness into a long narrow channel. All the superfluous \\[\\* superfluous- serving no useful purpose\\] half-thoughts and feelings of my normal awareness were being squeezed out.\n\nDon Juan was thoroughly aware of what was happening to me. I heard his soft chuckle of satisfaction. He said that now we could talk more easily and our conversation would have more depth.\n\nI remembered at that moment scores of things he had explained to me before. For instance, I knew that I was dreaming. I was actually sound asleep yet I was totally aware of myself through my second attention- the counterpart of my normal attentiveness.\n\nI was certain I was asleep because of a bodily sensation plus a rational deduction based on statements that don Juan had made in the past. I had just seen the Eagle's emanations, and don Juan had said that it was impossible for sorcerers to have a sustained view of the Eagle's emanations in any way except in dreaming, therefore I had to be dreaming.\n\nDon Juan had explained that the universe is made up of energy fields which defy description or scrutiny. He had said that they resembled filaments of ordinary light, except that light is lifeless compared to the Eagle's emanations, which exude awareness.\n\nI had never, until this night, been able to see them in a sustained manner, and indeed they were made out of a light that was alive. Don Juan had maintained in the past that my knowledge and control of intent were not adequate to withstand the impact of that sight. He had explained that normal perception occurs when intent, which is pure energy, lights up a portion of the luminous filaments inside our cocoon, and at the same time brightens a long extension of the same luminous filaments extending into infinity outside our cocoon.\n\nExtraordinary perception, 'seeing', occurs when by the force of intent a different cluster of energy fields energizes and lights up. He had said that when a crucial number of energy fields are lit up inside the luminous cocoon, a sorcerer is able to see the energy fields themselves.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Flux of Things", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ohrwak", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1625954556.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily taught me to look at the &amp;quot;flux&amp;quot; of the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think the IOBs have the pocket edition of the books of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have no pockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if they come up with a word like &amp;quot;flux&amp;quot;, it came from you.

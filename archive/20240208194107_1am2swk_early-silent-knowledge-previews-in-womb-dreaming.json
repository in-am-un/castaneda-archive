Those were our \"lineage's\" favorites it seems.\n\nAnd for whatever unfathomable reason, they liked to have sex in shapeshifted form.\n\nI mean, did you ever look at a crow and think \"That crow is kinda hot!!!\"?\n\nKeep in mind, that's your double. As a crow. Having sex, with another person's double.  Which also turned into a crow.\n\nBlame Taisha Abelar for that one. Or don Juan.\n\nThe best I can understand is that they do that sort of thing, to make sure you don't have a \"real life\" back home, the one in which you have lovers, which seems more attractive than the bizarre world of being a sorcerer. \n\nBy having sex in that impossible sorcery realm, they weaken the bond to the \"real world\".\n\nWomen seem to fall prey to that bond more easily than the men, or at least that's what I've observed so far. They used to sneak around figuring out where to get sex without being caught, back in the Castaneda private class days.\n\nThe men surely also, but I wasn't as keen on observing their behavior.\n\nAs for your double being \"lost in infinity\", that's an illusion created by how the emanations work.\n\nTime, space, and physical matter don't actually exist at all.\n\nThey're side effects of what does.  Which is fairly the same as advanced physics says.\n\nOur reality is a side effect of very consistent behavior among the bits and pieces of \"something else\". Something perhaps, eternal and unchangeable.\n\nAnd so in many ways, we're all lost in a video game. Having become so obsessed with it that we forgot that's not our real self in here.\n\n\"Space\" is one of the side effects of that delusion.\n\nSo actually your \"double\", which is the same as your \"energy body\" is trapped in an egg with you.  A shell created to hold the awareness we were given.\n\nIt's visible, so please keep in mind, nothing I say here is theoretical.\n\nNone comes from \"Saint Bob's\" sacred scroll handed down from the high Llamas on the mountains of Tibet.\n\nWhere, by the way, there's no real magic.  Just con artists who like the company of men better than that of women. With an occasional rapist Rinpoche mixed in.\n\nWhat I'm explaining here is just direct observations of how reality actually works. Including the Rinpoche bit.\n\nOur awareness, place into a container to give us a \"life\",  split into half.

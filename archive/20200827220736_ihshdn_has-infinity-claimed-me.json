My skin crawls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole thing about IOBs being bad is in fact in the books. Carlos banned me, so I forgot all the details, and then people got those quotes out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I have to admit, the books do give that impression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually kind of odd if you think about it. The training of Carlos, outside &amp;quot;heightened awareness&amp;quot; was pretty much all IOB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But people don&amp;#39;t think clearly about the earlier books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then in the later books,  don Juan warns that the IOBs scared even him, and like to kidnap people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s all people focus on, because in fact they have no actual sorcery abilities, and thinking is all they can do to soothe themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t notice that don  Juan said, they can&amp;#39;t touch you, if you learn to move your energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you have to learn to move your energy body anyway!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to me, it&amp;#39;s like the fliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cure for the fliers is internal silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have internal silence, they don&amp;#39;t like your taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, we have young people come here to private chat, completely upset because they believe the fliers are making them masturbate, or whatever fear they have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry about IOBs luring you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should be so lucky!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just learn to gaze at colors in darkness until you do something &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot;, which means, your dreaming double is helping you out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, I believe you can fight back against any possible kidnappings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy, my new IOB, is a kidnapper. I suppose because it&amp;#39;s so empty in her realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But so far to no avail.  She can move my dreaming double, but it&amp;#39;s so thoroughly connected to my tonal, she can&amp;#39;t keep it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ihshdn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ihshdn/has_infinity_claimed_me/g359cir/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1598630268.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1598630268.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g33o8d6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g327fy8", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ihshdn/has_infinity_claimed_me/g33o8d6/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_g33o8d6", "created": 1598587974.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1598587974.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g327fy8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1598559738.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ihshdn", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt; Could it be an ally or an inorganic being?  \n\nIf you play with it a lot, it will become one.\n\nAs for right now, not enough information to say.\n\nThey do like to hook us to self-sustaining images, if they can get away with it.\n\nMy new IOB, Fancy, likes to do that.\n\nShe seems to live in an ice cave, instead of a dirt one.\n\nSo far I've only seen her and Bob there.

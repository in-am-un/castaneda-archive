The thing is I kind of get used to it...I do not know the cause actually but it seems that for me any not-doing becomes doing the more I use it and I&amp;#39;m out of ideas what to try to shift myself as anything that works initially eventually stops ... and I do not know how to solve it.\nIn the past I used to gaze at water (dam,lake,sea) too - this had the biggest shifts for me- coupled with sunlight I used to try to find patterns that change very fast...it is hard to describe but I&amp;#39;m sure you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of assumed that you just \ntry to not-doing and the magic happens and this is the case for me when it is something new and later its power degrades..  I guess that I desire too much to shift and it becomes like a doing for the shift and this breaks it ... I do not know... trying to not desire the shift when doing it does not help, trying to not self-reflect or to be ruthless while gazing does not help too..always trying to do it without internal dialogue...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_f6iv8a", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/f6iv8a/leaf_gazing_and_stopping_the_world/ih7qo6g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658510874.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ih3zkl0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ih3qkp9", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's normal to hit blocks like that.\n\nI worry a tiny bit when you say gazing.

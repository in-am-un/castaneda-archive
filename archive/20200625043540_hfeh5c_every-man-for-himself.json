I didn&amp;#39;t get whether he meant that to be somewhere in the middle, where your assemblage point had indeed moved, but not far enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then stomach only breathing, which means, you&amp;#39;ve arrived!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t really need that to know, you&amp;#39;ll be surrounded by visible energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that you can get used to that, and having the breath for confirmation is a good tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure the two women had no clue what he was talking about, even if they succeeded. It has to remain somewhat towards the end of the curve, to even remember it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So poor Carlos would explain something wonderful to us in class, such as that the 2 new women had completed the J curve, and even the women he was talking about thought he was making it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that awful?!

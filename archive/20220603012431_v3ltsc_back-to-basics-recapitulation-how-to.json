[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "Hello Everyone!\n\nThe [beginner materials](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/introduction) have become a bit buried, and not everyone is terribly familiar with [the books](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/booklist) and the [terminology](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/terminology), so in the vein of regularly getting [beginner-relevant posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/introduction-practices) out, here's my best shot at [the Recapitulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/recapitulation).\n\nFirst, I can only state that subjectively the recapitulation is a magical experience. I personally have found that practicing it regularly radically altered my life in a positive way. However, getting started was tough. It felt impossible, so I gave up before I ever got started. My internal dialog invented many excuses not to do it: \"where am I gonna get a crate, and isn't that crazy person behavior, getting in a meditation crate!?\" \"how the hell can you ever get the time to recapitulate enough of your life to make a dent?\" \"This list thing seems impossible, no way you can ever finish!\" \"I can't remember which direction to turn for the in breath and the out breath, and I'm too lazy to find the passages in the books (before I had them in a searchable form on the PC)\" \"There's no way I can find the hours to do this\"\n\nThat was all complete bullshit.\n\nIncredibly stupid bullshit, because I was incredibly depressed when I first read about it and recognized that if I ever wanted that to change I had to practice the recapitulation to reduce my clinging and emotional attachments that were the basis of my depression and yet, I never even attempted until 20+ years later.\n\nThankfully I recently found out, after 20+ years of bullshitting myself, that all of those excuses were irrelevant and I'm sharing with you so you all know that you don't have to wait that long! The crate is optional, but enhances the effects, by impinging on the boundaries of energy body. Heck, you can do it in public, using the \"stealth mode\" of keeping your eyes open, and barely turning the head (while still having the head turning synchronized the the breath). The list is optional, but enhances the practice as a mnemonic device, to help you remember more memories. The exact order of the recap is not that important, especially at the beginning, because you can use intrusive memories at any time they arise in your attention. However, the most recent events are easiest to fully remember. Like that guy that just cut you off in traffic. Recap that as soon as you are stopped and, again, your eyes can be open. The direction of the head turn on the in and out breaths doesn't really matter, as long as the breath and head rotation are linked. I gained immediate benefits of slightly more detachment to emotional concerns and no longer spiraling emotionally out of control as easily, with not having all that much time in a day, so actually that's enough of a reason to do it without worrying about the practical considerations of how you ever get done. Who cares? It literally makes life better!\n\nI also discovered that, for myself, the recapitulation in the [dark room](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ifu1bv/darkroom_practice/) with my eyes open, made me silent enough to see the purple-pink puffs (tiny clouds) much faster than any other method I've tried, so I often begin my sessions of waking-dreaming with a few minutes of the recapitulation.\n\nOne reason I'm posting is because I have been repeatedly reminded recently that at first, one of the internal dialogs I had to overcome is \"that's too much to do at once, dude!\" I made it easier on myself, by simply doing the fanning breath continuously before really trying to bring up the memory, because I could get in a breathing rhythm that allowed me to focus more on the memory, and the feelings I felt, and the feelings the other felt. There's no way to know if that will help you if you are struggling to start recapitulation, but if you simply keep at it, you really can get to the point being able to breathe, turn the head, review the memory in as much sensory detail as possible (not just visual), breathe in your own emotions, breathe out the other persons emotions. Even if it seems like you are fumbling, the continuous effort will pay off because the intent is what counts. I also cannot speak highly enough of combining dark room and recapitulation. As is the case with all the practices, they mutually reinforce each other very effectively and we need every trick.\n\nOne of the most recent things Carlos wrote on the topic is from his book ***Magical Passes*** in the section on the five concerns, which includes the recapitulation in it's own section.\n\nFrom [Magical Passes](http://www.uazone.org/naph/ccarlos/books/cc10/tensegrity62.html) \\-\n\n&gt;The actual recapitulation of the event requires that one breathe deeply, fanning the head (*rotating the head without dipping or raising the nose*), so to speak, very slowly and gently from side to side, beginning on one side, ***left or right, whichever***. This ***fanning of the head was done as many times as needed, while remembering all the details accessible***. Don Juan said that sorcerers talked about this act as ***breathing in all of one's own feelings spent in the event being recollected***, and ***expelling all the unwanted moods and extraneous feelings that were left with us*** (by breathing out).  \n&gt;  \n\n&gt;Sorcerers believe that the mystery of the recapitulation lies in the act of inhaling and exhaling. Since breathing is a life-sustaining function, sorcerers are certain that by means of it, one can also deliver to the dark sea of awareness the facsimile of one's life experiences. When I pressed don Juan for a rational explanation of this idea, his position was that things like the recapitulation could only be experienced, not explained. He said that in the act of doing, one can find liberation, and that to explain it was to dissipate our energy in fruitless efforts. His invitation was congruous with everything related to his knowledge: the invitation to take action.  \n&gt;  \n\n&gt;***The list of names is used in the recapitulation as a mnemonic device*** that propels memory into an inconceivable journey. Sorcerers' position in this respect is that ***remembering events that have just taken place prepares the ground for remembering events more distant in time with the same clarity and immediacy. To recollect experiences in this way is to relive them, and to draw from this recollection an extraordinary impetus that is capable of stirring energy dispersed from our centers of vitality, and returning it to them***. Sorcerers refer to this redeployment of energy that the recapitulation causes as gaining fluidity after giving the dark sea of awareness what it is looking for.  \n&gt;  \n\n&gt;On a more mundane level, the recapitulation ***gives practitioners the capacity to examine the repetition in their lives.*** Recapitulating can convince them, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that all of us are at the mercy of forces which ultimately make no sense, although at first sight they seem perfectly reasonable; such as being at the mercy of courtship. It seems that for some people, courtship is the pursuit of a lifetime. I have personally heard from people of advanced age that the only ideal that they had was to find a perfect companion, and that their aspiration was to have perhaps one year of happiness in love.  \n&gt;  \n\n&gt;Don Juan Matus used to say to me, over my vehement protests, that the problem was that nobody really wanted to love anybody, but that every one of us wanted to be loved. He said that this obsession with courtship, taken at face value, was the most natural thing in the world to us. To hear a seventy-five-year-old man or woman say that they are still in search of a perfect companion is an affirmation of something idealistic, romantic, beautiful. However, to examine this obsession in the context of the endless repetitions of a lifetime makes it appear as it really is: something grotesque.  \n&gt;  \n\n&gt;Don Juan assured me that if any behavioral change is going to be accomplished, it has to be done through the *recapitulation,* since it is the only vehicle that can enhance awareness by liberating one from the unvoiced demands of socialization, which are so automatic, so taken for granted, that they are not even noticed under normal conditions, much less examined.  \n&gt;  \n\n&gt;The actual act of *recapitulating is* a lifetime endeavor. It takes years to exhaust the list of people, especially for those who have made the acquaintance of and have interacted with thousands of individuals. This list is augmented by the memory of impersonal events in which no people are involved, but which have to be examined because they are somehow related to the person being *recapitulated.*  \n&gt;  \n\n&gt;Don Juan asserted that what the sorcerers of ancient Mexico sought avidly in *recapitulating* was the memory of interaction, because ***in interaction lie the deep effects of socialization, which they struggled to overcome by any means available.***\n\nFurther down, Carlos clues us in that the recapitulation is a natural partner to awake-dreaming (dark room).\n\n&gt;The *recapitulation* affects something that don Juan called the *energy body.* He formally explained the *energy body* as a conglomerate of energy fields that are the mirror image of the energy fields that make up the human body when it is *seen* directly as energy. He said that in the case of sorcerers, the physical body and the *energy body* are one single unit. The magical passes for the *recapitulation* bring the *energy body* to the physical body, which are essential for navigating into the unknown.\n\nIf you read even further down, you'll notice that both [the series of passes for the recaptulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLToi43ucG4) and the series of passes in [\"Affection for the Energy Body\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqFb7kmvFs) involve constructing the energy body, so it really takes no imagination to see that recap and dark room are complementary and both belong on your daily schedule for as much time as you can possibly go for each day.\n\nEdit - I understand this is often a practice folks can find tedious, but when you do it in dark room with your eyes open, it's 100% entertainment!! If you really want it to get entertaining, Dan recommends doing 3+ hours sessions. Longest I've done was close to two hours, but it was a blast! Plus, afterwards, that measure of detachment is truly amazing even after a short session.\n\nI trust your personal power!\n\nGood-bye", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Back to Basics - Recapitulation How-To", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_v3ltsc", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 44, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1660712596.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1654212271.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/introduction\"&gt;beginner materials&lt;/a&gt; have become a bit buried, and not everyone is terribly familiar with &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/booklist\"&gt;the books&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/terminology\"&gt;terminology&lt;/a&gt;, so in the vein of regularly getting &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/introduction-practices\"&gt;beginner-relevant posts&lt;/a&gt; out, here&amp;#39;s my best shot at &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/recapitulation\"&gt;the Recapitulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I can only state that subjectively the recapitulation is a magical experience.

It just won't let things go!\n\nAnd yes, sometimes it's very horrible but still it doesn't do you any good to keep thinking about it.\n\nIt's like you're telling a magical being next to you, \"Yea, show me that time I got beaten up again\".\n\nOr, \"I'm tired of watching violence, show me the first kiss.\"\n\nExcept you have 100 things in your mind at the same time.\n\nYou CAN'T go very far into other realities, until you loosen those ropes tying you to past memories.  Understand that a memory in this reality, makes absolutely no sense in another.  So to even think about them, you have to keep some of your attention on this realm.\n\nRecap helps you to loosen those.\n\nIf you can just get your assemblage point down the back and up the front, it no longer matters if you did a good job on recap.\n\nOr at least, Zuleica our favorite crazy witch said so.  I suspect Cholita is a little jealous of her.\n\nAnd don't worry about the details, just DO IT.\n\nYou can complain later, and someone can answer any issue or doubt you have.\n\nSo when done VISIBLY, you can see the threads of glowing yellow, white, and an occasional \"hot\" one like orange or red flowing from your midsection.\n\nIt's VISIBLE!!!\n\nYou inhale back the fibers you stuck in someone else, or something else, and exhale out the foreign ones.\n\nIt's like you're Gulliver, on the island of the tiny people.  They weren't strong enough to hold him down on the beach, but they tied their tiny threads and pegged them to the sand,  until the hundreds of little ropes were able to hold him down.\n\nUntil he woke up and got angry.\n\nSo wake up and get angry!\n\nNow what can you do after you've gotten those tiny ropes loosened?\n\n**Anything**.\n\nLet's say you do recap open eyed in darkness.\n\nNot mandatory, but very amusing later on.  Do it following instructions at first, don't change it. But later on, who can complain if your eyes are open?\n\nThe witches recap any memory \"on the spot\", and I doubt they close their eyes each time.\n\nWith eyes open in absolute darkness, you can see the little threads for real!\n\nAnd then for the sake of a good story let's say, you get curious and you try the \"claw hand\" movement. Where you shape your hand like you were reaching straight forward and cupped your fingers around a doorknob.\n\nYou move that in the air, forward at the top in line with your face, then around and down to your stomach while it moves back.  It makes a circle like you were turning some kind of crank gear on a machine.\n\nDon Juan said that's how you find \"the lines in the hand\".\n\nBut he also said you could \"scoop things\" out of the air, or \"push out unwanted feelings\".\n\nOnce you can do \"visible recap\", your eyes can focus on that level of the second attention, and the claw hand becomes visible too!\n\nAnd it's everything don Juan said.\n\nLast night I did it, and for the first time I \"scooped something\" out of the air.\n\nI never emphasized that.  I just like to rotate my palm so I can look at it at the top of the movement to see the \"lines in the hands\".\n\nYES!!!  Those are absolutely there.\n\nFully visible too!\n\nImagine those are like, \"the revenge of the stuck emanations\".\n\nYou aren't trying to suck them back.\n\nNow \"it's personal\"!\n\nAnd you want to claw reality with those \"lines in the hand\".\n\nIn some ways, it's another form of recap!  Think about it.  You \"expel\" unwanted stuff, and you can scoop unknown stuff into your hand so you can hold it.\n\nI saw the air getting thick with \"fuzz\".  Closer to tiny white line segments, but there was so many that the air simply got \"fuzzy\".\n\nA pink tint once in a while?\n\nI hooked something!\n\nIt was a \"dream bubble\", but ragged.  Not smooth, not well contained.\n\nIt was almost as if my claw had \"scraped\" the flat surface of another reality, and collected a \"glob of dreaming\".\n\nStill with \"claw marks\" on the edges.\n\nNow keep in mind, when you can do things like that it's only a tiny surprise.\n\nYou're looking at magic that beats Harry Potter's British ass.\n\nWhich by the way, you can see if you like.  He made a movie after he made the fun ones.\n\nWhy he had to be naked, I have no idea.\n\nDon't care?  \n\nSame for what you will see using the claw  hand.  By the time you can see that sight, you don't care.\n\nIt's only \"sort of interesting...\"  Like Harry Potter's naked butt.  Man that guy is white!\n\nI kept moving my hand with the dream blob attached, and when it moved forward I fell  to the side. \n\nI literally toppled over from my cross legged position on pillows, fell left and down, landing  smack dab in the middle of the dream I had been olding.\n\nGone.\n\nBlanked out, but inside another world.\n\nGood reason to center those pillows on which you sit, on the bed.  You can in fact \"topple over\". Don't want to do that on the edge of the bed!\n\nI'm going to have to try to track down that story in the books. Carlos scooped up something bad, and don Juan told him not to do that anymore until he was more mature.\n\nI misunderstood that story, thinking you claw a rattlesnake out of the air, or some evil IOB.\n\nI never thought you could claw a \"reality blob\", and fall into it!\n\nSo put down your Buddha meditation beads please...  \n\nAre you serious????  \n\nCan't you see that bastard is only farting, and that's why he smiles blissfully while he meditates? He's probably thinking that the monks have to smell his farts, and won't dare to complain.  \n\nvery single one of them is hoping for their own \"franchise\".\n\nAnd please.... \n\nStop polishing your \"Daoist magic wand\".  \n\nYou can wave that over your husband's genitals as much as you like, and his \"chi\" will not be restored.\n\nGet him some viagra...\n\nIt's enough with the pretending!\n\nAren't you sick of that yet?\n\nMagic should be REAL.\n\nIN YOUR FACE!!!\n\nNot \"ephemeral\" or \"subtle\".\n\nAs long as we're using movie analogies, we've all fallen asleep from the poppies, on the way to the Emerald Palace.\n\nNo one ever makes it.  They just doze off and dream of the magic in the city.\n\nThe fliers...  ?", "edited": 1654268887.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ib1itvy", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey!!!

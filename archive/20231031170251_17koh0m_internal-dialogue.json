With a brief few seconds of confusion going either direction.\n\nNow comes the advanced stage of removing the internal dialogue.\n\nFind \"the abstract\".\n\nLearn to perceive that as a flow of events or \"activity\", or as visible manifestations of time and space which make no sense, permeating all the magic you see during darkroom.\n\nBut you'll have to be playing with intense magic by then, in order to do that.\n\nNone of this is anything you can force by visualizing or pretending it will happen.\n\nAs an example, you look right and can see through the wall, into the other rooms of your home. Once you get into the deep orange zone.\n\nAnd perhaps if you look left, you see a dream inside a purple blob of light, and can even \"enter\" into that dream.\n\n\"The Abstract\" is visible across that entire range.  From the other rooms in your home, seen as pink smoke and blobs past several walls, to the clear full color dream bubble in the air, and even into the inside of that dream, in another world.\n\nThe abstract flows through all of that and is in fact always visible. We just learned to ignore it.\n\nIt's like music playing in the background, if there's anything at all you can say is \"like the abstract\".\n\nIt connects all of the events in darkroom, because it's beyond being separate or part of, anything else.\n\nIt's an irrational and rejected flow of perceptions, about which it's impossible to think.\n\nYou can only experience it.\n\nSo an \"advanced\" stage of shutting off the internal dialogue is to focus your awareness on the abstract, making more internal dialogue impossible.\n\nYou just have to \"look over there\", and you are absolutely silent.\n\nThat will give you entry to continuous dreaming realms, surrounding you.\n\nInto which you can go, regardless of the walls of your practice room.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k793cfa", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping to make an animation on this topic eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, you&amp;#39;re too vague here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gives me the impression you actually can&amp;#39;t do that, but have convinced yourself you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stop the internal dialogue for real, the world itself stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not something you can miss!

Tensegrity lures it to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next step, remove your internal dialogue long enough to get the assemblage point to move, and keep trying to move it further and further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get more and more astonishing magic all around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll pass through the J curve.  And can match what you see to the pictures here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg%3Fwidth%3D3592%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg%3Fwidth%3D3592%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while doing this, figure out how often you &amp;quot;mess up&amp;quot; and it returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to see what causes that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What causes you to be able to silence your dialogue long enough for the assemblage point to move, but then you mess up and go back to words again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it fantasies in the mind?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are possible without the words to go with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You MUST remove those also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any such thing is a command to your assemblage point to move where that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next step, keep it up until you move into the Phantom realms of the orange region, where the double becomes visible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the bottom of the railroad tracks in that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then using silence, switch back and forth between your double &amp;quot;over there&amp;quot;, and your physical body over here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should literally teleport each time.  With a brief few seconds of confusion going either direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now comes the advanced stage of removing the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn to perceive that as a flow of events or &amp;quot;activity&amp;quot;, or as visible manifestations of time and space which make no sense, permeating all the magic you see during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll have to be playing with intense magic by then, in order to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this is anything you can force by visualizing or pretending it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example, you look right and can see through the wall, into the other rooms of your home. Once you get into the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And perhaps if you look left, you see a dream inside a purple blob of light, and can even &amp;quot;enter&amp;quot; into that dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Abstract&amp;quot; is visible across that entire range.  From the other rooms in your home, seen as pink smoke and blobs past several walls, to the clear full color dream bubble in the air, and even into the inside of that dream, in another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract flows through all of that and is in fact always visible. We just learned to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like music playing in the background, if there&amp;#39;s anything at all you can say is &amp;quot;like the abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It connects all of the events in darkroom, because it&amp;#39;s beyond being separate or part of, anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an irrational and rejected flow of perceptions, about which it&amp;#39;s impossible to think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can only experience it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So an &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; stage of shutting off the internal dialogue is to focus your awareness on the abstract, making more internal dialogue impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to &amp;quot;look over there&amp;quot;, and you are absolutely silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That will give you entry to continuous dreaming realms, surrounding you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into which you can go, regardless of the walls of your practice room.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17koh0m/internal_dialogue/k793cfa/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1698771951.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_17koh0m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 28}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k78ubq5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "NightComprehensive52", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1698768605.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_17koh0m", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_7zxv6xqs", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's normal for there to be an intense struggle to keep the internal dialog silent.

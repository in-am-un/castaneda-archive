The word combination doesn't seem to be there.\n\nFor beginners, let me explain that a bit more.\n\nThere's NOTHING in existence but the emanations, and awareness that can flow into them.\n\nAt least, not as far as sorcerers know.\n\n\"Causality\", the belief in unchanging laws of physics, gives rise to the belief that matter, or time, or space, are fundamental qualities of something that actually exists.\n\nBut if you read the forward to the last books of Carlos, he stated that causality is an illusion created by always keeping our assemblage points over our left shoulder blade.\n\nWith the whole planet keeping their assemblage points in the same spot, our reality is like a \"Mega-God\".\n\nMeaning, it's still a phantom creation for the most part, but there's so much awareness focused on the emanations which create it, that it's nearly inescapable.\n\nAs beginners will testify before they manage to move their assemblage points and see the puffs of their double.\n\nSo if causality is an illusion, and moving the assemblage point produces new \"laws\" and a new reality, then we can start to understand why even time and space are just a feature of the emanations.\n\nFor example, you're doing darkroom practice and succeed in reaching the red zone.  The \"shift below\".\n\nWhere the purple puffs swirl in jetblackness, with all sort of weird stuff appearing and disappearing.\n\nThere you can even pick up the puffs with your hands and change them into something real.\n\nA clown car there in your darkroom.\n\nA freeway overpass stretching hundreds of feet above you.\n\nA covering of moss on the floor.\n\nWater flowing like a stream with your feet 1 foot deep in it.\n\nAs vivid as if you were in sunlight at times.\n\nSo down in the red zone where just about anything becomes possible you can stop your tensegrity, sit up on the bed on pillows, and just gaze straight forwards looking for interesting things.\n\nIn that state you are summoning intent, to show you something.  A place perhaps.\n\nAnd once in a while doing that, a portal will open on the wall. A door, a crack big enough to slip through, a window with a nice breeze blowing into your dark room.\n\nYou can literally stand up and go inside there.  For hours if you like.\n\nYou end up in a 100% real looking alternate reality.  And it's not a dream.  You physically walked in there, and you have perfect lucidity as if you were awake.\n\nFor hours!\n\nIt's not at all \"lucid dreaming\" where you have to fight to stay aware.\n\nIt's as real as where you came from.\n\nExcept you're in another location in time and space.\n\nA worried beginner at this point will start to question if this is real or not.\n\nHey!\n\nWho the hell cares?\n\nNo one can do that!\n\nIsn't that good enough for you?\n\nEven Yogis sit there like old men with their eyes closed, \"visualizing\" everything.\n\nThey don't physically walk through a magical window that materializes on their wall!\n\nBut as for \"is it real\"?\n\nThere's the problem.\n\nOnce you say \"real\" you are automatically referring to the blue line on the J curve.\n\nIs it good for anything up there on that blue line?\n\nCan you rob banks for example, and then escape through a magical window?\n\nCan you lord it over your buddies with magic tricks?\n\nNo.\n\nIt's not real like that, because those parameters are impossible.\n\nIt's not this reality!\n\nYou can't force others (mostly) to perceive alternate realities.\n\nAnd at some point you just have to give up on that concern, over what kind of profit you can extract from sorcery.\n\nI'm going somewhere with this, but I had to lay the groundwork.\n\nSo the question arises, how does \"sunlight glitter work\"?\n\nIt definitely works!  I wouldn't go without it.\n\nAnd on days where the inorganic beings that visit me are mostly transparent, and not very interactive, I can often point to a lack of enough sunlight glitter that day.\n\nSo how does that work?\n\nI can theorize with the best of them!  How about, the sunlight glitter is very fine lines of intense light, so when they pass through the neural net,they light up very new pathways, or seldom used pathways, in the brain little tubes that carry signals around.  And with a very \"bright\" signal flowing through them.\n\nThose stretch a bit \"fatter\" and it becomes easier for signals to travel down those.\n\nYou've produced a physical modification to the visual portions of the neural net.\n\nTrue?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nAnd it misses the point.\n\nNothing in sorcery needs to have a \"reason\" for working.\n\nIt can work, because it always worked.\n\nEven if it's insane.\n\nWe call that not-doing.\n\nThere's a famous case in the books where a red rag gets stuck on a branch sticking up from the ground, and from a distance Carlos can't figure out what it is.  The wind is making it \"shiver\", and Carlos begins to worry it might be a wounded animal.\n\nDon Juan wants him to just watch it, because he can see that it's moving the assemblage point of Carlos.\n\nKeep in mind, at that point Carlos had done a LOT of \"the right way of walking\", and other activities designed to reduce the internal dialogue. And also don Juan had been teaching him secretly with the Nagual's blow.\n\nSo don't go running around the mountains pretending your sorcery.\n\nThere's preparations before a rag on a stick can turn into an alternate reality!\n\nBut Carlos didn't yet understand rule #1 of darkroom:\n\nIf you look at anything that can't possibly be there, in silence, the assemblage point moves down along the J curve.\n\nThen rule #2:  If you watch something impossible in silence and begin to feel that it's real, or you even \"treat it as real\" by perhaps manipulating it with your hands, the assemblage point moves sideways to make it more real.\n\nYou go off into dreaming realms, at that level of the assemblage point.\n\nAll this happens because we were designed to get trapped in a single reality.  By the Eagle itself, who wants us to explore things in detail.\n\nRule #1 is the control to select a range of emanations in depth, and rule #2 is the fine tuning, to make the new reality clear and usable.\n\nBut Carlos didn't understand not-doing at the time.  That is, finding something \"impossible\" in the real world and then gazing at it, or playing with it, to activate rule #1 and rule #2 of darkroom.\n\nIf he had simply sat and watched the rag he might have assembled another world, where it was in fact a wounded coyote.\n\nLittle Smoke does coyotes.  So if he managed to shift his assemblage point into waking dreaming, you can be sure his ally could take that rag over, and make it actually be alive.\n\nThere was no cause and effect there.  No actual animal.\n\nJust a movement of the assemblage point, and perhaps a mischievous spirit in the case of little smoke taking it over.\n\nNow, here's the part about how sunlight glitter works.\n\nIf the old seers went to that very mountain and repeatedly put a stick in the ground with a red ochre died cotton cloth hanging on it, to gaze at it in the wind, that would leave an \"imprint\" in the emanations.\n\nCarlos accidentally stumbled on that situation. On a perfect \"not-doing\" to gaze at.\n\nBut anyone could see the rag turn into a wounded animal, if the old seers had done that over and over again on that very mountain.\n\nThey would have energized the collection of those emanations needed to produce that sight, so that awareness flowed into those more easily than into other things.\n\nA non-sorcerer there would merely need to doze off for an instant, or wake up on a camping trip, sit up and gaze that direction with their assemblage point still moved slightly off its normal position as a result of having been asleep.\n\nAnd they could end up seeing the rag turn into a wounded animal.\n\nGod himself is that same effect. So many pray to God that there's a large bundle of those emanations, which are easily energized with awareness if someone manages to focus in that direction.\n\nAnd so why does \"sunlight glitter\" work?\n\nMaybe because the old seers decided it works.\n\nMaybe it doesn't work at all, for any \"reason\".\n\nMaybe only because they made it work.\n\nThe Tensegrity contains that kind of magic.\n\nI suppose you could call it, \"As it was in the past, so will it be in the future.\"\n\nOr, it could be something else.\n\nWe don't know. It just works.\n\nSo what is \"effect before cause\"?\n\nEffect before cause can happen when that tendency of the emanations to accept awareness more easily in some groupings, skips to the happy ending.\n\nThe result comes, before any effort was done to light up that collection of emanations.\n\nThe \"result\" of focusing on that sight is perceived before the steps, to energize the emanations.\n\nIt doesn't sound satisfying, I know.\n\nBut if you realize there's only the emanations and awareness flowing into them,  then \"effect\" is just a finished, \"skimmed\" copy of reality.\n\nThe fine tuned version, caused by \"treating it as real\".\n\nA horizontal shift.\n\nThe \"cause\" would be the steps leading to that finished effect.\n\nBut if the finished effect is very well \"energized\", it can pop out before what we consider to be the \"cause\".\n\nRituals do that.  The ritual stores the intent of the result.\n\nThe ritual is the \"cause\".\n\nFor instance, you learn to form a dirt road down the middle of your darkroom, and then jump up onto it and walk along.\n\nYou can do that!  For real.\n\nThe process to \"cause\" that is a long one. A ritual taking at least 1 hour.\n\nBut once you have done it a bunch of times, you can skip the \"cause\" and go to the effect.\n\nJust wave your palm parallel to the ground and say, \"dirt road!\"\n\nAnd it appears.\n\nEffect before cause.\n\nAt least, with nothing written in any notes I can find, that's one way to look at it.\n\nBut while looking I found this about \"dead star energy\",  from a lecture by Taisha written up by an audience member.  And so I looked for more on that constellation:\n\n\"Taisha indicated that two areas of dead star energy they were instructed to aim at while performing the Stellar Hatch Pass are in the Constellation\u00a0Corona Borealis, and the rotating binary star that makes up the Eye of the Bull in the Constellation Taurus.\"\n\nAnd then I found:\n\n\"Nury at first seemed rather shy and nervous. She referred to Castaneda and Carol as her father and mother. She also stated that her name, was in don Juan's native tongue (Yaqui?). Her first name, assertedly, was \"Nuli,\" which meant \"permanent.\" Her second (something like \"Alik\"?) and third names, when translated from Yaqui, meant \"blue scout.\" She described herself as \"a very restless being, which is why I am so slender and unable to put on weight.\" She also referred to a solitary energy emanating from a galaxy between Cassiopeia and Corona Borealis that don Juan had indicated had something to do with her origins. She commented on each group of poems and related elements of the poems to the theme of intersubjectivity. In one, Castaneda referred to the devastatingly \"sad hum\" of the Hollywood freeway.\"\n\nAnd:\n\nHe explained that he needed our birthdays and the times we were born to figure out when the constellation Corona Borealis was at its zenith on the day we were born. The old sorcerers had always been guided by that particular constellation. When it was immediately above, they would take action. If they were born a few hours before Corona Borealis was at its zenith, when they had an impulse to do something, they would wait a few hours before taking action.\n\nHe described the constellation as a horseshoe shape, visible from the Northern Hemisphere, and said he would show us a diagram. Castaneda told us that his birthtime was almost a day before Corona Borealis was at the zenith, so he has to wait almost a day, or eight hours, when he has an impulse, and then \"I either do it or I don't.\" But this practice gives him the space to act at the proper time. He told us that Corona Borealis had one dim star that made a triangle with two others. He said it was hard to see in a clear sky in the countryside in Mexico, but that \"in our polluted atmosphere here it is easier to make out.\"\n\nAnd:\n\nCastaneda explained that Corona Borealis was the most important of three constellations that were of interest to sorcerers of their lineage Corona Borealis' importance, he explained, was at least twofold: (1) the time of day you were born relative to when Corona Borealis reached its zenith in the sky that day indicates whether you should take action immediately on an impulse to do something, or whether you need to first wait a certain period of time (determined by the length of time between when you were born and when the constellation reached its zenith on the day of your birth); and (2) \"dreaming\" at times when Corona Borealis is at its zenith in the sky can enable you to \"enter other worlds.\"\n\nI'll stop there.\n\nWe already get to enter into other worlds without that astrology burden!\n\nWhat I found more interesting, was using the Stellar Hatch pass to retrieve energy from a \"dead star\".\n\nThe one I tapped into is anything but dead!\n\nOriginally taught as \"Gift to Maui\", here's an interesting thing about it (the title and the slight variations from \"Stellar Hatch\"):\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOpening a window for abstract energy:\n\nGift to Maui pass. Stand erect, look down between feet, count to 6 while ball of energy forms. Look way down. Eyes attach to ball. Lift head to attach the ball to your chest, lowering it again to look at your chest. Then raise head and look way up so that the ball can rise. Count to 6. Do right karate inside palm edge strike with left arm retracting, then do left. This opens a hatch. Raise right hand too to grab the hatch. rotate left, right, left, right, left, right. Go back to center. This opens the hatch. Pull it down but keep looking up, hands go to side and then let go. Send ball into infinity with gaze, count to 6. Then lower head and look down, opening the hole in the back of the neck. Count to 6 as ball falls and splashes onto neck. Lift and inhale shoulders 3 times. Raise arms and head to close hatch by rotating in the reverse direction from last time. Start right and do the 6 rotations. Bring arms and head down, then raise and lower head to unhook the energy to chest. Stare down for count of 6 to send the ball down into infinity. Hands at side. Fan fingers then do 3 gill breaths by lifting the wrists to parallel to the ground with fingers extended while breathing. But arms stay straight.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd a comment on it:\n\nCastaneda has sent a special movement for this weekend- the Gift to Maui Pass, or Opening a Window for Abstract Energy. It is a complicated series of moves in which we imagine a ball of energy between our feet, affix our gaze to it, and pull it up above our heads. We cut a hatch in the space above our heads and let the ball float up into a black, starry sky, then pull it down onto the back of our necks, flip it onto our chests, and allow it to float down below our feet. Finally, with hands at our sides, we open and close our fingers \"like gills.\"\n\n\"As we do the movements, we accrue silence,\" Kylie tells us. \"Then abstract energy can come in. After enough has accrued-two minutes or two days of silence-the scales tip, and the force of energy opens you like a vacuum, and abstract energy comes in. Who knows where it will take you? Who cares?\" Abstract energy, she says, is energy that is not used for personal endeavors-opinions, thoughts, ideas\u2014but for \"abstract action\": the journey into freedom. Kylie warns us not to combine tensegrity in the same session with other practices, like yoga, because tensegrity is specifically for \"calling on the sorcerer's intent\"- calling back the energy body to make the abstract flight.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Dead Star Energy", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"grqttht78vua1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97a9514b6d285d5e25aaa064d22f706a43f5390"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fa810888de5853aeb4ad97deef672b82a7f4b0a"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9df5349e7dd8d389ef73ab87b6a2bdb6a77b2837"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e12587ce516f3944552a67bf2a95e487b98365e2"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4652d1a5b615b15c5b701ff8fb2126ccb03bc763"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6979b3bbf989d49e1720e59eb3dda76e47110527"}], "s": {"y": 2400, "x": 2400, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=2400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44fc77eff71287d62599ebf693f0270cd8cefd3b"}, "id": "grqttht78vua1"}}, "name": "t3_12rzper", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bysRoYxn-OJJGAErLKscQzvORcZPDERxzwaYdagcTiM.jpg", "edited": 1681921392.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1681919842.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=2400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=44fc77eff71287d62599ebf693f0270cd8cefd3b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/grqttht78vua1.jpg?width=2400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=44fc77eff71287d62599ebf693f0270cd8cefd3b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was looking around for &amp;quot;effect before cause&amp;quot;, something you&amp;#39;ll all start to notice eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t find anything in the collected notes yet.

And also don Juan had been teaching him secretly with the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t go running around the mountains pretending your sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s preparations before a rag on a stick can turn into an alternate reality!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos didn&amp;#39;t yet understand rule #1 of darkroom:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at anything that can&amp;#39;t possibly be there, in silence, the assemblage point moves down along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then rule #2:  If you watch something impossible in silence and begin to feel that it&amp;#39;s real, or you even &amp;quot;treat it as real&amp;quot; by perhaps manipulating it with your hands, the assemblage point moves sideways to make it more real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You go off into dreaming realms, at that level of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this happens because we were designed to get trapped in a single reality.  By the Eagle itself, who wants us to explore things in detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rule #1 is the control to select a range of emanations in depth, and rule #2 is the fine tuning, to make the new reality clear and usable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos didn&amp;#39;t understand not-doing at the time.  That is, finding something &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; in the real world and then gazing at it, or playing with it, to activate rule #1 and rule #2 of darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he had simply sat and watched the rag he might have assembled another world, where it was in fact a wounded coyote.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke does coyotes.  So if he managed to shift his assemblage point into waking dreaming, you can be sure his ally could take that rag over, and make it actually be alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no cause and effect there.  No actual animal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a movement of the assemblage point, and perhaps a mischievous spirit in the case of little smoke taking it over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#39;s the part about how sunlight glitter works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the old seers went to that very mountain and repeatedly put a stick in the ground with a red ochre died cotton cloth hanging on it, to gaze at it in the wind, that would leave an &amp;quot;imprint&amp;quot; in the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos accidentally stumbled on that situation. On a perfect &amp;quot;not-doing&amp;quot; to gaze at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But anyone could see the rag turn into a wounded animal, if the old seers had done that over and over again on that very mountain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They would have energized the collection of those emanations needed to produce that sight, so that awareness flowed into those more easily than into other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A non-sorcerer there would merely need to doze off for an instant, or wake up on a camping trip, sit up and gaze that direction with their assemblage point still moved slightly off its normal position as a result of having been asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they could end up seeing the rag turn into a wounded animal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God himself is that same effect. So many pray to God that there&amp;#39;s a large bundle of those emanations, which are easily energized with awareness if someone manages to focus in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so why does &amp;quot;sunlight glitter&amp;quot; work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe because the old seers decided it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t work at all, for any &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe only because they made it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity contains that kind of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could call it, &amp;quot;As it was in the past, so will it be in the future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, it could be something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know. It just works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is &amp;quot;effect before cause&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Effect before cause can happen when that tendency of the emanations to accept awareness more easily in some groupings, skips to the happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result comes, before any effort was done to light up that collection of emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;result&amp;quot; of focusing on that sight is perceived before the steps, to energize the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t sound satisfying, I know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you realize there&amp;#39;s only the emanations and awareness flowing into them,  then &amp;quot;effect&amp;quot; is just a finished, &amp;quot;skimmed&amp;quot; copy of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fine tuned version, caused by &amp;quot;treating it as real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A horizontal shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; would be the steps leading to that finished effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if the finished effect is very well &amp;quot;energized&amp;quot;, it can pop out before what we consider to be the &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rituals do that.  The ritual stores the intent of the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ritual is the &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, you learn to form a dirt road down the middle of your darkroom, and then jump up onto it and walk along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do that!  For real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The process to &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; that is a long one. A ritual taking at least 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you have done it a bunch of times, you can skip the &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; and go to the effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just wave your palm parallel to the ground and say, &amp;quot;dirt road!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it appears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Effect before cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, with nothing written in any notes I can find, that&amp;#39;s one way to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But while looking I found this about &amp;quot;dead star energy&amp;quot;,  from a lecture by Taisha written up by an audience member.  And so I looked for more on that constellation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Taisha indicated that two areas of dead star energy they were instructed to aim at while performing the Stellar Hatch Pass are in the Constellation\u00a0Corona Borealis, and the rotating binary star that makes up the Eye of the Bull in the Constellation Taurus.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I found:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nury at first seemed rather shy and nervous. She referred to Castaneda and Carol as her father and mother. She also stated that her name, was in don Juan&amp;#39;s native tongue (Yaqui?). Her first name, assertedly, was &amp;quot;Nuli,&amp;quot; which meant &amp;quot;permanent.&amp;quot; Her second (something like &amp;quot;Alik&amp;quot;?) and third names, when translated from Yaqui, meant &amp;quot;blue scout.&amp;quot; She described herself as &amp;quot;a very restless being, which is why I am so slender and unable to put on weight.&amp;quot; She also referred to a solitary energy emanating from a galaxy between Cassiopeia and Corona Borealis that don Juan had indicated had something to do with her origins. She commented on each group of poems and related elements of the poems to the theme of intersubjectivity. In one, Castaneda referred to the devastatingly &amp;quot;sad hum&amp;quot; of the Hollywood freeway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He explained that he needed our birthdays and the times we were born to figure out when the constellation Corona Borealis was at its zenith on the day we were born. The old sorcerers had always been guided by that particular constellation. When it was immediately above, they would take action. If they were born a few hours before Corona Borealis was at its zenith, when they had an impulse to do something, they would wait a few hours before taking action.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He described the constellation as a horseshoe shape, visible from the Northern Hemisphere, and said he would show us a diagram. Castaneda told us that his birthtime was almost a day before Corona Borealis was at the zenith, so he has to wait almost a day, or eight hours, when he has an impulse, and then &amp;quot;I either do it or I don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; But this practice gives him the space to act at the proper time. He told us that Corona Borealis had one dim star that made a triangle with two others. He said it was hard to see in a clear sky in the countryside in Mexico, but that &amp;quot;in our polluted atmosphere here it is easier to make out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda explained that Corona Borealis was the most important of three constellations that were of interest to sorcerers of their lineage Corona Borealis&amp;#39; importance, he explained, was at least twofold: (1) the time of day you were born relative to when Corona Borealis reached its zenith in the sky that day indicates whether you should take action immediately on an impulse to do something, or whether you need to first wait a certain period of time (determined by the length of time between when you were born and when the constellation reached its zenith on the day of your birth); and (2) &amp;quot;dreaming&amp;quot; at times when Corona Borealis is at its zenith in the sky can enable you to &amp;quot;enter other worlds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll stop there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We already get to enter into other worlds without that astrology burden!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I found more interesting, was using the Stellar Hatch pass to retrieve energy from a &amp;quot;dead star&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one I tapped into is anything but dead!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originally taught as &amp;quot;Gift to Maui&amp;quot;, here&amp;#39;s an interesting thing about it (the title and the slight variations from &amp;quot;Stellar Hatch&amp;quot;):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opening a window for abstract energy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gift to Maui pass. Stand erect, look down between feet, count to 6 while ball of energy forms. Look way down. Eyes attach to ball. Lift head to attach the ball to your chest, lowering it again to look at your chest. Then raise head and look way up so that the ball can rise. Count to 6. Do right karate inside palm edge strike with left arm retracting, then do left. This opens a hatch. Raise right hand too to grab the hatch. rotate left, right, left, right, left, right. Go back to center. This opens the hatch. Pull it down but keep looking up, hands go to side and then let go. Send ball into infinity with gaze, count to 6. Then lower head and look down, opening the hole in the back of the neck. Count to 6 as ball falls and splashes onto neck. Lift and inhale shoulders 3 times. Raise arms and head to close hatch by rotating in the reverse direction from last time. Start right and do the 6 rotations. Bring arms and head down, then raise and lower head to unhook the energy to chest. Stare down for count of 6 to send the ball down into infinity. Hands at side. Fan fingers then do 3 gill breaths by lifting the wrists to parallel to the ground with fingers extended while breathing. But arms stay straight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a comment on it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda has sent a special movement for this weekend- the Gift to Maui Pass, or Opening a Window for Abstract Energy. It is a complicated series of moves in which we imagine a ball of energy between our feet, affix our gaze to it, and pull it up above our heads. We cut a hatch in the space above our heads and let the ball float up into a black, starry sky, then pull it down onto the back of our necks, flip it onto our chests, and allow it to float down below our feet. Finally, with hands at our sides, we open and close our fingers &amp;quot;like gills.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As we do the movements, we accrue silence,&amp;quot; Kylie tells us. &amp;quot;Then abstract energy can come in. After enough has accrued-two minutes or two days of silence-the scales tip, and the force of energy opens you like a vacuum, and abstract energy comes in. Who knows where it will take you? Who cares?&amp;quot; Abstract energy, she says, is energy that is not used for personal endeavors-opinions, thoughts, ideas\u2014but for &amp;quot;abstract action&amp;quot;: the journey into freedom. Kylie warns us not to combine tensegrity in the same session with other practices, like yoga, because tensegrity is specifically for &amp;quot;calling on the sorcerer&amp;#39;s intent&amp;quot;- calling back the energy body to make the abstract flight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived":

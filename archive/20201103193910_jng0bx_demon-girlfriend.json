I don't recall much of it because there's no way to trigger the memory.  I only recalled the insect because I was responding to a comment in here.\n\nI'd challenged Fancy to scare me.  But I'd also been joking with her about dancing in the past.  I ended up with her in red demon form, offering to dance.  She wasn't solid enough to feel (yet), so I put my hands on her shoulders.  Later I discovered,  if you touch the shoulders of a demon, it leaves a mark on the hands.  I could reliably feel 2 or 3 fibers extending from the little fingers, with which I could touch my legs.\n\nIt was 100% repeatable, a very spooky thing.  It felt like ants crawling wherever  my 2 little fingers swept.  I had to constantly check to make sure my fingers hadn't gotten so close to the legs, that they could touch tiny hairs.  But they were always at least a half foot away. I even lifted them to 1 foot away, and could still feel each movement of my fingers over my leg.\n\nI reached my arms up into the air to see what was going on, and I could feel a matrix of cobwebs in the air. Each felt like brushing the hand up against a dusty old spider web thread, dangling from the ceiling.   But there were none of those.\n\nEarlier that evening when I got home, I had found a very large fly in my room. Cholita has a habit of doing odd things, and I've found other very large insects crawling around my room.  The fly was too fast for me to catch and remove, but I figured that if I turned off the lights the room would be too dark even for a fly to try to move around.\n\nBut it may have triggered Fancy's transformation into an insect.  I had been wondering about crossing phylums last week, and she gave me a demonstration on left versus right energy, inside the luminous body.  It didn't seem to agree with Kylie's explanation on the crossing phylum video.  But it still had a side orientation.\n\nFancy seemed to believe you had to shift the assemblage point right, to turn into an insect.\n\nPerhaps that's not the same as which side of the luminous shell the energy came from, since Kylie said the right side awareness was not as useful for crossing phylums.\n\nMy finger wiggling has been paying off, but not the way I expected. I keep hoping I'll fold in half, the way Carlos did with Zuleica. But instead, the luminous shell is becoming easier and easier to see.  Don't read too much from that picture, it would take many hours to represent it accurately.\n\nPossibly because we're luring the dreaming double out to help in darkroom tensegrity, we'll get a more visible change over?\n\nYou have to be careful when joking with IOBs.  They have no sense of humor.   I joked with Fancy, as we \"danced\", that her outfit could be sexier. I pointed out that men were remarkably easy to please, being fixated on a few very small points.\n\nBeing female, Fancy wasn't fooled.  She walked up a half hour later, and took off her robe.  She seemed to have grown a few sizes since dancing.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Demon Girlfriend", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "link_ids": ["t3_ifu1bv", "t3_if5koq", "t3_ienqgj", "t3_ie01zd", "t3_idn0fa", "t3_idh7ju", "t3_iczlw5", "t3_icv2ot", "t3_irms6p", "t3_irglig", "t3_iqzit7", "t3_iq7jdg", "t3_iof5ib", "t3_invu3w", "t3_imlozg", "t3_ilzfhg", "t3_ildkri", "t3_ijgd33", "t3_iixdqk", "t3_ihms98", "t3_ih21eh", "t3_ih44uo", "t3_igh7ta", "t3_igday4", "t3_jcxlwj", "t3_hp41du", "t3_kdsew2", "t3_kz7y8a", "t3_kz75ql", "t3_kw4lpr", "t3_kvqj52", "t3_knpzzc", "t3_km2pzf", "t3_kj29l8", "t3_kd0b1h", "t3_k641wo", "t3_k4jrfq", "t3_k2paj7", "t3_k2dn7a", "t3_k1fwwj", "t3_jqlctf", "t3_jq09jk", "t3_jp4g2x", "t3_jng0bx", "t3_jmu5w3", "t3_jmsrw3", "t3_jm1fxl", "t3_jkklgr", "t3_jikxdd", "t3_jhb6f9", "t3_jh8142", "t3_jglh8m", "t3_jgb5mx", "t3_jg53re", "t3_jfoaai", "t3_jf4c1u", "t3_je4gyw", "t3_jdlcth", "t3_jby6ff", "t3_jadwdo", "t3_j9fkih", "t3_j96xwg", "t3_j8rmcm", "t3_j7c8fa", "t3_j65s10", "t3_j61w6p", "t3_j43yai", "t3_j40bem", "t3_j3eykq", "t3_j2jxyx", "t3_j261xv", "t3_j1vngl", "t3_j0g2nl", "t3_izm9cx", "t3_iyhkny", "t3_ix9ipe", "t3_ix5a4g", "t3_iw29ja", "t3_iverkv", "t3_iu3yxd", "t3_isv81g", "t3_isnn0y", "t3_ic1ppo", "t3_i9fbj8", "t3_i8kcue", "t3_i795h6", "t3_i5o2m4", "t3_i4tqjj", "t3_i3o4mq", "t3_i2ha3h", "t3_i1ch4u", "t3_i0s7jm", "t3_hzfk4m", "t3_hx8xej", "t3_iyz5md", "t3_ljjdbn", "t3_lfo0wa", "t3_lgzmsv"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 1", "created_at_utc": 1598295005.319, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1620558726.961, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"diytr04ei2x51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/diytr04ei2x51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=941fe06872f9c480e87fb4257415fbaec29e9851"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/diytr04ei2x51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6afd91382b06f827b517ed11c506a9eb55deb4ae"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/diytr04ei2x51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feadf2ebbe79001b978af9756b1f14609c9de2e3"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/diytr04ei2x51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51a476b4620a238d1ca10022c468c30c263dff58"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/diytr04ei2x51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61c30a28f1ef5d95a85da2a86b0e14559f66a710"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/diytr04ei2x51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7405547edce2c05accd1ec78625ea15a37994a2"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/diytr04ei2x51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab818165a47d26bb84d2bc84f812821bfa2efb42"}, "id": "diytr04ei2x51"}}, "name": "t3_jng0bx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/V3s7LsjKLxOuBcRAeZJmkEFqdoI9GaIpXpA-qx25i8A.jpg", "edited": 1604429111.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1604428750.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/diytr04ei2x51.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ab818165a47d26bb84d2bc84f812821bfa2efb42\"&gt;I may be merely Fancy&amp;#39;s pet, but it&amp;#39;s ok by me!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s less than 1/4th of what I did last night.

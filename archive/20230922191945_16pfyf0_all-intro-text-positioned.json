One of the two Carlos released to h is private classes.\n\nI suppose you either can't take them with you, or that's considered ingrateful.\n\nSeeing as how these 2 allies might have been the ones don Juan used to scare the dickens out of the apprentices, and might have been owned by Julian before don Juan, and so on, perhaps going back to the \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nFor their talking lizards show.\n\nWe really don't know much about the Allies, except that they live for billions of years.\n\nThey might have reproduced at one point. Taisha asked her Ally \"Phoebus\", who said they did but it was very long ago.\n\nPhoebus could have meant billions of years!\n\nJust to speculate, organic beings like us, evolve through a combination of natural selection, and which position of the assemblage point we prefer over time.\n\nInorganic beings like Phoebus, wouldn't have that path to evolve. There's no organic matter, to naturally select successful forms from.\n\nBut it's nice to know, they also evolved.\n\nAnd I have a feeling that these 2 allies, which Carlos released to his students, have been around a very very long time.\n\nWhen you move your assemblage point at least to just below your shoulder blades, you become capable of perceiving them.\n\nMeditation causes that too, and thus we have the \"fire Kasina\" text where the Buddha sees 4 dancing girls in blue dresses, who offer to do anything for him that he wants.\n\nIt's a typical inorganic being manifestation, except it's almost a certainty there was only one.\n\nI've seen them manifest as many as 5, from just the one.\n\nUp in the \"green zone \"where they first become visible, they aren't particularly \"convincing\".\n\nThey have the feel of a daydream to them.\n\nFor the super realistic, you have to shift your assemblage point to the same locations that drugs like magic mushrooms shift it.\n\nThat's all the way down your back, maybe even a tiny bit below your tailbone, and far to the right.\n\nOr the left.\n\nWe don't really know.  Perhaps once down that far, it can go either way.\n\nTo the left, heaven, wealth, bliss, insect consciousness.\n\nTo the right sex, violence, physical activity, and mammal super strength.\n\nBut that's all transparent to you.  You won't realize anything extreme is going on, because your entire reality is \"bent\".\n\nAnd everything seems normal.\n\nExcept now, you're Ally can be 100% realistic, speak with a voice, and even touch you and feel solid.\n\nIt's very alluring!\n\nMinx in this case is portrayed as in the red zone, but shifted only halfway as far horizontally as drugs would move it.\n\nSo he has \"distortions\".\n\nDon't take those too literally, there ought to be some fog also, and he should fade in and out. Not animate smoothly.\n\nThey don't animate smoothly until you can \"slow down\" your own awareness.\n\nSo one might ask, do the Allies really steal writing pens?\n\nIn fact, they do steal stuff.\n\nWe just don't have much info on that.\n\nI've seen them try to make off with something, which while you're fully awake, just looks like poltergeist activity in your home.\n\nIn fact, when Cholita first came to live with me, her constant complaint was that my house was infested with spirits.\n\nDoesn't seem like something to complain about to me, and eventually she got used to it.\n\nEven went out and found some inorganic beings of her own.\n\nOne from a long train trip. I suppose it was following the \"sleeper car\" train along, and Cholita lured it to come home with her.\n\nI believe this animation might be nearly finished.\n\nThe intro has the rearranged text.\n\nComments are welcome, but keep in mind I'm \"3 deep on the interruptt stack\" for animations.\n\nI need to go back and finish 3 others I started, and then couldn't finish because I needed to do another, to verify things like what angle the cheese slice runs at.\n\nthis one, was an \"order\" from Silent Knowledge.  I made it, out of fear I wouldn't get as many cool magical gifts, if I ignored the request to make it right away.\n\nI suppose, it is the #1 topic Carlos wanted emphasized, when he knew he couldn't stay with us.\n\nToo bad all three Cleargreens just ignored that in favor of dancing with wolves, or making up new passes of their own.\n\nThey didn't even bother to try to protect all magical passes ever taught, and let some become so obscure, maybe even Techno can't bring them back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzl1hu8j9upb1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=391b694dfc3746bfb9f82dfa1b9795c76bee9709", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "All Intro Text Positioned", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Audiovisual"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"zctp8ptrlupb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/16pfyf0/asset/zctp8ptrlupb1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718049745%2CODVmMTFkNmQ5OGMwZjA0MmM5ODJlNjcxOTBlMzYzYzQ1NDUyN2I3YmQyOGFiNThjZGY4NjMwMTcwNjNhMGNkNQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/16pfyf0/asset/zctp8ptrlupb1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718049745%2CNzY1MzFjMmY3OTRmNjNmMTkxMDRlZGQ1OWY0M2E1Yzk1NWQ3OTRjYWFiYTMyMDFmZmQ1Zjc2Yzk2NDZjMjE3Zg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "zctp8ptrlupb1", "isGif": false}, "rzl1hu8j9upb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rzl1hu8j9upb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ea762619444d57805587cc61c7850d117bfab19"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rzl1hu8j9upb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b8d2554ff23824a99143926f5aab99a252e5ea3"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rzl1hu8j9upb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b5cd5edf63518f9600d2753e6e7c663f32d39cb"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rzl1hu8j9upb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf78d8c661d460f78ee9ed5aad05db588155e69f"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rzl1hu8j9upb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b6c4f01c195ffa16b9b621ed7490298ce6c74cf"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rzl1hu8j9upb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4e20091f723f48809e4591146d4b7ce3598fd75"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rzl1hu8j9upb1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=391b694dfc3746bfb9f82dfa1b9795c76bee9709"}, "id": "rzl1hu8j9upb1"}}, "name": "t3_16pfyf0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Audiovisual", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Rs0O3d_q7UPK0wI5qVZgD9XQiLEGCjo-DDWxWUfrKXI.jpg", "edited": 1695406621.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1695403185.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/16pfyf0/video/zctp8ptrlupb1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/16pfyf0/video/zctp8ptrlupb1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, once we get a &amp;quot;format&amp;quot; for this one, I won&amp;#39;t need as much advice on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just to keep it educational, please notice how Minx has &amp;quot;distortions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx is an Ally.

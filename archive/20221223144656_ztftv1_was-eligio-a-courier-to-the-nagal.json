I am open to other opinions on that, though.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not looking for contradictions or a book deal, I am looking to see if there is more information on the concept of being a &amp;quot;courier to the nagal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was (and am) a member of the website that Th\u00e9un Mares ran, and back before he died he &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot; me as a &amp;quot;courier to the nagal&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his books and other writings there is some information available, I am working my way through it as we speak.  And I am aware of what Castaneda said concerning the issue in reference to Emilito, and probably Eligio, just making sure I know about all the info that is out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me - the idea of &amp;quot;the courier to the nagal &amp;quot; is a fascinating archetype, I am spending a couple days exploring the concept and what my attraction to it means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once stumbled upon an academic article, that was hidden behind a pay wall, that attempted to prove that Castaneda&amp;#39;s toltec unit was plagiarized from the Myeer Briggs personality profile (16 personality types based upon Jung&amp;#39;s teachings, plus the nagaul)  I would love to read that, to see how much detail he works with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally am not too concerned what was &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;not real&amp;quot; - I am just looking for what is useful to me and those I encounter in life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the info - every thread counts - sometimes we don&amp;#39;t know the value of a piece of information until years down the road. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all goes on &amp;quot;the bookshelf&amp;quot; in my brain!

A recapitulation consists of recollecting one&amp;#39;s life down to the most insignificant detail. It is one of the most fundamental techniques sorcerers use for retrieving energy left behind in the world and also to reject the energy others have left in us. &lt;strong&gt;Recapitulation sets free energy imprisoned within us.

Stalkers have a similar apronlike feature, but instead of fibers the apron consists of countless small, round protuberances. &amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, ALL  &amp;quot;scholars have a sort of shallow dent, a bright depression at his solar plexus. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All &amp;quot;men of action have some fibers emanating from the area of the will.  &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; The assistant has no obvious configuration.  &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The man behind the scenes is recognized not by a feature but by his ability to create, quite involuntarily, a burst of power that effectively blocks the attention of seers. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think there is anything in particular within each type that makes him/her more apt to assist any of the other categories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ztftv1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ztftv1/was_eligio_a_courier_to_the_nagal/j1g03wv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1671845063.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1671845063.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j1fxayp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j1fs1qb", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Hi,\n\nFirst off - you just gave me the perfect piece of evidence I was looking for - the fact that he says (in the paragraph you quote) that \"each one of them was a replica in an undeveloped form of the members of don Juan's own party\", and it lists Eligio in the place of Emilito - is PROOF that Eligio is in fact a courier to the nagal!

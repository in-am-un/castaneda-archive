How do you achieve that your energy is fluid, unbound, and sparkling? Shamans used different methods to do this. For example, they fumigated with smoke \u2013 in order to clear the luminosity.

I also remembered the old advice of some inorganic allies.\n\nWhat is the intent of this pass?\n\nThe same as the intent of the \"challenge Gravity\" magic pass group. We fix the state of weightlessness, the intention to overcome attraction-on the physical level, remember carefully these feelings.\n\nTask: remember these feelings as much as possible, so that you are able to reproduce these feelings at any time, wherever you are, in whatever state you are, emotional or physical.\n\nWhen? Catch the peak moment when you have already jumped on the trampoline, rose in the air, hung, but have not yet started to fall down.\n\nWhat? These sensations can cause a little similar feelings, like in a falling  Elevator. But falling in an iron box is not as pleasant as jumping and tumbling like a squirrel or a monkey.\n\nUse these jumps as magical passes, not as a physical exercise. Focus on the energy.\n\nYou need to observe various medical contraindications. Someone may feel sick, dizzy, and so on. Refuse if it's not for you. Find another way.\n\nAcrobatics can also be useful in this sense. In addition to lightness, it teaches us a sense of physical dexterity and balance.\n\nAfter completing your trampoline session, repeat 5-10 times the feeling you remember when you were suspended in the air. Make sure that this exercise \"works\"for you. You have a slight feeling of \"floating\" in reality.\n\nAnd then during the day and week, reproduce this feeling in moments when you are sad, lonely, hard, and so on. Create a useful pattern from this feeling. Use this new pattern when you feel that society, surrounding people, and events are again beginning to \"absorb\" you, your energy, thoughts, and emotions.

It's about sheer numbers flowing through here, trying to steal energy.  Or \"prove themselves right\".\n\nThere's no one in here who wouldn't gladly tolerate a \"mascot\" or two, who say nutty things.\n\nBut we can't tolerate a continuous buildup of people who aren't actually working to learn sorcery, and like to stick pins in people to make themselves feel good.\n\nOr to make it simple, if you piss on someone's leg, you'll get a scolding.\n\nIf you're slinging shit, you're out of here.\n\nDo that in the river of shit. That's everywhere outside here.\n\nDon't bring it here! We can't afford it, because of the endless flow of people.\n\nWe aren't trying to sooth anyone.\n\nThe opposite is true.\n\nSo please go somewhere else if you don't understand this place.  You can still read, and come back later when you realize what's really going on in the world, and the same old shit no longer \"soothes\" you.\n\nWe aren't here to be \"polite and understanding and share all people's points of view\".\n\nThat's what killed magic in the first place.\n\nIf you don't trust management to do a good job making sure people learn the real thing, then go away right now.  Find your paradise elsewhere.\n\nAnd if you don't agree with don Juan that it's all shit out there, and you also disagree with Carlos about that, and if you ignore that I've been searching for more than 20 years for anything real out there with thousands of followers to use as spies, and found NOTHING...\n\nThen you're on your own little trip down the river of shit.\n\nDon't drag this subreddit along. There's plenty of pretend magic places for you to hang out.\n\nCastaneda discussion groups too!  Although, none of those have actual magic, so they die off rather quickly.\n\nBut if you want to scare the hell out of yourself and kick the Buddha's ass, see clearly that Lao Tsu was a con artist because you regularly travel outside this reality and observe it from a point of view he pretended to be describing, then you're in the right place.\n\nAnd keep safe out there in shit land.\n\nIf what you are looking at in terms of a magical \"system\"  was created after money was invented, than it's surely a fraud.\n\nLet's say, anything younger than 5,000 years is a total fraud.\n\nMight have 5% magic, but that's not going to do you any good with the horrible stories they tell, to sell merchandise and motivate donations.\n\nDon't bring it in here unless there's some actual value to examining it from a sorcery point of view.\n\nGive us a chance to save real magic, since there isn't any elsewhere!\n\nIf you don't understand that, go away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "New People, Don't be Confused", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"b8iqiurol2391": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=741ce71a21b778c83ee9ddd2f7c614c760a03ab7"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d5fb79625eeeadc0e7191760976b6c9da51b3ab"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3e4c353b64e06952df602c1de6b3f13282d881"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9bb24d37dfe9b43ee25e29503f0140dedf7d874"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4e3f536271804f61b9fd85118b2bb02e0263c37"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5140942e243a6b9351ffdb4919fcb0e328907729"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c92a40202e8cb899e734855beb1582e0299832cf"}, "id": "b8iqiurol2391"}}, "name": "t3_v2qq39", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 113, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 113, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/iu4RweKnAukEyXP03JGpn0HIMZoEqDyWSj4-aVmOc40.jpg", "edited": 1658943790.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1654115698.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c92a40202e8cb899e734855beb1582e0299832cf\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/b8iqiurol2391.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c92a40202e8cb899e734855beb1582e0299832cf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know some new people have been running around the river of shit trying to find some relief for years, but lately there seems to be some confusion about this specific subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out there, outside this subreddit, it&amp;#39;s all shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not my words.

It&amp;#39;s a process of tuning in a precise copy of reality between both entities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which requires testing and verifying and coming to an &amp;quot;agreement&amp;quot;, before it&amp;#39;s like what people expect of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_v2qq39", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/v2qq39/new_people_dont_be_confused/iqwanwf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1664812490.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1664812490.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iqw76gj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iqw04nh", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/v2qq39/new_people_dont_be_confused/iqw76gj/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_iqw76gj", "created": 1664811099.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1664811099.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iqw04nh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iqtss0m", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "But you should stick around this subreddit until you notice that EVERYONE wants to steal, based on made up magic.\n\nThey pull it from other sources, repackage it, and try to con others using it.\n\nIt's RELENTLESS.\n\nSo that if anything contains actual magic, it's very quickly lost to greed and made up mutations of it.\n\nI spent decades collecting books on magic, as per the instructions of Carlos.\n\nNever found any but 3 books, and they were decayed magic.

Y'all are not very good at public relations, are you? :D\n\nAs a \"new people\", and lurker without a chip on my shoulder (at least none that I would be aware of) I think you have an interesting conundrum. Nothing magical, I think. Just... subreddit things.\n\n&gt;This isn't about being nice. It's about sheer numbers flowing through here, trying to steal energy. Or \"prove themselves right\".\n\nAt the same time, in order to produce the number of genuine products you hope to ultimately produce, you need some publicity. You need a certain number of people to see you, to have a chance to make ten sorcerers.\n\nIf all you want is a silent sub, where you shall not be disturbed by things and people you don't like, then any other name for this sub would better serve your purpose. As, for better or worse, r/castaneda is the first place anyone even remotely interested in *anything* on the topic, genuine or not, hobby or serious, will gravitate to. I mean, that's how I stumbled in here.\n\nI think having a rather specialized sub like this one (and that's what you are), under a name where anyone new will expect a friendly, open landing place for anyone who searches Castaneda on reddit...\n\nWell, that's it. That directly leads to all this drama which regularly seems to bubble up here. The apparently common confusion of new people, and the apparently equally common complaint that \"this sub should not be like that\", all stem from the fact that /r/castaneda is the place where anyone would expect a \"general landing place\" on the topic, and not \"the special anvil where sorcery is reforged\".\n\nSo, as it seems to be this time of the month again, where those problems bubble up... I have decided to say something for once. And no worries, after this thread I will never say anything again here, and go back to lurking. On anything but this subreddit stuff, which feels painfully obvious to me, I feel neither interested enough, nor qualified enough to comment.\n\nSo, if you, or the mods for that matter, think that too many non serious people spamming your sub with low quality nonsense is indeed a recurring problem, which doesn't seem to let up, I would propose the /r/coffee solution.\n\n\"This is not a community for meme, 'pretty,' or neat, pictures or videos; /r/cafe is our light-content sister sub;\", is what the elitist coffee professionals say in their sidebar. They solve the same problem you are having here, by offering people an alternative, a place where they can post their pretty pictures. Where they can gush about light heartedly made up terrible coffee drinks which have nothing to do with actual coffee. Where they can discuss what they want to discuss, and post what they want to post, no matter how unprofessional the opinion. In order for /r/coffee to remain the place the professionals like, they offer the rest of the audience the place they want, and which /r/coffee is not.\n\nSo, I think if you want to have a reasonable amount of peace, combined with the advantage of having a sub name which is popular and on topic enough, to get enough eyes on you to maybe ultimately produce a sorcerer or two... The best solution I see is a sister sub.\n\nEither you can link to some existing place in the sidebar. Or you can make something lighthearted with loose moderation and a welcoming attitude yourselves. Though... I don't know if you actually could :D\n\nSeriously though, you are not the only sub with this problem. /r/zen also has the same issue you have. Because they also have a... let's call it \"special take\" on their topic, under a sub name which implies \"general landing place for all things zen\". And for them it has also been a rather persistent and drama producing problem, as they refuse to refer people to more open and inclusive places.\n\nI think you don't lose anything by doing that. People who don't like this sub's take, will go elsewhere anyway. If you don't offer them an alternative, they will go there after shitting on the ground here.\n\nAnyway, no matter what you do, I hope you get at least 10 sorcerers who can beat a Buddha's ass!

Y&amp;#39;all are not very good at public relations, are you? :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a &amp;quot;new people&amp;quot;, and lurker without a chip on my shoulder (at least none that I would be aware of) I think you have an interesting conundrum. Nothing magical, I think. Just... subreddit things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t about being nice. It&amp;#39;s about sheer numbers flowing through here, trying to steal energy. Or &amp;quot;prove themselves right&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in order to produce the number of genuine products you hope to ultimately produce, you need some publicity. You need a certain number of people to see you, to have a chance to make ten sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If all you want is a silent sub, where you shall not be disturbed by things and people you don&amp;#39;t like, then any other name for this sub would better serve your purpose. As, for better or worse, &lt;a href=\"/r/castaneda\"&gt;r/castaneda&lt;/a&gt; is the first place anyone even remotely interested in &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; on the topic, genuine or not, hobby or serious, will gravitate to. I mean, that&amp;#39;s how I stumbled in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think having a rather specialized sub like this one (and that&amp;#39;s what you are), under a name where anyone new will expect a friendly, open landing place for anyone who searches Castaneda on reddit...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#39;s it. That directly leads to all this drama which regularly seems to bubble up here. The apparently common confusion of new people, and the apparently equally common complaint that &amp;quot;this sub should not be like that&amp;quot;, all stem from the fact that &lt;a href=\"/r/castaneda\"&gt;/r/castaneda&lt;/a&gt; is the place where anyone would expect a &amp;quot;general landing place&amp;quot; on the topic, and not &amp;quot;the special anvil where sorcery is reforged&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, as it seems to be this time of the month again, where those problems bubble up... I have decided to say something for once. And no worries, after this thread I will never say anything again here, and go back to lurking. On anything but this subreddit stuff, which feels painfully obvious to me, I feel neither interested enough, nor qualified enough to comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you, or the mods for that matter, think that too many non serious people spamming your sub with low quality nonsense is indeed a recurring problem, which doesn&amp;#39;t seem to let up, I would propose the &lt;a href=\"/r/coffee\"&gt;/r/coffee&lt;/a&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is not a community for meme, &amp;#39;pretty,&amp;#39; or neat, pictures or videos; &lt;a href=\"/r/cafe\"&gt;/r/cafe&lt;/a&gt; is our light-content sister sub;&amp;quot;, is what the elitist coffee professionals say in their sidebar. They solve the same problem you are having here, by offering people an alternative, a place where they can post their pretty pictures. Where they can gush about light heartedly made up terrible coffee drinks which have nothing to do with actual coffee. Where they can discuss what they want to discuss, and post what they want to post, no matter how unprofessional the opinion. In order for &lt;a href=\"/r/coffee\"&gt;/r/coffee&lt;/a&gt; to remain the place the professionals like, they offer the rest of the audience the place they want, and which &lt;a href=\"/r/coffee\"&gt;/r/coffee&lt;/a&gt; is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I think if you want to have a reasonable amount of peace, combined with the advantage of having a sub name which is popular and on topic enough, to get enough eyes on you to maybe ultimately produce a sorcerer or two... The best solution I see is a sister sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either you can link to some existing place in the sidebar. Or you can make something lighthearted with loose moderation and a welcoming attitude yourselves. Though... I don&amp;#39;t know if you actually could :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, you are not the only sub with this problem. &lt;a href=\"/r/zen\"&gt;/r/zen&lt;/a&gt; also has the same issue you have. Because they also have a... let&amp;#39;s call it &amp;quot;special take&amp;quot; on their topic, under a sub name which implies &amp;quot;general landing place for all things zen&amp;quot;. And for them it has also been a rather persistent and drama producing problem, as they refuse to refer people to more open and inclusive places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you don&amp;#39;t lose anything by doing that. People who don&amp;#39;t like this sub&amp;#39;s take, will go elsewhere anyway. If you don&amp;#39;t offer them an alternative, they will go there after shitting on the ground here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, no matter what you do, I hope you get at least 10 sorcerers who can beat a Buddha&amp;#39;s ass! I&amp;#39;d love to see that!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false,

The problem is, our society places a high stigma on mental illness.\n\nI know, because I can't even take Cholita (an insane but powerful Olmec Indian witch) to the cell phone store to get her phone recharged.\n\nThey throw her out, even after I explain about her condition, and they insist they're tolerant of mental illness.\n\nNo one is.\n\nShamanism on the other hand also upsets people.\n\nIt's threatening to people, because it points out the possibility that they missed the boat.  Got stuck in the mud.\n\nIt's like a wealthy guy going into a poor neighborhood. He'll stand out like  sore thumb, and people won't be happy to see him there, unless they believe they can get some cash from him.\n\nReal magic also worries people that maybe they aren't going to heaven after all.  Because all religions start with someone doing real magic, which then gets corrupted for profit.\n\nSo people classify real shamanism (visible magic) as something being broken, and lump it into the category of self-induced mental illness.\n\nAs for being \"subjective\", shamanism leads to breaking the laws of physics, right in people's faces. Whether they like it or not.\n\nSo it's not subjective in the long run.  Not as long as you have the real thing. Most have a phony teacher in it for money and attention, so they'll never get to see that.\n\nBut you might be wondering if a shaman can help someone with mental illness?\n\nI think it's  unlikely.  Mental illness comes with mood disorders.\n\nThey don't want help. That's the problem.\n\nAnd if they did, they're be too uncomfortable to put in the 3 hours a night of darkness gazing, needed to bring out real magic. Or to do any other thing that leads to real shamanism.\n\nIt would take a powerful sorcerer to help someone with the illness my witch friend Cholita has.

The problem is, our society places a high stigma on mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know, because I can&amp;#39;t even take Cholita (an insane but powerful Olmec Indian witch) to the cell phone store to get her phone recharged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They throw her out, even after I explain about her condition, and they insist they&amp;#39;re tolerant of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shamanism on the other hand also upsets people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s threatening to people, because it points out the possibility that they missed the boat.  Got stuck in the mud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like a wealthy guy going into a poor neighborhood. He&amp;#39;ll stand out like  sore thumb, and people won&amp;#39;t be happy to see him there, unless they believe they can get some cash from him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real magic also worries people that maybe they aren&amp;#39;t going to heaven after all.  Because all religions start with someone doing real magic, which then gets corrupted for profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So people classify real shamanism (visible magic) as something being broken, and lump it into the category of self-induced mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for being &amp;quot;subjective&amp;quot;, shamanism leads to breaking the laws of physics, right in people&amp;#39;s faces. Whether they like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not subjective in the long run.  Not as long as you have the real thing. Most have a phony teacher in it for money and attention, so they&amp;#39;ll never get to see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you might be wondering if a shaman can help someone with mental illness?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s  unlikely.  Mental illness comes with mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t want help. That&amp;#39;s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if they did, they&amp;#39;re be too uncomfortable to put in the 3 hours a night of darkness gazing, needed to bring out real magic. Or to do any other thing that leads to real shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would take a powerful sorcerer to help someone with the illness my witch friend Cholita has.

There's no possibility of \"waking up\", because you are already awake!\n\nAnd of all the types of dreaming, it's likely the most rational.

Cholita likes to do that once in a while, just to remind me who's boss.\n\nSo the dreaming double doesn't require you to fight for lucidity, you don't wake up, and you can pretty much remember most of what happened when you return.\n\nWhich is a good thing, because that's when you start to question it.  \"Hey...  What the heck was a tame squirrel doing in my living room?  And where did Cholita get those retro hot pants???\"\n\nHere's a similar account from Florinda's book.    I want the newbies to notice, it verifies a tiny point, which you can learn on your own.  Tiny points are great for bulding confidence.\n\nWhen a former private class student comes here to convince everyone that Carlos made it all up,  you can remember the tiny little points. He even made up those?\n\nWho could do such a thing?  Predict how an impossible path, which they made up, would actually go down, if you experienced it for real.\n\nNo one, that's who.\n\nSo best way to learn is to find something odd, AND THEN go back to the books to clarify it. \n\nDon't go looking around in the books first, or you'll cheat yourself.    This is why Carlos told us (in private class) to stop reading the books.\n\nBecause he was confident, we were on the edge of discovering things which could be verified from the books.\n\nIf you spend all of your time reading the books (masturbating), and you are simply a drug addict.\n\nYou can't learn sorcery that way!  Look around.  It only makes you a bastard most of the time.\n\nAn \"expert\" on Castaneda. \n\nAn expert who has no actual expertise.  We have enough of those!\n\nBut if you experience things first, then check the book, you're just being resourceful.\n\nHere's that Florinda book passage:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"\u201cWhat are you all doing to me?\u201d I shouted, unable to contain myself any longer. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize how horrible it is for me to hear you talk about me as if I were not here?\u201d\n\nMariano Aureliano fixed his fierce eyes at me. \u201cYou are not here,\u201d he said in a tone that was devoid of all feeling. \u201cAt least not yet. And most important, you don\u2019t count. Not now or ever.\u201d\n\nI shifted my attention back to the tall women. She, too, was observing me with that same bemused expression. Her eyes were so shiny they sparkled. \u201cAll of us here are bound together by our struggle, by our deep affection for one another, and by the realization that without one another nothing is possible,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are essentially dreamers,\u201d she explained softly. \u201cWe are all dreaming now, and by the fact that you were brought to us, you are also dreaming with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean I am sleeping and having a dream with you?\u201d I asked in mock incredulity. I bit my lip to suppress the laughter bubbling up inside of me.\n\nUnperturbed with my nervous giggles, she went on to explain that what was happening to me was more like an extraordinary dream where all of them were helping me by dreaming my dream.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s idio-,\u201d I stared to say, but she silenced me with a wave of her hand.\n\n\u201cWe are all dreaming the same dream,\u201d she assured me. She seemed to be transported by a joy I was at a loss to understand.\n\n\u201cWhat about the delicious food I just ate?\u201d I asked, looking for the chili sauce that had dribbled on my blouse. I showed her the spots. \u201cThat can\u2019t be a dream. I ate that food!\u201d I insisted in a loud, agitated tone. \u201cI did! I ate it myself.\"\n\nShe regarded me with a cool composure, as though she had been expecting just such an outburst. \u201cBut what about Mr. Flores lifting you up to the top of the eucalyptus tree?\u201d she asked equably.\n\nI was on the verge of telling her that he hadn\u2019t lifted me to the top of the tree but only to a branch, when I remembered that even the lowest branch of any of the trees around us was impossible to reach from the ground.\n\n\u201cHave you thought about that?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t,\u201d I said snappishly.\n\nShe said that the reason I hadn\u2019t thought about it was because in dreams we are not rational. \u201cIn dreams we can only act,\u201d she stressed.\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I interrupted her. \u201cI may be a little dizzy, I admit. After all, you and your friends are the strangest people I have ever met. But I am as awake as I can be.\u201d Seeing that she was laughing at me, I yelled, \u201cThis is not a dream!\u201d\n\nWith an imperceptible nod of her head she motioned to Mr. Flores, who in one swift movement reached for my hand and propelled himself, with me in tow, to a branch of the nearest eucalyptus tree. We sat there for an instant, and before I could say anything, he pulled me back to the ground, to the same spot where I had been sitting.\"\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A point worth knowing", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ko10a6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609459857.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609459168.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different types of dreaming.

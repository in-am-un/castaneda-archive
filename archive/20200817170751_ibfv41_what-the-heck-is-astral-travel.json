Deep inside.\n\nWe just want to play nice and not offend anyone.\n\nSo first and foremost, I\u2019ll be honest and describe Astral Travel this way:\n\nAstral Travel is the ultimate book deal. You can take any weird dream you had, go to the astral travel subreddit, and get yourself loads of attention.\n\nOf course, the only ones who will read it are in the \"book deal of the month club\", waiting for their turn to have a mini-book deal and explain their wonderful experiences.\n\nAstral Travel is for lazy explorers, who want the credit for being highly evolved, but won\u2019t do the actual work to get there.\n\nThey\u2019re broken people.\n\nWhich of course, gives them a chance! It\u2019s the people who are not broken, who have no chance.\n\nThat said, Astral Travel does in fact exist.\n\nWe have people in here who do it for real.\n\nIt seems to be mainly a gift from those fabulous ancient Yogis, who have the most astounding writings on consciousness.\n\nWhen you read those, you can\u2019t help but think this is why Indians are supposed to be so good with computers and logic.\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of amazing analysis of things outside normal events and thought.\n\nThey make sense of the nonsensical.  And their words evoke longing for *intent*.\n\nBut most Yogis are not known for being sober.\n\nThey\u2019re bliss addicts.  And if you don\u2019t disturb the bliss of a bliss addict, they\u2019re fun to be around.\n\nThus if you go to a practicing Hindu and ask him if he \u201cKnows Jesus\u201d, you won\u2019t get an angry response.\n\nHe won\u2019t slowly close the door, as if you were a Mormon on a mission.\n\nInstead he\u2019ll do what India has always done: absorb invaders.\n\nI once heard that very conversation!\n\nThe Hindu said, \u201cOf course we know our brother Lord Jesus! He is truly a great saint.\u201d\n\nI wish I\u2019d seen that argument used on a Mormon, but in fact he was an Evangelist.\n\nSo the topic was ended.  At least, the Evangelist got some respect. No need to fight about it.\n\nAnd besides, anyone who loves Indian food the way I do knows, you might get desert in the middle of the meal, and the coffee you wanted will likely be forgotten and need several reminders.\n\nThat's India.  It's timeless.  Complaining won't make the train run on schedule there.\n\nBut if Astral Travel is real, how does it compare to what sorcerers do?\n\nThat\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s not a valid question.\n\nSorcerers have lucid dreaming, waking dreaming, shared dreaming, intent created dreaming worlds others you can live in, worlds accessible only through silence (cyclic being worlds mostly), inorganic being\u2019s realms which exist here on earth, the world of the emanations, re-runs of past events,  and netherrealms I haven\u2019t explored yet so I can\u2019t describe them for you.\n\nSome of those netherrealms are connected only to \u201cwill\u201d, and can\u2019t be handled by \u201creason\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s from the 8 point diagram.\n\nAnd there are also experiences in the Nagual. Those can\u2019t even be spoken about, in any sensible fashion.  But if you had to classify them, they also qualify as \"astral travel\" because you experience activity in a place you can \"be\".\n\nDo we have all of these in Astral Travel?\n\nYes, but they don\u2019t seem to distinguish. They lump them all together. Or at least, the popular view lumps them all together.\n\nMuktananda, an LA guru active at the same time as Carlos, said that his line of yogis had their own private astral world, handed down from generation to generation.\n\nThat\u2019s clearly something sorcerers do also. We have the case of Clara\u2019s village, probably created originally by the death defier.\n\nAnd yogis commonly close their eyes to travel to astral planes using meditation.\n\nThis is what the remnants of Cleargreen seem to be involved in.\n\nClosed eye, waking dreaming.\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about what that really is, because it can be any of those previous types I listed.\n\nFor example, Maharashi, the other 40% of the hippy movement, with Carlos being 40%, and Leary being 20% (a front for Stanley\u2019s acid lab) once had a vision which called for a world wide alert.\n\nIn his vision he saw a gigantic caterpillar about to strangle the earth.\n\nNuclear war was imminent!\n\nNaturally that called for his followers to fork over $1500 to travel to his university in Iowa, and try to levitate in mass,  in his expensive geodesic dome with foam padded floor.\n\nThat was astral travel.  His vision of an inorganic being in a phantom zone.\n\nBut Maharashi, as wonderful as TM is, was clueless.\n\nHe was filled with those wonderful ancient explanations of things like, \"Smritis\", or \"Rakshasas\", but sober he was not.\n\nHe was known for waving a daisy in his hand,  a habit copied by the hippies.\n\nAnd that's probably good enough for me to finish.\n\nAstral travel is a big swamp.\n\nBut there are good fish in there somewhere!\n\nUnfortunately, if you go down that road you\u2019re going to consume a lot of Mosquitofish.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What the heck is \u201cAstral Travel\u201d?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ibfv41", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1597684011.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1597676871.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I\u2019m asked how &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; compares to \u201castral travel\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m always at a loss to answer, so I end up saying I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact that\u2019s not true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of us know the answer.

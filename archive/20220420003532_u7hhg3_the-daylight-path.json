Whenever a person&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;overexerts oneself physically, mentally, or emotionally, one creates a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;blockage, in which fibers of light become knotted. The energy is&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;constricted in one area, thereby, producing an excess in another, like&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;damning up a stream. This produces an energy imbalance causing illness&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00c2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;in the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nelida found a flat area and told me to clear it of rocks and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;debris.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lie down on your back and merge with the earth by tensing and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;relaxing all your muscles,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did as she directed, spreading out my poncho as a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She asked me specifically to note the difference in feeling&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;between tightening and relaxing various muscle groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tighten and relaxing involve two opposite energies,&amp;quot; she&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;explained, as she placed my knapsack under my head. for a pillow. &amp;quot;If a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;person is too relaxed or weak, he needs to tighten; if he is too tense&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or agitated, he needs to relax. When the forces of tension and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;relaxation are in balance, the person experiences health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;\nI stopped before page 273 in Taisha&amp;#39;s original English manuscript, like the one Cholita got.

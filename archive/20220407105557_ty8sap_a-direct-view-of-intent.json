Might not be the best method.\n\nI got a direct view of intent from Silent Knowledge tonight.  Or more accurately, the edges of it.  How it interacts with stuff.\n\nIt's very disturbing.\n\nDisturbing because it's remarkably simple, and we completely ignore it anyway.\n\nIt's almost like a one-armed man pretending he has 2 arms.\n\nYou want to teach him to play the piano, but it's kind of hopeless.\n\nWorse, he won't admit he only has one arm.  It's the dumbest thing you could think of, and yet it's just simply impossible to get him to admit it.\n\nEventually you realize, he doesn't actually want to learn to play the piano.\n\nThat's your obsession, not his.\n\nHe just wants people to admire him for being a famous piano player.\n\nMaybe as a kid, his mom was in love with a piano player and the family had no father.\n\nAnd his mom didn't treat him well because she spent all of her time looking for a husband.\n\nThus his obsession to be a pretend piano player, so his mom will love him.\n\nThat's very much like what we have to work with, in this subreddit.\n\nWhen new people come in here, the first thing old timers want to know is, is he a one-armed piano player again?  Will he insist on interacting with posts and comments, but his only goal will be to confuse others into being locked in to acknowledge his pretending?\n\nHis intent is wrong.  He wants something that's not compatible with actually learning to play the piano, and yet you have to pretend it's not so, or he will punish you.\n\nWe call it, \"exploding head\".\n\nBut in fact, it's the first step in cleaning your link to intent.\n\nTo understand what you really want.  Not what you pretend to want, so as to present yourself to others in a manner that makes you feel better about your miserable existence.\n\nOur one armed piano player only wants to hear, \"**Your** existence is **not** miserable!  Of course it's not. You're a master piano player!  How can you not be happy?\"\n\nUnfortunately, learning actual piano playing is not compatible with pretending.  You have to do a whole lot of practicing.\n\nAnd if you kept the pretend piano player people around, this subreddit would be overrun in just a few months.\n\nSo you have to confront them.\n\nBut really, what you are doing is trying to teach them the first step in the mastery of *intent*.\n\nTo recognize that you are composed of all sorts of motivations, and that to learn sorcery you have to come to grips with those.  Not ignore most of them.\n\nCarlos called it \"glossing\". It's as if we're standing on the edge of a cliff, and most of the rest of the cliff has already fallen.  We're just on a little round spot sticking 100 feet in the air, with no way to jump off to safety.  Meanwhile we're holding a platter covered with 4 \"Denny's Breakfast specials\", like a waitress, precariously balanced on that cliff remnant, with one shoe missing.\n\nA stick of dynamite with a long fuse, burning down at our feet.\n\nSomeone asks, \"Hey, do you need any help?\"\n\nBut we're like, \"For what?  I'm fine!\"\n\nThat's \"glossing\".\n\nSo some people who come in here new, will obviously be actually interested in learning to play the piano.  It would be nice if we could just bar the one armed piano player wannabes in the first place, but that would require changing the nature of this subreddit.  You'd need to remove all traces of potential attention seeking from it.\n\nI guess you could use an algebra class as an example.  There really isn't much potential for attention seeking in an algebra class.  You can be a math nerd, and have math nerd friends.  So you are indeed motivated to compete with them in your learning.  And that's a tiny bit of attention seeking.  But that much is ok.\n\nMeanwhile no one who wants only to impress others would be attracted to that algebra class.\n\nSo algebra solves the attention seeking problem by simply being a series of fixed lessons, which you either understood or you didn't. If you didn't, you can't get attention for yourself by hanging out forever anyway, despite never being able to understand it.\n\nIn here, people hang on forever if they can get away with it.\n\nAnd make pests of  themselves.\n\nSince they can't get even the \"first step\",  there's no hope of learning the entire thing.\n\nIdeally, if someone came in here new you could give them a test.  Find out what their true motive is.\n\nMotive is closely tied to intent.  It's not the same thing, but the relationship will never go away entirely.\n\nWomen have completely different motives than men.  It gives them a huge advantage.\n\nMy thinking is, they have a different life situation.  Men don't have to worry about walking down a major traffic pathway alone.\n\nOther than muggings that is.\n\nBut young women walking along on the sidewalk running in parallel with a major highway, are assumed to be prostitutes by many of the cars that go by.\n\nSo they have extra levels of having to pay attention to the world around them, and figure out what's going on from a wider point of view.  Add to that the monthly moodiness that represents an assemblage point push to the side, needing them to figure out how to soothe themselves back to the center, and they're simply different animals than men.\n\nTheir motives are broader.\n\nWhich means, they have a cleaner link to intent.\n\nThey can drop one thing, and pick up the other.\n\nAt the end, Carlos was facing the same thing i saw tonight.  He could see intent directly.\n\nHe wanted very much to succeed at teaching but it didn't look good.\n\nSo he made his final books.\n\nI didn't get to read them, so I have a hard time remembering which is which, but one of them is his attempt to take us step by step into an understanding of how important intent is.\n\nTo that end, he started to tell us, \"The Intent of the Sorcerer's of Ancient Mexico\", over and over again.\n\nIt was almost tedious, or puzzling.\n\nBut not to someone who can view intent directly.\n\nHe was trying to steer us away from being like the one armed piano player.  Keep us \"honest\".\n\nAnd the problem here is, people just don't realize our entire reality is a zillion fibers of awareness glowing with our attention.  If you can remove your attention from them and put it on another set of fibers, you vanish from the world in which you currently exist and materialize in another.\n\nForget about solid matter for the sake of this discussion.  Worrying about that is also like the one armed piano player.  If you are worried about \"but how can I really vanish, when my body still has to exist as solid matter and I need that to live, so the whole thing seems pretend.\"\n\nBelieve it or not, that's just the one armed piano player talking.\n\nMeaning, the person who worries about that doesn't actually want to learn sorcery.  They want to \"prove something\" to others. Their intent is hooked to other people. Not to sorcery.\n\nYou just sort of have to accept, at least we do what Buddhists pretend they are going to do.  And we do it with our eyes open, while they're sitting there in a meditation coma trying to smile wisely, like the Buddha.\n\nBut fully awake, with eyes open, we leap through solid walls. We play with visible spirits and in general do everything eastern magic systems lie and say they can do.\n\nBut we do it far better than they even claimed.\n\nJust get over worrying if you could \"prove it\" to your physics teacher.  Otherwise you won't get very far.\n\nAs it turns out, physical matter can at least be \"relocated\" using sorcery, so some of that worry about \"how can magic be real\", will be solved for you later.\n\nIn the meantime just worry about learning to actually play the piano.\n\nViewing *intent*, I wondered if I could pass on what I saw to help beginners.\n\nAnd I kept coming up with \"one liners\". Things I hoped, all taken together, would teach them the facts about intent.\n\nSuch as, \"If you assemble a different world and are actually standing in it, wondering what the hell is going on, don't pick up any objects, don't read any newspapers, and in general don't do anything that makes the world seem \"real\", or you risk forgetting where you came from and can get trapped.\"\n\nThat's a lesson in the \"sticky\" nature of intent.  How once you fully perceive a place you can even relocate there as soundly as you are located here, to where you don't even realize you don't belong.  You have to live out the rest of our life there.\n\nIt's a profound lesson on intent.   Given to us by Carlos in a story or two from the books, and some lectures about him and Carol Tiggs in cyclic being worlds.\n\nSpeaking of getting trapped, the one being who has absolutely pure *intent* is your dreaming self.\n\nThe guy running around in dreams.\n\nHe has no physical matter worries.  Can't actually be harmed.  He can have one arm if he feels like it, two, or even 10.\n\nAnd he's not bound by rationality, unless you bring some in via lucid dreaming.\n\nHe's free.  Can't get trapped by latent \"sticky\" intent.\n\nExcept, the IOBs have figured out how to trap him.  So intent itself, is not the whole picture.\n\nI'm afraid I don't understand how they can trap him, but I do know that can be discovered and learned by us.\n\nAnd the path is the same.  You still have to clean your link to intent.\n\nUnclutter it, so that it's pure.  You have to be in full control of your intent, to master sorcery.\n\nHave to \"want\" only what you are wanting to do at the time.  Have to \"expect\" only the result.\n\nCan't have ulterior motives.\n\nNot because this is a moral issue.\n\nBut because our reality is just your glow of awareness on some infinite lines of aware light.  Among the zillions of emanations that could possibly be lit up, to become an infinite number more realities.\n\nTo control sorcery you have to light up just the ones you need and then let a phantom world come into being, centered around our focus.\n\nLet's say you want to leave this world and enter a phantom city.  It's not even a real place, but you know how to get there anyway.\n\nI have one right behind me this minute!\n\nThe phantom copy of the house Cholita created.  I can turn around right now, and look inside it.\n\nIt's not a fantasy. If you practice sorcery it becomes completely normal.\n\nSo with pure intent, you \"summon\" that phantom city you want to enter.\n\nBut if in your mind you are also worried evil clowns have invaded the city,  maybe because the Buddha warned about that,  your intent is \"tainted\".\n\nYou'll run into some evil clowns there.\n\nNotice that there are two different things to be learned here.  One is how to enter that city.  But the other is what **not** to take with you.\n\nThat's part of cleaning the link to intent.\n\nAt the end, Carlos knew that if he left us as we were there are too many one armed piano players in the community.  So many, it was completely hopeless.\n\nWe didn't have a chance to go from pretending to real.  At least, not without him still around.\n\nKeep in mind, caring about that is more tainted intent.\n\nCaring if others learn, has nothing to do with mastering intent.\n\nIt's closer to a one armed piano player worry about fooling others into liking him.\n\nIn a sorcery lineage, all of the senior members will have grown past that.\n\nThey won't care at all if others learn, or if the group fails to teach any of the new replacements.\n\nHowever, they know that if they don't replace themselves the mastery of intent may be lost.\n\nMaybe forever.\n\nSo based on a good sense of purpose they teach others. Not to get fame, money, respect.  But for a higher purpose that supports the part of the spirit which has created \"The Eagle's Gift\" rule. The abstract cores.\n\nAnd while doing that, they also learn deeper levels of sorcery.\n\nBut the fake teachers out there are motivated by their own selfish desires.\n\nYou can't learn from those guys.  Their intent is so polluted they just can't lead anyone to sorcery knowledge.  They only create even worse one armed piano players.\n\nA real teacher has to slowly guide students to figure out what the link to intent is, what it's like when it's dirty, and then leave them to discover the rest themselves.\n\nWhile looking directly at intent tonight (as a selector for silent knowledge), I started to look for \"pieces\" I could \"extract\" to pass on.\n\nThen I realized, that's exactly what Carlos tried to do in \"Wheel of Time\".\n\nIt was a series of \"sayings\" from the books.  Inspirational quotes.  He said that as he tried to figure out which ones to use, an \"order\" came out all by itself. He realized the spirit was helping out, to come up with a series of messages you could read to clean your link.\n\nI was trying to do the same thing, but from a different point of view.\n\nI wanted \"practical tips\" based on actual observations of things I could teach others to see for  themselves, with their own eyes.\n\n\"Magic in your face\".\n\nCarlos did not take that approach in that book.  He still believed he could convince the one armed piano player to stop pretending and get serious.\n\nI believe he was wrong.  He couldn't.  The one armed piano player never actually wanted to learn to play.  It was all about seeking affection from other humans.\n\nBut what he could do, is help the one armed piano player once that person realized their mistake and became sincere.  Perhaps 20 years later, when they grew up a bit more.\n\nWhich by the way, can be sped up with recapitulation.\n\nAt that point \"advice\" would become useful, because the person would truly be on the path.\n\nWhat I believe he either missed, or didn't know how to produce, was the lure of greed.\n\nYes, the lure of greed...\n\nEvery new person is stuck in the river of shit.  Up to their necks in it, surrounded by their fellow men pissing and pooping on them, trying to wrestle themselves just a tiny bit higher so shit doesn't keep choking them.\n\nIf you want to lure a person into swimming to the shore to climb out of there, you need to motivate them.\n\nShow them how nice it will be when you aren't up to your neck in filth.  And go even further and describe the fields of nice smelling flowers basking in the sunshine on the dry shore.\n\nThey have to believe it too, because it's a difficult swim to the shore.  The others in the river will try to stop you.\n\nSo you have to be very convincing in your promises.\n\nCarlos used the stories in his books.  The \"Tales of Power\".\n\nThose are better than what we have in here.\n\nBut ultimately there were so many one armed piano players in the fanbase that only an idiot would actually believe those stories from the books.  No one else seemed to, since they were all pretending to have magic when there was obviously none.\n\nThey lacked enough \"credibility\" to motivate people.\n\nIn comes us.  Faction #3 from private classes.\n\nWhat we want to do is describe the rewards of all the effort in a convincing fashion.\n\nBut that's not enough.  People need to see periodically that they are actually getting those rewards.\n\nThen we need to teach them about intent, so that they learn how to use those rewards.\n\nWhat we need them to learn is that nothing they do, other than letting go of where they are, will move them further on the path.\n\nThat you can't learn sorcery.  All you can do is let the assemblage point move, and then the rewards just show up.\n\nTo do that we use darkness.  So that the rewards can be visibly seen.  But any other method from the books would also work.\n\nIn our case, each new \"sight\" in darkroom practicing represents a movement of the assemblage point.\n\nIf you nightly learn to summon the puffs of colored light, you have guaranteed you did indeed move your assemblage point lower on the back.\n\nYou have \"cleaned your link to intent\" enough to take it for granted that this new assemblage point position is real.\n\nYou make that new \"place\" real.\n\nFrom there we lure people into looking for the next thing.\n\nTo be surrounded by intense magic.  The \"shift below\".\n\nBy learning how to go from just seeing puffs,  to riding on actual dragons, we have further cleaned their link to intent.\n\nMeaning in this case, that new location also \"became real\".  They have developed a \"real\" feeling about it, rather than just pretending.\n\nOur goal in teaching is simple.  To move them one step at a time, across the entire range of the J curve.\n\nKnowing, you CANNOT learn sorcery.  All that matters is the position of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd as it moves, you can't reach the next position if you are expecting things that just can't be at that new location.  You can't move further if your intent is tainted.\n\nBecause your intent is what causes specific emanations to glow, which creates the actual reality you move to.\n\nAnd until you actually get there, you can't imagine how you should expect it to be, without completely destroying the chance to move there.\n\nIt's literally a map, but based on sight.\n\nOur path is like this kind of a map:\n\nGo to \"Desert City\".\n\nSee the biggest rock on the lowest hill?\n\nGo there.\n\nSee the red flowers in the distance?\n\nWalk over there.\n\nWe try to \"teach\" by sight.\n\nBut really, we teach by telling them what to expect to see next.  What to \"intend\".\n\nIntent is both internal and external.  So don't get confused on that point.\n\nYOU intend by focusing some awareness on something.\n\nThen *intent*, the FORCE, fills in the other details needed to go with what you sought.\n\nYou ask for the \"pot roast\".  Your intent is to bite into soft, slightly salty boiled meat.\n\nBut the force of intent, the master chef, gives you mashed potatoes and carrots to go with the pot roast.  Chianti on the side.\n\nTwo different things. Your intent, and the \"force of intent\". Both needed for the result.\n\nTo make specific ranges of the emanations glow.\n\nKeep in mind.  Advice like this doesn't seem very useful relative to \"specific\" instructions for beginners.\n\nLike \"force silence, stare at the dark, look for colors\".\n\nThe \"technique\" is not the same as \"the best attitude\" to make it work.\n\nBoth are important.\n\nI have a lovely story in the advanced subreddit about a miserable old chicken, and her fluffy purple chicks.\n\nFrom the storyteller.  I still don't like that guy.  But he tells a good story!\n\nIt's designed to \"infect\" the mind with a \"better attitude\".\n\nBut as a practical explanation of a technique it's pointless.\n\nAnd yet, if you understand the feelings in it the result is amazing \"practical magic\".\n\nDirect (temporary) command over your double comes from hearing the \"Story of the miserable old chicken\".\n\nIt's the result of the \"affection for the energy body\" Tensegrity pass.\n\nUnfortunately it can't be told here.  The one armed piano players would have a field day pretending.\n\nSo if you are a beginner, just keep finding those \"sights\".\n\nYou'll begin to \"feel\" the J curve.\n\nAs it gets more real, that cleans your link to intent by giving you \"real\" expectations, and removing your pretending.\n\nOr better said, pretending is a \"different intent\" than learning.\n\nYou can go that direction, and most have.  And angrily so.\n\nWe had a doozy yesterday.  Insisted he was making up his own sorcery path, based on whatever he liked.\n\nShowed up in a post about that miserable bastard Lujan Matus.  Maybe he was one of \"Lujan's Pretenders\".\n\nWas so used to everything being pretend, you couldn't even reason with him.\n\nHe could have been helped, but he would have had to admit he was not in fact an actual piano player.  He was the one armed variety.\n\nAll he had to do to change that, was follow instructions.\n\nFind the big rock, so you can look for the red flowers next.\n\nBut he wouldn't.\n\nAll he wanted, was for his \"mommy\" to love him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Direct View Of Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2frf1ri4i4s81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acfd18868e5f4182fe3331401a0beaac09568274"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b41d3bf2d3a3b4b685e544444c33552a7cc29f8b"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b0eb1b3672a9ef1f105785474ac845bdf72616"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdc0cc4664c88525112dcc290eaa13b4131b6cf"}, {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cadf266b8ff1cb73d6ca38bf7a19a096a00973e"}, {"y": 810, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99322373edb3be9ff9b2353c1e68e63c7d7230fe"}], "s": {"y": 901, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=292a56cb3525cc46a29f055561f134408490b0a2"}, "id": "2frf1ri4i4s81"}}, "name": "t3_ty8sap", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6XgsTkHQ6AbbgKsycpLa_Pe-cezCKogcRTIrcTF3oCg.jpg", "edited": 1649351597.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1649321757.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=292a56cb3525cc46a29f055561f134408490b0a2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/2frf1ri4i4s81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=292a56cb3525cc46a29f055561f134408490b0a2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably should have just taken what I learned tonight, kept it to myself, and gone to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as a group, we haven&amp;#39;t yet learned the most effective way to deal with new silent knowledge, so I&amp;#39;m trying to share it.  Might not be the best method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a direct view of intent from Silent Knowledge tonight.  Or more accurately, the edges of it.  How it interacts with stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disturbing because it&amp;#39;s remarkably simple, and we completely ignore it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost like a one-armed man pretending he has 2 arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to teach him to play the piano, but it&amp;#39;s kind of hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, he won&amp;#39;t admit he only has one arm.  It&amp;#39;s the dumbest thing you could think of, and yet it&amp;#39;s just simply impossible to get him to admit it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you realize, he doesn&amp;#39;t actually want to learn to play the piano.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s your obsession, not his.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just wants people to admire him for being a famous piano player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe as a kid, his mom was in love with a piano player and the family had no father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And his mom didn&amp;#39;t treat him well because she spent all of her time looking for a husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus his obsession to be a pretend piano player, so his mom will love him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s very much like what we have to work with, in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When new people come in here, the first thing old timers want to know is, is he a one-armed piano player again?  Will he insist on interacting with posts and comments, but his only goal will be to confuse others into being locked in to acknowledge his pretending?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His intent is wrong.  He wants something that&amp;#39;s not compatible with actually learning to play the piano, and yet you have to pretend it&amp;#39;s not so, or he will punish you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We call it, &amp;quot;exploding head&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, it&amp;#39;s the first step in cleaning your link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To understand what you really want.  Not what you pretend to want, so as to present yourself to others in a manner that makes you feel better about your miserable existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our one armed piano player only wants to hear, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Your&lt;/strong&gt; existence is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; miserable!  Of course it&amp;#39;s not. You&amp;#39;re a master piano player!  How can you not be happy?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, learning actual piano playing is not compatible with pretending.  You have to do a whole lot of practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you kept the pretend piano player people around, this subreddit would be overrun in just a few months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to confront them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, what you are doing is trying to teach them the first step in the mastery of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To recognize that you are composed of all sorts of motivations, and that to learn sorcery you have to come to grips with those.  Not ignore most of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos called it &amp;quot;glossing&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s as if we&amp;#39;re standing on the edge of a cliff, and most of the rest of the cliff has already fallen.  We&amp;#39;re just on a little round spot sticking 100 feet in the air, with no way to jump off to safety.  Meanwhile we&amp;#39;re holding a platter covered with 4 &amp;quot;Denny&amp;#39;s Breakfast specials&amp;quot;, like a waitress, precariously balanced on that cliff remnant, with one shoe missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A stick of dynamite with a long fuse, burning down at our feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone asks, &amp;quot;Hey, do you need any help?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re like, &amp;quot;For what?  I&amp;#39;m fine!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;glossing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So some people who come in here new, will obviously be actually interested in learning to play the piano.  It would be nice if we could just bar the one armed piano player wannabes in the first place, but that would require changing the nature of this subreddit.  You&amp;#39;d need to remove all traces of potential attention seeking from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you could use an algebra class as an example.  There really isn&amp;#39;t much potential for attention seeking in an algebra class.  You can be a math nerd, and have math nerd friends.  So you are indeed motivated to compete with them in your learning.  And that&amp;#39;s a tiny bit of attention seeking.  But that much is ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile no one who wants only to impress others would be attracted to that algebra class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So algebra solves the attention seeking problem by simply being a series of fixed lessons, which you either understood or you didn&amp;#39;t. If you didn&amp;#39;t, you can&amp;#39;t get attention for yourself by hanging out forever anyway, despite never being able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In here, people hang on forever if they can get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And make pests of  themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since they can&amp;#39;t get even the &amp;quot;first step&amp;quot;,  there&amp;#39;s no hope of learning the entire thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, if someone came in here new you could give them a test.  Find out what their true motive is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motive is closely tied to intent.  It&amp;#39;s not the same thing, but the relationship will never go away entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women have completely different motives than men.  It gives them a huge advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My thinking is, they have a different life situation.  Men don&amp;#39;t have to worry about walking down a major traffic pathway alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than muggings that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But young women walking along on the sidewalk running in parallel with a major highway, are assumed to be prostitutes by many of the cars that go by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they have extra levels of having to pay attention to the world around them, and figure out what&amp;#39;s going on from a wider point of view.  Add to that the monthly moodiness that represents an assemblage point push to the side, needing them to figure out how to soothe themselves back to the center, and they&amp;#39;re simply different animals than men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their motives are broader.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, they have a cleaner link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can drop one thing, and pick up the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end, Carlos was facing the same thing i saw tonight.  He could see intent directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wanted very much to succeed at teaching but it didn&amp;#39;t look good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he made his final books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t get to read them, so I have a hard time remembering which is which, but one of them is his attempt to take us step by step into an understanding of how important intent is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To that end, he started to tell us, &amp;quot;The Intent of the Sorcerer&amp;#39;s of Ancient Mexico&amp;quot;, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was almost tedious, or puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not to someone who can view intent directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was trying to steer us away from being like the one armed piano player.  Keep us &amp;quot;honest&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the problem here is, people just don&amp;#39;t realize our entire reality is a zillion fibers of awareness glowing with our attention.  If you can remove your attention from them and put it on another set of fibers, you vanish from the world in which you currently exist and materialize in another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget about solid matter for the sake of this discussion.  Worrying about that is also like the one armed piano player.  If you are worried about &amp;quot;but how can I really vanish, when my body still has to exist as solid matter and I need that to live, so the whole thing seems pretend.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, that&amp;#39;s just the one armed piano player talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the person who worries about that doesn&amp;#39;t actually want to learn sorcery.  They want to &amp;quot;prove something&amp;quot; to others. Their intent is hooked to other people. Not to sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just sort of have to accept, at least we do what Buddhists pretend they are going to do.  And we do it with our eyes open, while they&amp;#39;re sitting there in a meditation coma trying to smile wisely, like the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But fully awake, with eyes open, we leap through solid walls. We play with visible spirits and in general do everything eastern magic systems lie and say they can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we do it far better than they even claimed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just get over worrying if you could &amp;quot;prove it&amp;quot; to your physics teacher.  Otherwise you won&amp;#39;t get very far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, physical matter can at least be &amp;quot;relocated&amp;quot; using sorcery, so some of that worry about &amp;quot;how can magic be real&amp;quot;, will be solved for you later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime just worry about learning to actually play the piano.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Viewing &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, I wondered if I could pass on what I saw to help beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I kept coming up with &amp;quot;one liners&amp;quot;. Things I hoped, all taken together, would teach them the facts about intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, &amp;quot;If you assemble a different world and are actually standing in it, wondering what the hell is going on, don&amp;#39;t pick up any objects, don&amp;#39;t read any newspapers, and in general don&amp;#39;t do anything that makes the world seem &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, or you risk forgetting where you came from and can get trapped.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a lesson in the &amp;quot;sticky&amp;quot; nature of intent.  How once you fully perceive a place you can even relocate there as soundly as you are located here, to where you don&amp;#39;t even realize you don&amp;#39;t belong.  You have to live out the rest of our life there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a profound lesson on intent.   Given to us by Carlos in a story or two from the books, and some lectures about him and Carol Tiggs in cyclic being worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of getting trapped, the one being who has absolutely pure &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is your dreaming self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy running around in dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has no physical matter worries.  Can&amp;#39;t actually be harmed.  He can have one arm if he feels like it, two, or even 10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;s not bound by rationality, unless you bring some in via lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s free.  Can&amp;#39;t get trapped by latent &amp;quot;sticky&amp;quot; intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, the IOBs have figured out how to trap him.  So intent itself, is not the whole picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid I don&amp;#39;t understand how they can trap him, but I do know that can be discovered and learned by us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the path is the same.  You still have to clean your link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unclutter it, so that it&amp;#39;s pure.  You have to be in full control of your intent, to master sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have to &amp;quot;want&amp;quot; only what you are wanting to do at the time.  Have to &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; only the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t have ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not because this is a moral issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But because our reality is just your glow of awareness on some infinite lines of aware light.  Among the zillions of emanations that could possibly be lit up, to become an infinite number more realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To control sorcery you have to light up just the ones you need and then let a phantom world come into being, centered around our focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you want to leave this world and enter a phantom city.  It&amp;#39;s not even a real place, but you know how to get there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have one right behind me this minute!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The phantom copy of the house Cholita created.  I can turn around right now, and look inside it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a fantasy. If you practice sorcery it becomes completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with pure intent, you &amp;quot;summon&amp;quot; that phantom city you want to enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if in your mind you are also worried evil clowns have invaded the city,  maybe because the Buddha warned about that,  your intent is &amp;quot;tainted&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll run into some evil clowns there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice that there are two different things to be learned here.  One is how to enter that city.  But the other is what &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to take with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s part of cleaning the link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end, Carlos knew that if he left us as we were there are too many one armed piano players in the community.  So many, it was completely hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t have a chance to go from pretending to real.  At least, not without him still around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, caring about that is more tainted intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caring if others learn, has nothing to do with mastering intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s closer to a one armed piano player worry about fooling others into liking him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a sorcery lineage, all of the senior members will have grown past that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They won&amp;#39;t care at all if others learn, or if the group fails to teach any of the new replacements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, they know that if they don&amp;#39;t replace themselves the mastery of intent may be lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So based on a good sense of purpose they teach others. Not to get fame, money, respect.  But for a higher purpose that supports the part of the spirit which has created &amp;quot;The Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift&amp;quot; rule. The abstract cores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while doing that, they also learn deeper levels of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the fake teachers out there are motivated by their own selfish desires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t learn from those guys.  Their intent is so polluted they just can&amp;#39;t lead anyone to sorcery knowledge.  They only create even worse one armed piano players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A real teacher has to slowly guide students to figure out what the link to intent is, what it&amp;#39;s like when it&amp;#39;s dirty, and then leave them to discover the rest themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While looking directly at intent tonight (as a selector for silent knowledge), I started to look for &amp;quot;pieces&amp;quot; I could &amp;quot;extract&amp;quot; to pass on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I realized, that&amp;#39;s exactly what Carlos tried to do in &amp;quot;Wheel of Time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a series of &amp;quot;sayings&amp;quot; from the books.  Inspirational quotes.  He said that as he tried to figure out which ones to use, an &amp;quot;order&amp;quot; came out all by itself. He realized the spirit was helping out, to come up with a series of messages you could read to clean your link.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trying to do the same thing, but from a different point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted &amp;quot;practical tips&amp;quot; based on actual observations of things I could teach others to see for  themselves, with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Magic in your face&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos did not take that approach in that book.  He still believed he could convince the one armed piano player to stop pretending and get serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe he was wrong.  He couldn&amp;#39;t.  The one armed piano player never actually wanted to learn to play.  It was all about seeking affection from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what he could do, is help the one armed piano player once that person realized their mistake and became sincere.  Perhaps 20 years later, when they grew up a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which by the way, can be sped up with recapitulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point &amp;quot;advice&amp;quot; would become useful, because the person would truly be on the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I believe he either missed, or didn&amp;#39;t know how to produce, was the lure of greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, the lure of greed...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every new person is stuck in the river of shit.  Up to their necks in it, surrounded by their fellow men pissing and pooping on them, trying to wrestle themselves just a tiny bit higher so shit doesn&amp;#39;t keep choking them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to lure a person into swimming to the shore to climb out of there, you need to motivate them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Show them how nice it will be when you aren&amp;#39;t up to your neck in filth.  And go even further and describe the fields of nice smelling flowers basking in the sunshine on the dry shore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have to believe it too, because it&amp;#39;s a difficult swim to the shore.  The others in the river will try to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to be very convincing in your promises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used the stories in his books.  The &amp;quot;Tales of Power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are better than what we have in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ultimately there were so many one armed piano players in the fanbase that only an idiot would actually believe those stories from the books.  No one else seemed to, since they were all pretending to have magic when there was obviously none.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They lacked enough &amp;quot;credibility&amp;quot; to motivate people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In comes us.  Faction #3 from private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we want to do is describe the rewards of all the effort in a convincing fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not enough.  People need to see periodically that they are actually getting those rewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we need to teach them about intent, so that they learn how to use those rewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we need them to learn is that nothing they do, other than letting go of where they are, will move them further on the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That you can&amp;#39;t learn sorcery.  All you can do is let the assemblage point move, and then the rewards just show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do that we use darkness.  So that the rewards can be visibly seen.  But any other method from the books would also work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our case, each new &amp;quot;sight&amp;quot; in darkroom practicing represents a movement of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you nightly learn to summon the puffs of colored light, you have guaranteed you did indeed move your assemblage point lower on the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have &amp;quot;cleaned your link to intent&amp;quot; enough to take it for granted that this new assemblage point position is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You make that new &amp;quot;place&amp;quot; real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there we lure people into looking for the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be surrounded by intense magic.  The &amp;quot;shift below&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By learning how to go from just seeing puffs,  to riding on actual dragons, we have further cleaned their link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning in this case, that new location also &amp;quot;became real&amp;quot;.  They have developed a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; feeling about it, rather than just pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal in teaching is simple.  To move them one step at a time, across the entire range of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing, you CANNOT learn sorcery.  All that matters is the position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as it moves, you can&amp;#39;t reach the next position if you are expecting things that just can&amp;#39;t be at that new location.  You can&amp;#39;t move further if your intent is tainted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because your intent is what causes specific emanations to glow, which creates the actual reality you move to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And until you actually get there, you can&amp;#39;t imagine how you should expect it to be, without completely destroying the chance to move there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s literally a map, but based on sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our path is like this kind of a map:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to &amp;quot;Desert City&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See the biggest rock on the lowest hill?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See the red flowers in the distance?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walk over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We try to &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; by sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, we teach by telling them what to expect to see next.  What to &amp;quot;intend&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent is both internal and external.  So don&amp;#39;t get confused on that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YOU intend by focusing some awareness on something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, the FORCE, fills in the other details needed to go with what you sought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You ask for the &amp;quot;pot roast&amp;quot;.  Your intent is to bite into soft, slightly salty boiled meat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the force of intent, the master chef, gives you mashed potatoes and carrots to go with the pot roast.  Chianti on the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two different things. Your intent, and the &amp;quot;force of intent&amp;quot;. Both needed for the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make specific ranges of the emanations glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind.  Advice like this doesn&amp;#39;t seem very useful relative to &amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; instructions for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like &amp;quot;force silence, stare at the dark, look for colors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;technique&amp;quot; is not the same as &amp;quot;the best attitude&amp;quot; to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a lovely story in the advanced subreddit about a miserable old chicken, and her fluffy purple chicks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the storyteller.  I still don&amp;#39;t like that guy.  But he tells a good story!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s designed to &amp;quot;infect&amp;quot; the mind with a &amp;quot;better attitude&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as a practical explanation of a technique it&amp;#39;s pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, if you understand the feelings in it the result is amazing &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Direct (temporary) command over your double comes from hearing the &amp;quot;Story of the miserable old chicken&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the result of the &amp;quot;affection for the energy body&amp;quot; Tensegrity pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it can&amp;#39;t be told here.  The one armed piano players would have a field day pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you are a beginner, just keep finding those &amp;quot;sights&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll begin to &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it gets more real, that cleans your link to intent by giving you &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; expectations, and removing your pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or better said, pretending is a &amp;quot;different intent&amp;quot; than learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can go that direction, and most have.  And angrily so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a doozy yesterday.  Insisted he was making up his own sorcery path, based on whatever he liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Showed up in a post about that miserable bastard Lujan Matus.  Maybe he was one of &amp;quot;Lujan&amp;#39;s Pretenders&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was so used to everything being pretend, you couldn&amp;#39;t even reason with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He could have been helped, but he would have had to admit he was not in fact an actual piano player.  He was the one armed variety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All he had to do to change that, was follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find the big rock, so you can look for the red flowers next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he wouldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All he wanted, was for his &amp;quot;mommy&amp;quot; to love him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow":

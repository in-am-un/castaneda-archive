But I suppose it does.\n\nRemember that Julian's ability to change age, came from the gait of power.\n\nOne of my IOBs explained it to me months ago,  telling me to look down at the floor about 2 feet away, and that the emanations Julian manipulated were \"right there\".\n\nI just saw a mass of fog and fuzz. And some lines that seemed to want to group together.\n\nI'll try to add that to a pic I'll draw up tomorrow if I get the time.\n\n\\&gt;Would going in there be detrimental....\n\nSo far I simply have 2 older people from there helping me.  One man who makes fun of me, and a woman who suggests I should ignore his bad manners, that's just his grumpy teaching style.\n\nBut I've only gotten to remember a tiny bit of being inside there.  I only remember clearly exiting the place.\n\nWhen Lily showed me the entrance, it was more like a spell to stir up the required emanations, than it was \"instructions\".\n\nWhen you first learn from IOBs, you misunderstand what's going on.\n\nYou think in terms of \"teachers\", and how they teach.\n\nThey give you procedures, then you repeat them.\n\nThat's \"Men of Knowledge\" sorcery.\n\nWeak and ineffective.  Takes a whole year to prepare the smoking mixture.\n\nWe want to be *seers*.\n\n*Seers* can make up their own rituals.  Absurd ones if they feel like it!\n\nIn the case of Lily, I believe she was actually showing me that the second attention fog can be fractured by looking for the right thing.\n\nIt shatters with vertical cuts.\n\nYou can walk through that, into the Brujo world.\n\nThe procedure is simply to \"notice it\". By noticing it, the emanations get reskimmed to make it more  usable.\n\nThen you can walk in.\n\nBut you won't find it from that description.\n\nSo IOBs \"teach\" most of the time, by just showing you something that can't really be described.\n\nBut you think they're showing you procedures.\n\nWhich in fact, is not the most common way we learn.\n\nWitches learn the IOB way.

I only remember clearly exiting the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Lily showed me the entrance, it was more like a spell to stir up the required emanations, than it was &amp;quot;instructions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you first learn from IOBs, you misunderstand what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think in terms of &amp;quot;teachers&amp;quot;, and how they teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They give you procedures, then you repeat them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weak and ineffective.

See if you can do it again.\n\nBut first, it's come to my attention that people try to get away with sitting or laying with eyes closed, and don't bother to mention it in their post.\n\nNot saying that's you, but you didn't mention specifics so naturally I worry about it.\n\nFirst, deception is very bad.\n\nWe're actually trying to hook to past apprentices as much as possible.\n\nDeception has no connection to the flow of time, so you can't hook into the intent of past successful people.\n\nWe haven't talked about that much, becuase I feel uncomfortable with that topic.  People on the net who change their name to Castaneda Grau Donner.  Nutty stuff like that.\n\nIt's inventory warrior stuff.\n\nWe do want to hook ourselves to past sorcerers, but to make that work you have to more or less do the same techniques they did, as part of your learning process. So if you want to adopt La Gorda's flow, you should find out what techniques she did in the books, and try those.\n\nYou can't just pick a name and not do any actual work.  The advantage you get from trying to associate yourself with a Grau or Donner or Matus, is like a ritual to summon intent.\n\nMen of Knowledge stuff.  They couldn't simply see the emanations, wiggle their fingers in them, and get something to happen.\n\nThey had to do a long ritual, and it had to be exactly right.  That gets the notice of intent, and the past flow of actions and time is added in, to reskim reality.\n\nJust taking the name is closer to the intent of doing nothing.\n\nNot much to do with your situation, but I saw some things about that in the darkroom just now.  \n\nI got a lesson on that.\n\nMy situation repeats that of Carlos, in terms of whether people are learning or not.  There's definately a flow to repeat the events I witnessed of him trying to help people.\n\nBack to your situation: were you walking around or sationary?  Eyes open or closed?\n\nIt makes a huge difference.   We're trying to summon the doble, into the real world.  That can't happen if you go inward.\n\nThe question is, did you fall asleep and have a dream, or is there no possibility of that?\n\nAs for whether it could be IOBs, I will say if you have them around, it's very important to interact with them as much as you can, to get their dark energy.  Daily if possible.  The more you interact, even if it's silly, the stronger and faster they get.\n\nIt's also very important to figure out how to scoop puffs onto our pouches.  The very first thing anyone should do, is probably that.  As soon as you start. \n\nIt gets the support of the double as fast as possible.\n\nI've tried it both ways, many times.\n\nIt's always best to put some puffs there, even if they were so faint you feel silly for thinking they went there.\n\nConsider that we don't really even know what those are.\n\nThere's 2 possibilities:  Those are energy in common with the double, because they aren't tied up with our tonal body, and we can move them around.  So we stuff them on our pouches, and that attracts the double to come over to us from whereever it really is.\n\nThe other is that all of our energy is stuck in our shell, and that free energy, seen as puffs, is in fact the double.    He isn't \"out there\", he's remote viewing out there.  But is right there in front of us.\n\nEither way, getting even a tiny amount on the torso increases your power in the darkroom.\n\nIf you can't cleary see puffs, you aren't silent.\n\nIt's fatal.  You hafe to shut off that monster! It's ruining your life.\n\nSeeing visions might be usable to learn silence, because if you pay attention to those the assemblage point is pulled on harder, so you don't need as much silence to free the assemblage point to move.\n\nBut we aren't trying to make weird stuff happen. That's the misundestanding many new peoplee fall into.  We're trying to get to heightened awareness.  And in that state, there can in fact be nothing at all weird going on.\n\nSo it's not about seeing stuff you can tell your friends about, it's about silence.\n\nYou should figure out why you aren't gaining silence. I didn't hear anything about  your struggles, so I worry you're mostly punking us on the efforts your making.\n\nEven though, those visions are pretty cool!  Of course, we want that.  But I still have to remind people, you need to get the cool stuff the right way.  It's not the goal, it's an indicator.\n\nAnd it doesn't indicate anything, if you aren't following the path by emphasizing silence and tensegrity, done with open eyes and moving around at least a little to prevent sleepiness.\n\nIf that was an IOB you ran into, they will try to teach you to get more contact.\n\nAt first that's not obvious, it seems like random meetings.\n\nBut there's going to be teaching in there.  And eventually, it'll be non-stop teaching.  Even a bit too much.\n\nOne thing I learned tonight is from Lily, who showed me the entrance to the world of the brujos months back, and then didn't help me go in there.\n\nTurns out she did.  I just didn't realize it. An expectations and memory issue.\n\nShe sort of explained, but her appearance was very odd.  Might have been my less active IOB, Mystery.  I've given all 3 energy each day lately, and it seems to make them team up and coordinate help.\n\nWhen they show us something, that doesn't mean we've got it.\n\nThere's almost always a delay needed, to absorb the knowledge.  Or perhaps to build up the muscles needed to do it yourself.\n\nSo they show you something, then the next day you can't do it again.  And they don't seem to want to help.\n\nThat's not a failure or a problem, that's step 2 in learning.\n\nYou remembeer what they showed you, you get annoyed you can't do it, then in the future you notice anything else going on, which is sort of like that, and try to figure out if that could help you do the cool thing they showed you in the past.\n\nYou sort of get wiser regarding that particular issue, until you eventually notice something additional, and now understand enough to make use of the lesson they gave you.\n\nIn your case, you will either see  them again, or you won't.\n\nBut actually either way might accomplish any help they intended to give you.\n\nSome of the help they can give is just to make you notice something, which could be just a weird feeling that helps you sustain a vision of them.\n\nSo we naturally want the vision to return, but in fact it was the feeling of how to increase the duration of that vision, that was the lesson.\n\nYou felt it, so you got it.  Now it needs to soak in.\n\nI didn't see you mention the tensegrity you used either.\n\nMaybe you did in a past post, but I have a hard time keeping track of such things.\n\nDidn't give details of your struggle for silence, which makes me think there's no struggle, didn't tell if you were doing eyes open or closed, which makes me think you have an understanding deficiency, and you didn't mention tensegrity.\n\nMakes me suspicious you're book deal obsessed, which would be normal for a beginner.\n\nBut that's fatal if you don't work hard to get over it.\n\nBeing obsessed with stories to tell to others harms our learning in ways no one but an advanced darkroomer could comprehend.\n\nFor instance, tonight I discovered that the stupidest tensegrity moves are actually designed to stir the emanations creating your physical body appearance.  Which makes us think those are stupid, when in fact they're the most important of all at o ur level.\n\nBut you won't understand that, if you obsess over visions and IOBs.\n\nIf you can manage to develop a long term mutating version of that vision you had, you might end up with an IOB helper, which will make it a lot easier to get to the bottom of the J curve.\n\nRecently we posted some lecture notes, and it was interesting to see that even the witches like to have an IOB around when venturing into the second attention. They said their dreaming attention lasts longer.\n\nThey didn't say it used to, when they were new to this.\n\nThey also said they go places the IOBs are afraid to go, which means, they use IOBs to this day, and like to have them go along.", "edited": 1639742508.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hownctw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s best I don&amp;#39;t interfere with that.

Now it needs to soak in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t see you mention the tensegrity you used either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you did in a past post, but I have a hard time keeping track of such things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t give details of your struggle for silence, which makes me think there&amp;#39;s no struggle, didn&amp;#39;t tell if you were doing eyes open or closed, which makes me think you have an understanding deficiency, and you didn&amp;#39;t mention tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Makes me suspicious you&amp;#39;re book deal obsessed, which would be normal for a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s fatal if you don&amp;#39;t work hard to get over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being obsessed with stories to tell to others harms our learning in ways no one but an advanced darkroomer could comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, tonight I discovered that the stupidest tensegrity moves are actually designed to stir the emanations creating your physical body appearance.  Which makes us think those are stupid, when in fact they&amp;#39;re the most important of all at o ur level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t understand that, if you obsess over visions and IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can manage to develop a long term mutating version of that vision you had, you might end up with an IOB helper, which will make it a lot easier to get to the bottom of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently we posted some lecture notes, and it was interesting to see that even the witches like to have an IOB around when venturing into the second attention. They said their dreaming attention lasts longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t say it used to, when they were new to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also said they go places the IOBs are afraid to go, which means, they use IOBs to this day, and like to have them go along.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ria5mu/blue_woman_and_a_cat/hownctw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1639741470.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ria5mu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}]

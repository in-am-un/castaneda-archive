We're not talking about your brain, for the most part.\n\nBut about how you choose to focus your awareness.\n\nWhere the beam of awareness from the assemblage point is pointing.\n\nWe live in a predatorial universe, where in order to survive you have to be aware that something else out there wants to eat you.\n\nIt's just the nature of organic life.\n\nAnd it leads to having to be careful where you focus your attention, so that you reserve some for checking if there's any imminent threat.\n\nHumans are very successful manipulators of the environment, to the point that we created artificial ones to live in, and managed to develop technology which allows us to pretend we don't live in the same dismal situation as animals in the wild.\n\nBut the influences are still there.\n\nAnd a good reaction to danger, is not self-pity.\n\nWe've all seen Hollywood's version of that. Possibly one even involved Marilyn Monroe in her first \"serious\" role, riding down a river on a raft with the hero, who had to slap her on the face because she got hysterical from the danger they were in.\n\nPoint being, self-pity is not an effective strategy. Animals don't want to die and they dislike pain as much as we do, but when in danger they don't resort to self-pity as a way to consider how to get out of it.\n\nBut we do.\n\nSelf-pity is our \"advisor\", which might explain why don Juan suggested Carlos learn to use death as an advisor instead.\n\nSomewhere deep down inside, you have a fundamental thing you turn to when pondering difficult situations. Important ones.\n\nAnd using self-pity as the reference is a very bad choice.\n\nIt also drives your double away. The most powerful half of yourself, does not occupy a flesh body.\n\nIt shares the luminous shell container with you, and so is \"part\" of you.\n\nJust as a puff is part of your double.\n\nAnd since it's all awareness here that we're talking about, because reality consists ONLY of the emanations, and awareness flowing in them, there's nothing more basic than considering how awareness behaves, and whether we can take advantage of that better than we currently do.\n\nWhich leads to the secret to all of sorcery.\n\nWhich as far as we know, is the only real form of magic.\n\nBesides technology.\n\nTechnology is the manipulation of the effects of the flow of awareness. With a heavy focus on the illusion of solid matter, time, and space. All three just emergent properties of the flow of awareness in specific ranges of the emanations.\n\nBut sorcery is the manipulation of awareness itself.\n\nAnd the key to it, is to restore your energy body so that you gain the ability to \"see\".\n\nSilent Knowledge.\n\nAt that point, you'll have endless teachers to take you further.\n\nYou'll literally be surrounded by them, giving you lectures on whatever topic you are curious about.\n\nIt won't do any good for beginners who will simply turn it into another mental trip, the way Buddhists go around on weird mental trips, forcing themselves into a tiny restrictive way of looking at things, with useless techniques supposedly able to help them out. Such as \"mindfulness\".\n\nBut the simple truth is, if you get rid of self-pity your energy body will return, and if you can maintain that state, you won't have need of help from anyone\n\nIt's just that, telling a beginner that is likely to turn them into a pompous pretender.\n\nI can't even imagine the horrible ways someone would pretend to have conquered \"self-pity\".\n\nBut eventually if you practice darkroom, or some other real technique done seriously from all the techniques we've been given, you can literally see self-pity as a \"thing\".\n\nI'm not going to describe it, but just imagine that you ultimately find out it's like a dinner plate balanced on the top of your head.\n\nMaybe in this analogy, everything you do in life requires you to keep that dinner plate centered on your head, and to hold your chin at the right angle so that it doesn't slide off.\n\nThat's how ludicrous self-pity is.\n\nBut you can't get rid of it by decorating the plate.\n\nYou could swap it out for the world's finest porcelain from China.\n\nBut it's still a silly dinner plate balanced on the top of your head.\n\nSo please, don't anyone pretend to have gotten rid of self-pity.\n\nUntil you can \"see\", that might even be impossible.\n\nMeaning, to learn the most basic and important thing in sorcery, to toss out self-pity so that your energy body eagerly returns to you forming a blue ball of energy around you into which you can climb like a magical vehicle, you have to get glimpses of what it's like to be self-pity free.\n\nAnd enough times to perceive it as an abstract \"object\".\n\nThen, you can learn how to just \"wipe it off\" with your palm.\n\nMoving your palm slowly and rhythmically to stroke it off your mind.\n\nOr wash it from your mind, but I hate to use that analogy because the evil Zen people use it as a marketing ploy.\n\n\"Cleaning the mirror of the mind\" they call it. Then the next says, \"Wrong! Where can the dust alight, since there actually is no mirror?\"\n\nAnd you end up with snobby EuroBuddhists, turning their noses up at everything Carlos said during private class lectures.\n\nDon't be like Buddhists sitting on a little throne, lording it over others. Shame on you, if you find that appealing!\n\nThe real thing isn't even a tiny bit like that.\n\nIt's non-human.\n\nIf you're chanting and ringing gongs while wearing colorful attention seeking robes, shaving your head so that you stand out even more, you're DROWNING in humanness!\n\nAs Florinda explained, you may use that ritual to INTEND to move your assemblage point, but it'll be a tiny shift only likely to produce the effects we always hear about which come from meditation.\n\nDrugs for the mind.\n\nNothing worth pursuing once you realize that sorcery breaks the laws of physics on a regular basis.\n\nWhen you can see things at that level of \"the mirror of the mind\", you are in abstract realms where being human no longer makes sense.\n\nIn that sorcery state of seeing, you'll notice self-pity as an object which you can remove.\n\nAnd the energy body will flow back to you, visibly.\n\nBrilliantly!\n\nI'm not sure why it tends to be blue or purple.\n\nOr whether for some it might be green.\n\nBut in my case, once I wipe self-pity from the air, from the second attention fog, blue magical sparkles form accompanied by clouds of purple engulfing my torso.\n\nWhen I exhale, it goes into the energy body. Which enjoys being able to breath for real. That might in fact be what causes it to form a \"ball\".\n\nYou gain the sight of the double, once you fully remove self-pity.\n\nNow the double is the master of phantom dreaming realms.\n\nIt's held back when it's \"married\" to your tonal rationality, but its powers are still present.\n\nAnd you can't help but want to exploit them.\n\nThat's the \"proper\" mindset for the tonal.\n\nNot self-pity.\n\nBut rather, self-exploitation.\n\nThat sounds bad from a social point of view, but that's motivated by viewing the world through the eyes of self-pity.\n\nSo that, \"self-exploitation\" sounds evil. Like exploiting innocent women and children.\n\nBut in fact, all we really consist of is awareness.\n\nReality around is, what people would worry you were exploiting, is an illusion.\n\nAnd true self-exploitation is more like calculus, than like manipulation of a real physical world. Calculus manipulates and exploits numbers.\n\nIn particular, the easiest way to learn what I'm talking about here is to explore why we perceive the second attention colors we do.\n\nAll of this can be applied to full daylight practices, but it's just not my thing.\n\nThe good news there is, darkroom spills over into the day automatically, so you don't have to worry about starting over.\n\nIn the dark however, you find that once the energy body is restored, there's no such thing as \"nothing there\".\n\nBecause there's \"nothing\" forcing you to flow your awareness in a particular direction.\n\nSo it can flow in any direction, not held back by the shiny world of \"the real\".\n\nAnd with the energy body restored you always \"see something\", even in jet blackness.\n\nBut for this explanation, what is there is not as important as how it changes.\n\nWhat determines what comes next.\n\nWhat's behind the double's phantom abilities. His ability to create anything, from nothing.\n\nGigantic freeway overpasses towering over you, are a piece of cake to the double. Using his dreaming abilities he roams in endless complete worlds, all the time.\n\nBut lacking purpose.\n\nFor that, your energy body needs you.\n\nSorcery calculus is that study of how things change.\n\nWhen you reach the most basic level of reality, and realize there is none.\n\nThat it's \"up for grabs\".\n\nEasiest to view in the second attention fog of the orange zone.\n\nThe bleached out fog.\n\nThe intense magic of the \"shift below\" and the second attention fog there, is a bit too distracting for studying something as subtle as how things change.\n\nThere's too many toys to play with in the red zone, where just stretching a puff can transform you into a giant. Or shrink you down to toad size.\n\nBut in the orange zone, where Carlos pointed out that a whitish light is visible on surfaces, you have an ideal playground for studying how things change.\n\nThe most basic version of that involves \"hues\".\n\nOne of the most difficult oil paint colors, is actually not very colorful at all.\n\nIt's grey.\n\nGrey can drive you mad, if you're an oil painter.\n\nBecause if you add some blue to it, it moves away from the viewer.\n\nAnd if you add some red, it moves towards the viewer.\n\nSomehow the HUE of gray, controls where it is on a flat surface. On the Z axis onto which you can't paint directly.\n\nAn oil painting is 2 dimensional, but proper use of \"hue\" can add a third dimension to it, without resorting to obvious 3D drawing tricks like distorting sizes and angles.\n\nIt won't do any good for me to give you a simple experiment because once you hear it, it dirties your link to intent.\n\nBest to find your own.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest is to gaze at the whitish light on surfaces, in perfect darkness, and try to figure out what color it is.\n\nYou'll discover that it's \"whitish\", which is just another name for grey.\n\nOur eyes in fact utilize the \"gray world\" color balancing scheme. They try to make all the pixels of color flowing into the eye, balance out to perfect grey with no hue.\n\nSo that if you stare at blue too long, then look at perfect white, you'll likely see the \"opposite\" color of blue, on that whitish surface.\n\nUntil the eye readjusts.\n\nI have no idea if that eye control mechanism plays a role in this, but it doesn't matter because if you play with \"what color is that whitish light?\", the whitish light starts to make suggestions.\n\nThey ripple across the virtual surface on which the whitish light is located.\n\nA surface that doesn't actually have to be there, if you turn on the lights.\n\nSo imagine you are looking at somewhat \"shimmery\" light on a flat surface, perhaps like the ripples of sunlight on calm waters, and you consider \"what color is it really?\"\n\nAnd you believe you have discovered it.\n\nIt's slightly yellowish!\n\nThe whitish light has an amber hue to it.\n\nBut \"amber\" is a trigger word in sorcery. If you say \"amber\", you just triggered half your Castaneda audience.\n\nAmber does not create a \"safe space\" for wanna be sorcerers.\n\nUntil they get over it.\n\nThe likely fact is, whitish light tinted towards amber, is probably the most common color to see.\n\nGazing at the ripples, or vibrating lines of the orange zone \"whitish light on surfaces\", if you believe you saw a slight amber tint, then naturally you're going to move your gaze a tiny bit to the left or right of that, to see if it's continuous.\n\nIs all of it amber?\n\nBut now, you just injected something else into the emanations.\n\nMovement.\n\nHere's where ABSOLUTE silence is needed, or this won't work.\n\nAs your gaze moves, you detect that the whitish light is not universally amber in hue.\n\nThe part to the left of where you were looking has a pinkish \"hue\".\n\nJust the slightest tint of pink, into the grey. Like an artist might mix to cause the surface to move towards the viewer.\n\nAnd now interested in learning more, you move your eyes slightly to the right of the original point at which you were gazing.\n\nWhere you notice, that location has a greenish hue. It's not pinkish, not amber, but instead it's definitely greenish. And even more so, once you \"notice\" that.\n\nThen something else results from the green.\n\nThe \"surface\" there recedes, the same way it will for an oil painter. Look at this drawing, and tell me that the greenish hue on the water, doesn't look like its a dip there, while the orange hued looks like a bump.\n\nSo that you now have a ripple in space. A visible distortion in the \"flatness\".\n\nThat might make you pan your eyes slowly back to the left because you've just discovered that new detail.\n\nScanning like that, you just lit the fuse on a bomb.\n\nIntent.\n\nIntent has what I estimate to be a 10 second fuse for intermediate sorcerers.\n\nSo that as you pan your eyes to scan, the surface slowly forms moving \"ripples\".\n\nYou accidentally intended it.\n\nNot on purpose, but in the purest sense. You \"expected\" something impossible, and so the active emanations themselves changed.\n\nAnd the ripples in space on the whitish light surface, ripple in hue also.\n\nAs some come towards you, they take on the reddish hues.\n\nPink, orange, and yellow are all \"reddish\" hues.\n\nAs they move away, they take on bluish hues.\n\nPurple and green are blueish hues.\n\nAnd they \"recede\" in space.\n\nExcept that purple is schizophrenic.\n\nIt's also a reddish hue.\n\nSo it can create the illusion of \"volume\".\n\nOf being puffy.\n\nJust a theory, but the puffs are purple and the energy body is blue.\n\nIt finally settles down, and is a virtual surface.\n\nSo it loses the reddish tint of the puffy possibilities of purple.\n\nKeep in mind, if you observe things like this you are arriving at Silent Knowledge and the \"presentations\" will soon begin.\n\nStudying how things change in the second attention, leads to uncovering silent knowledge presentations.\n\nSpecifically on that topic. But also, on any lingering concern.\n\nAnd in Silent Knowledge \"the abstract\" is also a valid presentation method.\n\nIt's a less concrete one, but it's still fully visual.\n\nYou can gaze slightly upwards to the right at the whitish light, a location Carlos himself pointed out to me, and you'll see some \"hues\" up there.\n\nMixed with active bits and pieces of the abstract.\n\nAnd you'll naturally want to slowly sweep your gaze across it.\n\nWhich causes it to flatten out with a single hue, and at the very edge a little point lights up intensely.\n\nFrom which text can flow.\n\nIt's don Juan's suggestion to read text, instead of viewing videos in the air.\n\nPerhaps the \"pomegranate dot\" don Juan recommended is just the right \"hue\" to propel things. It's a schizophrenic color, since it's blue tinted red. But with emphasis on moving towards you, due to the dominance of red.\n\nBeing a \"Reader of Infinity\" is in fact, being someone who studies \"calculus\" in the second attention fog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sorcery Calculus", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Practical Magic"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"jw95t7nh2xoc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178921d8b4f25e372fed173a51b908bba4163546"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72e1bb3f1c91d8c0ebc871e793b07f6ceea02ae4"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46f822afef2c127a174c32eea7c163c3bfb6f673"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f2b0ae6e6e80d57c2ff3e56d8208c59a629b517"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5dd5fb64d1195ac6db387eb10e9f3744f1b7345"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20caaefa934fe90d519dbde07ebe6a54d3ce929e"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edb0f00287f95268e74e991b8bb61829164b6e75"}, "id": "jw95t7nh2xoc1"}}, "name": "t3_1bgta9j", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Practical Magic", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 48, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Aro4fmz5FM-0QU3MiUViSbR2SSSOgGJdcsVx2iHwhbc.jpg", "edited": 1710690959.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1710666468.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=edb0f00287f95268e74e991b8bb61829164b6e75\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/jw95t7nh2xoc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=edb0f00287f95268e74e991b8bb61829164b6e75&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hidden in plain sight in the books of Carlos and the witches, are advanced sorcery topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they aren&amp;#39;t what you&amp;#39;d expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, all of the readers of the books of Carlos are drowning in self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s the only thing that keeps you from having full sorcery powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it drives your sentient energy body away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And through practicing sorcery, you eventually come face to face with self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find it to be all that&amp;#39;s left in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If one could use the term &amp;quot;mind&amp;quot; loosely.

Then the next says, &amp;quot;Wrong! Where can the dust alight, since there actually is no mirror?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you end up with snobby EuroBuddhists, turning their noses up at everything Carlos said during private class lectures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be like Buddhists sitting on a little throne, lording it over others. Shame on you, if you find that appealing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real thing isn&amp;#39;t even a tiny bit like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s non-human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re chanting and ringing gongs while wearing colorful attention seeking robes, shaving your head so that you stand out even more, you&amp;#39;re DROWNING in humanness!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Florinda explained, you may use that ritual to INTEND to move your assemblage point, but it&amp;#39;ll be a tiny shift only likely to produce the effects we always hear about which come from meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drugs for the mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing worth pursuing once you realize that sorcery breaks the laws of physics on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can see things at that level of &amp;quot;the mirror of the mind&amp;quot;, you are in abstract realms where being human no longer makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that sorcery state of seeing, you&amp;#39;ll notice self-pity as an object which you can remove.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the energy body will flow back to you, visibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brilliantly!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why it tends to be blue or purple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or whether for some it might be green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in my case, once I wipe self-pity from the air, from the second attention fog, blue magical sparkles form accompanied by clouds of purple engulfing my torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I exhale, it goes into the energy body. Which enjoys being able to breath for real. That might in fact be what causes it to form a &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You gain the sight of the double, once you fully remove self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the double is the master of phantom dreaming realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s held back when it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;married&amp;quot; to your tonal rationality, but its powers are still present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t help but want to exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; mindset for the tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But rather, self-exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sounds bad from a social point of view, but that&amp;#39;s motivated by viewing the world through the eyes of self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that, &amp;quot;self-exploitation&amp;quot; sounds evil. Like exploiting innocent women and children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, all we really consist of is awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality around is, what people would worry you were exploiting, is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And true self-exploitation is more like calculus, than like manipulation of a real physical world. Calculus manipulates and exploits numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In particular, the easiest way to learn what I&amp;#39;m talking about here is to explore why we perceive the second attention colors we do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this can be applied to full daylight practices, but it&amp;#39;s just not my thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news there is, darkroom spills over into the day automatically, so you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about starting over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the dark however, you find that once the energy body is restored, there&amp;#39;s no such thing as &amp;quot;nothing there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; forcing you to flow your awareness in a particular direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it can flow in any direction, not held back by the shiny world of &amp;quot;the real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with the energy body restored you always &amp;quot;see something&amp;quot;, even in jet blackness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for this explanation, what is there is not as important as how it changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What determines what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s behind the double&amp;#39;s phantom abilities. His ability to create anything, from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gigantic freeway overpasses towering over you, are a piece of cake to the double. Using his dreaming abilities he roams in endless complete worlds, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But lacking purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that, your energy body needs you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery calculus is that study of how things change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you reach the most basic level of reality, and realize there is none.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;up for grabs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easiest to view in the second attention fog of the orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bleached out fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intense magic of the &amp;quot;shift below&amp;quot; and the second attention fog there, is a bit too distracting for studying something as subtle as how things change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s too many toys to play with in the red zone, where just stretching a puff can transform you into a giant. Or shrink you down to toad size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the orange zone, where Carlos pointed out that a whitish light is visible on surfaces, you have an ideal playground for studying how things change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most basic version of that involves &amp;quot;hues&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most difficult oil paint colors, is actually not very colorful at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s grey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grey can drive you mad, if you&amp;#39;re an oil painter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because if you add some blue to it, it moves away from the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you add some red, it moves towards the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow the HUE of gray, controls where it is on a flat surface. On the Z axis onto which you can&amp;#39;t paint directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An oil painting is 2 dimensional, but proper use of &amp;quot;hue&amp;quot; can add a third dimension to it, without resorting to obvious 3D drawing tricks like distorting sizes and angles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t do any good for me to give you a simple experiment because once you hear it, it dirties your link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best to find your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the simplest is to gaze at the whitish light on surfaces, in perfect darkness, and try to figure out what color it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll discover that it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;whitish&amp;quot;, which is just another name for grey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our eyes in fact utilize the &amp;quot;gray world&amp;quot; color balancing scheme. They try to make all the pixels of color flowing into the eye, balance out to perfect grey with no hue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that if you stare at blue too long, then look at perfect white, you&amp;#39;ll likely see the &amp;quot;opposite&amp;quot; color of blue, on that whitish surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the eye readjusts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if that eye control mechanism plays a role in this, but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because if you play with &amp;quot;what color is that whitish light?&amp;quot;, the whitish light starts to make suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ripple across the virtual surface on which the whitish light is located.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A surface that doesn&amp;#39;t actually have to be there, if you turn on the lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So imagine you are looking at somewhat &amp;quot;shimmery&amp;quot; light on a flat surface, perhaps like the ripples of sunlight on calm waters, and you consider &amp;quot;what color is it really?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you believe you have discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s slightly yellowish!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whitish light has an amber hue to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;amber&amp;quot; is a trigger word in sorcery. If you say &amp;quot;amber&amp;quot;, you just triggered half your Castaneda audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amber does not create a &amp;quot;safe space&amp;quot; for wanna be sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until they get over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The likely fact is, whitish light tinted towards amber, is probably the most common color to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing at the ripples, or vibrating lines of the orange zone &amp;quot;whitish light on surfaces&amp;quot;, if you believe you saw a slight amber tint, then naturally you&amp;#39;re going to move your gaze a tiny bit to the left or right of that, to see if it&amp;#39;s continuous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is all of it amber?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now, you just injected something else into the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where ABSOLUTE silence is needed, or this won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As your gaze moves, you detect that the whitish light is not universally amber in hue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The part to the left of where you were looking has a pinkish &amp;quot;hue&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just the slightest tint of pink, into the grey. Like an artist might mix to cause the surface to move towards the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now interested in learning more, you move your eyes slightly to the right of the original point at which you were gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you notice, that location has a greenish hue. It&amp;#39;s not pinkish, not amber, but instead it&amp;#39;s definitely greenish. And even more so, once you &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then something else results from the green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; there recedes, the same way it will for an oil painter. Look at this drawing, and tell me that the greenish hue on the water, doesn&amp;#39;t look like its a dip there, while the orange hued looks like a bump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you now have a ripple in space. A visible distortion in the &amp;quot;flatness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That might make you pan your eyes slowly back to the left because you&amp;#39;ve just discovered that new detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scanning like that, you just lit the fuse on a bomb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent has what I estimate to be a 10 second fuse for intermediate sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that as you pan your eyes to scan, the surface slowly forms moving &amp;quot;ripples&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You accidentally intended it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not on purpose, but in the purest sense. You &amp;quot;expected&amp;quot; something impossible, and so the active emanations themselves changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the ripples in space on the whitish light surface, ripple in hue also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As some come towards you, they take on the reddish hues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pink, orange, and yellow are all &amp;quot;reddish&amp;quot; hues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As they move away, they take on bluish hues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Purple and green are blueish hues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they &amp;quot;recede&amp;quot; in space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that purple is schizophrenic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also a reddish hue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it can create the illusion of &amp;quot;volume&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of being puffy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a theory, but the puffs are purple and the energy body is blue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It finally settles down, and is a virtual surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it loses the reddish tint of the puffy possibilities of purple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, if you observe things like this you are arriving at Silent Knowledge and the &amp;quot;presentations&amp;quot; will soon begin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Studying how things change in the second attention, leads to uncovering silent knowledge presentations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically on that topic. But also, on any lingering concern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in Silent Knowledge &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot; is also a valid presentation method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a less concrete one, but it&amp;#39;s still fully visual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can gaze slightly upwards to the right at the whitish light, a location Carlos himself pointed out to me, and you&amp;#39;ll see some &amp;quot;hues&amp;quot; up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mixed with active bits and pieces of the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll naturally want to slowly sweep your gaze across it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which causes it to flatten out with a single hue, and at the very edge a little point lights up intensely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From which text can flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s don Juan&amp;#39;s suggestion to read text, instead of viewing videos in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the &amp;quot;pomegranate dot&amp;quot; don Juan recommended is just the right &amp;quot;hue&amp;quot; to propel things. It&amp;#39;s a schizophrenic color, since it&amp;#39;s blue tinted red. But with emphasis on moving towards you, due to the dominance of red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a &amp;quot;Reader of Infinity&amp;quot; is in fact, being someone who studies &amp;quot;calculus&amp;quot; in the second attention fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b23a3d62-e446-11ec-9ff2-264132f2edf3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "1bgta9j", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1bgta9j/sorcery_calculus/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1bgta9j/sorcery_calculus/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1710666468.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kvf2szd", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1710765614.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kvcy7ou", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I'll add something else to help out with this.

However, that fixation should be light, funny, and void of morbidity and grimness. They should be done for the hell of it without really expecting returns.\"\n\nHe gave the example of one of his cohorts, a sorcerer by the name of Silvio Manuel, whose delight and predilection was to adapt the magical passes of the sorcerers of ancient times to the steps of his modern dancing. Don Juan described Silvio Manuel as a superb acrobat and dancer who actually danced the magical passes.\n\n\"The nagual Elias Ulloa,\" don Juan continued, \"was the most prominent innovator of my lineage. He was the one who threw all the ritual out the window, so to speak, and practiced the magical passes exclusively for the purpose for which they were originally used at one time in the remote past; for the purpose of redeploying energy.\n\n\"The nagual Julian Osorio, who came after him,\" don Juan continued, \"was the one who gave ritual the final death blow. Since he was a bona fide professional actor who at one time had made his living acting in the theater, he put enormous stock into what sorcerers called the shamanistic theater. He called it the theater of infinity, and into it, he poured all the magical passes that were available to him. Every movement of his characters was imbued to the gills with magical passes. Not only that, but he turned the theater into a new avenue for teaching them. Between the nagual Julian, the actor of infinity, and Silvio Manuel, the dancer of infinity, they had the whole thing pegged down. A new era was on the horizon! The era of pure redeployment!\"\n\nDon Juan's explanation of redeployment was that human beings are perceived as conglomerates of energy fields; sealed energetic units that have definite boundaries which don't permit the entrance or the exit of energy. Therefore, the energy existing within that conglomerate of energy fields is all that each human individual can count on.\n\n\"The natural tendency of human beings,\" he said, \"is to push energy away from the centers of vitality, which are located: on the right side of the body at the edge of the rib cage on the area of the liver and gallbladder; on the left side of the body, again, at the edge of the rib cage on the area of the pancreas and spleen; on the back directly behind the other two centers around the kidneys and above them on the area of the adrenal glands; at the base of the neck on the V spot made by the sternum and clavicle; and around the uterus and ovaries in women.\"\n\n\"How do human beings push this energy away, don Juan?\" I asked.\n\n\"By worrying,\" he replied. \"By succumbing to the stress of everyday life. The duress of daily actions takes its toll on the body.\"\n\n\"And what happens to this energy, don Juan?\" I asked.\n\n\"It gathers on the periphery of the luminous ball,\" he said, \"sometimes to the point of making a thick bark like deposit. The magical passes relate to the total human being as a physical body, and as a conglomerate of energy fields. They agitate the energy that has been accumulated in the luminous ball and return it to the physical body itself. The magical passes engage both the body itself as a physical entity that suffers the dispersion of energy, and the body as an energetic entity which is capable of redeploying that dispersed energy.\n\n\"Having energy on the periphery of the luminous ball,\" he continued, \"energy that is not being redeployed, is as useless as not having any energy at all. It is truly a terrifying situation to have a surplus of energy stashed away; inaccessible for all practical purposes. It is like being in the desert, dying of dehydration, while you carry a tank of water that you cannot open, because you don't have any tools. In that desert, you can't even find a rock to bang it with.\"\n\nThe true magic of the magical passes is the fact that they cause crusted-down energy to enter again into the centers of vitality, hence the feeling of well-being and prowess which is the practitioner's experience.\n\nThe sorcerers of don Juan's lineage- before they entered into their excessive ritualism and ceremony- had formulated the basis for this redeployment. They called it saturation; meaning that they inundated their bodies with a profusion of magical passes in order to allow the force that binds us together to guide those magical passes to cause the maximum redeployment of energy.\n\nI asked him once, without really meaning to be sarcastic, \"But don Juan, are you telling me that every time you crack your joints, or every time I try to imitate you, we are really redeploying energy!\"\n\n\"Every time we execute a magical pass,\" he replied, \"we are indeed altering the basic structures of our beings. Energy which is ordinarily crusted down is released and begins to enter into the vortexes of vitality of the body. Only by means of that reclaimed energy can we put up a dike; a barrier to contain an otherwise uncontainable and always deleterious flow.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Anything your heart desires,\" she said. \"You're doing fine so far. I cannot guide you, though, for I am not your dreaming teacher. I am simply a fat witch who actually takes care of the other witches. It was my partner, Delia, who delivered you into the sorcerers' world, just like a midwife. But she was not the one who first found you. Florinda did.\"\n\n\"Who is Florinda?\" I giggled uncontrollably. \"And when did she find me?\"\n\n\"Florinda is another witch,\" Clara said matter-of-factly, then began to giggle too. \"You met her. She's the one who took you into her dream in Esperanza's house. Do you remember the picnic?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" I sighed appreciatively. \"You mean the tall woman with the husky voice?\" A radiance filled me. I had always admired tall women.\n\n\"The tall woman with the husky voice,\" Clara confirmed: \"She found you a couple of years ago at a party you attended with your boyfriend; a plush dinner in Houston, Texas, at the house of an oilman.\"\n\n\"What would a witch be doing at a party in an oilman's house?\" I asked.\n\nThen the full impact of her claim hit me. I was dumbstruck. Although I didn't remember seeing Florinda, I certainly did recall the party. I had gone with a friend who flew in his private jet from Los Angeles just to attend that party and flew back the next day. I was his translator. There had been several Mexican businessmen at that party who didn't speak English.\n\n\"Jesus!\" I exclaimed under my breath. \"What a weird turn of events!\"\n\nIn great detail I described the party to Clara. It was the first time I had been to Texas. Like some star-struck movie fan, I ogled the men, not because they were handsome but because they looked so outlandish to me in their Stetson hats, pastel-colored suits, and cowboy boots. The oilman had hired entertainers. They had staged a variety show, worthy of Las Vegas, in a nightclub grotto built especially for the occasion. It throbbed with loud music and strobe lights. And the food had been superb.\n\n\"But why would Florinda attend such a party?\" I asked.\n\n\"The world of sorcerers is the strangest thing there is,\" Clara said by way of an answer.\n\nShe jumped up, like an acrobat, from a sitting position to a standing one, without using her arms. She paced about the room, back and forth in front of my mat. She looked formidable in her full, dark skirt, her cowboy denim jacket - colorfully embroidered in the back - and her sturdy cowboy boots. An Australian hat, pulled low over her brow as if to protect her from the noonday sun, added the last touch to her eccentric, outlandish appearance.\n\n\"How do you like my outfit?\" she asked, pausing in front of me.

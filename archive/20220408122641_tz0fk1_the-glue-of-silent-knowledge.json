And maybe spreading gossip is actually harmful.\n\nSo the town gossip \"ups the ante\".  She says, \"Yes, but did you know, Mrs. Robinson was born a man???\"\n\nIf you seem not to be spreading her fame all over the neighborhood by repeating the gossip, she just escalates, so that you can't resist.\n\nThat's what SK is like.  But keep in mind, as it turns out SK is CENTRAL to all of the sorcery as we've learned it.\n\nIt's in everything.  Even the tensegrity summons it.\n\nI believe, SK is actually how humans interface to intent.  If you consider that you can fairly quickly learn to look sideways into a puff of purple light, which is a piece of our energy body, and find \"crystalline details\" or tiny dreams on the edges of it, you realize that our ability to \"recognize\" things is connected to actually looking for them.\n\nIf you don't look, you don't recognize anything.\n\nI'm suggesting the \"looking\" is focusing your awareness.  \"Summoning\" if you will.  Trying to \"know\" something that isn't yet specific.\n\nThen you catch some tiny flicker, if you are using darkroom gazing, and by watching it out comes a completely finished object.  Or a peaceful scene of a lake.\n\nThat was SK!  You \"summoned it\".\n\nBut the books are FILLED with that.  We just didn't understand.\n\nLet's take the \"Men of Knowledge\".  As you all know, I don't  think much of those guys.  They were motivated by greed.  To be \"magic man\" bakers, dancers, mask makers, and healers.\n\nThere were so many of them,  as there are of fakers in our community trying to sell really bad sorcery knowledge, that the Olmec government required a license to do that.\n\nWe don't want to be men of knowledge!   We want to copy the \"old seers\".\n\nExactly!!!\n\nUntil the very end, and then the only difference is we elongate our luminous eggs instead of twisting them backwards, so we can mess with other people even more.  We seek \"the non-human unknown\".  Like Nyei's interactions with Stars.\n\nThe Men of Knowledge never learned to \"see\".  Which means, they could not view Silent Knowledge directly.\n\nAnd here's a secret that should nearly be obvious.   No SK, no really cool magic.  Sorcery is completely boring and nearly pointless without it.\n\nThe Men of Knowledge made up for their inability to perceive SK directly, by using drugs to move their assemblage points, and a ritual to engage the help of their Ally.\n\nNotice I said, the drugs engage the Ally.  If you don't have an Ally, the drugs only damage you.\n\nSo the Men of Knowledge had rituals, to summon SK.  Or to \"serve\" it I suppose, in some form designed by the ritual.\n\nIn one, it was talking lizards who would answer questions you put to them. Impossible stuff you should not be able to know.  And that was the cool part of the technique, not getting high on Devil's Weed.  It was the fact that you had talking lizards, telling you things you couldn't possibly know, without magic.\n\nLittle Smoke pretended to be a moth, and sent moth dust to Carlos, so he could view people he summoned as mushroom shapes.  Then by looking at the shapes, Carlos could learn to interpret them and know stuff about those people.\n\nLittle Smoke plus a ritual and a steady shroom diet, allowed Carlos to perceive SK before he was able to do that on his own.\n\nBut there's more. It's everywhere in what we do.\n\nThe dreaming emissary?  SK.  The inorganic being behind that, simply \"channels\" SK to us.\n\nSame as they've always done for humans!  You almost have to wonder if it even makes much sense to the inorganic beings.  The stuff they \"teach us\".\n\nI have a feeling it's a little like telling a kid about all the collectable \"Squinkies\" as if you understand why tiny plastic dolls are cool. Besides only being 50 cents to get a new one from the vending machine at the grocery store.\n\nYour \"knowledge\", which you are telling the little kid, comes from the product brochure.\n\nSo I'm a little suspicious about whether the dreaming emissary really deserves credit for teaching you.  But it's still pretty fun to watch!   The emissary will wear a school teacher's mini skirt outfit for you, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nTonight I was emphasizing the visual results of tensegrity, and trying to \"follow\" the lights and colors it produces, back to their \"origin\".\n\nI learned that in SK mode.  I wanted to know how to tell my Allies apart.  I'm afraid, unless they help me out with costumes and such, they're just a blurry face on a pink cloud.\n\nThe storyteller commented, \"That's why you should never use their name, except in an emergency.  Because no one can get them right and you don't want to feel like you disrespected one of your inorganic beings.\"\n\nI don't know if that's true, but it's good advice to me.  I sure can't tell which is which anymore.\n\nBut in SK mode, all I had to do was gaze at the blurryface and I noticed, that's coming from a streak of pink, stretching far back beyond the dark room. And as I looked closer, I sort of \"summoned\" knowledge about where that IOB came from.\n\nIt was the same old trick.  Silent Knowledge came to me through an Ally.  But she was only \"helping\".  She wasn't really the source.\n\nIn this case, there was no ritual involved. I just asked her to \"stand still\" a while so I could see how she comes and goes.  When I finished looking to see where the streaks came from, I found myself looking inside a cave with other little faces staring back.  Her \"home\".\n\nRemember this:  Tensegrity is designed to hook us to magic.  I don't know what forms of magic but it's not just one.   It certainly \"builds\" the energy body.  And you can gaze into the purple light used to do that, and summon SK.  Little dreams, sparkles, or objects, viewed through that energy body's pieces.\n\nSo \"energy body magic\" is one form.  But the energy body is merely working, in that case, as a \"summoner\" of silent knowledge,  when you see the details inside it.  It becomes an \"oracle\".\n\nSo there are at least 2 forms of powerful magic, which the tensegrity helps us learn.\n\nDon't forget about the SK part!\n\nWatch for details.  That's how the assemblage point moves beyond finding the puffs.\n\nThe puffs are real.  Those are pieces of your double.  Finding those only requires your assemblage point move down the back.  But to reach silent knowledge and view it directly, you have to move the assemblage point the rest of the way, on the J curve.\n\nUse your senses, don't fall into fantasizing in your mind with internal dialogue.\n\n\"Luke!!!  Use the force!!!\"\n\nI can't help myself with that one, because I got a visit from the Storyteller again.\n\nHe said, \"So, you don't like stories eh?  Is that what you claimed??\"\n\nOld Luke materialized in the second attention fog, with Ray sitting on a big rock.  Luke said, \"And binding it all together?\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, had a series of visions, and said, \"A force!\"\n\nThe storyteller seemed to be gloating a bit.\n\nI instantly understood the analogy.  She had focused on the thing that connects it all.  That's \"intent\".\n\nWhen focused on it, little visions of places all over the island appeared, to teach  her the lesson of how things are connected.  Because that was the lesson she was seeking.\n\nI wish I know who wrote that stuff!\n\nThe whole Star Wars movie series is based on the idea behind the books of Carlos.  The Mandalorian series even admits, the Jedi are actually very old enemy sorcerers to the commerce minded Mandalorians.\n\nThey were the \"Old seers\"...  Literally.\n\nAnd anywhere in the movies when someone needs to summon magical help, they are told to focus on intent.  On \"the force\".\n\nIt's in the middle of it all.\n\nBut when you focus on it, it doesn't zap you with energy or give you a kundalini rush up  your spine.\n\nThose are things you can pretend or imagine, so they're very popular with fake magic systems like Hindusm.\n\nWith real magic, you get knowledge. Visions of the future even!\n\nAnd not in a bad dream because you dozed off during meditation.\n\nIt's real, \"wide awake\" magic.\n\nThat's our situation.  In the middle of all we do is Silent Knowledge, summoned by cleaning your link to intent.  So you don't cloud your vision of it.\n\nEven that detail is in those Star War movies.  The force becomes cloudy, and it becomes hard for Yoda to see the future.\n\nThe link becomes dirty with too many possibilities in mind at the same time.\n\nSilent Knowledge is \"served\" according to what you are \"looking for\".  It can be \"served\" to you in many ways.  Rituals,  Allies, Tensegrity, the whitish light,  inside the edges of pieces of our energy body.\n\nWhen it begins to flow, you can let it freely move from topic to topic, each one summoning a full on dream vision, into which you may even find yourself entering.\n\nThat method is a little bewildering, I don't recommend it at first.\n\nAnd don Juan did not either.  I think that's what the old seers liked best in the end, because they allowed movies to play on the walls of their home, or in the sky.  That's a sure fire way to get \"sucked in\" to SK mode.\n\nSo don Juan suggested reading text instead.  And Carlos emphasized it for us, with his \"readers of infinity\" publication.\n\nAnd in private class.  He explained, find the whitish light, and it can form \"a wall\". Then you can see stuff on that wall.  Certainly text, as don Juan recommended.  But the text can come from \"the whorl\", which appears in association with \"the wall\".  And entire pages can form, it doesn't have to spit out like a typewriter.\n\nThis I heard him say in private classes.   He showed the example of looking at an entire page of text, written on your palm.\n\nThen there was the poster the blue scout likely painted.  It showed a little city materializing in the second attention haze.  Carlos emphasized, that was one view of \"the wall\".  He handed out the posters so we would remember it.\n\nAll lost now...\n\nYou can't fake SK, unless you start to lie and say \"well, my seeing is not visual\".\n\nOk, but how lame is that?\n\nMaybe you need to put in some work?\n\nAre we supposed to believe you are \"broken\".\n\nOr you are \"above visions\"?   Perhaps a Daoist???  You're just \"wonderful\", with no need to actually experience any real magic?\n\nMaybe, but imagine the harm to the community if anyone can make up such things.\n\nIn fact, they do!\n\nLet's stick with actually seeing stuff visually for a while, to weed out pretending?\n\nNot that you can't summon SK through feeling, or sound, or touch.\n\nThose cobwebs can summon it.  You feel around for them, and when they get easy to feel everywhere your skin can start to crawl as if the whole thing is \"creeping you out\".\n\nBut really, your assemblage point is moving faster.  Triggered by feeling.\n\nSound too!  The storyteller gave me an entire show of sounds.  Women walking by outside and I could visibly see through the wall to watch them talking.  Then all around me, women's voices in the surrounding houses.\n\nThen a motorcycle gang invaded the entire city, and I could hear them zooming around all over.\n\nEach of those were likely real sounds, but once I was focused on them in SK mode they \"summoned\" knowledge of what they were.\n\nWhere they were located.\n\nI even got to see the \"motorcycle gang\".\n\nIt was just some Los Angeles lawyers taking their expensive \"hog\" toys out for a spin at night.\n\nPlaying tough gang to make up for their nerdy day job.  They might sue you, but beating you up wasn't on their list of things they liked to do.\n\nSo keep in mind.  Darkroom works best if you keep focusing your attention anywhere you can \"detect\" something.  A sparkle, a woman's face on a puff of pink, the sharp edges of a intense purple puff of color.\n\nYou need to pull those puffs to your body too, that's critical.\n\nYou need to gather the energy body closer, so it can behave as an assistant, instead of separate \"magic puffs\" you can form into anything you like.\n\nAnd while you gather it closer, don't neglect to remember SK!\n\nLooking at your energy body clinging to your torso, even if it's not well formed, will summon \"knowledge\" of the energy body.\n\nYou do that by intending to see it, without interfering with what you see.  At least, not much.\n\nDo it right, and you'll be able to visually see how to \"dent it\".\n\nFor SK it's best to have a \"single topic\",  according to the examples in the early books.\n\nYou get to ask the Lizard one question.  Don't accidentally ask him 2 questions, because the other is floating around in your mind.\n\nThe result will be confusing.  It'll still work, but you won't be able to  understand the results.\n\nOr look at it like this, if you dare.\n\nSK is always there.  The reason you don't normally see it is because your internal dialogue has become the \"selector\".\n\nAnd it's a mess!\n\nSK still comes to us, but it's in the form of \"tiny understanding\" about the things that obsess our internal dialogue.  Stuff like, \"how dare she say that to me?\"\n\nThat's an Sk selector!  Eventually, you will in fact get some SK on \"how dare she\".\n\nBut you won't even notice it, because there are 100 more \"selectors\" for SK going on at the same time, in your noisy mind.\n\nCarlos designed the Tensegrity to try to cut back on that, and we all understood we needed to be silent.\n\nWe just didn't learn to do that, because it's so hard.\n\nSo Carlos emphasized long forms, hoping the muscle memory needed would help reduce our internal dialogue.\n\nAnd he emphasized the \"Fierce Kylie Stare\" while doing it.\n\nThat's also a technique to summon SK!\n\nAngry SK?\n\nThat's Cholita's job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Glue of Silent Knowledge", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"tn2tud964cs81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tn2tud964cs81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e14e58bd2f7ed43c53a4e0a413d22555936d0a03"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tn2tud964cs81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1879926463eb7b5447e3b2e53039c4da4f826195"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tn2tud964cs81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e9c26b598d710641e10f0466f5ebf0a5d341296"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tn2tud964cs81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=618d37e8dc0c08b81fd860a808f716a6806fa371"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tn2tud964cs81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d21f27fb3e61fdabc99d8a078ab0be86fd15eb"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tn2tud964cs81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ccd8f332eadaba6fbdf033d6454a895669f6ff9"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tn2tud964cs81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=965932cb02e95cd7196ca7b4ee5863108caaa7dd"}, "id": "tn2tud964cs81"}}, "name": "t3_tz0fk1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_2zS41iJ6sJ2aOFAN1LfKhkbydDkJ1Gj-97xnmoOQgo.jpg", "edited": 1649439184.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1649413601.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tn2tud964cs81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=965932cb02e95cd7196ca7b4ee5863108caaa7dd\"&gt;Ok...

But the energy body is merely working, in that case, as a &amp;quot;summoner&amp;quot; of silent knowledge,  when you see the details inside it.  It becomes an &amp;quot;oracle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there are at least 2 forms of powerful magic, which the tensegrity helps us learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget about the SK part!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch for details.  That&amp;#39;s how the assemblage point moves beyond finding the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs are real.  Those are pieces of your double.  Finding those only requires your assemblage point move down the back.  But to reach silent knowledge and view it directly, you have to move the assemblage point the rest of the way, on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use your senses, don&amp;#39;t fall into fantasizing in your mind with internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Luke!!!  Use the force!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help myself with that one, because I got a visit from the Storyteller again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;So, you don&amp;#39;t like stories eh?  Is that what you claimed??&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old Luke materialized in the second attention fog, with Ray sitting on a big rock.  Luke said, &amp;quot;And binding it all together?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes, had a series of visions, and said, &amp;quot;A force!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The storyteller seemed to be gloating a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I instantly understood the analogy.  She had focused on the thing that connects it all.  That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When focused on it, little visions of places all over the island appeared, to teach  her the lesson of how things are connected.  Because that was the lesson she was seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I know who wrote that stuff!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole Star Wars movie series is based on the idea behind the books of Carlos.  The Mandalorian series even admits, the Jedi are actually very old enemy sorcerers to the commerce minded Mandalorians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were the &amp;quot;Old seers&amp;quot;...  Literally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And anywhere in the movies when someone needs to summon magical help, they are told to focus on intent.  On &amp;quot;the force&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in the middle of it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you focus on it, it doesn&amp;#39;t zap you with energy or give you a kundalini rush up  your spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are things you can pretend or imagine, so they&amp;#39;re very popular with fake magic systems like Hindusm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With real magic, you get knowledge. Visions of the future even!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not in a bad dream because you dozed off during meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s real, &amp;quot;wide awake&amp;quot; magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s our situation.  In the middle of all we do is Silent Knowledge, summoned by cleaning your link to intent.  So you don&amp;#39;t cloud your vision of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even that detail is in those Star War movies.  The force becomes cloudy, and it becomes hard for Yoda to see the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The link becomes dirty with too many possibilities in mind at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge is &amp;quot;served&amp;quot; according to what you are &amp;quot;looking for&amp;quot;.  It can be &amp;quot;served&amp;quot; to you in many ways.  Rituals,  Allies, Tensegrity, the whitish light,  inside the edges of pieces of our energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it begins to flow, you can let it freely move from topic to topic, each one summoning a full on dream vision, into which you may even find yourself entering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That method is a little bewildering, I don&amp;#39;t recommend it at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don Juan did not either.  I think that&amp;#39;s what the old seers liked best in the end, because they allowed movies to play on the walls of their home, or in the sky.  That&amp;#39;s a sure fire way to get &amp;quot;sucked in&amp;quot; to SK mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don Juan suggested reading text instead.  And Carlos emphasized it for us, with his &amp;quot;readers of infinity&amp;quot; publication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in private class.  He explained, find the whitish light, and it can form &amp;quot;a wall&amp;quot;. Then you can see stuff on that wall.  Certainly text, as don Juan recommended.  But the text can come from &amp;quot;the whorl&amp;quot;, which appears in association with &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;.  And entire pages can form, it doesn&amp;#39;t have to spit out like a typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This I heard him say in private classes.   He showed the example of looking at an entire page of text, written on your palm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there was the poster the blue scout likely painted.  It showed a little city materializing in the second attention haze.  Carlos emphasized, that was one view of &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;.  He handed out the posters so we would remember it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All lost now...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t fake SK, unless you start to lie and say &amp;quot;well, my seeing is not visual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, but how lame is that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you need to put in some work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we supposed to believe you are &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you are &amp;quot;above visions&amp;quot;?   Perhaps a Daoist???  You&amp;#39;re just &amp;quot;wonderful&amp;quot;, with no need to actually experience any real magic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe, but imagine the harm to the community if anyone can make up such things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, they do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s stick with actually seeing stuff visually for a while, to weed out pretending?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that you can&amp;#39;t summon SK through feeling, or sound, or touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those cobwebs can summon it.  You feel around for them, and when they get easy to feel everywhere your skin can start to crawl as if the whole thing is &amp;quot;creeping you out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, your assemblage point is moving faster.  Triggered by feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sound too!  The storyteller gave me an entire show of sounds.  Women walking by outside and I could visibly see through the wall to watch them talking.  Then all around me, women&amp;#39;s voices in the surrounding houses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a motorcycle gang invaded the entire city, and I could hear them zooming around all over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each of those were likely real sounds, but once I was focused on them in SK mode they &amp;quot;summoned&amp;quot; knowledge of what they were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where they were located.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even got to see the &amp;quot;motorcycle gang&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just some Los Angeles lawyers taking their expensive &amp;quot;hog&amp;quot; toys out for a spin at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Playing tough gang to make up for their nerdy day job.  They might sue you, but beating you up wasn&amp;#39;t on their list of things they liked to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So keep in mind.  Darkroom works best if you keep focusing your attention anywhere you can &amp;quot;detect&amp;quot; something.  A sparkle, a woman&amp;#39;s face on a puff of pink, the sharp edges of a intense purple puff of color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to pull those puffs to your body too, that&amp;#39;s critical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to gather the energy body closer, so it can behave as an assistant, instead of separate &amp;quot;magic puffs&amp;quot; you can form into anything you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while you gather it closer, don&amp;#39;t neglect to remember SK!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at your energy body clinging to your torso, even if it&amp;#39;s not well formed, will summon &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; of the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do that by intending to see it, without interfering with what you see.  At least, not much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do it right, and you&amp;#39;ll be able to visually see how to &amp;quot;dent it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For SK it&amp;#39;s best to have a &amp;quot;single topic&amp;quot;,  according to the examples in the early books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get to ask the Lizard one question.  Don&amp;#39;t accidentally ask him 2 questions, because the other is floating around in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result will be confusing.  It&amp;#39;ll still work, but you won&amp;#39;t be able to  understand the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or look at it like this, if you dare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SK is always there.  The reason you don&amp;#39;t normally see it is because your internal dialogue has become the &amp;quot;selector&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a mess!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SK still comes to us, but it&amp;#39;s in the form of &amp;quot;tiny understanding&amp;quot; about the things that obsess our internal dialogue.  Stuff like, &amp;quot;how dare she say that to me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an Sk selector!  Eventually, you will in fact get some SK on &amp;quot;how dare she&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t even notice it, because there are 100 more &amp;quot;selectors&amp;quot; for SK going on at the same time, in your noisy mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos designed the Tensegrity to try to cut back on that, and we all understood we needed to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just didn&amp;#39;t learn to do that, because it&amp;#39;s so hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos emphasized long forms, hoping the muscle memory needed would help reduce our internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he emphasized the &amp;quot;Fierce Kylie Stare&amp;quot; while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also a technique to summon SK!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angry SK?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s Cholita&amp;#39;s job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "tz0fk1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tz0fk1/the_glue_of_silent_knowledge/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/tz0fk1/the_glue_of_silent_knowledge/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1649413601.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_tz0fk1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_tz0fk1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i3y0vbg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i3xmnlr", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Flashes are a thing.\n\nYou get more and more of those, the further you go on the J curve.

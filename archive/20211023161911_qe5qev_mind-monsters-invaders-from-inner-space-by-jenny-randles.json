Having performed his rounds, he settled in\nto watch the security monitors.\n\nOn one of the screens, he noted one of the workers walking towards the\nbuilding's rear gate through the loading bay. As the security guard\ncontinued to watch, he suddenly saw a strange, fuzzy white glow appear\nand cover the area where the factory worker was standing.\n\nIt caused a kind of electromagnetic interference which briefly affected\nthe quality of the picture on the screen. The glow continued for a few\nseconds and then disappeared, as suddenly as it had arrived. When it had\ngone, the cameras returned to working normally - but the man had\ndisappeared.\n\nA later frame-by-frame analysis of the security videotape shows the\nfactory worker's near-instant disappearance, swallowed up by the glow.\n\nThe security guard reports that he went to search for his colleague,\nbut could not find him anywhere. He was at a complete loss to explain\nwhat had happened.\n\nEVENTUALLY, he returned to his post in front of the security monitors.\nThen, one hour and 50 minutes later, as he continued to watch the\nscreens, to his great astonishment he saw the missing worker return.\n\nAgain, the videotape tells the full amazing story.

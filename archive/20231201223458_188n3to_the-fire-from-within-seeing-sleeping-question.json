Westerly Witches can do that.\n\nAs for a prelude to \"seeing\", you've simply shifted your assemblage point during sleep and as a result you can see odd things.  Or experience time distortion.\n\nWe have quite a few beginners in here who have done that, and even seen pieces of their energy body that way.\n\nIt won't be a prelude to *seeing*.

Hoping you can imagine results, or skip all the work.\n\nSo you can get attention from others.\n\nNot because you actually want to learn to make this stuff work.\n\nEveryone did that, even our leaders at Cleargreen.\n\nUntil the last 5 years when this subreddit came along as a result of the two Allies Carlos left us.\n\nYou MUST remove your internal dialogue nearly absolutely, for perhaps 2 hours for a beginner, before your assemblage point moves into alignment with that of your double.

Just ignored the context and what the participants had been working hard to learn before that, for years.\n\nWhich allowed them to do something in the books.\n\nPeople skipped all the work they read about, and just tried to pretend to do the \"tale of power\" they read about.  By imitating it.\n\nIf you don't find a METHODICAL way to get a tiny bit of real magic daily, and then use that to perfect removing your internal dialogue, it's hopeless.\n\nSorcery doesn't happen at random.\n\nIt's a 100 mile long road.\n\nWhere you only get to make 1 foot of progress each day, and only if you work hard.\n\nWorse, sorcery is a gift from infinity.\n\nWhich REQUIRES you make an impressive effort.\n\nA half effort will result in nothing.\n\nWell...\n\nHalf might get you some visible puffs and an Ally.\n\nBut not seeing.\n\nRemember, the \"Man of Knowledge\" had allies.\n\nBut they never learned to *see*.", "edited": 1701470533.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kblyg3s", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the book is seemingly contradicting another part, where whenever you see the luminous sphere you see it from the front, not as if it were walking around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So apparently there&amp;#39;s a difference between the &amp;quot;sphere&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;cocoon&amp;quot; in this context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s interesting!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered why there were wavy tentacles which are easily visible just by moving to the beginning of the orange zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On this map Carlos gave us (I added the pictures):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/\"&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t get further than that green station zone in the upper right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;ve used this method from &amp;quot;Fire From Within&amp;quot; on Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until she caught me, and blocked it.  Westerly Witches can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for a prelude to &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ve simply shifted your assemblage point during sleep and as a result you can see odd things.  Or experience time distortion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have quite a few beginners in here who have done that, and even seen pieces of their energy body that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t be a prelude to &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;. And it won&amp;#39;t last very long.  If you go to the bathroom, it&amp;#39;ll pretty much return to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believing sleeping is a path to sorcery knowledge is the usual confusion which has plagued our community for the last 55 years, and contributed greatly to preventing anyone from learning any sorcery at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People tried to pretend their results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re doing here.  Hoping you can imagine results, or skip all the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can get attention from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not because you actually want to learn to make this stuff work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone did that, even our leaders at Cleargreen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the last 5 years when this subreddit came along as a result of the two Allies Carlos left us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You MUST remove your internal dialogue nearly absolutely, for perhaps 2 hours for a beginner, before your assemblage point moves into alignment with that of your double.  Which is where you can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a video on how you &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icCEcjDfhIU&amp;amp;list=PLI0sRqIalXH6XrHuhA31NVVVn_4X6C48d&amp;amp;index=3\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icCEcjDfhIU&amp;amp;list=PLI0sRqIalXH6XrHuhA31NVVVn_4X6C48d&amp;amp;index=3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you&amp;#39;ve done perhaps is move your assemblage point 4 inches down the back, a common thing people notice when sleeping and waking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It needs to move 8 feet more to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get &amp;quot;previews&amp;quot;, but if you are half asleep they&amp;#39;re not much different than ordinary dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which are not, and never were said to be, a path to sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People misread the books.  Just ignored the context and what the participants had been working hard to learn before that, for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which allowed them to do something in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People skipped all the work they read about, and just tried to pretend to do the &amp;quot;tale of power&amp;quot; they read about.

The awareness will expand and dissipate.\n\nExcept, sorcerers found an alternative container.\n\nThe earth's shell, more than likely.\n\nWe see many examples in the books and workshop lectures, of how your awareness can share someone else's container.  The death defier is supposedly taking refuge in Carol Tiggs.\n\nThe blue scout seems to be a body snatcher, if you look at her history, and think about it rationally.\n\nOr Carlos liked her and wrote her into the story.  Not sure which it is.\n\nOne theory on how a Nagual (double) forms is, a death in the womb, just prior to the next birth.  The energy didn't leave, and the new baby gets the whole thing.\n\nSo, the new seers go on their \"definitive journey\" by sharing the cocoon of the earth, and then projecting themselves across the universe.\n\nOr, you can take refuge in the IOB cave, and explore the universe from there.\n\nWhy that's considered dreadful, I have no idea.\n\nYou do end up with an audience.  And they can influence the outcome by helping you out a little too much.

If we hadn't been made paranoid about it, people in a sorcery community would talk about nothing else.  They'd call the bottom of the J curve the \"sweet spot\".\n\nYou can explore anywhere in the universe at the orange zone.\n\nBut it's not \"fun\".

It's essentially applied silent knowledge, but in low resolution. Don't underestimate the power of perceiving pieces of that phantom room, because each sweep to look around lights up more emanations, which moves the assemblage point to make that more real.  It's a fast way to enter silent knowledge fully.\n\nBut a phantom bedroom doesn't feel nearly as good as an IOB cave used for the same purpose, because the phantom bedroom is mostly old tired emanations being \"re-skimmed\".\n\nIt's leftovers casserole.\n\nIOB cave is exotic takeout.  Much more fun.\n\nA sweep looking at your phantom bedroom reveals at best, a nice vivid detail here or there.\n\nA sweep through an IOB cave phantom bedroom, reveals a huge audience.  You now have fans in the darkroom, like a crowd cheering on a sports team.  And their presence lights up shared emanations you never used before.  That gives you nearly unlimited energy, as long as you don't return to self-reflection.  Meaning, you don't get tired and want to stop.\n\nHow to get there?  To let your phantom bedroom actually be the inside of part of their world?\n\nSeems to be just a matter of a color change.  The phantom room is dull grey.\n\n\"Noticing\" a hue associated with the IOB's world, is enough to bring you there.\n\nBut you'd have to have had an IOB in your darkroom enough times to form that sort of connection.  If you did, then you notice the hue, for instance brown, and as you scan for details, you start to pick up rock or dirt tunnel features.  Or even ice, as in the case of Fancy's cave.\n\nLily's cave is hard angled rock.  It just looks like the inside of a real cave made from rock.  Fairies was like conglomerate dirt.\n\nSo you won't miss that you relocated; it's obvious as you scan with your *seeing*.  Silent knowledge is in fact seeing.\n\nYou can never fully leave an IOB world, the same way you can never really leave Disneyland, once you have visited a few times.\n\nIt's familiarity.  An unknown power we have. To believe we know something.\n\nIt alters which emanations are skimmed.\n\nThe IOB realm is in some ways like a virtual world ride at an amusement park.

You sat in a chair, and it looked like you were in an airplane.\n\nYou can do that in our phantom bedroom if you fear IOBs, but it's vastly more powerful in their realm.  I suspect that's how Carlos and Carol ended up in a shack, worrying the IOBs were going to trap them there.\n\nBut mostly, if you use silent knowledge in an IOB cave, you can travel to different realities and be living in them like that.\n\nIn your phantom bedroom, you can also simulate travel, but it's still on the walls so it feels safer.\n\nTo make that more vivid, you have to find the inside of your shell, and try to move the assemblage point to make that more red or dark brown.    The dull grey is too tiring for much travel, you'll get bored easily.\n\nBut if you can make a phantom bedroom with some color, red or dark brown (dark amber) probably being the easiest, it'll be invigorating.\n\nYou will literally be able to gaze towards a detail on your phantom bedroom wall, and slowly move in that direction, as if going through space in that direction.\n\nObject after object can materialize as the \"detail\" at that spot in the room.\n\nSo for example, a huge thrill in the dully grey phantom bedroom might be noticing there's a picture frame on the wall, and you can actually make out a tiny bit of the painting.\n\nBut if you can make yourself a reddish brown phantom room that glows on the outer edges, each detail you manage to produce pulls you towards an entire world which contains that detail.\n\nBut you don't get sucked over there, you just get to sort of zoom in and have a closer look.\n\nIf you look for a dark bluish tint, you can relocate the phantom bedroom to outside, looking up into the night sky.  Then you can gaze for details in space, and get closeups of those sights,\n\nIt's pretty much the same principle as Patanjali's \"pole star\" sutra, although his technique is very crude by comparison.\n\nYou can transition from phantom bedroom to IOB realm as seen in a \"real\" sense.  You gaze slowly around your phantom bedroom, noticing that there's a faint superimposed dream hiding behind the dull grey.\n\nYou can cause it to change into a dream, in which you are standing.\n\nThat dream can be one an IOB taught  you, such as Lily's analogy of an old amusement park, being a replica of some aspect of the IOB world.  A view the men of knowledge would have liked, wheere you walk in as if it were a real place.\n\nBut before anyone starts thinking this sounds like a bad thing to learn (probably is), Emilito's escapades with grabbing people in dreams and walking around with them as if they were on sand dunes, with \"glory\" just over the hill, was just as bad.\n\nI thought we had lost that, because none of us was introduced.  No one \"showed\" it to us.\n\nBut as it turns out, the descriptions in the books are enough to find the intent trail and actually go there.\n\nIt can be entered as a dream hidden behind the phantom bedroom, the same as Lily's dream of that amusement park.\n\nI wouldn't mention it if I hadn't just done it a while ago.

I don't know if it will be useful to you, but Lily told me and it makes sense.\n\nIf darkroom isn't organized, you can miss making it to full HA.\n\nIf you don't make it to full HA, you sink back into self-pity.\n\nSo even if you were  holding a fairy in your hand 3 nights ago, and the Buddha himself materialized and congratulated you on your amazing accomplishments, if you miss going to HA for 3 days you'll start to feel bad at the start of practice.\n\nYou'll be back to square 1.\n\nAnd even though you'll know you can plod along (I like the thimble token myself), you've already been down that path playing that game, so many times.\n\nLong before you get to \"Park Place\", you'll be feeling bad about the whole thing. How much work it all is.\n\nI have no idea what's up with that, but I suppose our mood and our \"wisdom\" is really just a function of the position of the assemblage point.\n\nExcept, plus some \"hangover\".  There's something else that affects our mood, besides just where we are on the J curve.  Maybe it's some slight left horizontal shift thing?\n\nSo it's important to go as far as you have before, at least every 3 days.  Better every other day.\n\nLily put it this way:  \"We're commuters from the River of Filth.  We don't yet live on dry land.  You must get out of the river, at least every 3 days or you'll get pulled back under the shit.\n\nAnd then all you'll see is a few bubbles coming up.\n\nBut on the dry land, the breath changes, and you become satisfied with life.  \n\n\nWhen you can perceive the whitish light, you're right at HA.  The very start I assume.\n\nIt's just that it's \"formed\" already.\n\nWhen it's on all surfaces, and seems to have no observable form other than lines, that's full on HA.\n\nSilent knowledge is just around the corner.\n\nPlay with the light, and you'll experience silent knowledge.\n\nBut I suggest you need to get that phantom room to give up some of the light it's using.\n\nGaze at the  room, find a detail that's \"stable\" enough to grab, reach out the hand, and \"pull\" that off the wall, and into the room.\n\nI tried it last night, so I could not mislead anyone.\n\nYou can actually see some smoke moving along, as you pull the detail off the wall.\n\nTickle it with your finger tips, until it forms a surface.

There&amp;#39;s something else that affects our mood, besides just where we are on the J curve.

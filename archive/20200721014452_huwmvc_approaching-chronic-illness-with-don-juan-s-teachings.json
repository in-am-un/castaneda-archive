It happens when the assemblage point gets near the lower back.\n\nPersonally I find it hard to believe. \n\nBut I haven't seen anything in the books that didn't turn out to be a literal account of something that's actually pretty simple once you understand it.\n\nAnd I wouldn't want to bet against Cholita figuring out how to turn into some weird creature so she can squash me.\n\nShape-shifting is one of those things you hear about across all cultures and time.\n\nDemons too, and those turn out to be true.  They do exist!\n\nSo maybe shape-shifting isn't as nutty as it sounds.\n\nWe also have reports of one of the old sorcerers doing all kinds of modifications to his physical body.  He even figured out how to change from male to female.\n\nAnd to extend his lifespan.\n\nI think it might be possible to \"specialize\" in that shape-shifting range of the assemblage point.\n\nMyself, I just blow through there on the way to the orange zone where magic floats around in the air (seeing energy).\n\nIn the course of moving it all the way on that J curve,  to get to the fun areas, you learn the signs at various positions.\n\nThat ought to make it possible to hold it in the red line area.\n\nFor example, seeing vague colors is right at the top.  When they become purple, red, or green \"puffs\", that's a little deeper.  When blackness swirls around with them, that's even deeper.  \n\nSeeing the yin/yang whorl is even deeper.\n\nFurther down you start to perceive faint lines mixed in there. \n\nAnd further down, dark energy.  Creepy things.\n\nIt's a progression of predictable results.\n\nI'd guess the red zone is right there where dark energy becomes obvious.  But before dreaming fog is visible.\n\nIt's in the creep zone!\n\nNaturally you can skip down several levels without doing the ones individually, so that you see blackness right away.   Or you pick up some lines before you ought to.\n\nSome in this subreddit have done that.   When they saw puffs, they also saw the blackness.  \n\nAnd some saw lines in the puffs.\n\nBut some of that is due to power plant usage in the past. \n\nMust have made some \"smooth\" places where the assemblage point can slide faster.\n\nOthers got an orderly progression, verifying what I believed to be the order of effects.\n\nNaturally, what I'm explaining here is like what don Juan mentioned.  Sorcerers \"mapped\" the second attention.\n\nThey didn't do that out of intellectual curiosity!  Mapping it is the only way to make practical use of it, and to make it easier to teach.\n\nShifting left or right can be done by paying attention to what you *see*  at a given depth.  Spiritual to the left, physical to the right.\n\nSo, to slide down, watch for known effects. Colors, lines, dark energy, dreaming fog.\n\nDon't judge or revel in it. Just watch it in silence, so you can move.\n\nBut when you get to a given level, you can park your car and get out.  Then walk around in that spot.\n\nPlay with it without moving on.\n\nIt's basically all the same process for us at this point.  \n\nMove it manually with whatever we have.  Awareness primarily.\n\nThat means, notice something in the direction you want the assemblage point to move, while silent. The silence lets it move, because you don't keep thinking about this position of the assemblage point, with all the worries and fuming about stuff here.\n\nDon Genaro did a similar thing to Carlos, using the sound of the feet tapping, while he did the gate of power.  He lured his assemblage point in the direction he wanted it to go.\n\nBut he could do that, because Carlos was essentially silent all the time at that point in the story.\n\nSo rituals can also be used to move it.  Even something as simple as goosestepping.\n\nOr drums.\n\nBut we don't have any powerful ritual practitioners in the Castaneda community yet.  So it's not an option.\n\nIf we did, we'd know about it.   \n\nPeople don't keep real magic to themselves. They run around screaming about it, and trying to get others to learn it too.\n\nPeople who keep magic to themselves don't actually have any.   \n\nThat's easy to understand.  If you have a lot of food, way more than you need, only a bastard wouldn't offer it to starving people.\n\nAnd only a bastard would pretend to have magic, when they did not.\n\nSo be wary of looking for \"secrets\" out there.  \n\nIf it's secret, it's not worth knowing.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fyvppbv", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention, shape-shifting is in that diagram.

When they saw puffs, they also saw the blackness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some saw lines in the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some of that is due to power plant usage in the past. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must have made some &amp;quot;smooth&amp;quot; places where the assemblage point can slide faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others got an orderly progression, verifying what I believed to be the order of effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, what I&amp;#39;m explaining here is like what don Juan mentioned.  Sorcerers &amp;quot;mapped&amp;quot; the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t do that out of intellectual curiosity!  Mapping it is the only way to make practical use of it, and to make it easier to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shifting left or right can be done by paying attention to what you &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;  at a given depth.  Spiritual to the left, physical to the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to slide down, watch for known effects. Colors, lines, dark energy, dreaming fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t judge or revel in it. Just watch it in silence, so you can move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you get to a given level, you can park your car and get out.  Then walk around in that spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Play with it without moving on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s basically all the same process for us at this point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Move it manually with whatever we have.  Awareness primarily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, notice something in the direction you want the assemblage point to move, while silent. The silence lets it move, because you don&amp;#39;t keep thinking about this position of the assemblage point, with all the worries and fuming about stuff here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Genaro did a similar thing to Carlos, using the sound of the feet tapping, while he did the gate of power.  He lured his assemblage point in the direction he wanted it to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he could do that, because Carlos was essentially silent all the time at that point in the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So rituals can also be used to move it.  Even something as simple as goosestepping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or drums.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t have any powerful ritual practitioners in the Castaneda community yet.  So it&amp;#39;s not an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we did, we&amp;#39;d know about it.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;#39;t keep real magic to themselves. They run around screaming about it, and trying to get others to learn it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who keep magic to themselves don&amp;#39;t actually have any.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s easy to understand.  If you have a lot of food, way more than you need, only a bastard wouldn&amp;#39;t offer it to starving people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And only a bastard would pretend to have magic, when they did not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So be wary of looking for &amp;quot;secrets&amp;quot; out there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s secret, it&amp;#39;s not worth knowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/huwmvc/approaching_chronic_illness_with_don_juans/fyvppbv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1595431860.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_huwmvc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fyr16ke", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Happynewusername2020", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1595324226.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_huwmvc", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_5cor6icn", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "There is nothing you can do in this life but live with the cards your are dealt with.\n\nPracticing sorcery is the highest utilization of playing the game one can achieve, all others are just bluffing.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fyr16ke", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing you can do in this life but live with the cards your are dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practicing sorcery is the highest utilization of playing the game one can achieve, all others are just bluffing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/huwmvc/approaching_chronic_illness_with_don_juans/fyr16ke/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1595324226.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_huwmvc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fzcebey", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dissysissy", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1595800971.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_huwmvc", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_d3hwno9", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I have a health concern as well and I find when I gaze a lot, my symptoms improve.

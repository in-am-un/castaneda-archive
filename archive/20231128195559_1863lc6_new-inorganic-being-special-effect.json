That type of magic is called \"technology\".\n\nWe have that.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with sorcery.\n\nWhich as far as we know, is the only real form of magic which has survived the invention of money and cities.\n\nAt least, no one can point to any other which isn't obviously made up to steal from others.\n\nMeanwhile Sorcery is the manipulation of reality.  And reality is VAST.\n\nAnd takes decades to \"master\" even a tiny part of it.\n\nSo at first you just have to be content to get \"gifts\" as rewards for your efforts.\n\nAnd you can forget about repeating them.\n\nWhich is good!  There's more gifts available than one could witness in an entire lifetime.\n\nBest to see them only once, so that you see the next one as soon as possible.\n\nWhich by the way, is the way sorcerers have always been taught.\n\nOne gift at a time, with no ability to repeat them.\n\nAs it was in the past, so it is in the present, when it comes to sorcery.\n\nThat's why it's even possible.\n\nThe inorganic beings know there are endless possible magical gifts full well, so they make \"deals\" to teach you magic for hundreds of years.\n\nIf only you'll agree to live in their world for the next few million years.\n\nAfter which they'll still be around, but you'll have finally died.\n\nAnd they could keep that promise!\n\nOne day you'll get to learn from the dreaming emissary and then you'll realize she could in fact teach you for hundreds of years, without repeating anything.\n\nMiracles beyond words!\n\nWhich unfortunately, are mostly **inapplicable** back home.\n\nThat's one of the problems with sorcery.\n\nToo much magic, too many copies of \"you\", too many realities in which the magic happens.\n\nAs your assemblage point moves, so do you change and so does everything around you.\n\nThe same is true of the \"physical appearance\" of the inorganic beings.\n\nActually they have none here.\n\nBack home they're so alien you couldn't even describe them well.  \"Tubes\" is what I last read about this.\n\nBut here they just project their awareness into the flow of sensations coming to you from the emanations, into which you have flowed your own awareness, and what they \"added\" to your perceptions is turned, by your *attention*, into something real.\n\nExcept, it's not usually \"perfectly\" real.\n\nInside a dream it can be. But inside a dream you're \"Loopy\".  \"Out to Lunch\".  \"Easily amused\".\n\nIn the real world you might shift horizontally and find your inorganic being is so real, you start to worry if you didn't go mad and kidnap someone.\n\nBut that's very rare.\n\nMost of the time they're simply \"ethereal\".\n\nAnd \"inconsistent\" for the most part.\n\nHere's an attempt to use an animation special effect known as \"distortion field\" to simulate how the inorganic beings actually look, if you stay near to the middle of man's band of emanations in the red zone.\n\nUnfortunately the speed of animation special effects isn't easily modified.\n\nThis ought to be slowed down by a factor of 8 or so.\n\nBut I'd have to dig into raw (hidden) python code to do that.\n\nEven so, it's not bad!\n\nComments are welcome, from those who have seen inorganic beings.\n\nThis one is \"Ruby\" and belongs to Athena.\n\nShe looks oddly like a video game character.\n\nBut my \"Fairy\" looks oddly like Tinkerbell

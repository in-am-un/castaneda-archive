[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "If you learn to enter into dreaming directly from waking, you\u2019ll have some odd experiences regarding your memory.\n\nA lifetime of memory can seem to materialize in your mind, the instant you enter the dream.\n\nCarol Tiggs explained that you\u2019ve taken over someone else\u2019s body. Maybe not always, but in some dreams. She described a dream where she\u2019d wake up naked in bed with Carlos, and they\u2019d be experiencing a world they\u2019d visited many times before.  In that world they actually watched a child grow up, because they\u2019d returned so many times over the years.\n\nCarlos likened this to a strand of beads hanging down as part of a beaded curtain.\n\nYou can move up or down to any adjacent bead on your strand, but you can\u2019t leave your strand to jump to another.\n\nEach strand is the possible places a single individual may go. Each bead on that strand is an entire world.  Possibly, it\u2019s 600 beads long.\n\nGiven Carol Tiggs' description of one specific world they visited, presumably when you land on another bead you inherit the qualities of a person who belongs in that place.\n\nBut I can attest that it\u2019s not always this way. Sometimes you\u2019re just a visitor in a world. You don\u2019t inherit memories of another person.\n\nIt seems that you do however, always have a little more insight into the place you visit than you ought to.  Particular things, like there\u2019s a little market around the corner and you have money in your pocket.   Or stuff like, that animal won\u2019t bite but he really stinks.\n\nThe best way to get a clear view of the memory you inherit in dreaming, is to go directly from waking into dreaming. The gates of dreaming techniques are nice, but there\u2019s a rough period when you realize you\u2019re in a dream, and try to become fully lucid.\n\nThat\u2019s too disturbing for figuring out what you inherited in the new dream landscape.\n\nSometimes you inherit insights, sometimes you take over another person\u2019s knowledge, and at other times, you\u2019re \u201cre-living\u201d an event.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even have to be your own life event.\n\nDon Juan claimed any of us could relive the life of any of the past sorcerers in our lineage. You just need a little hook, and *intent* can locate the rest.\n\nI was once forcing silence to stop the world and noticed I could turn my head with zero effort. Painlessly, even pleasurably.\n\nNormally moving any part of our physical body comes with some discomfort, but not so with the dreaming body.\n\nAnd so you might only subconsciously realize you\u2019re turning your dreaming body head, and not your real head. But the fact that you can move it effortlessly, almost pleasurably,  comes to your awareness.\n\nSo you do.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me what happens to your \u201creal\u201d head.  So far I haven\u2019t tried to look back.\n\nThe same effect can happen if a dreaming portal opens up in front of you, in your bedroom at night.  If you can jump into it, you\u2019ll just know it.\n\nI suspect that\u2019s because you can feel the wonderfulness of being in a pain free dreaming body.  I\u2019ve been checking ages lately, and in dreaming Cholita is 20 years younger.\n\nIt makes sense to assume that you\u2019ll revert to the strongest copy of yourself you can remember.\n\nBut in this example, I wasn\u2019t jumping into a dream. I was turning my head.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what made the difference, but instead of looking into a dream, I was looking into a past event. I had turned my head to see a past event from the life of an apprentice of don Juan\u2019s lineage.\n\nWhen I turned it to the left, I was in a train station. I remembered it! I\u2019d traveled there many times. I could almost see the person I traveled there with. But I was so absorbed in the dream that it didn\u2019t occur to me to look.\n\nHow many times during the day do you look to make sure  who you\u2019re actually with?\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t occur to you. You already know.\n\nAnd so I was looking into a past events dream, but without any curiosity about how it could be. It just was.\n\nThus, it was a replay.\n\nWhen I turned my head back to the right, I was sitting on my bed forcing silence and the idea that I\u2019d ever been to that train station was pure delusion.\n\nI love that word now.  Delusion\u2026 It\u2019s so tasty.   All the good stuff, tossed out by the black magicians!\n\nAn entire buffet of fun things, and no one dares go near it!  They\u2019ll even curse you for suggesting it.\n\nIt's as if your weird spinster aunt, the one with bug eyes and bright red  hair, went to the family thanksgiving dinner and yanked all the delicious frosting, deserts,  and gravy from the table, tossing them into a huge black garbage can.   \n\n\"It's not nutritious!\", she keeps screaming.  \"It's delusional to partake of that stuff!\"\n\nThat's the nagual.  All the gravy and frosting. \n\nWhen I turned my head back from the nagual, to look away from that past event, I brought some of the memories with me. Some of the delusion was there for me to examine, using my reason.  I had frosting on my mouth.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough to create a flow of thought. It was only broken memories. And for that reason it still felt like delusion, even when I tried to logically follow what I remembered.\n\nWhen looking to the left, into that dream world, I could examine any memory I had in its original context. The flow of memories was sequential and perfect, and I was absolutely sure I had been there.\n\nThat\u2019s the nature of memories. If they seem to be continuous, they\u2019re convincing. If there\u2019s a break, they start to look more like delusion.\n\nSome find what are called, \u201cfalse memories\u201d during meditation. They can stick in the mind, and lead to confusion. For instance, a female Zen nun who remembers being attacked at night in the monastery, and doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s a false memory.  So she stirs up trouble without any specifics.\n\nWe can pick up entire streams of memories in an instant, when our internal dialogue is disturbed.\n\nIn recapitulation, I suspect that false memories are also somewhat common. I don\u2019t have enough input from people who write to me to be sure, but I\u2019m confident it\u2019ll turn out to be the case.\n\nIn that situation, you can play with the false memory. It\u2019s not a lot different than going back and forth in dreaming, except that if you try that for too long you\u2019ll almost surely end up in the dream.\n\nDuring recap, you can stay neutral. Playing on the edges, when practicing sorcery, is always a fast path to knowledge.\n\nIn Carlos\u2019 books, the highest goal of recapitulation seems to be reliving the events. He takes it to an absurd level at times, with him and la Gorda sharing past events freely and agreeing they feel like they\u2019ve lived for hundreds of years as a result.\n\nI\u2019ve never done that.  During recap the best I could manage is to get into a dream copy of the event. But the flow was interrupted by my lucidity.\n\nThe memory didn\u2019t proceed. It was stopped, and I was interfering with it by my presence.\n\nAccording to Taisha, if you want this kind of flexibility in recapitulation, you need to find the \u201cusher\u201d event.\n\nI take this to be the time when someone in your life finally got you to perceive the world as objects, and not energy.\n\nYou can observe this in babies. The younger they are, the more they stare without focusing.\n\nWhen they start to focus, you can tell that they\u2019re perceiving objects, and not just random colors and sights.\n\nFrom a previous post entitled, \u201cAnother Story from Cholita\u201d, we were given this:\n\n\u201cEveryone of us can 'see' energy - even now - but you are no longer aware of it. Infants on the other hand perceive energy directly. However, as they get older the 'Usher' introduces them to the world of ordinary reality. Instead of seeing amorphous energy, the infant one day will assemble the energy configuration into...a table. A toy. A dog. A tree. Each time the transformation comes from the Usher.\u201d\n\nAnd\n\n\u201cOrdinarily once the Ushers do their work of helping us perceive the various energy configurations as 'objects,' the assemblage point is fixed once and for all and the assemblage point does not move thereafter.\u201d\n\nAnd finally\n\n\u201cSorcerers say that the road is free only after a gigantic upheaval, after the appearance on our screen of the memory of an event that shakes our foundations with its terrifying clarity of detail. It's the event that drags us to the actual moment that we lived it. Sorcerers call that event the usher, because from then on every event we touch on is relived, not merely remembered.\u201d\n\nAnd so it seems that memory isn\u2019t what it appears to be.\n\nEdited: twice", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What is Memory?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_d1umbj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1568054172.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1568052640.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you learn to enter into dreaming directly from waking, you\u2019ll have some odd experiences regarding your memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lifetime of memory can seem to materialize in your mind, the instant you enter the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs explained that you\u2019ve taken over someone else\u2019s body.

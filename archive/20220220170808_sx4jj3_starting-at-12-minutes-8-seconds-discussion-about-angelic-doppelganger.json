Determined to save the life of her firstborn son, Duryodhana, Gandhari told him to appear before her naked. Duryodhana obeyed but covered his hips with a banana leaf out of modesty.

She was a princess of Gandhara and the wife of Dhritrashtra, the blind king of Hastinapura, and the mother of a hundred sons, the Kauravas, and a daughter. She always wore a blindfold in order to live like her husband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The epic tells the tale of what happens when Gandhari finally removes the blindfold. She does this twice in her life, once just before the war at Kuru-kshetra, and once only after. Both these stories come from folk retellings of the Mahabharata.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sages said that after years of covering her eyes, the first thing Gandhari would gaze upon would become invulnerable to all weapons. Determined to save the life of her firstborn son, Duryodhana, Gandhari told him to appear before her naked. Duryodhana obeyed but covered his hips with a banana leaf out of modesty. So when Gandhari saw him for the first time, she wept. She could save him, but not entirely. She realised he would die as was fated, with a blow to the hips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/a-leaders-gaze-determines-the-culture-of-the-organisation/articleshow/46210188.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;amp;utm_medium=text&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cppst\"&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/a-leaders-gaze-determines-the-culture-of-the-organisation/articleshow/46210188.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;amp;utm_medium=text&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cppst&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sx4jj3/starting_at_12_minutes_8_seconds_discussion_about/hyemjid/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1645810819.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_sx4jj3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}]

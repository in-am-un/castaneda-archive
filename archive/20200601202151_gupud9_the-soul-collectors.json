In fact, you\u2019ll be attacked over it.\n\nHow come?\n\nAnd why did the world decide to rid itself of magic, our primary resource?\n\nI have a theory.\n\nNo, not the fliers!\n\nI suspect it was agriculture.\n\nBefore agriculture, people were hunters and gathers.\n\nThey regularly moved from place to place, and everyone had value in the tribe.\n\nThe old women knew which herbs to use, and how to heal. Some learned to make coverings for protection.\n\nThe young women knew where to gather foods nearer to camp. Or how to make containers such as baskets and pottery.\n\nThe men went hunting for long periods of time.\n\nIt was a community, where everyone had unique value.\n\nThe men were free to roam, and as we\u2019ve seen in this subreddit, wandering around in the wild can easily introduce you to magic.\n\nIOBs in particular. For whatever reason, being out alone at night makes them visible on occasion.\n\nIf you become friends with an inorganic being, they'll teach you everything else you need to know to become a sorcerer.\n\nI suppose back before agriculture, men were covered in body paint and magical charms. It seems to be the case in movies about ancient peoples.\n\nMagic was in their blood and on their bodies.\n\nThe original hunter/gatherer cultures, ones where book deals weren\u2019t practical, typically had a shaman in charge of magic in that tribe.\n\nIt was certainly that way in Southern California, among the Indian tribes.\n\nYou can\u2019t have fake sorcerers, without book deals.\n\nAll the people would quickly figure out they\u2019re powerless, and no new people would keep filling in for the customers they lost.\n\nOr in some cases, the magical leaders were simply powerful people with awesome reputations, like Queen Boudica.  That was perhaps the case with warrior tribes.\n\nBut peaceful or warlike,  lifetimes were spent exploring and growing in knowledge.\n\nAnd in magical abilities.\n\nIt\u2019s our heritage. To explore and learn, and meet the unknown.\n\nThen came agriculture.\n\nSomeone discovered that wild corn cobs can grow in giant quantities near camp, if you just water them.\n\nAnd those chilies you have to get from the jungle, grow just fine outside your own hut.\n\nYou could even plant fruit and nut trees, which would feed the tribe for decades.\n\nAs long as they stuck around the same camp.\n\nI doubt this appealed to the hunters, but to the gatherers it was a revolution.\n\nAnd it allowed women to take over.\n\nThey began to work on the internal dialogues of the children, to adapt them for a life of agriculture.\n\n\u201cFamily must stick together\u201d was the new theme. Forget magic. There\u2019s nothing more important than family.\n\nFamily life was given almost entirely to tending crops and mating.\n\nNesting replaced exploring.\n\nCozy replaced the unknown.\n\nAs matters got worse, and humans began to grow so much food they could afford to feed people outside the tribe, the groups grew larger.\n\nTrading systems developed, where people might spend their entire lives producing no food at all, and yet survive all the same.\n\nCities formed.  People lost their intrinsic worth.\n\nTheir sense of worth was based on how many other people they could get attention from.\n\nThey lost touch with the real world.\n\nAnd families became vital sources for free labor.   Something they were never intended to be.\n\nInstead of living for their own exploration and growth, they began to cling.\n\nIt's a reason don Juan told Carlos to go live in that depressing hotel, until he didn't care if he was alone or with company.\n\nHe was trying to remove the brainwashing. Restore him to explorer status.\n\nMissing the original purpose for living,  human beings became \u201csoul collectors\u201d.\n\nTheir happiness was now controlled by how many other people they could bully.\n\nI liken it to the \u201cdeath eaters\u201d in Harry Potter movies.\n\nExcept in the real world, this world, the death eaters won.\n\nThe world was rid of magic.\n\nBig cities made matters worse. Isolated from even the food growing, people clinged to each other even tighter.\n\nThey made up myths, such as that you need to spend time with your fussy old controlling relatives, because you\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t, after they die.\n\nActually, I never saw that happen.\n\nExcept in a hallmark movie.\n\nThat particular myth, that you have to become a slave to the old, particularly appealed to the grandmothers who always outlive their husbands.\n\nThey added additional brainwashing to the children.\n\nGranny got  regular control of the kids, to help out mom.\n\nSo she did a number on their minds.\n\nSuch as the story of the old woman with no family, who has to eat cat food.\n\nDid you ever hear that one?\n\nPoor granny has no one, and has to eat cat food.\n\nExcept, it makes no sense. Cat food is very expensive.\n\nIt\u2019s not cheap!\n\nBetter that the cat eat beans and rice.  Everyone would have enough.\n\nIt's a nonsensical story of pity, designed to bully people.\n\nIt's the myth of a petty tyrant who oppresses with sadness.\n\nBack in the time of magic, that old granny would be a prized, wise leader in the tribe.\n\nBut she has nothing to do in the big city, and no way to grow.\n\nHer only chance is to stick to the plan, and collect as many souls as she can.\n\nInstitutions were created to feed off that idea.  Get some donations, by making granny feel justified in her pursuits of control over others.\n\nGod demands it!\n\nChurches and temples spread the word.\n\nGranny became the chief church goer in the family, always trying to get the young ones to copy her mistakes.\n\nThe cat food myth is actually a warning to young people. \n\nAnd also a threat.\n\nThe message is, it\u2019s important to collect as many souls as you can, before winter comes.\n\nIt\u2019s a gatherer\u2019s myth, translated to city dwellers.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of this speculation?\n\nI\u2019m afraid, if you keep practicing sorcery you\u2019ll find out.\n\nSoul collectors are not easy to escape. They use every device available to them to keep their prisoners.\n\nDon Juan advised Carlos to leave his family and friends.\n\nI did.\n\nThen Carlos himself sent me back.\n\nMaybe just so that I could learn what I just posted.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to work around the soul collectors.\n\nBut it can be done.\n\nEdited once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Soul Collectors", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Flyers (counter intent)"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 82, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ner2gxvxac251": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 63, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ner2gxvxac251.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=531ec458352d9f2a313444dfbdfdc64e1328cab5"}, {"y": 126, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ner2gxvxac251.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d71a048b7f388041f398585b24f5330f515f173"}, {"y": 187, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ner2gxvxac251.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91fb75b504e3ff44fda8382e7338e0fe9893eee5"}], "s": {"y": 364, "x": 620, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ner2gxvxac251.jpg?width=620&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68feedd8b02045b0e0206e7ec447f03a3e1a64e9"}, "id": "ner2gxvxac251"}}, "name": "t3_gupud9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Flyers (counter intent)", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/y3coQBIzDNuHiIVu6lJHS151LeEo4o6GD2fQfG_TPC8.jpg", "edited": 1591036194.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1591035711.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ner2gxvxac251.jpg?width=620&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=68feedd8b02045b0e0206e7ec447f03a3e1a64e9\"&gt;The Despicable Old Sorcerers Might Look Like This&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve always been a fan of Harry Potter movies, except that they\u2019re so dark it\u2019s not fun to watch them more than a few times each.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t watch the same gory train wreck too many times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First let me say, you can live in a Harry Potter movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Special effects wise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His movies have nothing on what you can do yourself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don\u2019t expect your friends to be happy about that.

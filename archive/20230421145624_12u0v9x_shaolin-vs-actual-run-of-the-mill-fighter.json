He told a story once about going to visit a very famous Yogi, who was standing at the top of the stairs coming down to greet Carlos.\n\nTripped, tumbled down the stairs, and died at the feet of Carlos.\n\nI might think Carlos was making up a story to teach us, but I've never heard any story from Carlos that didn't ultimately turn out to be true.\n\nAnd \"the spirit\" does things like that once in a while, as a teaching lesson.\n\nSuch as flooding the basement of the apartment Carlos lived in, in Arizona.\n\nJust because don Juan suggested it as a solution to the noisy kid practicing piano down there, disturbing the silence of Carlos all day long.\n\n(magical) Shit happens!\n\nThe blue scout story worries me, but once you get out into Silent Knowledge you realize we exist in 2 timeframes.  And one isn't as \"separate\" from the other as you might assume.\n\nCholita has a hard time believing that, even though she's the one who proves that for me!  \n\nI have to be very careful to keep track of which copy of Cholita I'm facing.\n\nYea, Bruce was cool. \n\nI don't care what anyone says; he had the absolute best spinning back kick. I took private lessons for a few months from the Hwa Rang Do leader,  trying to get as good as Bruce for that move.\n\nThe Koreans get fancy kick obsessed.

Just repetitive learning of stylized movements.\n\nLike Kabuki or tea ceremony.\n\nLikewise for Chinese martial arts.\n\nAll bad players.\n\nBUT, martial arts could be \"fixed\".\n\nEmphasize muscle memory above all else, and silence to increase the effectiveness of it.\n\nThen, \"shrinking the tonal\", so that at some points in the fight,  you are actually in your double.\n\nAnd completely invincible.\n\nI've seen Cholita do that!  In public switch to her double, and assault someone annoying her.\n\nShe shoved a grocery helper woman at Sprouts who dared to ask if she needed help with the cosmetics display.

Even when the first muscle memory attempt fails, it's modified by that very same muscle memory, and you push it back a bit  higher, so you can try again.\n\nYou begin to \"juggle\" it using muscle memory.\n\nCompletely unconsciously.\n\nToo bad there aren't any actually good martial arts schools!\n\nI tried to get some interested, and got doors slammed on my nose.\n\nIt's impossible to influence asian \"masters\".\n\nIt's rude to even suggest there's something they might want to look at.\n\nI'll try to lure them with cartoons.\n\nCholita and Jadey studied with Howard for years.\n\nMaybe I'll make westerly witch and policewoman give martial arts people a clue what's possible.\n\nEven leaping across the treetops.\n\nI'll try to recreate a scene from crouching tiger!\n\nMaybe a fight breaks out at Tata Pakora's festival, in the park where the Buddhists are gathered?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a524db12864c8572c30d6979977796069468206e", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jip0tmo", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abandon and observation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence would do the job.

Even when the first muscle memory attempt fails, it&amp;#39;s modified by that very same muscle memory, and you push it back a bit  higher, so you can try again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You begin to &amp;quot;juggle&amp;quot; it using muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Completely unconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too bad there aren&amp;#39;t any actually good martial arts schools!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to get some interested, and got doors slammed on my nose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s impossible to influence asian &amp;quot;masters&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s rude to even suggest there&amp;#39;s something they might want to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to lure them with cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita and Jadey studied with Howard for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;ll make westerly witch and policewoman give martial arts people a clue what&amp;#39;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even leaping across the treetops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to recreate a scene from crouching tiger!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe a fight breaks out at Tata Pakora&amp;#39;s festival, in the park where the Buddhists are gathered?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a524db12864c8572c30d6979977796069468206e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a524db12864c8572c30d6979977796069468206e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_12u0v9x", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/12u0v9x/shaolin_vs_actual_run_of_the_mill_fighter/jip0tmo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1683120693.0, "media_metadata": {"i4g1ve57unxa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0032377a085b048d9cdc3d446f725cbd7220d86b"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a957d759cb813202a4d736362e0e3427d410890"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=109dc07f00316856d8e378b53f523c392fc2a3f1"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b54b980a90237724463e55e4f8eaae0450ce912"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d41b42bfcfcc763fbb544b1979ed0236821c5a"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4082714a642365671f4cb44fe25ba520ec4c988b"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i4g1ve57unxa1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a524db12864c8572c30d6979977796069468206e"}, "id": "i4g1ve57unxa1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1683120693.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jinu6tb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Toltech99", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jil7m2r", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_iq49h", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That thing you mention, that elephant in the room that paralysis, exist.

This technique didn't get a lot of attention in the communities of practitioners, but is described in a book of being of a tremendous importance.\n\nDid anyone give it a try? Don Juan describes it in a simple way, but with a profound result. Some quotes below.\n\r\n\"The three of us are going to sit against a rock,\" don Juan said to me, \"and look at the sunlight\r\nas it is reflected on the eastern mountains. When the sun goes down behind the western peaks, the\r\nearth may let you see alignment.\"\r\nWhen we reached the top of a mountain, we sat down, as don Juan had said, with our backs\r\nagainst a rock. Don Juan made me sit in between the two of them.\r\nI asked him what he was planning to do. His cryptic statements and his long silences were\r\nominous. I felt terribly apprehensive.\r\nHe didn't answer me. He kept on talking as if I had not spoken at all.\r\n\"It was the old seers who, on discovering that perception is alignment,\" he said, \"stumbled\r\nonto something monumental. The sad part is that their aberrations again kept them from knowing\r\nwhat they had accomplished.\"\r\nHe pointed at the mountain range east of the small valley where the town is located.\r\n\"There is enough glitter in those mountains to jolt your assemblage point,\" he said to me. \"Just\r\nbefore the sun goes down behind the western peaks, you will have a few moments to catch all the\r\nglitter you need. The magic key that opens the earth's doors is made of internal silence plus\r\nanything that shines.\"\r\n\"What exactly should I do, don Juan?\" I asked.\r\nBoth of them examined me. I thought I saw in their eyes a mixture of curiosity and revulsion.\r\n\"Just cut off the internal dialogue,\" don Juan said to me.\r\"\n\n\"\"Today, with the help of Genaro, you are going to find the key that unlocks everything. You\r\nwon't be able to use it as yet, but you'll know what it is and where it is. Seers pay the heaviest\r\nprices to know that. You, yourself, have been paying your dues all these years.\"\r\nHe explained that what he called the key to everything was the firsthand knowledge that the\r\nearth is a sentient being and as such can give warriors a tremendous boost; it is an impulse that\r\ncomes from the awareness of the earth itself at the instant in which the emanations inside\r\nwarriors' cocoons are aligned with the appropriate emanations inside the earth's cocoon. Since\r\nboth the earth and man are sentient beings, their emanations coincide, or rather, the earth has all\r\nthe emanations present in man and all the emanations that are present in all sentient beings,\r\norganic and inorganic for that matter. When a moment of alignment takes place, sentient beings\r\nuse that alignment in a limited way and perceive their world. Warriors can use that alignment\r\neither to perceive, like everyone else, or as a boost that allows them to enter unimaginable worlds.\"\n\n\"I wanted to think about what both of them were saying, but my thoughts did not obey me.\r\nSomething was pressing down on me. I felt I was shrinking. I had a sensation of nausea. I saw the\r\nevening shadows advancing rapidly up the sides of those eastern mountains. I had the feeling that\r\nI was running after them.\r\n\"Here we go,\" Genaro said in my ear.\r\n\"Watch the big peak, watch the glitter,\" don Juan said in my other ear.\r\nThere was indeed a point of intense brilliance where don Juan had pointed, on the highest peak\r\nof the range. I watched the last ray of sunlight being reflected on it. I felt a hole in the pit of my\r\nstomach, just as if I were on a roller coaster.\r\nI felt, rather than heard, a faraway earthquake rumble which abruptly overtook me. The\r\nseismic waves were so loud and so enormous that they lost all meaning for me. I was an\r\ninsignificant microbe being twisted and twirled.\r\nThe motion slowed down by degrees. There was one more jolt before everything came to a\r\nhalt. I tried to look around. I had no point of reference. I seemed to be planted, like a tree. Above\r\nme there was a white, shiny, inconceivably big dome. Its presence made me feel elated. I flew\r\ntoward it, or rather I was ejected like a projectile. I had the sensation of being comfortable,\r\nnurtured, secure; the closer I got to the dome, the more intense those feelings became. They\r\nfinally overwhelmed me and I lost all sense of myself.\r\nThe next thing I knew, I was rocking slowly in the air like a leaf that falls. I felt exhausted. A\r\nsuction force started to pull me. I went through a dark hole and then I was with don Juan and\r\nGenaro.\"\n\r\n\"What do you mean, don Juan, by the only door there is?\"\r\n\"I mean that when man's assemblage point moves beyond a crucial limit, the results are always\r\nthe same for every man. The techniques to make it move may be as different as they can be, but\r\nthe results are always the same, meaning that the assemblage point assembles other worlds, aided\r\nby the boost from the earth.\"\r\n\"Is the boost from the earth the same for every man, don Juan?\"\r\n\"Of course. The difficulty for the average man is the internal dialogue. Only when a state of\r\ntotal silence is attained can one use the boost. You will corroborate that truth the day you try to\r\nuse that boost by yourself.\"\r\n\"I wouldn't recommend that you try it,\" Genaro said sincerely. \"It takes years to become an\r\nimpeccable warrior. In order to withstand the impact of the earth's boost you must be better than\r\nyou are now.\"\r\n\"The speed of that boost will dissolve everything about you,\" don Juan said. \"Under its impact\r\nwe become nothing. Speed and the sense of individual existence don't go together. Yesterday on\r\nthe mountain, Genaro and I supported you and served as your anchors; otherwise you wouldn't\r\nhave returned.

Its presence made me feel elated.\n\nPage 675-676 of the all-in-one PDF:\n\n\"In that  particular  vision I  had found myself  looking at  an outlandish world. There  was  an enormous  rock right  in front  of  my eyes, a  rock which had been split  in two. Through a  wide  gap in it  I  could see  a  boundless  phosphorescent  plain, a  valley of  some  sort, which was  bathed in a greenish-yellow  light. On one  side  of  the  valley, to the  right, and partially covered from  my view by the  enormous  rock, there  was  an unbelievable  domelike  structure. It  was  dark, almost  a charcoal  gray. If  my size  was  what  it  is  in the  world of  everyday life, the  dome  must  have  been fifty thousand feet  high and miles  and miles  across. Such an enormity dazzled me. I  had a sensation of  vertigo and plummeted into a  state  of  disintegration. \n\nOnce  more  I  rebounded from  it  and found myself  on a  very uneven and yet  flat  surface. It  was a  shiny, interminable  surface  just  like  the  plain I  had seen before. It  went  as  far  as  I  could see. I soon realized that  I  could turn my head in any direction I  wanted on a  horizontal  plane, but  I could not  look at  myself. I  was  able, however, to examine  the  surroundings  by rotating my head from  left  to right  and vice  versa. Nevertheless, when I  wanted to turn around to look behind me, I could not  move  my bulk. \n\nThe  plain extended itself  monotonously, equally to my left  and to my right. There  was  nothing else  in sight  but  an endless, whitish glare. I  wanted to look at  the  ground underneath my feet  but my eyes  could not  move  down. I  lifted my head up to look at  the  sky;  all  I  saw  was  another limitless, whitish surface  that  seemed to be  connected to the  one  I  was  standing on. I  then had a moment  of  apprehension and felt  that  something was  just  about  to be  revealed to me. But  the sudden and devastating jolt  of  disintegration stopped my revelation. Some  force  pulled me downward. It  was  as  if  the  whitish surface  had swallowed me. \n\nNestor  said that  my vision of  a  dome  was  of  tremendous  importance  because  that  particular shape  had been isolated by the  Nagual  and Genaro as  the  vision of  the  place  where  all  of  us  were supposed to meet  them  someday. \n\nBenigno spoke  to me  at  that  point  and said that  he  had heard Eligio being instructed to find that  particular  dome. He  said that  the  Nagual  and Genaro insisted that  Eligio understand their point  correctly. They always  had believed Eligio to be  the  best;  therefore, they directed him  to find that  dome  and to enter  its  whitish vaults  over  and over  again.\n\nPablito said that  all  three  of  them  were  instructed to find that  dome  if  they could, but  that  none of  them  had. I  said then, in a  complaining tone, that  neither  don Juan nor  don Genaro had ever mentioned anything like  that  to me. I  had had no instruction of  any sort  regarding a  dome. \n\nBenigno, who was  sitting across  the  table  from  me, suddenly stood up and came  to my side. He  sat  to my left  and whispered very softly in my ear  that  perhaps  the  two old men had instructed me  but  I  did not  remember, or  that  they had not  said anything about  it  so I  would not  fix my attention on it  once  I  had found it.\n\n\"Why was  the  dome  so important?\"  I  asked Nestor. \n\n\"Because  that's  where  the  Nagual  and Genaro are  now,\"  he  replied.\n\n\"And where's  that  dome?\"  I  asked.\n\n\"Somewhere  on this  earth,\"  he  said.\n\n I  had to explain to them  at  great  length that  it  was  impossible  that  a  structure  of  that  magnitude could exist  on our  planet.

Its presence made me feel elated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Page 675-676 of the all-in-one PDF:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In that  particular  vision I  had found myself  looking at  an outlandish world. There  was  an enormous  rock right  in front  of  my eyes, a  rock which had been split  in two. Through a  wide  gap in it  I  could see  a  boundless  phosphorescent  plain, a  valley of  some  sort, which was  bathed in a greenish-yellow  light. On one  side  of  the  valley, to the  right, and partially covered from  my view by the  enormous  rock, there  was  an unbelievable  domelike  structure. It  was  dark, almost  a charcoal  gray. If  my size  was  what  it  is  in the  world of  everyday life, the  dome  must  have  been fifty thousand feet  high and miles  and miles  across. Such an enormity dazzled me. I  had a sensation of  vertigo and plummeted into a  state  of  disintegration. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once  more  I  rebounded from  it  and found myself  on a  very uneven and yet  flat  surface. It  was a  shiny, interminable  surface  just  like  the  plain I  had seen before. It  went  as  far  as  I  could see. I soon realized that  I  could turn my head in any direction I  wanted on a  horizontal  plane, but  I could not  look at  myself. I  was  able, however, to examine  the  surroundings  by rotating my head from  left  to right  and vice  versa. Nevertheless, when I  wanted to turn around to look behind me, I could not  move  my bulk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The  plain extended itself  monotonously, equally to my left  and to my right. There  was  nothing else  in sight  but  an endless, whitish glare. I  wanted to look at  the  ground underneath my feet  but my eyes  could not  move  down. I  lifted my head up to look at  the  sky;  all  I  saw  was  another limitless, whitish surface  that  seemed to be  connected to the  one  I  was  standing on. I  then had a moment  of  apprehension and felt  that  something was  just  about  to be  revealed to me. But  the sudden and devastating jolt  of  disintegration stopped my revelation. Some  force  pulled me downward. It  was  as  if  the  whitish surface  had swallowed me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nestor  said that  my vision of  a  dome  was  of  tremendous  importance  because  that  particular shape  had been isolated by the  Nagual  and Genaro as  the  vision of  the  place  where  all  of  us  were supposed to meet  them  someday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Benigno spoke  to me  at  that  point  and said that  he  had heard Eligio being instructed to find that  particular  dome. He  said that  the  Nagual  and Genaro insisted that  Eligio understand their point  correctly. They always  had believed Eligio to be  the  best;  therefore, they directed him  to find that  dome  and to enter  its  whitish vaults  over  and over  again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pablito said that  all  three  of  them  were  instructed to find that  dome  if  they could, but  that  none of  them  had. I  said then, in a  complaining tone, that  neither  don Juan nor  don Genaro had ever mentioned anything like  that  to me. I  had had no instruction of  any sort  regarding a  dome. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Benigno, who was  sitting across  the  table  from  me, suddenly stood up and came  to my side. He  sat  to my left  and whispered very softly in my ear  that  perhaps  the  two old men had instructed me  but  I  did not  remember, or  that  they had not  said anything about  it  so I  would not  fix my attention on it  once  I  had found it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why was  the  dome  so important?&amp;quot;  I  asked Nestor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because  that&amp;#39;s  where  the  Nagual  and Genaro are  now,&amp;quot;  he  replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And where&amp;#39;s  that  dome?&amp;quot;  I  asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Somewhere  on this  earth,&amp;quot;  he  said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  had to explain to them  at  great  length that  it  was  impossible  that  a  structure  of  that  magnitude could exist  on our  planet. I  said that  my vision was  more  like  a  dream  and domes  of  that  height could exist  only in fantasies. They laughed and patted me  gently as  if  they were  humoring a  child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You want  to know  where  Eligio is,&amp;quot;  Nestor  said all  of  a  sudden. &amp;quot;Well, he  is  in the  white vaults  of  that  dome  with the  Nagual  and Genaro.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/f6zmjs/the_earths_boost/fi8pouk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1582245524.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_f6zmjs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

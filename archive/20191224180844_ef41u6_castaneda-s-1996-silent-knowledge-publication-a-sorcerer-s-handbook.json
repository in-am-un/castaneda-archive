Babies have as many as 10,000 connections per neuron (cell)!  One backwards is enough to make thousands of errors.\n\nWhen you hear that so-and-so made a 1 million neuron simulator (the brain has 100 billion), he's exaggerating his invention.\n\nI met the first guy.  He was introduced to me as being a prestigious pioneer in the computer field. \n\nSomeone wanted to sell him to me.\n\nThen I casually asked him, how many neural connections?\n\nHe left the room.\n\nHe's probably got 16 connections per simulated neuron.\n\nSo don't worry about Skynet for now.  \n\nWe have no AI.  Only simulators hyped up by Google.\n\nI'm building a device that can do 2000 for a billion neurons, which is astounding in the AI world.  Memory sockets up the yin-yang. Fills a small room. Blows your main power supply in seconds.\n\nAnd still, you couldn't even simulate a mouse.\n\nThe brain itself is merely an organic computer.  Even without understanding biochemistry, you can deduce things about it.\n\nIt has to have a \"bus\" to pass large amounts of data around, from one part of the brain to another.\n\nIt has to have buffering, to hold information that's not completely timed to be used up as it's finished.\n\nIt's going to have predictable delays from input, to output.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe deal with those things when we practice sorcery.  You can learn to *see* and manipulate the buffering portion, for example.  That's the source of any information you can gain in *seeing*.  It's just that if you can manipulate the buffer, you can toss less of it out. You have access to answers normally considered delusional.\n\nAnd you will always be facing those input to output delays. Some of them are responsible for the waking animation rate of inorganic beings. They animate faster in dreaming, because dreaming bypasses the input output delays.\n\nBut the miracle of a human brain is, it \"scoops\" intelligence from the universe.  \n\nIt's just a particular shape.  The shape has evolved to have certain prejudices, or \"pre-learning\" if you like.\n\nWhy can a baby giraffe stand and walk in the first hour after birth?\n\nIt's evolved the shape for that. Otherwise that baby gets eaten and doesn't pass on his \"shape\".\n\nBut the human genome only contains a few megabytes of information. It's nowhere near enough to produce \"intelligence\".\n\nThe rest of our understanding is scooped out of infinity. Some is used, some is tossed out, and you get \"intelligence\".\n\nIf you copied that exact shape, for instance by scanning Bob's brain, and simulated it in a computer, the result would not realize, it wasn't really \"Bob\".

Babies have as many as 10,000 connections per neuron (cell)!  One backwards is enough to make thousands of errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you hear that so-and-so made a 1 million neuron simulator (the brain has 100 billion), he&amp;#39;s exaggerating his invention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met the first guy.  He was introduced to me as being a prestigious pioneer in the computer field. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone wanted to sell him to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I casually asked him, how many neural connections?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He left the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s probably got 16 connections per simulated neuron.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t worry about Skynet for now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have no AI.  Only simulators hyped up by Google.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m building a device that can do 2000 for a billion neurons, which is astounding in the AI world.  Memory sockets up the yin-yang. Fills a small room. Blows your main power supply in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And still, you couldn&amp;#39;t even simulate a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The brain itself is merely an organic computer.  Even without understanding biochemistry, you can deduce things about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to have a &amp;quot;bus&amp;quot; to pass large amounts of data around, from one part of the brain to another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to have buffering, to hold information that&amp;#39;s not completely timed to be used up as it&amp;#39;s finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s going to have predictable delays from input, to output.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We deal with those things when we practice sorcery.  You can learn to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; and manipulate the buffering portion, for example.  That&amp;#39;s the source of any information you can gain in &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;#39;s just that if you can manipulate the buffer, you can toss less of it out. You have access to answers normally considered delusional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you will always be facing those input to output delays. Some of them are responsible for the waking animation rate of inorganic beings. They animate faster in dreaming, because dreaming bypasses the input output delays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the miracle of a human brain is, it &amp;quot;scoops&amp;quot; intelligence from the universe.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a particular shape.  The shape has evolved to have certain prejudices, or &amp;quot;pre-learning&amp;quot; if you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why can a baby giraffe stand and walk in the first hour after birth?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s evolved the shape for that. Otherwise that baby gets eaten and doesn&amp;#39;t pass on his &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the human genome only contains a few megabytes of information. It&amp;#39;s nowhere near enough to produce &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of our understanding is scooped out of infinity. Some is used, some is tossed out, and you get &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you copied that exact shape, for instance by scanning Bob&amp;#39;s brain, and simulated it in a computer, the result would not realize, it wasn&amp;#39;t really &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;.

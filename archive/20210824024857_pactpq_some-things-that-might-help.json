Your dreaming attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While looking, you force all words from your mind, so that you aren&amp;#39;t talking to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can have absolutely no words for 2 minutes, the assemblage point will jar loose, and try to shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; insures it drifts into the second attention, instead of back into self-reflection (worry, anger, thinking about the past, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe there&amp;#39;s a darkroom instructions post at the top of all of the main posts on the main page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#39;s what you don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This only works if your actions are similar to what the old seers did, to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of it as being a ritual, that summons the spirit of the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they stand in the room, and help you out with &amp;quot;gifts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll learn about &amp;quot;intent gifts&amp;quot; if you put the right amount of time into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t think that your amazing skills, past learning, and general overall &amp;quot;good guyness&amp;quot;, can help  you out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your Mom&amp;#39;s putting that picture on the fridge for a whole 6 months, back in the 3rd grade, won&amp;#39;t help you either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that can help you is a magical force we call &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So often, lucid dreamers fail miserably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As do astral travelers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just can&amp;#39;t stick to the single minded intent to find colors, and move them around in the air using Tensegrity, while forcing yourself completely silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t talking about not talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re talking about mental silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can see a color, or a streak, or anything vague you hope might be what you&amp;#39;re looking for, the level of silence, and duration, will determine if you make it to the next little picture on the J curve diagram.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but man!!!!  Look at those bottom pictures!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want that?  We got that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And nowhere else do I see anything that amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Done eyes open that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You like Tinkerbelle?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about Tinkerbelle in a see through sailor suit, like Sailor Moon?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can have that for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; once did that for me, and with a streak of wickedness in her mind, she &amp;quot;passed out&amp;quot;, so I could do with her as I pleased. She was just laying there on the floor, 100% real looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it was so real, I was worried about even toughing her with a finger, in case I&amp;#39;d made a mistake, and it was in fact a real person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as a scientist, I HAD to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I put my face no more than 2 inches from her body, all over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was NO WAY to tell she was not a real woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got hell over the sailor suit...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it seems it wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;dignified&amp;quot; enough for an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People are fine with a giant demon ready to murder you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a girl in a see through sailor suit, really tested the limits of their ability to believe things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bet Juan&amp;#39;s done worse with her!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fact is, they&amp;#39;ll do anything you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should find a subreddit that would like that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t be the same type of &amp;quot;bad players&amp;quot; in those subreddits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_pactpq", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pactpq/some_things_that_might_help/ha8375e/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1629846754.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1629846754.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ha7vkrz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "IndridColdwave", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ha778v8", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_4bh23f1k", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thank you again for your time and help.

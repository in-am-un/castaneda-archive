I can see shadows of images forming all around. Some of them horrorish faces, but some of them random events (someone sitting at a table, someone walking etc). There is still some fear  around what I will see, so I notice I don't stay on the images for long. It's still a bit too new.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA voice in me tells me to stand up and go explore (turn my head around it etc), but laying in bed feels more safe. The feeling accomponied by it is strange, I notice whenever I'm in the 'grid' I feel like I'm losing my identity. There is one feeling fighting against it. It tries to 'bargain' with the strange nothingness and says things like 'I will explore if someone will promiss me that it is all grounded in love.' And then I laugh knowing that beyond this treshold all human emotions don't apply in the same way I hold onto them now. It's like fighting the psychedelic you just took and demanding yourself to stay 'normal'. I try not to fight these fearful thoughts, because that defeats the purpose of wanting to go into the silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most vivid thing that happened was a bright fog growing to the size of a real life old timey television. There was a sports interview on, I could see the red fibers on the man's jacket, wrinkles around his eyes. It was surreal. But right after came a flood of thoughts and the image fell. At other times I saw IOB's but they all looked a little uninviting and the fear in me said 'I will wait for a more appealing invitation'. I can see now that there is a part of my identity that is very stubborn to dissolve and that's a part of me that is very spoiled and has high demands lol. Best to see it and try to move past it I guess..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday a bright blue light came through the grid and felt like it talked to me, it felt very comforting. There was a sort of exchange and then I agreed to be helped, the light went through my mouth in my stomach and gave me a wonderful feeling of new energy and some of the fear dissipated and my body felt extremely relaxed after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also remembering events I have supressed that were magical in nature, they just keep coming up. Sitting almost closed-eyed in the sun I explored a lot of dreams, at the time I didn't know what I was doing. Seeing IOB's for a while when I was meditating a lot, at the time I just accepted them as normal. Learning how to fly and control my dreams as a kid.. I forgot it all. What have you guys been remembering lately?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing more to add for context is that I noticed it is easier for woman to get into certain states than men, but is **not** easier to hold that state. Fear of losing my mind is very present as the emotions are felt more intensely. And it's no fun if you dip in and out of fear while going nowhere with snippets of inspiration. I see the struggle against ones own fantasies being triggered by emotionality in and around me in other woman. One post I did someone mentioned that I must be a natural, but I think that was just me being a girl lol (Just my reflections on my own experiences and to say I want to achieve a stable state, not just 'experiences').

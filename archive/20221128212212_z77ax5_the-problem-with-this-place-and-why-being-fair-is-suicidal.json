No one who read only those early books has even a tiny chance of learning anything at all, other than to be a big pest to others.\n\nAnd maybe if the later books started to be what you really needed to know, by that time it was obvious no readers would ever put in a serious effort.\n\nSo it was ok to just blab it all out in the open.\n\nPeople have been brainwashed by fake magic systems to believe 20 minutes a day is enough to learn what they have.\n\nNaturally it's because they have nothing real, aside from effects shamanic drumming can easily reproduce,  and actually only want your money.  Buddhism doesn't exist to save you. It's there to steal from you.\n\nAs is everything else.\n\nBut in general the tolerance for \"putting in some effort\" in a system, extends to about 20 minutes a day. Because everyone who wants to steal from you, will tell you that's enough.\n\nWhich is absolutely not nearly enough to learn sorcery.\n\nYou have to put in the same amount of effort you would make to learn to play a musical instrument well.\n\nOr to learn to be good at a sport.\n\nOr in any other \"beloved hobby\".\n\nUnfortunately, that \"common sense\" doesn't extend to learning magic.  People just won't put in the time, no matter how much they claim to want to learn.\n\nSo the books as a whole,  the ones beyond the early books, and which have everything you need to know, were likely deemed by don Juan and Carlos to be no danger to anyone. Probably after they saw how poorly people reacted to the first ones.\n\nBecause there was no one around to tell readers, they aren't working hard enough. And to get them to stop doing the pretend stuff that has nothing to do with actually learning, and focus on the instructions as given. On the \"hard stuff\".\n\n\\#1 being, you must learn to be silent for real.\n\nBut later Carlos thought perhaps it could be taught through a book, and created a publication which was lost in a theater amidst the seats.\n\nSo he concluded it wasn't time.\n\nHe wasn't alone in trying to save the knowledge.\n\nOver the years the apprentices left by don Juan had moved to the LA area. Nestor, La Gorda, Soledad, Begino, and other \"little sisters\".\n\nIn my opinion, all moved here. Some maybe even known around, without anyone realizing who that was.\n\nAnd all were undoubtedly engaged in their own activities of teaching.\n\nSorcerers benefit as much from teaching, as the students they teach.\n\nBut you won't understand that until you get there yourself.\n\nI suppose at an ordinary level, it's like the saying in the Japanese Karate world. Which is likely universal to all martial arts schools.\n\n\"You never learn your own techniques as well as when you are called upon to explain them to others.\"\n\nThe same applies to sorcery, except that we also have a magical force called \"intent\" helping us.\n\nAnd if you wanted to translate that old Karate school saying to sorcery, it would be, \"You never receive so much help from the spirit, as when you endeavor to pass on your sorcery knowledge to others.\"\n\nIt translates to what don Juan said happens, in the cycle of sorcerers.\n\nJust before old age takes them out.\n\nWhen teaching you enter a period of unequalled impeccability and power.\n\nOne old apprentice of don Juan in particular, the witch Soledad, took the proceeds of what was likely a vast fortune of valuable objects the lineage had accumulated, just by virtue of being 800 years old.\n\nAnd used it to influence Hollywood.\n\nCholita was possibly indirectly involved in importing them here, and preparing them for sale.\n\nNaturally without that being explained to her.\n\nFrom her point of view, Carlos was simply importing art from Mexico, and had lots of friends in the art business.\n\nWhere Carlos found employment for Cholita.\n\nWe almost surely got Star Wars from that.  The writers even admit that Yoda is don Juan, and \"the force\" is what's written about in the books.  We call it \"intent\".\n\nThough I wish the writers would talk about Soledad, if she was helping in that effort.\n\nIt should be possible to identify her.  There can't be that many women fitting her description among hollywood producers around that time.\n\nBut the apprentices weren't going to engage in anything obviously public.\n\nThat fell on Carlos.\n\nWho after his how to book seemed to receive a \"bad omen\", tried to teach in a public park.\n\nNear Santa Monica I believe.  Someone showed me the very park. Or so they claimed.\n\nAnd those in private classes often found themselves there in shared dreaming.\n\nA feature of learning sorcery from a real sorcerer, in groups.\n\nPhantom realms open up, in which you are taught \"in secret\".\n\nThe same as Carlos and the apprentices were taught, using the Nagual's blow.\n\nBut Carlos had to discontinue the free classes in a public park.\n\nAngry crazy men who had read his books and were either stealing from others pretending to teach that, or had ambitions to do so, showed up to heckle him.\n\nAt one point there were even dangerous followers of a man who calls himself \"Harley Swift Deer\" threatening his life.\n\nCarlos had to stop holding public teaching, and make it both harder to get into classes, and put up some automatic barrier, to reduce the workload of figuring out who could attend.\n\nEntry fees.\n\nIt worked \"all right\". A few times Kylie and others had to chase down bad men who came to the workshops to steal.\n\nKen Eagle Feather was among them.\n\nAnd they used the workshop to notice who seemed to be serious, so they could take them into the free classes, lead by Carlos himself.\n\nWhich were called \"Sunday Classes\", but I remember getting calls any time or day of  the week, asking if I could make it to a class just 2 hours later.\n\nCarlos did nothing but teach, every single day. For free.\n\nHe had different \"factions\".  Possibly as part of an intelligent plan to have \"pockets\" of apprentices, in case any one group polluted itself, and failed to learn.\n\nWe've counted as many as 6 as I recall.  Separated by which classes they were invited to.\n\nALL failed but one.\n\nUnless you count Soledad's faction, which we've dubbed \"H\", for Hollywood.\n\nThe factions all failed so badly, that they'd even argue about it with us.\n\nThey didn't even learn enough to know, this stuff is real. And produces stunning real magic, beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nAll that still remain are pretending that imagining magic, and altering your behavior to be more annoying to outsiders, constitutes \"having learned\".\n\nThey believe that being a pain in the ass, is the same thing as \"magic in your face\".\n\nIt all looked like it it was doomed to permanent failure, until I got blackmailed to come here.\n\nShortly after which, Cholita showed up at my doorstep. Supposedly homeless.\n\nUsing trickery, rituals, and his allies, Carlos manipulated me to end up here.\n\nThe only place left with any chance to pass on his knowledge.\n\nBut he did succeed in protecting Tensegrity, even if it's a magic free variety.\n\nWe in this subreddit are all there is, standing between the total loss of this 800+ year old sorcery lineage, and the crap magic the world has come to expect.\n\nWhere nothing happens to anyone and they only believe it does, because they've been brainwashed to believe that someone, somewhere else, is making it work.\n\nWhen in fact, there are none.\n\nThere's google now!  How long can people get away with pretending their system has magic?\n\nIt seems, a long time unless something is done to change the perception of \"how real\" magic ought to be.\n\nThe problem with this place is, the mods want to be \"fair minded\".\n\nAnd new people come here and demand it.  They'll attack, if they perceive the situation here isn't as crappy as elsewhere, where \"all points of view are respected\".\n\nIt's a very poor understanding of human behavior in general, and the totally defunct state of magical systems everywhere.\n\nAll magic destroyed by greed and pretending.\n\nThey don't realize that, because they never saw any.\n\nOr worse, because they're greedy and perfectly willing to pretend to have magic themselves.\n\nAs long as they can get attention for it from other humans.\n\nIn all of this, the blue scout was a bit ahead of the rest.\n\nShe saw it as pointless to try to teach private classes. She accepted the workshops, but as some lecture notes will tell you she didn't like the attention at all.\n\nI suppose Patty was like Manfred the dog, or the fruit trees at don Juan's compound, or the death defier.\n\nA body snatcher.\n\nBut Carlos still used her to introduce much of what we have in here.\n\nUsed her energy to create this place. In part.\n\nIf you read around, you'll come across it.\n\nAnd I'll animate it later.\n\nBut the tediousness of bad men attacking this subreddit, can't be sustained.\n\nIt's a large part of what killed Carlos.\n\nAnd why the lineages were so secretive, relying on stalking to hide their activities.\n\nThey weren't willing to risk even a tiny bit of energy, for a pointless cause.\n\nSo they hid in plain sight.\n\nWe're out in the open, because of obscurity, and because we want to give everyone a \"fair chance\" to learn the real thing.\n\nBut the instant we can leave this public park, we need to do that.\n\nIt's a huge waste of energy.\n\nIf anyone needs permission or justification, I fully agree with simply flagging bad posts as  subject to deletion, and doing so as fast and as often as possible.\n\nEven if some put reasonable comments to try to fight those posts.\n\nIt's hopeless.\n\nThere's bad lurkers all over the place in here, looking for a chance to do harm and get away with it.\n\nNot at all interested in learning.  Just waiting for \"their chance\".\n\nThere's nothing to gain by being \"the fastest gun in the west\", and taking on all hot shot newcomers.\n\nEspecially when you find, the people watching the fight are NOT on your side. They're hoping you finally get shot.\n\nWe've battled enough bad guys over the last 3 years.\n\nIf anyone calls that \"not enough to be sufficiently fair minded\", let them go start a teaching subreddit.\n\nI suppose it's actually vanity to even think that could have worked out in the long run.\n\nCarlos gave up on that very early on.\n\nI'm not sure what good this post can do. If someone gets blocked for an asinine post, it's not like they're going to have read this so they understand why they got deleted.\n\nThey'll just go badmouth this place either way, since it stands in the way of whatever awful plans they have to cheat others.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Problem With This Place And Why Being \"Fair\" Is Suicidal", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"e7pen7lf3r2a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6204eb59d61cc70750268a3d63d94f90c40b6da"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c47bc1d7800f0502f875d297c113e78542914f0"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71a038db9d1b8a09322735e9dbd10a0edff74845"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecb4ec18c292b68be6139a9f32e308df0b6053dc"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04dc11443808361b9b20f2edefb6703781b78bc7"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb1a145ca00a53bc7883186a13e32a1d8f274d48"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37fe5b8fe115b83680304b0be755aacd506db31"}, "id": "e7pen7lf3r2a1"}}, "name": "t3_z77ax5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qlKOun6ZSTmXuLwfPZMUxv1FGup3Fa5PbR4URkpZDlk.jpg", "edited": 1669669186.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1669666932.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f37fe5b8fe115b83680304b0be755aacd506db31\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/e7pen7lf3r2a1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f37fe5b8fe115b83680304b0be755aacd506db31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the 80s, not so long after don Juan left, Carlos started to try to figure out how to preserve the knowledge of the lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was clearly the task don Juan had given him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He made a &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The early books,  WERE NOT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Carlos admitted by calling that one a &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I believe the early books were actually were slightly sabotaged to keep people safe.

They&amp;#39;ll attack, if they perceive the situation here isn&amp;#39;t as crappy as elsewhere, where &amp;quot;all points of view are respected&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very poor understanding of human behavior in general, and the totally defunct state of magical systems everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All magic destroyed by greed and pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t realize that, because they never saw any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or worse, because they&amp;#39;re greedy and perfectly willing to pretend to have magic themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as they can get attention for it from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all of this, the blue scout was a bit ahead of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She saw it as pointless to try to teach private classes. She accepted the workshops, but as some lecture notes will tell you she didn&amp;#39;t like the attention at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose Patty was like Manfred the dog, or the fruit trees at don Juan&amp;#39;s compound, or the death defier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A body snatcher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos still used her to introduce much of what we have in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Used her energy to create this place. In part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read around, you&amp;#39;ll come across it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ll animate it later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the tediousness of bad men attacking this subreddit, can&amp;#39;t be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a large part of what killed Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why the lineages were so secretive, relying on stalking to hide their activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They weren&amp;#39;t willing to risk even a tiny bit of energy, for a pointless cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they hid in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re out in the open, because of obscurity, and because we want to give everyone a &amp;quot;fair chance&amp;quot; to learn the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the instant we can leave this public park, we need to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a huge waste of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone needs permission or justification, I fully agree with simply flagging bad posts as  subject to deletion, and doing so as fast and as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if some put reasonable comments to try to fight those posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s bad lurkers all over the place in here, looking for a chance to do harm and get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at all interested in learning.  Just waiting for &amp;quot;their chance&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing to gain by being &amp;quot;the fastest gun in the west&amp;quot;, and taking on all hot shot newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially when you find, the people watching the fight are NOT on your side. They&amp;#39;re hoping you finally get shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve battled enough bad guys over the last 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone calls that &amp;quot;not enough to be sufficiently fair minded&amp;quot;, let them go start a teaching subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;#39;s actually vanity to even think that could have worked out in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave up on that very early on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what good this post can do. If someone gets blocked for an asinine post, it&amp;#39;s not like they&amp;#39;re going to have read this so they understand why they got deleted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll just go badmouth this place either way, since it stands in the way of whatever awful plans they have to cheat others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "z77ax5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/z77ax5/the_problem_with_this_place_and_why_being_fair_is/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/z77ax5/the_problem_with_this_place_and_why_being_fair_is/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1669666932.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 3, "name": "t1_iy5e3yu", "id": "iy5e3yu", "parent_id": "t1_iy55p6a", "depth": 1, "children": ["iy5e3yu"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iy55p6a", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1669668516.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_z77ax5", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "We have a new plan over the Moderator Chat.\n\nThe worst part of deleting those posts was to lose the useful comments, mainly from students that took the time to make a reply and protect the subreddit.\n\nBut lately, we've got at least 4 \"group attacks\" just because of letting those posts stay.\n\nSo we are going to take screenshots from the useful comments, and re-post them in the main page.\n\nThat way we could still generate useful discussions on the topic, save the efforts of the subreddit helpers, and get the bad players ass kicked.\n\nSo they will get banned before others come to help them.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iy55p6a", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a new plan over the Moderator Chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst part of deleting those posts was to lose the useful comments, mainly from students that took the time to make a reply and protect the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But lately, we&amp;#39;ve got at least 4 &amp;quot;group attacks&amp;quot;

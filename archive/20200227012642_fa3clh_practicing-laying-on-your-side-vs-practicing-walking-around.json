She was blown away, by the light produced by moving my thumb sideways!\n\nJust moving a thumb redeploys energy???\n\nIt does.\n\nI went back to waiting for her to show up again, she did, and I tried moving the thumb just a very tiny bit.\n\nShe rippled.\n\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that people trying to do sustained dreaming practices like those statues, end up in odd positions.\n\nThe mistake is to pass on the positions, as if you can learn to do these things, by adopting those positions.\n\nYou can\u2019t.

It doesn\u2019t seem to lead anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that state, you can also just wait, and things show up. You don\u2019t have to insist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I waited, hoping for a re-visit by Carlos and his Indian friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I caught a glimpse of Cholita.   Just a hint of a face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a woman materialized in front of me. But she wasn\u2019t animating at all. She was just still.  Absolutely stable, right there on my bed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transparent. But stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was right front of me.  Just inches away. Not moving. Nothing moved. Not even an eyelash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t figure out if it was a dreaming entity, or an inorganic being. I can\u2019t recall seeing anything that still before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it was Cholita, she was getting pretty creepy.  Hair was right, face generally right, but her expression was alien.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I had the thought that she was too alien to be Cholita, she smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moved smoothly too!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to give myself a thumbs up, so I\u2019d remember.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, that\u2019s probably why I can write this today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was so silent that raising the hand to do a proper one would have messed it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just stretched my thumb out a bit. Sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A flood of yellow light drifted across the woman, and blew her away. She was blown away, by the light produced by moving my thumb sideways!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just moving a thumb redeploys energy???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to waiting for her to show up again, she did, and I tried moving the thumb just a very tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She rippled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it\u2019s not surprising that people trying to do sustained dreaming practices like those statues, end up in odd positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mistake is to pass on the positions, as if you can learn to do these things, by adopting those positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t.   There\u2019s no shortcut.  You have to sweat blood to learn silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_fa3clh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fa3clh/practicing_laying_on_your_side_vs_practicing/fixlua5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1582822672.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fixhmxm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jd198703", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fixhgxd", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3tl0tnl8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Yes, it is there.

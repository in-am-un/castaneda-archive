See the frightened child praying endlessly to itself, trying to get better treatment in the world from the very limited range of reality it perceives, all tied only to human beings in the same situation.\n\nAs don Juan said, 90% of our energy is tied up in that so that nothing outside our ordinary reality can be perceived by us.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from reddit \\*\\*\\*\n\nQuestion:Can anxiety manifest in the physical body as the AP moves down the back, in what looks like the green zone? Or is that just related to the threatened nature of the self-reflection? I\u2019ve been having tremendous anxiety corresponding to the middle of my back lately as I proceed with dark room practice, many thanks\n\nReply:\n\nSure!\n\nIn fact, our imaginary idea of a \"self\" is driven by anxiety.\n\nWhen seen, it's like a frightened version of yourself curled up in a fetal position, going over and over words in its mind trying to uphold its feeling of being safe or effective or well treated in the world.\n\nAn endless pointless loop of tossing the same words back at itself. Having been the one that made the words, what's the point of repeating them like some kind of religious fanatic reciting bible verses?\n\nThat got so well embedded into our actual state of being (when seen), that the foreign nature of it is very obvious out in the deep orange zone.\n\nCan't see that in the green zone, so don't anyone try. You'll just make it worse.\n\nBut its effects are still there up in the green zone. So if you start threatening it, all kinds of sensations might occur.\n\nI mean, the very least and easiest to notice is that your jaw actually mouths the words you are thinking to yourself, at times.\n\nWe've been severely traumatized I suppose. Or Jedi mind trick controlled by the fliers.\n\nWe even get the stomach ache later in the orange zone, when the breath is about to change.\n\nThat's possibly what holds \"self\" in place for some. A nervous stomach ache, maybe from perpetually tensing those muscles.\n\nThe green zone is known for the first breath change (a little) from the worst form of breathing, lifting the shoulders, to a slightly better breathing method of puffing out the chest instead.\n\nLater in the orange only the low stomach moves in and out. Reducing tension all over the torso.\n\nSo in the green zone we also have \"weird tension\" holding our \"self\" in place.\n\nLike a 3 year old tensing their fists out of anger their older sibling is getting more attention.\n\nWhat we do isn't fake magic like Yoga or Buddhism, where everything is wonderful and it's never unpleasant if you do it \"right\".\n\nAlthough even they run into problems with students, since they do in fact get to the green zone.\n\nThey'll say it's \"stress relief\" to put a positive spin on it.\n\nBut it's more like, that fetal position version of yourself repeating words over and over like it was praying, doesn't want to let go.\n\nWhen you can \"mess with it\" directly, you can see that it starts to look around and finds nothing to soothe itself in the real world. The real world is just vast and empty from its point of view.\n\nNot \"cozy\".\n\nIt's a protection mechanism, so naturally when you try to get rid of it, it's uncomfortable about that and you feel pity and stop trying to get rid of it.\n\nSo in some ways any physical \"stress relief\" symptoms are more like that fetal position \"being\" grabbing onto your legs and squeezing hard, refusing to be sent away.\n\nI really need to animate this!\n\nIt's so easy to confuse \"getting rid of the idea of self\", with \"egoless\".\n\nCertainly Cleargreen has made that serious mistake.\n\n\"Egoless\" is just manipulation of the idea of self to make yourself feel and seem superior, to groupies.\n\nVery much an Asian social order concept void of any real magic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The False Idea of a 'Self'", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"o5hg8dtqai0c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a40506aacf21fd02b2b374337c17ed2fb683b2cf"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd31c684d96c8c0bcd0ea51b4dc6d3bf353db60d"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37e146c355ce5ee4371f8054f7bba1297d2f2f89"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8abc7b92f5932177de817c4cf9b4c75f5a9e9c2"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f10370d3c11df2a5efd18dfef048108f11e53d3"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4c57daadb4b4dd15ef9cfb4785421145610bc37"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89c4b0f24b142765d40747765f417cdc6a035681"}, "id": "o5hg8dtqai0c1"}}, "name": "t3_17vsrn6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/owBTQ5gtHYyjhUtDfnIx8cB8QkFibrmsCEjCSPrY3QM.jpg", "edited": 1700059199.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1700051947.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=89c4b0f24b142765d40747765f417cdc6a035681\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/o5hg8dtqai0c1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=89c4b0f24b142765d40747765f417cdc6a035681&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is so difficult to explain mostly due to exploitation of people in the east, with fake magical systems which put bad men on thrones for others to worship, claiming it&amp;#39;s because they are &amp;quot;egoless&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact, they got a tiny buzz in the green zone on the J curve.

trying to remove all words from your mind, with the goal of seeing \"weirdness\".\n\nYou might doze off for an instant, come to with a jerk of your head going back up, and remember a little dream you just had.\n\nIf you play on the edge of that, you can get it to happen over and over, until you can literally step off into the dream and spend time there.\n\nBut you need near perfect mental silence to do that kind of thing.\n\nMore likely is that while gazing at something, perhaps fern leaves and the patterns of darkness and light, your eyes cross slightly.\n\nBut they find 'alignment' with unrelated features.\n\nWhich produce a 3D area that's impossible.\n\nTwo places on the fern leave that are inches apart, become a single object in the middle, and there's something really \"wrong\" with it.\n\nSo your \"dreaming attention\" comes out to fill in the details.\n\nAnd you see some fantastic little pattern on the edge of it.\n\nLike a very colorful rectangle with a triangle in it.\n\nSomething very concrete which can't possibly be there, and yet there it is.\n\nIt's like this:\n\nWe have 2 of us.\n\nOur physical body, and the person who runs around in dreams creating phantom realms as he goes.\n\nWhen you remove the internal dialogue, you are no longer filled with endless grief and worry so your double who has fled from you ever since you reached puberty and picked up that endless dialogue in your mind, comes closer to you to see what's going on.\n\nThe gazing causes him to let you borrow his \"eyes\", so you end up looking at the leaves with your own eyes, but also with his.\n\nHe has the power to do ANYTHING!\n\nThat's where the \"weirdness\" that shows up during gazing comes from.\n\nBUT, here's some very important advice.\n\nWe are not trying to produce weirdness.\n\nWe're trying to learn why it appears.\n\nSo we can learn to do that.\n\nThe fact that we use strange displays of magic in the air to learn that, is just because we need something to keep us honest.\n\nSo for example, someone posted about noticing \"duality\".\n\nThat's too easy to pretend!\n\nEastern systems tell you about things you can pretend and self-flatter, because it keeps you around giving them money.\n\nWe try to find things you cannot pretend, to make sure we are really making progress to learn real magic.\n\nGazing is merely looking at things, perhaps with slightly crossed eyes, and practicing shutting off the endless flow of words in the mind, so you can see what the world is like when that's gone.\n\nThe world literally STOPS if you attain perfect silent.\n\nIt simply comes to an end, and you find yourself somewhere else.\n\nSomewhere bizarre the first few times, perhaps.\n\nI saw this the first time.  The universe on fire.\n\nThat's actually what the universe is.\n\nAn endless expanse of those fibers of light.\n\nWhen your awareness flows into a single one, it sends back a super tiny \"feeling\".\n\nTrillions of them give the illusion of a causality universe.\n\nThe one governed by the \"laws of physics\".\n\nBut in fact, it's an illusion created by the reliability of the behavior of those filaments of awareness, if you remain in your normal state of consciousness.\n\nOutside that, everything changes.\n\nIn fact, there are 600 copies of ourselves we can switch over to, once we learn to reach perfect silence.\n\nI've never made a picture like this myself using animation tools, so I had to borrow it from \"The Matrix\".\n\nIt's almost right however.\n\nEach \"clump\" in there is a whole world you can enter by gazing in there.\n\nYou'll be like your normal self in the new world.\n\nBut if you stay too long you get trapped there instead of here, so it's advisable to \"turn your head\" and zip back out, in just a few seconds.\n\nDon't do that more than 3 times, I've been warned by \"Little Smoke\".\n\nThe moth Ally from the early books.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1342618620cc5f1c1a15601b53424adad1c2ea3d", "edited": 1700169529.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k9jxppd", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No time to correct typing mistakes, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan put a pile of leaves in front of each of his apprentices (he had perhaps 10?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You look at them fixedly, while trying to remove all words from your mind, with the goal of seeing &amp;quot;weirdness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might doze off for an instant, come to with a jerk of your head going back up, and remember a little dream you just had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you play on the edge of that, you can get it to happen over and over, until you can literally step off into the dream and spend time there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you need near perfect mental silence to do that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More likely is that while gazing at something, perhaps fern leaves and the patterns of darkness and light, your eyes cross slightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they find &amp;#39;alignment&amp;#39;

that shows up during gazing comes from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, here&amp;#39;s some very important advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are not trying to produce weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to learn why it appears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we can learn to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that we use strange displays of magic in the air to learn that, is just because we need something to keep us honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for example, someone posted about noticing &amp;quot;duality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s too easy to pretend!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eastern systems tell you about things you can pretend and self-flatter, because it keeps you around giving them money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We try to find things you cannot pretend, to make sure we are really making progress to learn real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing is merely looking at things, perhaps with slightly crossed eyes, and practicing shutting off the endless flow of words in the mind, so you can see what the world is like when that&amp;#39;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world literally STOPS if you attain perfect silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It simply comes to an end, and you find yourself somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere bizarre the first few times, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw this the first time.  The universe on fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s actually what the universe is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An endless expanse of those fibers of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your awareness flows into a single one, it sends back a super tiny &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trillions of them give the illusion of a causality universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one governed by the &amp;quot;laws of physics&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, it&amp;#39;s an illusion created by the reliability of the behavior of those filaments of awareness, if you remain in your normal state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside that, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are 600 copies of ourselves we can switch over to, once we learn to reach perfect silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never made a picture like this myself using animation tools, so I had to borrow it from &amp;quot;The Matrix&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost right however.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each &amp;quot;clump&amp;quot; in there is a whole world you can enter by gazing in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be like your normal self in the new world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you stay too long you get trapped there instead of here, so it&amp;#39;s advisable to &amp;quot;turn your head&amp;quot; and zip back out, in just a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do that more than 3 times, I&amp;#39;ve been warned by &amp;quot;Little Smoke&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moth Ally from the early books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1342618620cc5f1c1a15601b53424adad1c2ea3d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1342618620cc5f1c1a15601b53424adad1c2ea3d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_17vsrn6", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17vsrn6/the_false_idea_of_a_self/k9jxppd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1700168921.0, "media_metadata": {"x2vhiveryr0c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4d76e5cb0a6dd47fc633e1b6f9cc119b310fcdc"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6e960de5d3d6d7786b4038b2a725e86bc15b6a9"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31647933c952ca761bb6ecf49770dbad4b78c202"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763ea00a0910215bb5c85a9039e0090d163268ce"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6f1039d2e33bf8f2d85322acf9084c61a7ab0d0"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42bd25964813db45d85cd2d720391f4366f2a433"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/x2vhiveryr0c1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1342618620cc5f1c1a15601b53424adad1c2ea3d"}, "id": "x2vhiveryr0c1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k9jtzos", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Zbit5", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k9jsdo4", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_26axeup5", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "talk to me more about gazing, how would one go about that?

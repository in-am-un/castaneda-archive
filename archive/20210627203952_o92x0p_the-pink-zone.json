As a result, around 5AM I still hadn't awoken to practice in my dark room.\n\nAnd I was in a tiny bit of pain, as if I had a hangover.  I lifted one eye to see if sunlight was leaking into the room from behind my blackout curtains, and there was Lily. Her face floating not more than 2 feet from my eyes.\n\nI flattered her a bunch, lay on my side, and told her I'd get up in a minute or two. I just needed to rest a bit more.\n\nThen I started to feel guilty.  Lily had traveled from another world to get here, and all I had to do was sit up in bed.\n\nBut there was no more than an hour left before I had to get up, and try to beat Cholita to the shower.  She's been getting up early to go to West Hollywood each day.\n\nSo I played with the darkness in the room, looking for the whitish light.\n\nOnce you can move your assemblage point into the orange zone regularly, and become familiar with the manifestations of \"seeing energy\", you can go directly to that.  You can skip playing with puffs.\n\nThe result is a little odd.  Since you bypassed the red zone, you don't have the sensation that you traveled far to get there.\n\nAnd yet, you can still find the whitish light.\n\nYour assemblage point isn't in the red zone, searching for a phantom bedroom copy so you can move it into the orange zone.\n\nYou aren't looking \"past\" or \"behind\" the puffs in the air, to try to find the whitish light on surfaces.\n\nBut you are very aware, you are further on the J curve than you deserve to  be.\n\nAt that point, I tried to make up for it by forcing absolutely nothing but silence. There was no other consideration.\n\nWhen you treat it like that, silence becomes a \"thing\" in itself.\n\nAnd you can feel a sort of pressure, the more you force silence.\n\nOnce you can feel \"silence pressure\", you can learn to simply \"feel that\", without any actual effort.\n\nEach time I did, I saw a white flame in the air.\n\nPerfectly white, floating near enough that I could grab it with my right hand.\n\nBut I just gazed at it to make it materialize, and then go away because I wanted to look around.\n\nIt was only the silence that cause it materialize, but I needed the right gaze, so that I didn't prevent it from forming.\n\nIn and out.  I was cycling  between the place just before the red light tinted objects start to fade away and puffs of color and dreaming fog clear out, which is deep red zone, and the place where whitish light finally shows up and you lose interest in everything.\n\nOr to put it another way, the point  just before you can acquire a phantom room.\n\nOver time, we can all learn where what type of thing appears, and in what sequence, and you get a general idea of where you are on the curve.  This was a dead man's zone. Your assemblage point could move either direction.

But then he didn't like the results, so he created \"long forms\", explaining that if we had to use muscle memory to remember a sequence, it would help us be more silent.\n\nBut he didn't take into account our incredible ability to fantasize the whole time, and stare at the butt of the person in front of you. There's really no official \"short forms\". Just individual movements, and \"forms\". Some longer, some shorter.\n\n**If you concentrate on how the muscles are moving, it can greatly help reduce the fantasizing. Which can help starve off the internal dialogue, since fantasies drive it. But you still have to force it off at its own level**. Or nothing is going to happen, as proven by the entire workshop crowd and no one ever learning anything magical that stands out enough to get someone excited.\n\nI'd really like to get an honest answer from what the \"facilitators\" experience, and why they believe that's enough. Some took the facilitator classes believing the magic was reserved for upper levels. So when they got to #4 and realized there isn't any magic at all, they didn't finish the course. Reni should just add on darkroom to fix that situation. Starting at level 3. And don't let anyone go to level 4, until they reach the green zone. And not to 5, until they reach the red zone....\n\n...**Do your best to \"feel\" the physical movements, and almost pretend you're trying to that style of dancing, \"The robot\".

Don't exaggerate or alter them.**\n\n**Just find which muscles need to move, and which do not, and only move those which do need moving.**\n\n**It \"undoes\" your sense of physicality and attacks your internal dialogue, because it's a \"not-doing\" to pay that much attention.**\n\n**Also, Carlos believed it can actually activate that part of the brain, and reduce the part we normally use for our internal dialogue.**\n\nThat part of the brain is what catches a falling glass before you realize it's slipping off the dinner table.\n\nSo it's \"conscious\" of everything going on.\n\n\\[*username #1*\\] - old videos of tensegrity volume 1 they are all individual forms, but they can be done in series. They didn't have a much connection movement between each pass, so eventually i just started picking a choosing and isolating each pass. So it became this do 3-4 random passes and rest. But i just learned they westwood the first concern, and is much more intense for me ( i tried it with blindfold as well). I guess because it is a longer uninterrupted flow. i will learn the whole 5 concerns and work them as one block of movements, continuous and focusing on muscles only.\n\nu/danl999 \\-  With silence. Never forget that part. Eventually you'll have ideas on how to make the assemblage point move, which aren't based entirely on the forms or silence. But you have to discover those yourself. And then of course you forget them, until later you rediscover them further along the J curve. We really don't have this system entirely down yet. But if we started to try to figure it out in more detail, it would only encourage more bad players. So at some point, you just have to keep things to yourself.\n\n\\[*username #1*\\] -  one more question about magic greed. Last week i had insane magic things happen to me in the middle of the night and in the darkroom and this kinda make me act very greedy towards magic. I started to push really hard, but push not smart on daily basis for more and in return just got self pity. Any advise on this ?\n\nu/danl999 \\-  Progress flows and ebbs. Each time it is less, you just have to work harder on forcing off your internal dialogue. The greed all goes away when you've been doing this so long, you realize it's a 1000 mile road. Not a short 1 mile and you're there.\n\nI seem to recall from the books, that it's possible to raise an apprentice in 10 years. Though I can't remember where I read that. We have both an advantage, and a disadvantage. The disadvantage is, when we hit a rough spot, there's no one to help pull us along at a fast pace, the way don Juan did for Carlos. No one to \"show us the next thing\" on a regular basis.\n\nBut the advantage is, we get 100% credit from the spirit, for all efforts. Because all efforts are our own. Not just us being bullied by actual sorcerers, and made to go where they want us to go.\n\nOne of the reasons for the big \"blow up' when the Nagual leaves, where the apprentices are subjected to some scandal or bad situation that makes them all think about giving up, is to convert the \"free ride\" apprentices, into the kind of students we are. The \"on your own power, 100%\" kind. No one knows what will result from that.Something slightly different though.\n\n\\[*username #2*\\] -  (referring to \\[*username #1*\\],  I've found that self pity turns itself off if you force darkroom long enough. For me it was after about 2.5 hours of trying. Doesn't happen every session, but when I experienced it several times I started to wait for that state.\n\nEverything before that is just tonal making excuses to not give up the internal dialogue. It really fights back hard, it can even give you bad mood. But when it finally gives up, the resistance disappears suddenly together with self pity.\n\n\\[*username #1\\]* \\-  or me self-pity is long drag through out the days if I don't push in darkroom good enough, but one good 1 hour session fixes it like new. I have noticed that self pity is self importance thing and is very connected to wishes and wants, and in general existence around the idea that life happens to you instead of for you.\n\nOnce you slowly start realizing that we are just an assembly point and on some kind of ride where decisions only made between self importance and what the force wants the energy trapped slowly starts to release.\n\nIn fact the best darkroom sessions I had when I fully forgot who I am and where iam and why iam doing this. Self importance is the main enemy and what grounds you in the blue line permanently by taking energy and making you belive that you exist.

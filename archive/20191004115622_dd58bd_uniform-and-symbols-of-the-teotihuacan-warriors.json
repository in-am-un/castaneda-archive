The elements that make up the warrior\u2019s clothing can be seen not only in Teotihuacan, but also in the Maya area and at the Zapotecs in Monte Alban.\n\nAn obligatory element of clothing was the mashtattl loincloth, which was decorated with decorative ornaments launched along the edge. One such ornament, most likely, began to represent the city of Teotihuacan, and was used to decorate the loincloth only among the soldiers from this city-state. The stepped pattern resembled the toothed roofs found in Teotihuacan. In Maya, this decorative ornament was also used, but not among warriors, but in the \"fashionable\" clothes of wealthy Mayans and in women's clothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cqvdajloxhq31.jpg?width=527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08a89a7c759e8f78d9b783cd545ae25da5fc8c87\n\nThe warriors from Teotihuacan wore different types of clothing for their upper body. As depicted in the funerary images, warriors often wore short cloth tunics. Tunics of feathers were worn by warriors in Teotihuacan and in the Maya area. One of the most typical types of warrior clothes was a tunic with three ornaments around the edge. Teotihuacan warriors also wore quilted cotton and downy armor as protective clothing against flying stones and darts.\n\nWarriors and \"jewelry\" did not avoid. The jewelry was a kind of beads, necklaces and moniste on the neck and chest, they were made of jade beads, shells or human upper jaws. As you can understand, these jewelry were ritual and magical in nature and were used either in solemn occasions or in the burial of a warrior.\n\nIn the clothes of warriors in Teotihuacan often used an element denoting an owl. The owl is a well-known symbol of the warrior class at Teotihuacan, and may have designated the warrior as a person who, like the owl, was the link between the living and the dead, sending the living to the dead.\n\nOf course, the warrior's weapon was an important part of the costume. Atlatl (a special device for throwing short darts) and darts were the weapons preferred by the soldiers of Teotihuacan, and it was recognized as a typical weapon of Teotihuacan. Later, the atlatl became a symbol of the weapons of warriors and for the Toltecs. In particular, all four figures of the famous Toltec \u201cAtlanteans\u201d in Tollan hold the atlatl in their left hand. Spears and knives were also used by warriors, but were much less commonly depicted in the art of Teotihuacan. Archaeological studies of the Mayan regions show that atlatt was used in real battles and for everyday hunting. Atatl probably symbolized the quality of alertness, the warrior's readiness for battle.\n\nRound and flexible square shields served to protect warriors from flying stones, darts, or for hand-to-hand combat. These shields were made of reed, interwoven with cotton and covered with feathers and other ornaments and emblems. Flexible shields were very characteristic of the soldiers of Teotihuacan - they are found on the images of soldiers very often.\n\nInterestingly, mirrors were an essential element of the costume of the Teotihuacan warrior. Most likely, it was a magical element associated with Tescatlipoca (a smoking or fire mirror). Tescatlipoca was the main god of the priesthood, and the mirror was his most characteristic element. Interestingly, Tescatlipoca was considered Quetzalcoatl's main rival, and the mirror appears in the story of the fall / seduction of the legendary ruler Xie Akatl Topilcin Quetzalcoatl. Mirrors were worn separately or in combination with feathers and a coyote tail. Archaeological examples of these important elements of the costume from Teotihuacan were found among the graves of warriors in the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent.\n\nMirrored bibs were often used as part of the funeral costume of warriors. The rear mirrors were worn alone, tied to the lower back or as a unifying element in a larger cluster of feathers and tails.\n\nIt is no less interesting that in addition to mirrors, the soldiers of Teotihuacan often wore incense pouches, which also, apparently, had to do with magic and was used by priests. Many examples of Mayan art say that there incense was also an integral part of the military complex and costume.\n\nThe hats used by the Teotihuacan warriors encoded the complex nature of the mystical Teotihuacan notions. They ranged from simple dressings to stately, multi-layered assemblies of feathers, gems, shells and other precious materials. Senior military commanders used lush and sophisticated headgear with feather plume. More practical hats in the form of a year sign in the form of shells with plates are perhaps the most widely represented in burials in both Teotihuacan and Mayan Indians. In Mayan versions, the main elements of the headgear of the Teotihuacan warriors are decorated with a turban-like structure.\n\nBut there were hats of a different type. Some hats depicted a \"war serpent\" of a shiuhkoatl, which symbolized a living, fighting warrior. Headwear like a butterfly carried the meaning of turning a warrior into a butterfly. Fire was a key element involved in this transformation, and the symbols of this element appear on both the headgear of snakes and the headgear of butterflies. While headdresses such as the serpent and butterfly contained the Teotihuacan\u2019s belief in the importance of self-sacrifice, military hats depicting Tlaloc, the god of war, rain and thunderstorm, reflected the importance of sacrifice. On headdresses of this type, the image of Tlaloc\u2019s head and annual signs appear sequentially. Tlaloc\u2019s astonished face was the face of every warrior in search of maintaining the balance of the universe through sacrifice, a prisoner taken in battle, or his own flame (the fire of life), extinguished by the enemy.\n\nAn interesting element of clothing is safety glasses. Made from gray obsidian. Scientists do not know what they were used for. It is assumed that they were an imitation of Tlaloc, which is usually depicted with round \"glasses\". With the war and military operations associated his ability to bear destruction, accompanied by lightning and fire. The thunder god acted as the patron of warriors who fought under his banners - the \"points\" of God were an important element in the appearance of the Teotihuacan warrior. Some researchers believe that glasses were an element of intimidation of enemies, since they gave the Teotihuacan warrior such a \"skeletal\" appearance.\n\nThe Teotihuacan warrior fought not to kill and survive, it was not so simple. His war was a sacred action in a mystical war manifesting his personal power and magic. Therefore, all the details of his costume, weapons and armor were of great symbolic importance, served as functions of receiving support from the gods and connected him with the elements and with intent. To die in war was considered a very worthy death, a voluntary sacrifice. The war was a solemn event, which was furnished with magnificent rituals. Mystical and supernatural forces were full participants and players in battles along with people, and people, in a sense, voluntarily transferred their fate to these forces.\n\n[https://www.tensegrity.moscow/%D0%9E%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%85%D1%83%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0/](https://www.tensegrity.moscow/%D0%9E%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%85%D1%83%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0/)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Uniform and symbols of the Teotihuacan Warriors", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Lineage"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3r6eyg6jxhq31": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 67, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=991281a477deccaef3c588f44dcf7d6bc7317914"}, {"y": 135, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486194846c788095c2635a0754018a53ee1e62de"}, {"y": 200, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af61101d8bf4cd48157bb3553891a0651ff8707f"}, {"y": 400, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28297b18773f06746a0033d7116ebbab09f84f40"}, {"y": 600, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e1590cc523fd3f3e554a3c7896da415a4cd6438"}, {"y": 675, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ebb377a0d1d75c04dfbc7c9894cc57a4fcf481"}], "s": {"y": 675, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ffd6c9108c6bb01c1794cb62a0e8ffba2b1edca"}, "id": "3r6eyg6jxhq31"}, "cqvdajloxhq31": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 112, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cqvdajloxhq31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=011d89e7ed2e6f7bb625c4ae6dbd06750bcf078a"}, {"y": 225, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cqvdajloxhq31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=315c2f3fa40a13b091d183945606ee753d44ffb7"}, {"y": 333, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cqvdajloxhq31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4326cee1953f43ac46bd89a2642c2c3b40e92b62"}], "s": {"y": 550, "x": 527, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cqvdajloxhq31.jpg?width=527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08a89a7c759e8f78d9b783cd545ae25da5fc8c87"}, "id": "cqvdajloxhq31"}}, "name": "t3_dd58bd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 8, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_hkde3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Lineage", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4rj8YbKzCxlUOS-XMWvUxl70EZNn2iYJhMRSZVvuQUc.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1570182982.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4ffd6c9108c6bb01c1794cb62a0e8ffba2b1edca\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3r6eyg6jxhq31.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4ffd6c9108c6bb01c1794cb62a0e8ffba2b1edca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tradition of military clothing in Teotihuacan is full of many meanings and symbols.

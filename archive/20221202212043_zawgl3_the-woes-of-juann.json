Your eyes are covered by green tinted glasses, and your view of reality is dubious and egotistical.\n\nNormally, no other system ever leaves there.  And that's if they even make it that far.\n\nI know how Juann feels regarding his thoughts on how to save the subreddit, motivated by hanging out on the green line of the  J curve.\n\nEach \"station\" along the J curve has its own special \"reasoning\".\n\nYou will notice this most at first when you get up to practice, and life seems to suck.  You're filled with doubts, self-pity, and  worry that the whole sorcery thing is likely crap.\n\nMaybe you should just go back to your old habits so you don't \"miss out on life\".\n\nBut after just 10 minutes your view of everything changes.

We hamper ourselves with our internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your IQ goes up 10-15 points, your memory improves greatly, you can type without looking at the keyboard nearly as often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can crumple up a paper you don&amp;#39;t need, and toss it directly into the trash across the room, without looking as much as before you learned to get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also aren&amp;#39;t as offended by unreasonable people, instead feeling more like they can&amp;#39;t really help themselves, due to suffering so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#39;s reached the outskirts of the red zone on the J curve could tell you more things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery really does transform you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the delusional buddhists admit it&amp;#39;s their &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;, if you can remove the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that, they never really do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They get the &amp;quot;beginner&amp;#39;s delusion&amp;quot; level of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is in fact enough to get to the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at each point you make progress moving on to the next, when you realize you were glossing and that your thinking you could get silent was a big lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you try harder, and reach the next point after a few days of stronger effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you are &amp;quot;on that path&amp;quot; the Eagle notices, and you may even get supernatural help if you have a very serious problem to solve at work, and your well being depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the Eagle likes &amp;quot;specialists&amp;quot; who explore outside the normal range of human obsessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Can you elaborate on what you mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sky splits into portals to other realms you can &amp;quot;zip&amp;quot; into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see how the variety of light intensities moves the assemblage point, and feel specific ones looking at specific elements in the scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A scary being like a skull (the favorite of Cholita) might peek from behind a cloud to see what you&amp;#39;re up to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very specific things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not an overall pretend feeling of being a &amp;quot;superior being&amp;quot;, as our own bad players use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To pretend their achievements by &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; the inventory items.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of being able to do them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same way Zen fanatics like to toss in the lame &amp;quot;watching a leaf fall&amp;quot; thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is only amusing up at the green line, when you first get there. For a few weeks at most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they go around using it like an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m wiser than you&amp;quot; shield if you point out they&amp;#39;re delusional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zen is despicable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of our own pretend they&amp;#39;ve incorporated it, because the Zen people have very good marketing, telling everyone they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;superior&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as Anaam Zen Nagual, a major butthead who comes up in cleargreen chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Japanese even stationed &amp;quot;Zen Masters&amp;quot; with Kamikaze troops, to convince them suicide was honorable, and they&amp;#39;d be rewarded handsomely in the next reincarnation.

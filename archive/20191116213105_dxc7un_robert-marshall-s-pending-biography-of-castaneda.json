I\u2019ll have to check it out next time we go there and see if it's possible to convince her to wear it.\n\nThat wouldn't stand out on Rodeo drive, where it's not uncommon to see women in their 50s and 60s, with lots of plastic surgery, lips puffed up on collagen, with a small white dog, and a tutu.\n\nI kind of like them. They're boldly on the make.  When Cholita abandons me for hours in Beverly Hills, they hit on me.\n\nI gazed into Cholita's dreaming body tutu and realized it was actually a collection of very sharp lines of black and white light, with occasional colored lines of purple, blue, or even orange, giving the overall feeling of a black and violet tutu.\n\nIn fact, it was more like a giant dust bunny draped around her waist.    As I noticed that, I also realized that more of her second attention energy body was visible in this manifestation.\n\nMy left-over Tonal couldn\u2019t accept a giant dust bunny, so I perceived a tutu, and ignored the other signs of something different.\n\n*Intent* is sticky!  If you let your assemblage point drift from silence, it'll lock on to left-over *intent*.\n\nThat's why I recommend burying your silence stones, when you're done with them. They really will have your *intent*.\n\nBut before *intent* sticks on a stable assemblage point position, you get nonsense and random interpretations from your own concerns.\n\nConsider how it works.  *Intent* is detected by your assemblage point, perhaps as a \"hole\" it can roll into.\n\nAnd that lets the assemblage point focus on a tighter range of perceptions, associated with that position.\n\nPerhaps, you just see a shape because it hasn't settled in fully.\n\nIf you see a shape, you can try to see what it looks like.   But until the assemblage point locks into the precise position to experience that *intent*, you'll add your own details.\n\nMaybe this explains how *intent* can be both an external force, and an internal one, which fills in missing details for us.  It's actually external, but it creates internal activity.\n\n(just speculation)\n\nI peered into her tutu, because I had a worry. Earlier that night I\u2019d found those reddish orange fibers of light that are needed for La Gorda\u2019s flying technique.  Flicking urine from the fingers lights them up, and if you grab them you'll be pulled into the air.\n\nIt would be a clear violation of causality, thus my interest in proving that technique works.\n\nThat night I had just gotten up at 3AM, the room was already sealed in pitch black, and as I verified I was completely silent, I started to see very strong lines.  It was unusual.\n\nThey were the kind of lines you see when viewing the body of the second attention. Very sharp, kind of weird because they move both violently, and silently. And yet, you can\u2019t really see any movement but a slight waving.\n\nPerhaps violent isn\u2019t the right word. But they\u2019re dangerous to the Tonal.  Sharp perhaps.\n\nThey were just fragments, but clear and stable as anything.\n\nShe had around 3 of them dispersed in her \u201ctutu\u201d.\n\nTo me that means, Cholita can do the flying technique. She already has the orange lines with her. I had worried whether those lines form a network everywhere, or if you have to know how to acquire them.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but noticing the orange lines triggered me thinking about the fliers, who are said to lick up our outer coating of extra glow.\n\nThe fliers are almost certainly merely your fellow men.  I can't say for sure, because I've never *seen* them.\n\nAnd that's the point. I've *seen* a lot.  But not them.\n\nAs Carlos said, \"*It's a metaphor Ellis, only you are intelligent enough to understand it.\"*\n\nShe put that in her book. And I might be off a little in the quote's wording, but the meaning is correct.\n\nIn private classes, we knew what was up. He held up a cheesy photo of a UFO flying over a pyramid in Mexico, and said one of the women standing there showing us the picture had taken it.\n\nHe seemed to me to be pulling a practical joke on us, and the look on the women\u2019s faces verified that. No way they took that photo. It seemed obvious.\n\nBut it was a not-doing. We had to smile and pretend to be worried about them.\n\nLater I saw the same photo on a UFO investigation TV series.\n\nI assumed, back in the mid 90s when this took place, that Carlos was simply doing what he\u2019d promised in his books.  And his books are turning out to be a map in themselves.\n\nHe was giving us a worthy opponent.  Don Juan had given him La Catalina, now he was giving us mud colored aliens.\n\nWe needed a worthy opponent for a group, so he told us that there were uncountable numbers of them hopping around everywhere, and they\u2019d taken over the entire world.\n\nThey were responsible for keeping us from learning sorcery. He daily checked the height of our awareness, telling us that if it could rise above our ankles, we'd progress faster.\n\nBut the fliers kept licking it down.\n\nThus the dark conspiracy to hold all of mankind in a chicken coop of ignorance, became the paranoid theme of future workshops.\n\nBy now it\u2019s so ingrained that rocking the boat by pointing out he made that up, almost threatens some people's livelihood.\n\nAnd maybe, that was also part of the purpose of the fliers. To give more stability to Cleargreen, until more students discovered, Carlos wasn't making things up.  Then the paranoid story could be replaced by real sorcery experiences.\n\nIt was a great paranoid story!  The sorcery isn't working, because you're being attacked.  And the only way to overcome that, is to practice!\n\nIt's like a kid learning Taekwondo, because there's a school bully bothering him.\n\nHe won't work nearly as hard if there's no bully, and you merely tell him it's going to make him happy to do Taekwondo.\n\nBut not to fear, if you're selling the fliers' angle.\n\nTensegrity is the real thing, and everyone needs to try it at least a little.\n\nCleargreen is still the best place to get it, unless you're in Argentina.\n\nSo anyone who can attend a workshop should do so.\n\nOtherwise, his book is enough to let you figure out how to scoop energy onto your body.  You just won't get exposed to the other techniques he embedded in the more complex tensegrity forms.\n\nSuch as teleportation...\n\nWith his \"fliers\" story, Carlos also gave us an incredible demonstration of how socialization works.\n\nGradually over time, while all of us were being coerced into pretending the fliers exist and are our main enemy, he added more and more details, explaining how they lick us with their big sloppy tongue, keeping our outer glow of awareness so low that all we can do is feel sorry for ourselves.\n\nThe fliers became the obsession of Cleargreen. And since he\u2019d created factions in the group, he only needed that particular faction to go along with it.\n\nThe rest had to follow, since they had less power in the group.  I was in the less powerful faction #3. We were just lucky to be there, so we couldn't rock the boat.\n\nThe result was, exactly what happens to us as children. We were forced to accept that view of the world.\n\nThe same thing happens to you as a baby. Your mom slowly forces you into serving her, as a cute little toy slave she can carry around.\n\nShe strips you of magic (the second attention), and replaces it with cookies and people.\n\nIt almost reminds me of the inorganic beings, and how they're said to be female. They dazzle men with their appearance, and try to take them prisoner into their own kingdom.\n\nCholita does the same thing, with shopping cart after shopping cart of home decorations.\n\nWe call raising a baby \"love\", but in fact it's biology, and the social conditions we've added on top, to lure the baby with promises of happiness, are the least we could possibly have given it.\n\nThey lead mostly to suffering.\n\nYour mom hooks you to the worry of other people\u2019s thoughts.  Better behave, or you\u2019ll be criticized or punished.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve learned in Asia, the victim becomes the bully. Whoever is ruthlessly bullied for years, turns into a bully when they mature. Vast parts of Asia consist almost entirely of bullies.\n\nVisit for a spell and see.\n\nThey even have TV shows in Asia to celebrate that. Coming of age, so that you can be the bully.\n\nThose are the fliers.  Your fellow men.\n\nThey lick your awareness to keep you dumb.\n\nGo find a troll on the internet, to see how they lick awareness. Or learn to do the things I'm describing here, and try to tell your friends about it.\n\nYou'll get a licking you won't forget!\n\nOn the other hand, I could be wrong about all this.  Maybe I haven't seen any fliers, because they're super hard to *see*.\n\nAnd yet, don Juan said even ordinary people could see them.\n\nPlus someone snapped a Polaroid!\n\nI'll leave it to you guys to draw your own personal conclusions.\n\nEdited: four times", "edited": 1574017918.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f7u6l4r", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right on cue!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you got to serve &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; today because I had more thoughts on the fliers last night, while trying to figure out if Cholita\u2019s dreaming body was wearing a tutu, or I could simply see her dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it didn\u2019t seem post worthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you learn to get silent, so many bizarre things will happen that you can\u2019t post about all of them.

Usually she materializes near the far, right wall. But this time, she was only a foot from the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a couple of days ago she\u2019d threatened to prevent me from intercepting her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess she did it. Now she has to walk in on her own?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was standing in total darkness, in a black and violet tutu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know why I thought that couldn\u2019t be, since the day before she had on her blue work apron.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a tutu, that was over the top!

Their &amp;quot;kingdom&amp;quot; needed some upgrading and young men were letting them down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was very similar to what happened to Carlos, with the women he gathered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_dxc7un", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/dxc7un/robert_marshalls_pending_biography_of_castaneda/f7vdt6a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1574022858.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1574022858.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f7v5hz1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "CaptainObvious5000", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f7uk70k", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3yfcfk1m", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It\u2019s not a shot over your bow just a poke at your side planks.\nIn other words I\u2019m just kidding in a ruthless sort of way.\n\nI assume you are not partial to the links or viewing links but the links are 100% associated with the conversation at hand.\n\nI would have loved to elaborate upon the content further while I was originally posting but I have a lack of time on my hands, yet the subject matter concerning the authenticity of the works of CC always pisses me off.\n\nYet that has been the case since the beginning and while I am over it (the criticism and conjecture) I still attribute the lack of faith that society places upon the combined works of CC as simply at best a lack of attention or at worst a conspiracy of forces aligned to discredit the man and his works.\n\nThis conspiracy in fact may be spearheaded by spirit itself as a way to weed out those skeptics happy to remain fixated with the cozy 1st attention.\n\nThe first link I posted was the article for which the OP had commented upon, the \nSecond was a video I stumbled upon which again details many of the points that the article covers.\n\nIn both links there are many example of how the skeptics point out many transgressions that Carlos may or may not have been responsible for.

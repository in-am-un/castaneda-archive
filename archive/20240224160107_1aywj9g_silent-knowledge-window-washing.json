If you really do earn the right to see the puffs, you'll see them daily after that as long as you keep working hard everyday.\n\nYou'll have plenty of chances to figure this out.\n\nHowever, Tensegrity works BEST if you are looking at impossible magical sights the entire time.  Which takes very deep silence, and control over where you focus your attention.\n\nThat's when Tensegrity shapeshifts you, even if you aren't aware of it.\n\n\\&gt;puffs will be following the movements of the passes\n\nThat's not easy to say, because Carlos was tricky and once in a while he's distracting you during the Tensegrity with some hand posture, but in fact it's the forearm and elbow that are doing what he wanted you to be doing.\n\nCarlos could \"see\" anytime he liked.\n\nAnd while designing the Tensegrity movements out at Pandora  (most of them to conceal some old seer magic he didn't want to be lost), he might easily look up above the 3 \"Chacmools\" (Nyei, Reni, and Kylie) and see some text materialize, telling him some desirable modification or addition to the form.\n\nSeeing is really quite amazing!  It often gives you information you don't fully understand at the time, until you check it out later and find it was completely true.\n\nBack in the early 90s I was making video games for the \"Famicon\" gaming system. The original Nintendo with the first Super Mario Bros. \n\nNintendo didn't like that I hadn't purchased their very expensive development system,  that I made my own game cartridges,  and didn't buy their very expensive ROM memory chips to hold my games. They wanted $16 a chip, but I could buy them for $1.50 from TSMC in Taiwan.\n\nSo they threatened to sue me.\n\nBecause some poorly informed patent office official had granted them a patent for putting a deep 45 degree bevel on the bottom edge of their cartridges.\n\nSo that they couldn't be put into the machine upside down.\n\nIt was a useless patent, because in order to use the machine, you had to fit the cartridge.\n\nBut if it fit, then you violated their pointless patent.\n\nI had a multi-millon dollar business running full steam, and Nintendo believed they had shut it down overnight.\n\nBut that evening I sat in a chair forcing silence, and a video game cartridge materialized in the air, right where I could see it.\n\nI was \"gone\" (blanked out), so a voice said, \"Hey stupid, Look!!!  See how it slides OVER the bevel, because the cartridge is simply a lot thinner?\"\n\nAnd it was right.\n\nI rushed to my office, built one out of cardboard, and it did indeed fit without violating their patent.\n\nNintendo was pissed off big time and tried to fight us off two more ways, but each time we worked around what they'd come up with.\n\nEventually they gave up and complimented us in another court case, where the company they were suing had not tried to work around their tricks. Nintendo used us to crucify someone else.\n\nTo whom we eventually sold our design, and manufactured games for them too.\n\n\\&gt;don't want to lose sight of the colors when I see them pronounced so I'd like to know how to handle them.\n\nSilence is what makes the puffs visible.\n\nNot the Tensegrity.\n\nThen if you want DAZZLING magic, you have to remove even the fantasies in your mind.\n\nThe ones continuing a flow of virtual time, in a virtual fantasy world of memories.\n\nSo that even if you really are \"silent\", meaning absolutely no internal dialogue, it's still not enough to get you all the way to the end of the J curve, on that map in the subreddit explained to us by Carlos a year before he died.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ktaq99d", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;should I stop the pass and start playing with the colors?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t answer that.

Which takes very deep silence, and control over where you focus your attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when Tensegrity shapeshifts you, even if you aren&amp;#39;t aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;puffs will be following the movements of the passes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not easy to say, because Carlos was tricky and once in a while he&amp;#39;s distracting you during the Tensegrity with some hand posture, but in fact it&amp;#39;s the forearm and elbow that are doing what he wanted you to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos could &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; anytime he liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while designing the Tensegrity movements out at Pandora  (most of them to conceal some old seer magic he didn&amp;#39;t want to be lost), he might easily look up above the 3 &amp;quot;Chacmools&amp;quot; (Nyei, Reni, and Kylie) and see some text materialize, telling him some desirable modification or addition to the form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing is really quite amazing!  It often gives you information you don&amp;#39;t fully understand at the time, until you check it out later and find it was completely true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 90s I was making video games for the &amp;quot;Famicon&amp;quot; gaming system. The original Nintendo with the first Super Mario Bros. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nintendo didn&amp;#39;t like that I hadn&amp;#39;t purchased their very expensive development system,  that I made my own game cartridges,  and didn&amp;#39;t buy their very expensive ROM memory chips to hold my games. They wanted $16 a chip, but I could buy them for $1.50 from TSMC in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they threatened to sue me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because some poorly informed patent office official had granted them a patent for putting a deep 45 degree bevel on the bottom edge of their cartridges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that they couldn&amp;#39;t be put into the machine upside down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a useless patent, because in order to use the machine, you had to fit the cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it fit, then you violated their pointless patent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a multi-millon dollar business running full steam, and Nintendo believed they had shut it down overnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that evening I sat in a chair forcing silence, and a video game cartridge materialized in the air, right where I could see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was &amp;quot;gone&amp;quot; (blanked out), so a voice said, &amp;quot;Hey stupid, Look!!!  See how it slides OVER the bevel, because the cartridge is simply a lot thinner?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rushed to my office, built one out of cardboard, and it did indeed fit without violating their patent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nintendo was pissed off big time and tried to fight us off two more ways, but each time we worked around what they&amp;#39;d come up with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually they gave up and complimented us in another court case, where the company they were suing had not tried to work around their tricks. Nintendo used us to crucify someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To whom we eventually sold our design, and manufactured games for them too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;don&amp;#39;t want to lose sight of the colors when I see them pronounced so I&amp;#39;d like to know how to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence is what makes the puffs visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then if you want DAZZLING magic, you have to remove even the fantasies in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ones continuing a flow of virtual time, in a virtual fantasy world of memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that even if you really are &amp;quot;silent&amp;quot;, meaning absolutely no internal dialogue, it&amp;#39;s still not enough to get you all the way to the end of the J curve, on that map in the subreddit explained to us by Carlos a year before he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1aywj9g", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1aywj9g/silent_knowledge_window_washing/ktaq99d/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1709561256.0, "media_metadata": {"boirkctvpbmc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 137, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/boirkctvpbmc1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7598223cd6d753c1af8055fc54533c006a67882"}, {"y": 274, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/boirkctvpbmc1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe86d3cdb76b95c77d6bd5fd208ccaeb35ad3cdf"}, {"y": 406, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/boirkctvpbmc1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86629844c79b3a8cc181d31032edd1a0583e27d0"}, {"y": 812, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/boirkctvpbmc1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=274ec866314af9044d86c97039049b275ab89963"}, {"y": 1218, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/boirkctvpbmc1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d38f3783c93052dd6c6486545f8bf4190c8b17"}, {"y": 1371, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/boirkctvpbmc1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0263af657215d2c59f1d36557f81f1e9138aed6e"}], "s": {"y": 1371, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/boirkctvpbmc1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ecad2cbb65edd5a59ffaa29019c647d0dfde52e"}, "id": "boirkctvpbmc1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kt9edcr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "pumpkinjumper1210", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1709531549.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1aywj9g", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_mdxakt6w0", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Hi danl, \"Keep in mind, this is done fully awake, eyes wide open, and during Tensegrity movements.\" \nif colors are spotted during darkroom practice while doing Tensegrity, should I stop the pass and start playing with the colors?\n\n\"And that guy needs you to play with the puffs using your hands, and the Tensegrity moves.\" - from another post.\n\nI have a hunch that the colors will be following the movements of the passes but I don't know.\n\nI've gotten more hypnagogic sights showing up when drifting to sleep that always seem to disappear right as I become conscious of them.

And don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m a lesbian\ud83d\ude02 and I want to kiss her\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude0f.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_150afk0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/150afk0/establishing_the_accuracy_of_the_egg_animation/js2pm73/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1689434603.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "js2bmw5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1689428133.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_150afk0", "score": 15, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Oh the Humanity!!!\n\nA recreation of the J curve lecture, including the horrified look of the girl on which he did it, and the grin of Carlos as he made use of sexual tension, to get us to pay better attention to an important topic.\n\nRemember, Carlos pretty much ALWAYS used women to introduce important new topics.\n\nKind of the way he got Carol Tiggs to \"show us something\".

When a nagual presses on that point of intense luminosity,\nthe point moves into the disk of the cheddar cheese. Heightened awareness comes about when the\nintense glow of the assemblage point lights up dormant emanations way inside the disk of\ncheddar cheese. To see the glow of the assemblage point moving inside that disk gives the feeling\nthat it is shifting toward the left on the surface of the cocoon.&amp;quot;\nHe repeated his analogy three or four times, but I did not understand it and he had to explain it\nfurther.

Then all at once the people in front of \nme changed into very large blobs of white light. I was facing the luminous eggs in a sustained \nfashion for the first time in my life! Don Juan had told me that human beings appear to the seer as \nluminous eggs. I had experienced flashes of that perception, but never before had I focused my \nvision on them as I was doing that day.\n\nThe blobs of light were quite amorphous at first. It was as if my eyes were not properly \nfocused. But then, at one moment, it was as if I had finally arranged my vision and the blobs of \nwhite light became oblong luminous eggs. They were big, in fact, they were enormous, perhaps \nseven feet high by four feet wide or even larger.\nAt one moment I noticed that the eggs were no longer moving. I saw a solid mass of \nluminosity in front of me. The eggs were watching me; looming dangerously over me. I moved \ndeliberately and sat up straight. \n\n_____________.............\n\nTo this effect, he trained la Gorda and me to see together and was able to show us that, \nalthough human beings appear to a seer as luminous eggs, the egglike shape is an external \ncocoon, a shell of luminosity that houses a most intriguing, haunting, mesmeric core made up of \nconcentric circles of yellowish luminosity, the color of a candle's flame. During our final session,he had us see people milling around a church. It was late afternoon, almost dark, yet the creatures \ninside their rigid, luminous cocoons radiated enough light to render everything around them \ncrystal clear. The sight was wondrous.\n\nDon Juan explained that the egg-shaped shells which seemed so bright to us were indeed dull. \nThe luminosity emanated from the brilliant core; the shell in fact dulled its radiance. Don Juan \nrevealed to us that the shell must be broken in order to liberate that being. It must be broken from \nthe inside at the right time, just as creatures that hatch out of eggs break their shells. If they fail to \ndo so, they suffocate and die. As with creatures that hatch out of eggs, there is no way for a \nwarrior to break the shell of his luminosity until the time is right.\n\nDon Juan told us that losing the human form was the only means of breaking that shell, the \nonly means of liberating that haunting luminous core, the core of awareness which is the Eagle's \nfood. To break the shell means remembering the other self, and arriving at the totality of oneself. \n___________________ .............\n\nHe went on to explain that a state of heightened awareness is seen not only as a glow that goes \ndeeper inside the egglike shape of human beings, but also as a more intense glow on the surface \nof the cocoon. Yet it is nothing in comparison to the glow produced by a state of total awareness, \nwhich is seen as a burst of incandescence in the entire luminous egg. It is an explosion of light of \nsuch a magnitude that the boundaries of the shell are diffused and the inside emanations extend \nthemselves beyond anything imaginable.  \n\n____________________ .............\n\n\"Now if that ball of jack cheese were transparent,\" he went on, \"you would have the perfect \nreplica of man's  cocoon. The cheddar cheese goes all the way inside the ball of jack cheese. It's a \ndisk that goes from the surface on one side to the surface on the other side.\n\n\"The assemblage point of man is located high up, three-fourths of the way toward the top of \nthe egg on the surface of the cocoon. When a nagual presses on that point of intense luminosity, \nthe point moves into the disk of the cheddar cheese. Heightened awareness comes about when the \nintense glow of the assemblage point lights up dormant emanations way inside the disk of \ncheddar cheese. To see the glow of the assemblage point moving inside that disk gives the feeling \nthat it is shifting toward the left on the surface of the cocoon.\"\n\nHe repeated his analogy three or four times, but I did not understand it and he had to explain it \nfurther. He said that the transparency of the luminous egg creates the impression of a movement \ntoward the left, when in fact every movement of the assemblage point is in depth, into the center \nof the luminous egg along the thickness of man's band.\nI remarked that what he was saying made it sound as if seers would be using their eyes when \nthey see the assemblage point move.\n\n\"Man is not the unknowable,\" he said. \"Man's luminosity can be seen almost as if one were \nusing the eyes alone.\"\nHe further explained that the old seers had seen the movement of the assemblage point but it \nnever occurred to them that it was a movement in depth; instead they followed their seeing and \ncoined the phrase \"shift to the left,\" which the new seers retained although they knew that it was \nerroneous to call it a shift to the left. \n\n____________.............\n\nDon Juan further explained that most of the shifts modern-day sorcerers experience are mild \nshifts within a thin bundle of energetic luminous filaments inside the luminous egg, a bundle \ncalled the band of man, or the purely human aspect of the universe's energy. Beyond that band, \nbut still within the luminous egg, lies the realm of the grand shifts. When the assemblage point \nshifts to any spot on that area, perception is still comprehensible to us, but extremely detailed \nprocedures are required for perception to be total. \n\n______________............", "edited": 1689444208.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_js3afzo", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More relevant context for &amp;quot;Luminous egg&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What does a complete person look like to a sorcerer?&amp;quot; I asked.\n&amp;quot;Like a luminous egg made out of fibers,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;All the fibers are complete; they look like \nstrings, taut strings.

The part that looked like a lid was the front plate; it\nwas perhaps one-fifth the thickness of the total cocoon.\nI would have gone on seeing those creatures, but don Juan said that I should now gaze at\npeople __face to face__ and sustain my gaze until I had broken the barrier and I was seeing the\nemanations.\n\nI followed his command. Almost instantaneously, I saw a most brilliant array of live,\ncompelling fibers of light. It was a dazzling sight that immediately shattered my balance. I fell\ndown on the cement walk on my side.

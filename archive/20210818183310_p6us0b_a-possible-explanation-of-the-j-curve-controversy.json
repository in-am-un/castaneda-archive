tensegrity,  to rebuild our energy body. \n\nThat should not be confused with the J curve, which he demonstrated on a human body.\n\nI was thinking about this last night, with Cholita's head materializing in front of me, possibly to make up for a lost car.\n\nShe misplaced her car around 50 miles away, somewhere...\n\nBut seeing her make a \"guest appearance\" in the darkroom more than makes up for it.\n\nThe \"double\" is not at all like an inorganic being manifestation.

How does it go under the butt, along the crotch, when the edge of the luminous egg has to be located below the feet?  \n\nBut then I remembered that when Carlos gave the J curve lecture, he reached back behind the woman at the start, to show that the assemblage point was actually back there. He waved his open hand, fingers touching where it was back there.\n\nThen his hand slid down through the air at an angle, to touch the woman on the shoulder blade.\n\nOn the corresponding spot.\n\nIt moved slightly DOWN, and an angle.\n\nI was wondering, where have I seen that before?\n\nAnd luckily (if anything Carlos did was from luck), it turned out Carlos had drawn us a picture of that. Just happened to be having lunch at Cal State Fullerton, and decided to get out his pencil and draw the most valuable sketch we have!\n\nThen, possibly because GIMP has a cool \"spinny tool\" for making pictures go around and around, I wondered if I could remove that assemblage point \"beam\", and spin it around to figure out how the assemblage point moved along the bottom.\n\nI was watching the air in the darkroom at the same time. I was almost arriving at \"Silent Knowledge\".   I felt tired and fussy, despite being vividly on the outskirts of the red zone.\n\nIf I could just make it solidly into the orange, I would be guaranteed bliss most of the next day.\n\nYou can get used to the red zone and be happy/grumpy all the time, the way lucid dreaming makes you feel.\n\nOr you can be in heaven if you just work a little harder.\n\nI suppose it's like Cholita, yesterday.  She wanted to take a train to nowhere,  but for whatever reason the train wasn't available to her that day.\n\nSo she walked to a starbucks, and gave me a call to come get her.\n\nNow, starbucks is wonderful.  It wakes you up, and gives you energy.\n\nBut it doesn't make you happy all the rest of the day.\n\nCholita wasn't there when I arrived, so I had to search for her.\n\nFinally she texted me, \"I'm in heaven!\".\n\nI found her sitting on the floor in the Barnes and Noble, the last of the great book shops.\n\nShe had a stack of books on her lap.\n\nSo the red zone is like Starbucks is to Cholita, but the orange zone is a Barnes and Nobel.\n\nSilent Knowledge!\n\nLast night I was almost to the book store.

Some passages are below, as well as the link. \n\n\"The discovery of the assemblage point is what made the ancient sorcerers powerful. But for generations they went bananas figuring where to place it and how to fix it there. Thus emerged the arts of dreaming and stalking. Dreaming is the art of using the natural process of sleep to displace the assemblage point to new locations, and stalking is the art of affixing the assemblage point in the new position in order to assemble bona fide, new, all inclusive worlds. They became so versed in fixing the position of the assemblage point that they ended up in the new positions, staying there, never coming back. It's like skins of an onion. There are billions of possible positions, but not all of these give us all inclusive worlds. Don Juan figured that about 600 of the positions were worlds, the rest were phantoms, they were \"too fast\", and didn't have enough \"meat\" for us to hold on to. Not that don Juan ever got to them, but the sorcerers of antiquity did.\n\nEven if I only enter the 6000 skins of the onion, it's infinitely better than dying of cancer. Give it to me...\"\n\n...\n\n\"The first art, Dreaming, is the art of using dreams as bona fide gates of perception. It's the condition of harnessing \"dreaming attention\", or art of fixing the attention in dreams on different objects in our dreams, systematically. It's a disciplined way of reminding that you must look at objects. Just a glance, staying on objects as long as possible until it starts to dissolve, then you switch, and repeat, until there is no more attention left, and you fall asleep.\n\nSomething in us records our effort; we get better until we focus attention on anything we want - 100 objects... Dreams follow the natural movement of the assemblage point. It moves a great deal, or only slightly. When the assemblage point moves to \"phantom\" positions, we experience a regular dream. One day your assemblage point will be in a key position. By then you've harnessed your dreaming attention, and can focus on as many objects as you want. The energy body knows the threshold - how many objects you need to switch between. Suppose mine is 16 objects. I focus on 16, afterwhich I am in a different world, providing my assemblage point moved to one of the 6000 positions. Don't despair. One day it will move to one of these \"meaty\" positions. At that point you'll know your threshold. You'll hear, \"16 objects\".\n\nThere are two choices; one is to explore the human unknown, the positions within the luminous eggs. The other is the unknowable, which can only be known partially. This is the realm of the new seers.\n\nThe 2nd art, is the art of fixing the assemblage point at the new position. You've fixed at phantoms enough to have weird dreams. But by the time you get to the meat, you've become versed enough to know how to fix your assemblage point there. Then, off you go. The danger is in getting trapped. You move bodily, permanently. The old seers couldn't get back. But when travelling outside the egg, the abstract doesn't want you. \"You\" do. It's human indulgence which pulls and traps us at points within the human unknown. The sorcerers of antiquity, although lost, are \"in heaven\". Best of possible worlds. But, not for don Juan's mentality. Don Juan's purpose was total freedom. Freedom is defined as the capacity to let awareness grow to full length.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Looking at the body, sorcerers see a counterpart/twin. Where is this counterpart? For some it is close, but others don't have it. Why? If this is truly a twin universe, why is this counterpart in Japan? Something has connived to push it away.\n\nThe more disciplined you are, the closer your energy body is to you. The contact is via your assemblage point. The \"dreaming body\", or energy body (they mean the same, but I like to call it energy body; dreaming body assumes we make it in dreaming, while energy body is more abstract) has an assemblage point, too. Via dreaming, one can get close to the energy body, but not via lucid dreaming. The energy body gets closer by practicing dreaming, or exercising your dreaming attention. Twin universes are not excluded. We are holders of dualisms. Body and mind is not a dualism to sorcerers. The body and the energy  is a dualism.\"\n\n...\n\nAnd some more by another participant:\n\n...\n\n\"Sorcerers like to direct this division to get to \"what is permissible.\" The same kind of dichotomy is true of our world. On one side is the organics' world -- including us and other organisms with awareness. On the other side is the inorganics' realm -- entities with awareness but without organic beings. \"The structure of their world is different but complimentary to ours.\" The sorcerers found that the inorganic beings came to them in dreams. Dreams, at least certain kinds of special dreams, are \"trap doors\" that open for passage into the inorganic beings' side of the universe, and that allow them passage into our world. Only in dreams can we balance our energy sufficiently to perceive this other realm. Our velocity is otherwise too fast to perceive them at all.\n\nThe old sorcerers found that dreams gave access to the inorganic and other realms. They named the beings there \"the allies.\" This term is not accurate, of course, since these beings were not able to act as allies in this realm, and they failed the sorcerers in their time of crisis. Since then, the sorcerers have stayed away from them. DJ felt that the only thing to do was to stay away from inorganic beings. The moment you use the trap door, \"you enter into a well organized veritable world, whether you like it or not.\" Sorcerers train their dreaming attention -- developing it at the beginning by remembering to focus their eyes on any object and to focus for longer than a glance, and then to move on to another object, and then another.\n\nThey found that for each individual there is a threshold number of objects that we can focus on until the dream becomes something else. In non-ordinary dreams, once you reach this threshold point, you're off to something else. Such special dreams are heralded by something quite unusual -- for example, an image like flying fish. Once you learn to trap your attention, you can arrive at the threshold whenever \"you hit a dream that is not a dream.\"\n\nDJ gave CC the task of looking at his hands in his dreams, and CC turned it into an obsession. He found that he couldn't do it [and mimics himself saying to DJ that he can't find his hands. DJ said he could look for something else: \"Look for your penis.\" CC mimics himself saying, in a whiny voice, \"Make up your mind, once and for all. I don't like your jokes.\"] DJ told him initially to look for his hands \"or something else,\" and he simply ignored the \"something else\" part. [This reminded him of a woman who kept a list of all the reasons she was special. He'll bring the list for us before the end of the workshop. On the list, for example, was the fact that a professor once told her, \"You are way too mature.\" When CC questioned whether there was something missing in that statement, she talked to the professor and found out to her chagrin that he had been trying to say, \"You are way too mature to act like an asshole.\"] CC saw everything else but not his hands. In fact, he only found his hands once in his dreams -- and then they weren't really his but some big hairy hands. [They found some plastic ape hands recently, and felt that the way they look, in cupped position, are depictive of how we as humans are -- with little grasping gorilla hands. He'll bring them in to show us.] But CC had actually succeeded with DJ's assignment without knowing it by focusing on all the other things in his dreams. [He is sure that his mentioning this command of DJ's had the same effect on those reading his books as it did on him -- making us obsessive about finding our hands.]\n\nDreaming attention is another source of discipline that renders us inedible to the Flyers. Once you cross the trap door, something comes to take you either to another layer of the onion, or to the dual universe of the inorganic beings. You control which direction you go by voicing your intent -- essentially giving an order, such as \"Take me to your world.\" The only thing they listen to is a direct order, it does no good at all to plead, whine or act placatingly. You \"don't order them in an arrogant way,\" but in a strong, forceful, convincing manner. (\"If you are well brought up, you can say 'please' or 'thank you' too,\" he joked, \"but it's optional.\")\n\nOnce you voice your desire to go, these balls of energy take you. DJ told him to go elsewhere, and to not voice his intent to go to the IB's world. But CC has always had this strange proclivity to get himself into dangerous things.\"\n\n...\n\n\"So CC is a \"reckless idiot\" by nature, someone who takes chances. DJ told him he would start hearing a voice, the Dreaming Emissary, but told him not to listen to it. One day he heard a voice, but told himself it was some kind of post-hallucinogenic effect. The voice, however, is from another world, and adapts itself for you. For him it started out as a man's voice, speaking Argentine Spanish, or English from the West Coast of the United States. It used endearing Argentinean terms -- like \"flaco,\" \"hijito,\" and \"boludo.\" And the voice said that it would reveal to him anything he wanted to know. But its results \"were always asynchronous.\" It would tell him something about someone two months after he had asked, or even 5 years later, by which time he didn't care anymore.\n\nThis dreaming emissary voice attaches itself to us physically. To him it felt physically like it was coming from the area near his liver.\n\nThe IB world is basically feminine, and by the end it was a woman's voice he heard -- \"quite exquisite.\" Males are coveted in this world because they are a \"little twist\" on a female base. [He mimicked being \"macho,\" and then really just a \"little twist.\" Then he described how he once blew his nose so hard when he was at DJ's that he blew his adenoid out. His immediate reaction was to \"go and show it to mommy.\" That then reminded him of working in a mental hospital, where a guy who had no feeling in his body wedged out one of his eyeballs and then brought it to the doctor saying, \"Look what happened.\" Being only a psychiatrist and not a surgeon, the doctor fainted. The same patient later was found in the process of sawing off his arm, singing \"Old MacDonald had a farm.\"]\n\nDJ didn't count on CC's \"imbecility.\" The dreaming emissary is a very appealing salesman. It says, \"All you have to do is give me a word.\" The word is \"forever.\" \"If you give me your word, we could elongate your awareness to five billion years. You could see inconceivable things, like the heart of a star, and it won't burn you. You won't have to breathe. But, we can't force you, it's your choice.\" DJ told him not to fall for it.\"\n\n...\n\n\"DJ planned to somersault to avoid the IB's world. But CC knows that we can't make the definitive journey without going through the \"cousins' home.\" Even though that world \"is heavily mixed with ours,\" DJ insisted on staying away from it. DJ was \"into heavy denial.\" CC believes it is better to deal with that world now; to learn how to manage it before making the ultimate journey.\n\nIB's can lower our speed and increase theirs, giving us either fleeting glimpses or sustained interaction. Women can do this fairly easily. Men must fight a lot more, just like men have to read a lot. \"Women don't have to read so much. Well, there may be women philosophers who do.\" [Florinda looked uncomfortable at this point.] \"And maybe German women, German philosopher women.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Meaty Worlds\nA person needs to build up dreaming attention before they can really do dreaming. Lucid dreaming is not what sorcerer's call dreaming. To build up dreaming attention a person must begin to isolate objects in their normal dreams and hold them as long as possible. Once a person can hold a threshold number of object they will be automatically whisked away into another world. There are millions of worlds within the reach of man that are Phantom worlds. Phantom worlds are worlds that lack any kind of solid structure. Also with in the reach of man are Meaty worlds that have a solidity equal to our daily worlds. The ancient sorcerers painstakingly mapped out every meaty world that they could assemble. They concluded that there were only about 6000 Meaty worlds within the reach of man.\"\n\n[Workshop notes](http://castaneda-ru.com/viewtopic.php?id=889)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A notes from Tensegrity workshop, covering dreaming and IB topic", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_evk16w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3tl0tnl8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1580309846.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1580285314.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have found an interesting notes from the Tensegrity workshop where Carlos talked quite a lot of the topic of dreaming.

The one Carlos gave us.\n\nBut at the end I wanted to clarify that you can't assume the second attention looks like anything in particular, consistently.\n\nPeople who do darkroom know that.  If you have an inorganic being friend, they never really look the same twice.\n\nNor does anything in the second attention.  Here's the quote I plan to insert:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"What's it like to see, don Juan?\"\n\n\"You have to learn to see in order to know that. I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"Is it a secret I shouldn't know?\"\n\n\"No. It's just that I can't describe it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't make sense to you.\"\n\n\"Try me, don Juan. Maybe it'll make sense to me.\"\n\n\"No. You must do it yourself. Once you learn, you can see every single thing in the world in a different way.\"\n\n\"Then, don Juan, you don't see the world in the usual way any more.\"\n\n\"I see both ways. When I want to look at the world I see it the way you do. Then when I want to see it I look at it the way I know and I perceive it in a different way.\"\n\n\"Do things look consistently the same every time you see them?\"\n\n\"Things don't change. You change your way of looking, that's all\"\n\n\"I mean, don Juan, that if you see, for instance, the same tree, does it remain the same every time you see it?\"\n\n\"No. It changes and yet it's the same.\"\n\n\"But if the same tree changes every time you see it, your seeing may be a mere illusion.\"\n\nHe laughed and did not answer for some time, but seemed to be thinking. Finally he said, \"Whenever you look at things you don't see them. You just look at them, I suppose, to make sure that something is there. Since you're not concerned with seeing, things look very much the same every time you look at them. When you learn to see, on the other hand, a thing is never the same every time you see it, and yet it is the same. I told you, for instance, that a man is like an egg. Every time I see the same man I see an egg, yet it is not the same egg.\"\n\n\"But you won't be able to recognize anything, since nothing is the same; so what's the advantage of learning to see?\"\n\n\"You can tell things apart. You can see them for what they really are.\"\n\n\"Don't I see things as they really are?\"\n\n\"No. Your eyes have learned only to look. Take, for example, the three people you encountered, the three Mexicans. You have described them in detail, and even told me what clothes they wore. And that only proved to me that you didn't see them at all. If you were capable of seeing you would have known on the spot that they were not people.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nKeep in mind, this is one way you can spot fake magic instantly.\n\nBecause if they ever even really did the \"cool stuff\" they claim, to trick students they fail to mention that they only did it once or twice.\n\nOr they would have realized, everything mutates.\n\nThere isn't another kind of magic out there, which behaves like the fakers claim.\n\nAt least if there is, no one has found it after decades of searching.\n\nBut it is pretty obvious that what everyone is claiming is magic, is just the same as we do.\n\nThat's what mankind has.\n\nThe ability to stop perceiving our normal reality and shift the assemblage point down, so that reality mutates.\n\nAnd when it does, you're in \"uncharted waters\".\n\nThere aren't billions of people making that real.  So it can change.  And does.\n\nAt any given depth of the assemblage point there are 20,000 variations on what you are perceiving.\n\nAnd nothing to hold you to a particular one.\n\nWith many such \"depths\" available.\n\nLet's take a practical example.\n\nThe Jewish prophets perceived \"The Shining One\".\n\nLucifer.\n\nBut it's a sure bet someone just saw that once or twice, or they would have realized you can get any spirit you encounter, even \"the king of the demons\", to turn into whatever you like.\n\nBecause they have no physical body here.  It's elsewhere.\n\nWhat you see is just a projection designed to get your attention.\n\nSame for the Buddha and his 4 dancing girls in blue dresses.\n\nIf he'd had any control, he'd have realized it's just one spirit and he could make it turn into anything he wanted.\n\nBut typically a beginner who lucks out and sees a spirit is completely fooled by the appearance.\n\nAnd unable to repeat that.\n\nSo they just tell that story over and over, as if that's how reality works.\n\nThat all other realities are just like this one, but with different scenery.\n\nWe don't want anyone believing that, as a result of this video.\n\nSo at the end, TPW (tensegrity policewoman) finds herself in waking dreaming, where the dreaming emissary is waiting to explain what I just said.\n\nFarfetched?\n\nNO!  I've done that more times than I can possibly count.\n\nThe dreaming emissary comes even if you are fully awake, and teaches in some \"pleasing\" or frightening form, in a real environment that takes your breath away.\n\nThat's what they do.\n\nAt first that is.  Later on you begin to be unsuitable for their tricks, and you don't get things that vivid anymore.\n\nWhich forces you to the next stage, Silent Knowledge.\n\nBut that's another topic.\n\nI believe I'm going to reenact 2 stories Carlos told us, with that cowboy.\n\nOne, that he staged a bar fight home movie with Bruce Lee, and Howard Lee.  And Carlos as the bartender.\n\nAnd the other, the joke Carlos told us. \n\n\"A man walks into a bar with a duck.  The bartender asks...\"\n\nI'm afraid i forgot that joke. I hope it's not lost.\n\nIt was a joke designed to create \"cognitive dissonance\".\n\nA little jolt, to loosen the assemblage point.\n\nSo skip to the end of this new version of the video, where TPW finds herself in IOB territory.\n\nI'll put the missing scenes back in there later when I have time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezmlohs89scb1.png?width=2179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcb9892fc8ff90ba7c29b95357b555baa08b4bed\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cartoon with \"surprise ending\".", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Audiovisual"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"irl2d0l9ascb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/1539dpf/asset/irl2d0l9ascb1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718050381%2CYjQzYTUzMWEyMTQ1ODU2NTVkOWVkODBhNjA5NjZkY2ZhNDg2ZTU4NDBmNjYyYWQ3MWJlZTBhZjk1ZGIwY2EwNA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/1539dpf/asset/irl2d0l9ascb1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718050381%2COTc2NTJiMzQ1N2FmNTY1NjVhYmFmMzM4YmRmZTNlMDZlZTM3NTAzZmQ2MDYxNjhkYWMzYTE0NWY4ZGVhNjhmYg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "irl2d0l9ascb1", "isGif": false}, "ezmlohs89scb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ezmlohs89scb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f0cd6576ed9df2c754ca3638d7658bae574b945"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ezmlohs89scb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c35a60e96e37efc139e75957821431b578d8462"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ezmlohs89scb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9abe282e55a8e4ceb1c6de5ecbdc60d7fee07bd"}, {"y": 359, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ezmlohs89scb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97f86977d57e382e608318e87a0295a132904a77"}, {"y": 538, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ezmlohs89scb1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acefc1435a15bddf2e8c3ac7d1b6079f905094fb"}, {"y": 606, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ezmlohs89scb1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9b9bc7b52b7fd3f480a71932ea5b78b0a0d5e40"}], "s": {"y": 1223, "x": 2179, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ezmlohs89scb1.png?width=2179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcb9892fc8ff90ba7c29b95357b555baa08b4bed"}, "id": "ezmlohs89scb1"}}, "name": "t3_1539dpf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Audiovisual", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yq82AO9_vJ_Wj1DX1dAIVxmcGlHXHv1GnCVHbUxnAjU.jpg", "edited": 1689712492.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1689712000.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1539dpf/video/irl2d0l9ascb1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/1539dpf/video/irl2d0l9ascb1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid inventory warrior types from watching the cartoon and adding that to their arsenal of fake sorcery knowledge, there&amp;#39;s a surprise ending now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still missing instructional scenes where the assemblage point moves, you get to see it from the front and understand why &amp;quot;the shift left&amp;quot; is a misnomer, and it&amp;#39;s probably going to include a lesson on what happens at each level on the J curve.

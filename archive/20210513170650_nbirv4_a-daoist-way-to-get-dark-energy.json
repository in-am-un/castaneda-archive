Daoists are just as bad as westerners in having, \"Book Deal\" motivations.\n\nFor newbies, we got trapped here in this limited reality by our attention. Where it focuses determines where the assemblage point moves. When flooded with \"thought loops\", meaning topics that produce a vicious cycle keeping our minds on a single range of  ideas endlessly,  our attention can get stuck permanently on this one assemblage point position.   The position currently in use by humanity.\n\nThat's why the key to darkroom gazing is to silence the internal dialogue.\n\nWhen a person sees nothing but that ordinary position of the assemblage point all of their entire lives, it seems impossible to believe that magic is possible.  Our common sense begins to tell us that it is not.  This keeps us from putting in enough effort to learn to move our assemblage point. If we try to escape our mind tells us that it's wasted effort, and we should be putting our time into something else.  Like watching movies.  That allows us to escape reliably, for a while.\n\nSome get the idea to escape anyway, but with their minds convinced it's not possible, they will accept substitutes.    If magic is too difficult, or even impossible, then just get yourself a certificate that says you can escape (are a sorcerer), and that's good enough.\n\nYou can even earn a little money that way.  And although you won't get to explore infinity the way sorcerers do, at least you can pretend you are getting more respect from others, based on the \"sorcery school certificates\" you have earned.\n\nThat's the current situation in the Castaneda community.  The sellers of phony magic have lured people in with easier formula based sorcery knowledge, which actually contains no magic.  When confronted, they will tell you that magic is evil, of the \"old sorcerers\", and that they are \"warriors\".\n\nMeaning, pretend magic.\n\nI thought that showing people real magic, magic for free, with others succeeding, would be enough to turn things around.\n\nBut it isn't.  The \"book deal mind\" has people longing for sorcery degrees they can buy from the phony sorcerers.  The \"certificate of sorcery knowledge\" has become the goal.  And having magic is just an annoyance.  It reminds the bearer of the phony degree that it is in fact not what they wanted in the first place.  I suppose they console themselves with promises of money they can earn, as a \"sorcery teacher and counselor\".\n\nHere you see one way Daoists earn money on the Island of Taipei.  By demonic possession.\n\nLet me warn you that if you have not spent a lot of time in Asia, you cannot possibly comprehend the social pressures they live under.   And if you violate any of the social rules, it brings shame not only on you, but on your father, and your ancestors.\n\nIn this video, the women you see wandering around the young men actually believe in this form of demonic possession. They aren't pretending. It's been trained into them from childhood. It's also part of their ancestor worship, so to deviate from their beliefs would also bring dishonor to their ancestors.\n\nJunior High students in Taipei commonly pretend to go into these Daoist trances to get attention, and being so  young they can contort into the most astounding postures.  They know that if anyone asks, the can simply claim \"I don't remember any of it\".\n\nMost business owners have a small shrine in their office, where they toss the \"moon blocks\" divining objects, to get help from ancestors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Jiaobei](https://preview.redd.it/99j2m5tlhwy61.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=992b4d83184c0a4547807158de124466ea5b84d7)\n\nPeople believe in their connections to their ancestors so strongly, they actually burn \"Ghost Money\" at the temple, along with pictures of important household items like scissors, believing the money and objects will then be given to their grandparents in heaven.\n\nI once watched one of these ceremonies at a Chinese business that was being sued over a phony patent. The lawsuit was resolved shortly after the ceremony, with the best possible outcome for the chinese business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3iygw2unawy61.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b83f84a4d19af48fa2da7780ed4fbc1969f30a43\n\nBut back to the Taoist Sorcerers for a while.  I get a little flack in here for putting down Daoists, because westerners read their sales literature (wise sayings), and believe it helps them learn sorcery.\n\nIn fact, it's just another \"thought loop\". If you pay attention to those who object to my honesty on that topic, honesty Carlos voiced reluctantly knowing how attached to those ideas people can become, you'll see a lot of anger coming out of them.\n\nThat demonstrates they have a strong emotional bond to those thoughts.  A bond which becomes another reason they will not be able to escape this view of reality.\n\nAnd there's no doubt there is some knowledge in Daoist wise sayings.  Modern Daoists evolved from the same strain of sorcerers as the Jewish Prophets. At the same time on this world, the Olmecs were developing the kind of sorcery we practice.\n\nAgriculture was just barely rising at the time, and people were still free to explore the world as part of their hunting/gathering activities. It wasn't until agriculture completely took over, that people's minds became too trapped to escape, due to living entirely inside rooms with 4 walls surrounding them. And only the people they knew to occupy their attention. Life became one single thought loop for the city dwellers, fed by rising agriculture.\n\nBefore that, people ran into inorganic beings while out in the world looking around.  They had things outside the social order to occupy their minds, reducing the most oppressive of thought loops, and making it easier to perceive magic.  Meaning, easier to perceive \"spirits\".\n\nIn fact, all sorcery comes from inorganic beings. They are the teachers of magic.  The magic they teach is almost always misrepresented by the recipient and those he tells it to, and when it's vivid and powerful it leads to exploitation, franchises to teach it, certificates to prove who can earn money from it and who isn't qualified, and we end up with \"religions\".  Follow the path of the Buddha, and this is clearly demonstrated.\n\nBut at the base, it's all inorganic being magic.\n\nDemons.\n\nI like to say, all religions were created by demons.\n\nJust because it's fun to say that.  But in fact, it's true.  Inorganic beings are nearly always labeled as \"demons\", which helps to produce the appearance they have based on social expectations, making it very difficult for the person viewing them, to deny they are demons.\n\nThe most vivid glimpses of inorganic beings that ancient man got were undoubtedly driven by power plants. The same way Carlos got his first exposure to inorganic beings, using the smoking mixture and Devil's Weed.\n\nLikewise, Daoism in particular is an offshoot of the \"vinegar\" given to Christ on the cross.\n\nWhich is the same as the \"ration of bitter wine\" given to Roman Soldiers as they tried to take over the known world.\n\nOr more precisely, it's from the power plant we would refer to as \"middle eastern wild poppies\".\n\nI wish I could recall the scientific name, but you can imagine what comes up if you google \"wild poppies\".\n\nNot that plant for sure.   You'll see one of it's cultivated offspring.\n\nI'm not even sure the original plant is not now extent. But that plant contained a chemical that simulates natural endorphins.  The molecules in it have the same shape, on one part, as the shape of our \"reward chemicals\" in the brain. So if you get some floating around in your blood, you get rewarded at levels impossible through the natural methods which produce that chemical, such as jogging, or winning the lottery.\n\nThe intense concentration in the plant produces an ecstatic trance state which in China is known as \"Chasing the Dragon\".\n\nIt's also an amazing pain killer.\n\nWarning: You will stop breathing. So forget whatever you were thinking. Go watch Johnny Depp kill himself in \"From Hell\", and take that as a weak warning. The true situation is much worse than you will imagine.\n\nThat wild poppy was widely cultivated in the middle east, until we ended up with our modern varieties.\n\nSome of which you can see growing outside the white house.  Jefferson grew those red opium poppies and they've been kept there for historical reasons.\n\nIn the middle east, they were used to \"gin up\" cheap wine.  The worst wine in the world could easily be sold, if you added a little poppy pod extract.\n\nThe romans were total addicts, and carried it everywhere.\n\nWhile on the cross, some soldiers took pity on Jesus and offered him some to kill the pain.  The King James translation doesn't make this clear and calls it, \"vinegar\", because of it's very bitter taste.  Apparently the soldiers had a bucket of it with them, with a sponge and a pole, likely indicating they used it often to help those being crucified.\n\nThat wine is horrible.  But the high it produces is so wonderful, people put up with the vomit inducing taste.\n\nThe Akkadians, the magical kingdom of the \"fish people\", were the sworn enemies of the Jews.\n\nThey created Daoism.\n\nIt was a poppy wine cult.  If you read descriptions of \"the Tao\", you are reading a description of an opium high.\n\nPower plant sorcery.\n\nThe Akkadians became the Chinese, possibly after mixing with ancient africans.  Some even say the queen of Sheba was involved in their creation.  Considering her relationship to Solomon and his Jewish magic, it's not too big of a stretch.\n\nPowerful people back then pursued sorcery.  It was inevitable.\n\nTo this day Daoist monasteries in Asia grow opium flowers as a source of income, and to partake of when no one's looking.\n\nIf you think there aren't a bunch of drug addicts among yogis and daoists, you haven't looked around much.\n\nSame as there are a bunch of drug addicts among Castaneda fans.  They pass through here, hopeless to learn anything because they believe they already have what they need.\n\nBut back to demonic possession.\n\nIt's not as pointless as it looks.  Naturally, the real purpose is to swindle people out of their money.  You pay a Daoist priest to allow himself to become possessed by evil spirits and he battles them to get the help you need, under constant threat of being completely taken over.\n\nSometimes he has to bang his head with a nail stuck in a board until it bleeds, to prevent the demon from taking full control. And to prove he's now impervious to pain.  The same way the Daoist sorcerers in the Boxer Rebellion believed they were impervious to bullets, until the coming Chinese communist government murdered them all.\n\nThe more difficult your problem or question, the further into the trance the \"sorcerer\" has to go, and the more risk to him. And  the more money you ought to give him, after the \"show\".\n\nTaoism has been \"book dealed\" beyond any levels we can imagine, and all of Asia has bought the entire series of books. It's embedded in their movies, cartoons, and video games.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't sincere Daoists who use this trance to move their assemblage points.  In fact, if you really do what they are pretending to do, the assemblage point moves a tiny bit simply because you are focusing inward and forcing yourself not to have your usual internal dialogue.\n\nIt's the same trick the jewish prophets used to visit heaven and view demons.  They would \"fold in half\", putting their head between their ankles, force out thoughts, and then force out anything at all they could find in addition to that (images in the mind for example), until their assemblage points shifted and they saw \"the divine light\".\n\nIt was poorly understood darkroom gazing.\n\nIn the case of Daoists who enter trances, you could say that it is \"closed eye, inorganic being assisted darkroom gazing\".\n\nThe assemblage point moves, the Daoist priest senses the second attention, and an inorganic being picks up on their primitive waking dreaming,  taking over whatever it can in their mind.\n\nIOBs are usually not visible to sorcerers.  Our variety of sorcery is unique in that.  We move our assemblage points so well, they actually become visible.\n\nBut even among sorcerers in the americas, that's unique.  Rosy at Morongo and Maria Sabina in Mexico, could not visually see their spirit guides.\n\nIt's the same with Daoists.\n\nThe \"creepy feeling\" of being taken over is the dark energy we all need, to move our assemblage points further.\n\nSo remember this: When you hear that Howard Lee told his students that Carlos went bad, due to hanging out with inorganic beings, keep in mind.\n\nHe's a Hong Kong Daoist. His understanding of inorganic beings is tainted by his cultural upbringing.\n\nAnd even Daoists need the dark energy of inorganic beings, to move their assemblage points.\n\nBut they've become used to cashing in on their sorcery knowledge, and one of the ways to increase the price of their \"services\" is to claim that contact with inorganic beings shortens your lifespan.\n\nThus for the 5 years they'll lose, you have to pay them a huge sum of money, if you want their help.\n\nOf course they size up your pocket book, and adjust how many \"years they will lose\" for helping you.\n\nSteeped in this belief, it was natural for Howard to conclude that inorganic beings killed Carlos.\n\nBut in fact, they tried to save him. I was there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Daoist Way To Get Dark Energy", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"99j2m5tlhwy61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/99j2m5tlhwy61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f13e51738890332bc8c7de00d613492c0835d228"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/99j2m5tlhwy61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bebd3a6e013c6f3aa94f573083c5dd3f3acc186"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/99j2m5tlhwy61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d92dae79185c1617bb9d0ff56a75880326a754aa"}], "s": {"y": 375, "x": 375, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/99j2m5tlhwy61.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=992b4d83184c0a4547807158de124466ea5b84d7"}, "id": "99j2m5tlhwy61"}, "3iygw2unawy61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3iygw2unawy61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=857cee2e0b4de51547365b2ef582a9da6f4cfb7c"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3iygw2unawy61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b96d6b80c1e045e43777b0d87857d9688f41c11"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3iygw2unawy61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55c6413d50ed2f1525fad83b92a33bd5bf7add17"}], "s": {"y": 479, "x": 638, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3iygw2unawy61.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b83f84a4d19af48fa2da7780ed4fbc1969f30a43"}, "id": "3iygw2unawy61"}, "xpdrx0d87wy61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 61, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpdrx0d87wy61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc33535578ee5b4d246d7e731b91ad12304f1275"}, {"y": 122, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpdrx0d87wy61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=417170a73cd2767101d4e932dd417b8205a9d4df"}, {"y": 181, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpdrx0d87wy61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a3fe58622c26e9a01959b9124d598ddd28aa67d"}, {"y": 363, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpdrx0d87wy61.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593688142bd3c66cbeb1643dbb16932bb8f06307"}, {"y": 545, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpdrx0d87wy61.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d24db6470572e6928eea54c8f6a6947b0088dfa"}, {"y": 613, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpdrx0d87wy61.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=705fe7d9ad2dd46a97f6803114171a8b41052ba7"}], "s": {"y": 725, "x": 1276, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xpdrx0d87wy61.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5572a5fd411fb0fcb27dd78bba1d36a27b82859"}, "id": "xpdrx0d87wy61"}}, "name": "t3_nbirv4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 14, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjXaLpZgcjA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

The lawsuit was resolved shortly after the ceremony, with the best possible outcome for the chinese business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3iygw2unawy61.png?width=638&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b83f84a4d19af48fa2da7780ed4fbc1969f30a43\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3iygw2unawy61.png?width=638&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b83f84a4d19af48fa2da7780ed4fbc1969f30a43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to the Taoist Sorcerers for a while.  I get a little flack in here for putting down Daoists, because westerners read their sales literature (wise sayings), and believe it helps them learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s just another &amp;quot;thought loop&amp;quot;. If you pay attention to those who object to my honesty on that topic, honesty Carlos voiced reluctantly knowing how attached to those ideas people can become, you&amp;#39;ll see a lot of anger coming out of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That demonstrates they have a strong emotional bond to those thoughts.  A bond which becomes another reason they will not be able to escape this view of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s no doubt there is some knowledge in Daoist wise sayings.  Modern Daoists evolved from the same strain of sorcerers as the Jewish Prophets. At the same time on this world, the Olmecs were developing the kind of sorcery we practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Agriculture was just barely rising at the time, and people were still free to explore the world as part of their hunting/gathering activities. It wasn&amp;#39;t until agriculture completely took over, that people&amp;#39;s minds became too trapped to escape, due to living entirely inside rooms with 4 walls surrounding them. And only the people they knew to occupy their attention. Life became one single thought loop for the city dwellers, fed by rising agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before that, people ran into inorganic beings while out in the world looking around.  They had things outside the social order to occupy their minds, reducing the most oppressive of thought loops, and making it easier to perceive magic.  Meaning, easier to perceive &amp;quot;spirits&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, all sorcery comes from inorganic beings. They are the teachers of magic.  The magic they teach is almost always misrepresented by the recipient and those he tells it to, and when it&amp;#39;s vivid and powerful it leads to exploitation, franchises to teach it, certificates to prove who can earn money from it and who isn&amp;#39;t qualified, and we end up with &amp;quot;religions&amp;quot;.  Follow the path of the Buddha, and this is clearly demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the base, it&amp;#39;s all inorganic being magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to say, all religions were created by demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just because it&amp;#39;s fun to say that.  But in fact, it&amp;#39;s true.  Inorganic beings are nearly always labeled as &amp;quot;demons&amp;quot;, which helps to produce the appearance they have based on social expectations, making it very difficult for the person viewing them, to deny they are demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most vivid glimpses of inorganic beings that ancient man got were undoubtedly driven by power plants. The same way Carlos got his first exposure to inorganic beings, using the smoking mixture and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Daoism in particular is an offshoot of the &amp;quot;vinegar&amp;quot; given to Christ on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is the same as the &amp;quot;ration of bitter wine&amp;quot; given to Roman Soldiers as they tried to take over the known world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or more precisely, it&amp;#39;s from the power plant we would refer to as &amp;quot;middle eastern wild poppies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could recall the scientific name, but you can imagine what comes up if you google &amp;quot;wild poppies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that plant for sure.   You&amp;#39;ll see one of it&amp;#39;s cultivated offspring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even sure the original plant is not now extent. But that plant contained a chemical that simulates natural endorphins.  The molecules in it have the same shape, on one part, as the shape of our &amp;quot;reward chemicals&amp;quot; in the brain. So if you get some floating around in your blood, you get rewarded at levels impossible through the natural methods which produce that chemical, such as jogging, or winning the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intense concentration in the plant produces an ecstatic trance state which in China is known as &amp;quot;Chasing the Dragon&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also an amazing pain killer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warning: You will stop breathing. So forget whatever you were thinking. Go watch Johnny Depp kill himself in &amp;quot;From Hell&amp;quot;, and take that as a weak warning. The true situation is much worse than you will imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That wild poppy was widely cultivated in the middle east, until we ended up with our modern varieties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of which you can see growing outside the white house.  Jefferson grew those red opium poppies and they&amp;#39;ve been kept there for historical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle east, they were used to &amp;quot;gin up&amp;quot; cheap wine.  The worst wine in the world could easily be sold, if you added a little poppy pod extract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The romans were total addicts, and carried it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While on the cross, some soldiers took pity on Jesus and offered him some to kill the pain.  The King James translation doesn&amp;#39;t make this clear and calls it, &amp;quot;vinegar&amp;quot;, because of it&amp;#39;s very bitter taste.  Apparently the soldiers had a bucket of it with them, with a sponge and a pole, likely indicating they used it often to help those being crucified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That wine is horrible.  But the high it produces is so wonderful, people put up with the vomit inducing taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Akkadians, the magical kingdom of the &amp;quot;fish people&amp;quot;, were the sworn enemies of the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They created Daoism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a poppy wine cult.  If you read descriptions of &amp;quot;the Tao&amp;quot;, you are reading a description of an opium high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Power plant sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Akkadians became the Chinese, possibly after mixing with ancient africans.  Some even say the queen of Sheba was involved in their creation.  Considering her relationship to Solomon and his Jewish magic, it&amp;#39;s not too big of a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Powerful people back then pursued sorcery.  It was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this day Daoist monasteries in Asia grow opium flowers as a source of income, and to partake of when no one&amp;#39;s looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think there aren&amp;#39;t a bunch of drug addicts among yogis and daoists, you haven&amp;#39;t looked around much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as there are a bunch of drug addicts among Castaneda fans.  They pass through here, hopeless to learn anything because they believe they already have what they need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to demonic possession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as pointless as it looks.  Naturally, the real purpose is to swindle people out of their money.  You pay a Daoist priest to allow himself to become possessed by evil spirits and he battles them to get the help you need, under constant threat of being completely taken over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes he has to bang his head with a nail stuck in a board until it bleeds, to prevent the demon from taking full control. And to prove he&amp;#39;s now impervious to pain.  The same way the Daoist sorcerers in the Boxer Rebellion believed they were impervious to bullets, until the coming Chinese communist government murdered them all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more difficult your problem or question, the further into the trance the &amp;quot;sorcerer&amp;quot; has to go, and the more risk to him. And  the more money you ought to give him, after the &amp;quot;show&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taoism has been &amp;quot;book dealed&amp;quot; beyond any levels we can imagine, and all of Asia has bought the entire series of books. It&amp;#39;s embedded in their movies, cartoons, and video games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean there aren&amp;#39;t sincere Daoists who use this trance to move their assemblage points.  In fact, if you really do what they are pretending to do, the assemblage point moves a tiny bit simply because you are focusing inward and forcing yourself not to have your usual internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same trick the jewish prophets used to visit heaven and view demons.  They would &amp;quot;fold in half&amp;quot;, putting their head between their ankles, force out thoughts, and then force out anything at all they could find in addition to that (images in the mind for example), until their assemblage points shifted and they saw &amp;quot;the divine light&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was poorly understood darkroom gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of Daoists who enter trances, you could say that it is &amp;quot;closed eye, inorganic being assisted darkroom gazing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assemblage point moves, the Daoist priest senses the second attention, and an inorganic being picks up on their primitive waking dreaming,  taking over whatever it can in their mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs are usually not visible to sorcerers.  Our variety of sorcery is unique in that.  We move our assemblage points so well, they actually become visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even among sorcerers in the americas, that&amp;#39;s unique.  Rosy at Morongo and Maria Sabina in Mexico, could not visually see their spirit guides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same with Daoists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;creepy feeling&amp;quot; of being taken over is the dark energy we all need, to move our assemblage points further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So remember this: When you hear that Howard Lee told his students that Carlos went bad, due to hanging out with inorganic beings, keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a Hong Kong Daoist. His understanding of inorganic beings is tainted by his cultural upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even Daoists need the dark energy of inorganic beings, to move their assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;ve become used to cashing in on their sorcery knowledge, and one of the ways to increase the price of their &amp;quot;services&amp;quot; is to claim that contact with inorganic beings shortens your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus for the 5 years they&amp;#39;ll lose, you have to pay them a huge sum of money, if you want their help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course they size up your pocket book, and adjust how many &amp;quot;years they will lose&amp;quot; for helping you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steeped in this belief, it was natural for Howard to conclude that inorganic beings killed Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, they tried to save him. I was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dwa6iOes_g6usMQ67HssH0K1jvxaLmfS-ceS-KrCrsc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=59960ad9d39e148fc382df198f5c6621b9da9e67", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dwa6iOes_g6usMQ67HssH0K1jvxaLmfS-ceS-KrCrsc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26d55040b00e7ddd1d7bdd7a2b4300be24a91418", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dwa6iOes_g6usMQ67HssH0K1jvxaLmfS-ceS-KrCrsc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6021f3a4621fc375aa1680f448115d85d3fa85ee", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dwa6iOes_g6usMQ67HssH0K1jvxaLmfS-ceS-KrCrsc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bba5b7e7ddcdd46ed62d9b7e15d790feb104cab", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "ZOPb2JrcvV_FsPXawBMueQOH09WMtOduFTksDnyc4pw"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "nbirv4", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "Going In + Coming Out of Taoist Trances + Spirit Whips: Zhang Gong Sheng Jun B'day (August 24, 2016)", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjXaLpZgcjA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "Malaysia Travel Guide", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NjXaLpZgcjA/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/c/MalaysiaTravelGuide"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nbirv4/a_daoist_way_to_get_dark_energy/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/nbirv4/a_daoist_way_to_get_dark_energy/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1620918410.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gy0o3nc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1620936079.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gy0k8w2", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I can't think of any specific to that, except this one.

Using procedures designed to follow the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of a past sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rituals.  Like the mirror in the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the darkroom, so far, we have only my intent, and that&amp;#39;s it in Fairy&amp;#39;s pass.  With hers added to it of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their intent eventually substitutes for the intent you have to find on your own, as shown in that picture. Your intent &amp;quot;recognizes&amp;quot; that feeble face, and a clear one comes along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they take it over!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a version of 4 gates dreaming.  The first 2 steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;#39;s in waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same can be done in recapitulation and in Tensegrity, but that&amp;#39;s too far out there for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you will however, that some Tensegrity is a summoning spell for IOBs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of it!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the community is not advanced enough to do that for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now we should have had workshops where each participant brought their pet ally, like in a Harry Potter movie!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, we have &amp;quot;Path with Heart&amp;quot; hugging at workshops and bad men sneaking around trying to find paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in dreaming you have to look from &amp;quot;object to object&amp;quot; to generate the kind of energy they can&amp;#39;t resist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So  you use the puffs in waking dreaming.  Object to object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you are super advanced, and can translocate yourself into a full on waking dream. Here&amp;#39;s a post about that. I tried it again 2 days ago, to make sure it was repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mw8sve/3d_translocation/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mw8sve/3d_translocation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me entice you!  Please learn to do this! I haven&amp;#39;t the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn to repeat that form of translocation, until your IOB is like a street hooker, leaning up against that lamp.  I suppose she can be a classy street hooker, like &amp;quot;Pretty Woman&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not kidding.  You can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the Daoists tells stories about that sort of encounter.  Usually the hero is kidnapped and disappears for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have one of them, you don&amp;#39;t have to go looking for them anymore.  They come on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose there&amp;#39;s more to this than is obvious.  In 4 gates dreaming, the scouts eventually stop visiting your ordinary dreams, because they don&amp;#39;t need to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same happens in the dark room, once they take you to their world and become the dreaming emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, you learn what&amp;#39;s their favorite activity, so that you can summon them on demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_nbirv4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nbirv4/a_daoist_way_to_get_dark_energy/gy0o3nc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1620936079.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gyi1sla", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Cryptomitrist", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gyhxehj", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_8yn5rqvm", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Wonderful response!

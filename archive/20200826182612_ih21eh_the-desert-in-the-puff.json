to silence my internal dialogue after months of practice ( i started doing waking dreaming since the beginning of april), the silence i reached was different then what id expected, it came all at once and was very sudden and intense , there was very little transition (or my perception of time got really distorted) cause i was watching very faint puffs then i felt like a wave of heaviness enveloping me and my mind shut down completely if i had to sum up what i felt i would say : \"i felt i was falling into the silence\".  \nwhen my mind shut down i started gazing at a single puff in front of me and it started pulsating (like exploding and reforming) every time it exploded and reformed from the blackness it was more intense and the blackness was more black and it became bigger and bigger, till it started getting kind of circular, then conical and it started gaining depth then it stopped pulsating , it became like a tunnel which i could fully see in depth, then on the right side of the inside of the tunnel i saw VERY clearly a crow flying in the sky of a desert with some cactuses in the background (the image i made isn't the best representation , cause it was kind of inside of the circular part of the tunnel but i wouldn't know how to draw that my gimp skills are basic)\n\ni started watching the desert and then i kind of doozed off and im not fully sure if i entered a lucid dream, but if it was a lucid dream it was a perfect copy of my room, i remember only some fragments from this part:  \nfirst thing i member is my whole room was not dark anymore in fact it was lighted up with all kinds of colors over the surfaces, then i remember i tried to move my body, but couldn't manage to do it, i felt it was heavy as fuck or i didn't have enough energy  to move it, then i started watching around and i saw one small sphere of shadows (felt it was an iob) it was very small and near me it wasn't scary i just felt very curious about it and attracted to it, so i concentrated my attention on it and scooped it up in my hand (cause it was small but can't recall the exact shape) and started passing it over my torso like i do with colors, then i started gazing all over my room again and saw a second iob which was way bigger (can't recall the shape at all) and scared me pretty heavily so much so that i don't remember anything after this point.\n\ni wanna add that yesterday i probably met the same 2 iobs in a lucid dream when i fell asleep during practice, when i dreamed i was in another near perfect copy of one of the rooms in my house (but this was very clearly a lucid dream) and both iobs were present, this time the smallest one was a statue in front of me with which i played for a bit (and passed it over my body too), and the bigger one was like a flying ball of near transparent tentacles and fibers. one of the other most noticeable things were that where i use to wiggle fingers (zuleica technique)  there was a very bright and small dot of light.\n\nwanted also to add also some things i learned during these last months so that they might be usefull to the whole subreddit:\n\nwhen i started practicing i did 3 hours each day but divided in 3 sessions of 1 hour, this didn't really work, when i switched to a longer single practice session i started having way better results, i also got myself a VERY comfy chair with headrest this made my practice time way better too.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "the desert in the puff", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text",

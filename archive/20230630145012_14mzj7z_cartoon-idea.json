Which is what happens to Yogis and Buddhists.\n\nAnd you can't get obsessed with building zombies in the red zone. Or shapeshifting.\n\nThose also hold you back in the end and can even doom you. As we've heard, they doomed Julian.\n\nYou can't obsess over travel to other realms on the other side of your darkroom wall, in the orange zone.\n\nIf you're in the Olmec used car lot, you get to see all types of cars. But it's not expected that you'll take a 3 day test drive in each.\n\nThe car lot is the \"intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico\".\n\nBut you shouldn't expect to LIVE each car. You'll stall out and never reach the end of the lot.\n\nOnce you see all of them, then if you feel like it you can go back and get the hippy car and dwell in bliss.\n\nWe're just lucky that the old seers lined up the cars for us, over thousands of years \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cartoon Idea", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"b6pcw7d6i59b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b6pcw7d6i59b1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae46f6eecb3ddbad60caf350fcb8f9a03bbf5f39"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b6pcw7d6i59b1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45fa160d5332a47749f9eb2a1e209ec9299cd27f"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b6pcw7d6i59b1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f84350987af6368580148a5c67de8fd421c8db0"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b6pcw7d6i59b1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=577dcd13d497e40dc0fcdf093f260df781282cb0"}, {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b6pcw7d6i59b1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61fc32ffe4ff5831df3e2badc77ee897bae8e18d"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b6pcw7d6i59b1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e9f9cfba62abc12f26fca8fbdd5e6edbd3067f5"}, "id": "b6pcw7d6i59b1"}}, "name": "t3_14mzj7z", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7_-4J-5WqI7RyoFNy5oObIwXhFc3FIKHTsyCwhrSyyg.jpg", "edited": 1688129990.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1688129412.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b6pcw7d6i59b1.png?width=960&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e9f9cfba62abc12f26fca8fbdd5e6edbd3067f5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/b6pcw7d6i59b1.png?width=960&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e9f9cfba62abc12f26fca8fbdd5e6edbd3067f5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a cartoon idea to explain about all the amazing magic you learn along the J curve, and also why you can&amp;#39;t expect to repeat each thing you find more than once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Westerly Witch goes to buy a nice used car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me on this one, you don&amp;#39;t want to be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except to pay at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The place allows test drives, and you can even take the car for up to 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, a sign says &amp;quot;unlimited test drives&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she goes nuts.

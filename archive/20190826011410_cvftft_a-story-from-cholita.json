They may still be transformed, but just don\u2019t know about it. Their energy bodies have been made closer to whole.\n\nOr at least, Carlos was successful at transforming Cholita. I'd have to get around more women from back then, to figure out how extensive the transformations are.\n\nCholita is just plain dangerous. She's filled with so much dark energy that she has super powers.  She's also stark raving mad.\n\nAmong her superpowers is the ability to project dark energy for protection. Her eyes turn blood red in a matter of seconds, well up with tears, and she stares ahead without blinking. A fat beam of dark energy flows from her, and you can actually both feel and hear it.\n\nI've never seen anything like it. But the sound is familiar. It's the sound of a transformer humming. It\u2019s humming in your own head, not outside.\n\nThe effect seems to be to disorient whoever is the target of the energy.\n\nI found it pleasant. I'd been playing with dark energy for a while now. But I had to duck the last time she projected it. It was just too strong to tolerate directly.\n\nA \"normal\" person would just see it as unprovoked rage. They'd still be forced to turn away from her, but probably in their mind it would be because they were embarrassed for her and didn't want to stare, or they were afraid they were the target of her wrath.\n\nThat's not to say a normal person wouldn't perceive what I perceived. But they'd quickly toss it out, do a \"double take\" so to speak, and force the world back to its normal boundaries.\n\nCholita told me a story for this group today, and based on that I've asked her to try opening a dreaming portal using her dark energy. There's no way of telling if she will.\n\nThe other thing she did today was transform into her luminous cocoon. I've never seen that during the day, without the aid of heightened awareness.\n\nI've been trying to stabilize her assemblage point, and took her to familiar old places she liked to visit.\n\nAt one point I seemed to have succeeded, and I brought up the topic of tensegrity, asking if she ever noticed the high it produces.  She closed her eyes and said, \u201cOf course I know that feeling!\u201d\n\nFlowing lines of light with dark trails began to emanate from her stomach.  I could feel them as cobwebs touching my arm, as well as visually see them clearly. I could even hear them, if that makes any sense.  I can't even begin to think of any description for the sound, other than it was there and familiar.\n\nOne heavy line of light, around 5 feet long but curved heavily,  intersected with my stomach. My assemblage point shifted drastically, my body seemed to lose all mass as if it could float away,  and I got a shiver that started at my lower half and went all the way to the top of my head. I would have worried about passing out, except for playing with colors in the darkness. That kind of feeling happens all the time when you get silent in darkness.  I had the initial fright, but realized I should just relax and nothing bad would happen.\n\nI tried to look directly at the flowing lines, to see if possibly they were tentacles. They weren't. But in the course of looking at them directly, I saw most of her luminous body. It was like a blob, floating along, with fibers flowing around and touching the environment.\n\nBut the fibers weren't stretching straight out to touch things.  They were continuously \"whipping\" (moving with a curve similiar to the way you cast a whip out), but in  a gentle fashion.  Think of horizontally whipping the side of a chair, and how much curve the whip body itself would have.  But almost in slow motion.\n\nAnd the whip is made out of white light, but has a ghost trail of black. So it seems to be \"thick\", but in fact the glowing part is only the thickness of the smallest rope you can buy.\n\nIt was almost as if they were radar, scanning the environment. They radiated continuously.  As far as I could tell, there were only 2 of the very strong ones, but a myriad of the tiny ones.\n\nCholita seemed to partly realize what happened, and just a few minutes later became interested in my \"project\", which she called, \"Saving whatever is left.\"\n\nHere's Cholita's story she recalled just for all of you.  She said she wrote it down once, but when I insisted she give me the written one, she got angry and said that's what she was going to tell me.\n\nWhen she gets angry, you just have to back off. So this is all I got.  Not much of a story. But maybe more like an archetype.\n\nAll of this story is true.  It happened.  But maybe not the way she's recounting it, or in the sequence I\u2019m writing.\n\nYou can\u2019t stop her to ask for clarifications once she decides to bestow a story on you.  And occasionally she insists she must be \u201ccompensated\u201d for her efforts.\n\nHere\u2019s the story she told me this morning, compensation free:\n\nCholita traveled all over Mexico with her tall, handsome, and very thin husband. She was in her early 20s.\n\nCholita herself was so beautiful that she could find a man to give her shelter in a strange city with just 10 minutes notice.  She\u2019s a tiny thing, and even has to shop for some clothing items in the children\u2019s department.\n\nThat\u2019s undoubtedly why Carlos dubbed her \u201cCholita\u201d.  She could very well have been one of very few women in his private classes, who was shorter than Carlos himself.\n\nBut it could also be that Carlos recognized she had 2 distinct personalities inside her, and the one that rarely came out was quite a bit like an angry Cholita.\n\nFinding men to marry wasn\u2019t a problem for Cholita. I believe she\u2019s now looking for #6, but she\u2019s become confused on the count since some of the marriages were a little \u201cify\u201d.  No one (even a lawyer) could really say if they were \u201creal\u201d marriages.\n\nShe traveled all over with her first husband, much of the time on his motorcycle.   They were usually in the company of left over hippies bent on partying in South America, and she said it was non-stop drugs, sex, and music.\n\nShe recalled traveling up the lush green mountains of Costa Rica in a wooden train with no windows, essentially an antique, as being pretty much a continuous orgy for the entire trip.\n\nBut at one point the honeymoon with her husband was over.  She was working hard all day, while he was hanging around in a hotel by the pool, waiting for her to get off work so he could fuck her.  He became possessive, even questioning why she chose to wear the sexy clothes she did. Cholita said he became childish, dependent, and violent.\n\nIn the past,  if he slapped her once, she slapped him twice.  But this time it looked like he was going to hit her for real. She dumped him, hopped a plane for Mexico City, and left him stranded in a boring remote Mexican town.  He called nightly, crying and begging her to return.\n\n(At this point I have to mention that possibly Cholita\u2019s accounts of things swing a tiny bit in her favor, especially when there\u2019s no way to prove otherwise.)\n\nAfter dumping her husband she joined up with a shamanistic tour, where you go out to find your own peyote in a Mexican desert mountain landscape.  The tour consisted of death defying rides up a mountain road barely adequate to get across a sheer cliff.  They rode on the very top of a jeep, luggage and all, and if they fell off they were certain to die.\n\nTheir destination was a Mexican mountain desert paradise.  Hearing her description of it, with flowing streams, steep rock trails, and peyote hiding anywhere you might go, I began to wonder why Mexico has such a bad reputation in the USA.\n\nWhy would you want to go to boring France, with all of Mexico just a few hundred miles below you?\n\nApparently, Cholita\u2019s several experiences with peyote during that trip escalated until her life was in danger.  She found an amazingly beautiful light, and kept staring into it for so long that the leader had to bodily pull her back, yelling at her to stop looking at that.\n\nCould have been yellow or white light, but I was afraid to interrupt Cholita to ask for more details.  Once she starts telling a story, she\u2019s on the verge of beaming dark energy from her face if you interrupt.\n\nShe said she was about to leave this world, because the light was so beautiful.\n\nAs it turns out, she\u2019d started reading Carlos' books at that same time, possibly the motivation for the peyote trip.  Shortly after that, or maybe immediately, she traveled to L.A. and got invited to Carlos\u2019 private classes.\n\nJust like that apparently.   There was some help in there from another woman, but it's kind of amazing how easily she found Carlos, and got into his classes.\n\nYou can be sure the other participants in that peyote tour would have given anything to be invited.\n\nDuring private classes with Carlos, Cholita claims she got very high doing the tensegrity.  However, on questioning her about heightened awareness, she seemed never to have thought about it. She didn\u2019t even know what it was.\n\nI tried to explain it to her, thinking she could now understand. But she got into a convoluted explanation of how it was like this or that, this other thing, and nothing like the effects from peyote.  They were different things.\n\nShe was confused by all the other stuff she read, being a fan of weird mediation books and philosophies.  She also insisted that being \"impeccable\" was the main thing, not internal silence.\n\n(That's a warning to the impeccable warriors among us).\n\nAnd so she\u2019s a model of what happened to private class students. While doing tensegrity she absolutely was brought to the door of heightened awareness, and her energy body was largely restored.\n\nAnd it came to not, because no one emphasized it, or explained how close she\u2019d gotten to understanding.\n\nWhen Carlos died, Cholita had the following vision.  Or maybe it was a dream.  Certainly, it was the story she wanted me to relate.  Not much to tell however.\n\nCholita woke up in a dark cave, except that the walls were glowing orange.\n\nShe seemed puzzled when she tried to explain.  I interrupted her to say, \u201cThat\u2019s Zuleica\u2019s technique for looking for colors in darkness.  Orange was her favorite.\u201d\n\nShe insisted it was not a dark room so it was not the same thing.  But then she hesitated and said, \u201cWell, it \\*was\\* a dark cave.\u201d\n\nShe emerged from the orange glow into a wasteland, sort of like a Hollywood apocalypse movie.\n\nCarlos was dead.  But in the distance she saw a man.\n\nIt was Howard Lee.  He showed her some moves, and she remained to practice, but eventually realized his techniques were limited to his interests.  And they weren\u2019t the same as those taught by Carlos.\n\nShe left Howard, only to find herself choking from Sulphur gas, in a place that was entirely yellow.\n\nEnd of story.   Cholita started to get angry and rant about the Bilderberg group, so no more of that story is available.\n\nBut she never stopped practicing Carlos' techniques after his death. She merely tried to find them in other things.\n\nAnd I have to point out, when don Juan left, Carlos went looking for the other apprentices.  He found them angry and dangerous, but with super powers that were too tempting for him to ignore.\n\nI pointed out to Cholita that maybe Carlos had masterfully broken up the group on his death, similar to the way don Juan did, so as to scatter the apprentices and force them to make a decision.\n\nI started to explain how he used sex with the women to do it...\n\nCholita got angry and said, \"Who cares about the sex?  Why do you go on about it?  That's their business.   It's just fun.\"\n\nI guess the \"be celibate\" memo didn't get out to everyone in private classes.\n\nEdited: three times.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Story from Cholita", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 102, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"di1oesnk0c351": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 79, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5190746a11bb560d0ef7568b4bd3e44389d86085"}, {"y": 158, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fc400f30079660db2e762bf7adbb8b1ce46e883"}, {"y": 234, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af16a98ba808100d7413ea2016f434716a98c475"}, {"y": 468, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3a15208bab4e238f691f0871f2ae702f8b6263"}, {"y": 702, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4d45d72b23996a5528f4d298c8f7806db33e560"}, {"y": 790, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=616e8357ca585a0f5f7a7153590d5b1f58a758b3"}], "s": {"y": 1704, "x": 2327, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=2327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b705a87bf9d30fd06b7e6877466448b9b466b3"}, "id": "di1oesnk0c351"}}, "name": "t3_cvftft", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oPmoZ9J8nowX7703YeAVgD0HqmUmOxdcHMZ2o4dUPlA.jpg", "edited": 1591467594.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1566774850.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/di1oesnk0c351.jpg?width=2327&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=95b705a87bf9d30fd06b7e6877466448b9b466b3\"&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s River of Filth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s starting to look like the women Carlos put a lot of time into, were in fact transformed.

While doing tensegrity she absolutely was brought to the door of heightened awareness, and her energy body was largely restored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it came to not, because no one emphasized it, or explained how close she\u2019d gotten to understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Carlos died, Cholita had the following vision.  Or maybe it was a dream.  Certainly, it was the story she wanted me to relate.  Not much to tell however.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita woke up in a dark cave, except that the walls were glowing orange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She seemed puzzled when she tried to explain.  I interrupted her to say, \u201cThat\u2019s Zuleica\u2019s technique for looking for colors in darkness.  Orange was her favorite.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She insisted it was not a dark room so it was not the same thing.  But then she hesitated and said, \u201cWell, it *was* a dark cave.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She emerged from the orange glow into a wasteland, sort of like a Hollywood apocalypse movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was dead.  But in the distance she saw a man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was Howard Lee.  He showed her some moves, and she remained to practice, but eventually realized his techniques were limited to his interests.  And they weren\u2019t the same as those taught by Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She left Howard, only to find herself choking from Sulphur gas, in a place that was entirely yellow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;End of story.   Cholita started to get angry and rant about the Bilderberg group, so no more of that story is available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she never stopped practicing Carlos&amp;#39; techniques after his death. She merely tried to find them in other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I have to point out, when don Juan left, Carlos went looking for the other apprentices.  He found them angry and dangerous, but with super powers that were too tempting for him to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pointed out to Cholita that maybe Carlos had masterfully broken up the group on his death, similar to the way don Juan did, so as to scatter the apprentices and force them to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to explain how he used sex with the women to do it...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita got angry and said, &amp;quot;Who cares about the sex?  Why do you go on about it?  That&amp;#39;s their business.   It&amp;#39;s just fun.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the &amp;quot;be celibate&amp;quot; memo didn&amp;#39;t get out to everyone in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: three times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "43d4e582-6010-11ea-a748-0ef2a7bb995d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "cvftft", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/cvftft/a_story_from_cholita/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/cvftft/a_story_from_cholita/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1566774850.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ey5nd2s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1566835854.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_cvftft", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "A clarification: The whip like strands were curved the wrong way, if you use my analogy of whipping a chair in slow motion.\n\nThey were more like \"scooping\" up information than whipping it.

From there Willy\u2019s jeeps ferried people up the mountain to Real, it really is a crazy ride. The Quemado mountain, just to the south maybe, is a sacred spot for the Huicholes. They\u2019re not actually from the region but travel a long way to this valley for peyote. Though some may have set up shop now in the valley or more likely, Real.\n\nEdit: capital letters", "edited": 1566831327.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ey44em3", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desert mountain paradise is no doubt Real de Catorce, an old silver town, which has become a rather boutique destination now.

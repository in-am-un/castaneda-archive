At least, on Cholita, after she's happy from hours of shopping, they rotate at that rate.\n\nWomen go into gathering mode when they shop, so their attention is focused on everything around them, more than usual.  I've been told by some witches that they know very well, they gather energy as they shop.  I suspect actually, it interrupts their internal dialogues, which is why they gather energy. \n\nThe 2 second scanning rate of the tentacles means, what they light up must have a persistence of at least 2 seconds, or you wouldn't have continuous perception.\n\nRadar screens use a similar principle.  If there's a dot on the radar, maybe a plane, it remains on the monitor long enough for the next sweep to complete and refresh its position on the screen.\n\nThis also implies why you can burn with the fire from within. Or, reach the 3rd attention for newbies, and I would really like them to understand that.  There's too many fakers out there making up stuff about how they understand the 3rd attention, when they can't even assemble another world.\n\nThe fire from within just means, you lit up all of the emanations humans can perceive, at the same time.\n\nI once moved my assemblage point all the way from normal, to full on heightened awareness, in 2 seconds.\n\nIt was a result of storing energy using sunlight glitter, for the first time in 25 years. I'd forgotten about that technique, since Carlos told me not to read the books.\n\nSo you could light up all the emanations all the way along that J curve, at once.\n\nDue to the persistence.\n\n&gt;Does perception seem like sweeping and attention feel like a limited resource to be switched and focused? \n\nYes.  I believe the sweeping of the emanations to light up things around you, so you can perceive them, causes that effect.\n\nI haven't *seen* anyone who has low energy, but I suspect that when the emanations touch things, they light up very poorly.\n\nSo those people are left to imagine the world around them most of the time.\n\nThe cure for that is to \"save energy\".\n\nThe only practical way of doing that is to get rid of that internal dialogue all day long.\n\nCarlos tried other methods, and we all certainly know Cleargreen has Russia convinced they can save up energy just by doing Tensegrity, and they'll eventually become real sorcerers.\n\nBut no one has. It's not working.\n\nSo silence is the way to figure out how much you can light up at once.", "edited": 1594487267.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fxpazrw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fear makes you focus on slight movements and novel input, ignoring the normal routines. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see where you&amp;#39;re going.

At least, on Cholita, after she&amp;#39;s happy from hours of shopping, they rotate at that rate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women go into gathering mode when they shop, so their attention is focused on everything around them, more than usual.  I&amp;#39;ve been told by some witches that they know very well, they gather energy as they shop.  I suspect actually, it interrupts their internal dialogues, which is why they gather energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 2 second scanning rate of the tentacles means, what they light up must have a persistence of at least 2 seconds, or you wouldn&amp;#39;t have continuous perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Radar screens use a similar principle.  If there&amp;#39;s a dot on the radar, maybe a plane, it remains on the monitor long enough for the next sweep to complete and refresh its position on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also implies why you can burn with the fire from within. Or, reach the 3rd attention for newbies, and I would really like them to understand that.  There&amp;#39;s too many fakers out there making up stuff about how they understand the 3rd attention, when they can&amp;#39;t even assemble another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fire from within just means, you lit up all of the emanations humans can perceive, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once moved my assemblage point all the way from normal, to full on heightened awareness, in 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a result of storing energy using sunlight glitter, for the first time in 25 years. I&amp;#39;d forgotten about that technique, since Carlos told me not to read the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could light up all the emanations all the way along that J curve, at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the persistence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does perception seem like sweeping and attention feel like a limited resource to be switched and focused? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes.  I believe the sweeping of the emanations to light up things around you, so you can perceive them, causes that effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; anyone who has low energy, but I suspect that when the emanations touch things, they light up very poorly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So those people are left to imagine the world around them most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cure for that is to &amp;quot;save energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only practical way of doing that is to get rid of that internal dialogue all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried other methods, and we all certainly know Cleargreen has Russia convinced they can save up energy just by doing Tensegrity, and they&amp;#39;ll eventually become real sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one has. It&amp;#39;s not working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So silence is the way to figure out how much you can light up at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_hcp8mc", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hcp8mc/looking_between_an_object_eye_crossing_exercise/fxpazrw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1594486679.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fxlhx53", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tryerrr", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fxjmh3o", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_n9h6v", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Fear makes you focus on slight movements and novel input, ignoring the normal routines. \n\nLimited sampling bit budget (busy with imagination/dialogue) and perception speed (frequency mismatch) both could cause the low-framerate animation of perfectly \u201cfast\u201d events/entities.\n\nIf perception is \u201csweeping\u201d the available frequencies slowly (takes more than a second to sweep full range), then it can only see the event/IOB once per sweep, and can even miss the event on sone sweeps if the event is not continuous or if phases are not in sync. \n\n\nPerception capability would then be able to be measured: by base frequency/position (bias from zero, can explain inability to recall events from different states), base sweep/perception range (while unfocused), maximal/minimal range (for hooking on distant signals or zooming onto specific nearby one), sweep speed (if not immediate, could be range-dependent) and sweep accuracy (both in sweep step size and bit-budget for signal representation).\n\nDoes perception seem like sweeping and attention feel like a limited resource to be switched and focused?

Why not?\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to learn to *see* trees, because someone asked.\n\nCholita ran away, so that left me a whole day off on Sunday, with access to the house.  And the plants in the yard.\n\nI managed to see the emanations in a tree Cholita has in a big pot.  It took 10 hours of continuous practice to move the assemblage point that far. The tree was not in perfect darkness, since it was outside.  So it was more difficult to *see*.\n\nAnd although it was now the next day, Monday, Cholita was still gone, so I hurried home to try again with the tree.\n\nAlmost instantly I could see the tree emanations again.\n\nThey were darting about in some odd way, without actually moving, and I realized those were the basis of all we see.\n\nThey went away, and I had to figure out why.\n\nI relaxed them back, and my eyes blinked 3 times.\n\nI realized; Mr. DoubleTake is who blocks them!\n\nIf you *see* one of the emanations directly, it means the assemblage point moved.\n\nYou feel the energy released as a \u201cmicro-panic\u201d.\n\nYou won\u2019t get that far if you\u2019re still confusing energy with fear, so micro-panic is all you feel by the time you can move your assemblage point that far.\n\nAn \u201cinstant\u201d of fear so small, it\u2019s only annoying.\n\nIt's like the mind itself blinked.\n\nThat causes the assemblage point to shift back, away from seeing them.\n\nAnd the eyes themselves blink!  Three times to boot!\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar blink, I guarantee we all know it.\n\nI had a girlfriend a very long time ago, who would blink like that when she didn't like something.\n\nHer eyes would start to flicker, and you knew it was time to make that topic go away!\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201cdouble take\u201d to make things go away, and it works even with magic because it would have gone away anyway.\n\nThose emanations are only visible at that unusual position of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd Mr. DoubleTake\u2019s trick is to make your eyes flicker to explain what you just saw, so you don\u2019t try again.\n\nI relaxed the 3 blink set, and watched the energy to see if it would make the same thing happen.\n\nI could feel Mr. DoubleTake wanting to do that again, to make it go away.  But he gave up.\n\nI had smoothly crossed over the \"3 blink barrier\", if that makes any sense.\n\nI was looking right at the energy body of a tree!\n\nI saw a bright blue spot.  I mean, a very soothing nice blue spot, with remarkable color.\n\nIt was inside swirling lines. \n\nBut I couldn't see it as clearly as  you'd expect. Maybe just the brightest stuff was visible.\n\nThe main details.\n\nI won\u2019t describe it much, it might be wrong and mislead.\n\nBut it was very pleasant to see.\n\nTrees are soothing...\n\nAnd once I had *seen* it, I was able to *see* it again, even when not facing that particular tree.\n\nWhile watching it, a gigantic hornet appeared. It was the size of a pony!\n\nIt was solid black.  And standing very near to the tree, in Cholita\u2019s favorite resting spot.\n\nNormally I\u2019d get excited at a gigantic insect, right in front of my nose.\n\nBut Shinzen (Taiwanese Zen master) has seen those too.  So I mentally gave him 3 points, and ignored it.\n\nShinzen tells the truth?  Good to know.\n\nI heard extremely faint music.  \n\nI realized, maybe Cholita is back, hiding in the garage.\n\nShe was. \n\nI'd been in Cholita's garden, so I returned to my room, now able to switch my eyes to seeing energy.\n\nThe entire house and yard are off limits to me, when Cholita is home.\n\nWhen she's not, I'll go into the  yard.  And eat her cheese from the fridge so she knows not to stay away too long.\n\nCholita likes expensive cheese.\n\nI sat up on my bed in my now perfectly dark room. Even in daylight it\u2019s dark. I discovered the secret.\n\nSpecial fabrics!  Particularly, very fluffy black artificial fur.  It hugs all the cracks and blocks all light.\n\nAnd light blocking vinyl fabric.  Hangs well, no light at all can get through.\n\nSitting there I noticed, someone had reached over and pulled a brown bag off a little shelf in a convenience store.  They were ruffling it open.\n\nIt was the size of a lunch bag, but it had been sealed up in a clear outer bag, so that it had a hole for hanging in a store.\n\nIt was a young woman who had picked it up.  I knew her, even though we'd never met.\n\nIt was possibly a 7-11 store.  \n\nShe opened the bag and I realized, it was me.\n\nA student I\u2019d had too much interaction with had located me, and pulled me off the shelf.\n\nPossibly a witch.\n\nThere was a second brown bag there too, also me. A reserve in case the first me is damaged.\n\nI realized the absurdity of it!\n\nObviously while trying to see energy directly, my assemblage point had made a lateral shift.\n\nAnd it was too abstract to deal with.\n\nBut the connection you pick up when you try to teach someone, is not abstract.\n\nIt's real.  An *intent* link.\n\nBe warned.  People who take on students for money are frauds.\n\nThere's too much at stake to do that!\n\nI tried to restore a little sense to myself by concentrating a little, so I could get a glimpse of the bags in the store. \n\nAnd the woman.  I was wondering if Fairy had taken an interest in her.\n\nI found I had a real physical bag, sitting on my left side.\n\nI checked with my hands. \n\nYes, there was a brown bag there, possibly made from weaved burlap. \n\nIt was what you\u2019d call, \u201creusable\u201d these days.  Hefty, without being heavy.\n\nI glanced around the room to see energy fibers, wanting to remain at that distant assemblage point position, wherever it was.\n\nFairy flew up. She\u2019d been gone a full day.  \n\nShe could see I was genuinely happy to have her return, and moved around in the air to please me.\n\nThen she mutated into her \"real\" form, just a collection of colorful lights.\n\nA new bag began to form on my right.  \n\nIt was smaller, and of a lighter color.\n\nI failed to notice this, but when I used my hands to verify it was real and solid, I turned the wrong way on the bed.\n\nIt just seemed normal at the time.\n\nAs best I can figure, my dreaming double turned, while my Tonal remained sitting on pillows.\n\nI verified for an hour, yes, both bags were real.  They seemed so real, I was hopeful they'd stick around when I turned on the lights in the room.\n\nThey had physical mass.\n\nThey were solid.\n\nThey behaved properly for something sitting to the side of me.  They didn't mutate or change locations.\n\nI moved my assemblage point back to normal. Somehow I just knew how to do that.\n\nAll you 3rd attention speculators out there, no need to speculate anymore.  \n\nThe 3rd attention attainment is automatic.  You just learn to move the assemblage point on demand.\n\nThere's no mysterious lizard, LSD trip, or a 20.5th abstract core as some Eastern Bloc fakers are claiming.\n\nThe 3rd attention is no big deal!  At least, as far as how to find it.\n\nJust practice!\n\nThe old sorcerers failed because they believed in their rituals.\n\nThey never learned to move it all by themselves, without anything to help them.\n\nThe only difference between old and new sorcerers, is how they move their assemblage points.\n\nAnd that the old sorcerers were obsessed with other people.\n\nA common trait in the Castaneda community these days...\n\nAfter moving my assemblage point back to near normal, the bags were not there.\n\nI moved it back to *seeing* energy, and the bags had been there all along.\n\nFairy was looking a little tired, from having gone wherever she went.\n\nI put up my hand, and she flew into it.   Just her head.\n\nShe was too dim to make any use of.\n\nI scooped purple into her, she got better.  I asked if she wanted black light also, and scooped some of the intense blackness onto her.\n\nShe still wasn\u2019t fully formed, so I went looking for yellow light.  There's nothing Fairy likes more than yellow and purple, mixed with intense black swirling around it.\n\nWho knows why?\n\nI\u2019d just managed to scrape some yellow onto fairy, when I noticed it was probably time for me to get up.\n\nI'd left a single, very dim light leak above the doorway, which would light up around 6AM.\n\nAll I knew was, it was after 6AM, but the brightness seemed to imply 7AM.\n\nI had to hurry, in case Cholita decided to hog the shower and lock me out.", "edited": 1594142194.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fx7n37x", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; you can interact with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wasn&amp;#39;t making things up when he said you could dust off your connecting link to &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, and then some available energy fields connecting you to it would become active.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sort of becomes your teacher, but guided by your own choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; is more into the abstract territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which might simply be a percentage more nagual than we&amp;#39;re used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure.

Somehow I just knew how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you 3rd attention speculators out there, no need to speculate anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 3rd attention attainment is automatic.  You just learn to move the assemblage point on demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no mysterious lizard, LSD trip, or a 20.5th abstract core as some Eastern Bloc fakers are claiming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 3rd attention is no big deal!  At least, as far as how to find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just practice!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old sorcerers failed because they believed in their rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never learned to move it all by themselves, without anything to help them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only difference between old and new sorcerers, is how they move their assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that the old sorcerers were obsessed with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common trait in the Castaneda community these days...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After moving my assemblage point back to near normal, the bags were not there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved it back to &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; energy, and the bags had been there all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy was looking a little tired, from having gone wherever she went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put up my hand, and she flew into it.   Just her head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was too dim to make any use of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scooped purple into her, she got better.  I asked if she wanted black light also, and scooped some of the intense blackness onto her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She still wasn\u2019t fully formed, so I went looking for yellow light.  There&amp;#39;s nothing Fairy likes more than yellow and purple, mixed with intense black swirling around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d just managed to scrape some yellow onto fairy, when I noticed it was probably time for me to get up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d left a single, very dim light leak above the doorway, which would light up around 6AM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I knew was, it was after 6AM, but the brightness seemed to imply 7AM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to hurry, in case Cholita decided to hog the shower and lock me

I ended up going back to that spot regularly during a whole summer and did some of my best dreaming during that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hcp8mc/looking_between_an_object_eye_crossing_exercise/fvk8w8n/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1592765512.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hcp8mc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fvgdgxl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Odysx2", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1592672048.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_hcp8mc", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3s3ezg", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I noticed that when you blur your vision or you not focusing or just try to get the hole image all the optical field thinking cannot  feed and slows or stops . civilisation uses lines etc that the reason \u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2  means people that gazing in to the horizon or the mountains etc  stop their thinking easier .", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fvgdgxl", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noticed that when you blur your vision or you not focusing or just try to get the hole image all the optical field thinking cannot  feed and slows or stops . civilisation uses lines etc that the reason \u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2  means people that gazing in to the horizon or the mountains etc  stop their thinking easier .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hcp8mc/looking_between_an_object_eye_crossing_exercise/fvgdgxl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1592672048.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hcp8mc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fvmscai", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "epc611", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1592830386.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fvhran5", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6z4buifm", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "From *The Second Ring of Power*:\n\n\"the Nagual taught us gazing.

Stay down in \"Whoville\" pretending that you aren't living on a snowflake, or listen to the Grinch who knows things aren't right and badly wants to escape.\n\nCarlos was clearly more like a Grinch than people who weren't in private classes realize, but there's wonderful lecture notes telling all about it. Compiled by our scribe Techno, and available in the subreddit. A volume of notes so large, even an AI can't read the whole thing.\n\nIn the end, people trashed Carlos and included the claim that he wasn't a nice man.\n\nOf course, nice men are con artists when it comes to magic and exploration of consciousness.\n\nThe saintly Gurus only want your money, and can't make a living off telling you the truth about how hard you have to work, to ditch that snowflake before it melts.\n\nBut what about that energy body choice?\n\nYou'll notice it!  The energy body is sentient.\n\nBut it's half of our awareness.\n\nWe can join part of our \"tonal\" (physical body) awareness to go off with our energy body, into dreaming realms.  That gives the \"double\" some rationality and sense of purpose, so that your tonal can ride along and learn about sorcery and exploration of other worlds.\n\nOur double can explore whatever it likes, but it has no sense of reason, and typically ends up only in \"phantom\" realms. Unable to care about the difference.\n\nIt is in fact a separate entity, and you can come to understand just HOW separate if you consider that the inorganic beings first kidnap your energy body, and THEN come back for the physical body later on. When your energy body is already trapped in their world.\n\nYou might also want to consider how the old seers would bury their physical body, and then live on in an inorganic being like state, preying on passers by for more energy.\n\nI hope you don't believe their mummified physical body was still alive under that rock!  They were long dead, but managed to \"contain\" their awareness so that they could live on a few thousand more years.\n\nIn the end, Carlos found a path to immortality in his modified energy body.  Telling readers in his final magazine interview, \"I'm already gone, and can't come back.\"\n\nBut that's all way too advanced for us to worry about. If you obsess over details like that, you've already sided with the con artist Gurus.  Telling tales of power, no one will ever get to see.\n\nAnd them, no wiser than a Taxi driver in Bangladesh.\n\nWhat you should keep in mind until we reach that level of sorcery skills, is that your energy body WILL form if you practice darkroom, and at some point those purple puffs will swarm around your torso on their own.\n\nNote: It forms from recapitulation also,  so don't think \"darkroom\" is your only choice.\n\nBut you DO have to work very hard, and be CREATIVE, if you hope to make anything at all work for you.  You can't just look for an \"easy routine\" and go back to being cozy in the river of shit (your normal life).\n\nWith \"darkroom\" you eventually get a choice on what form those amazing brilliant puffs of light ought to take, for your new \"energy body\".\n\nIf you make no choice, chances are it'll form as the new seers preferred it.  \"An impersonal blue ball of energy\". Which simply means, they cling to the area of your body, where most of your tonal awareness is stored.\n\nThey \"join the cause\" once you get rid of that ugly grief stricken internal dialogue, which makes you into a very unpleasant being to be around.  Get rid of that, and your energy body is happy to help you out.\n\nIt gains a sense of purpose!\n\nBut you could also form an energy body the way the old seers did.   Don Juan made that clear.\n\nThe \"blue ball of energy\" is merely a choice.\n\nWe have no idea what the old seers chose, and likely it was different among them.  But their jade figurines give us an idea about their obsessions.\n\nI don't advocate any particular choice, other than knowing from real experiences that you DO have a choice.\n\nYou can experiment with that.\n\nKeeping in mind, the energy body is not only sentient, and can understand what you want to tell it, but that it's just half of our total energy, and can be subdivided even further.\n\nIf you lend it some tonal awareness, it has no problem at all making 2 copies of yourself.\n\nSo there can be three of yoU, standing right there in your dark room.\n\nAs I learned last night.\n\nMy energy body vividly swarmed my lower half, and then I just used each arm to rise up a pillar of that intense blue/purple light on either side,  until a phantom appeared in the middle of each.\n\nI couldn't tell if both were present at the same time, because if I looked left, I saw one.\n\nAnd if I looked right, I saw a different one.\n\nBut I was unable to look at both, at the same time.\n\nNaturally...  I had to turn my head for each.\n\nBut I'm pretty confident Cholita could do that for me, if she felt like it.\n\nShe might already have done that before when she brought an \"old witch\" to visit me.\n\nThose bifurcated energy bodies are rather scary looking things, but I'm certain that with practice you could make them take any appearance you like.\n\nAnd even use them with other people, the way don Genaro helped teach Carlos, mostly using his energy body.\n\nWe've speculated in here whether Emilito actually existed.\n\nThere's evidence it was the energy body of Zuleica.\n\nBut we also have evidence that Zuleica was nearly always in her energy body, and perhaps Taisha and Carlos only met the real one, one time.\n\nFor example that time when Carlos discovered she was stark raving mad.\n\nLike Cholita.\n\nI once thought we might just read carefully to find out if there was ever a time when both Zuleica and Emilito were present in the same room.\n\nBut now I realize, that doesn't mean a thing.\n\nJust as the inorganic beings can project as many as 5 phantoms to surround you, only one of them being the real \"scout\", we can do the same.\n\nAt least, if you try out this technique you'll likely agree with me on that point.\n\nBy the way, if you \"raise up a phantom\" of yourself, don't be surprised if it greets you the next night, when you turn off the lights to practice.\n\nI had one stick around for 2 days.\n\nFright you say?\n\nYes, there's plenty of that when magic is real!\n\nAnd none when you follow a \"Guru\".

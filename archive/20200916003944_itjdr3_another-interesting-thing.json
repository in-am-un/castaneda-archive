She seems to believe those are the key to horizontal shifts of the assemblage point.\n\nYou know. \"Feel your chin turning into a beak.  Feel little wings sprouting from your shoulders...\"\n\nThe Little Smoke helped Carlos learn that \"lateral shift\" to shapeshift into a crow.\n\nThat sort of lateral shift is driven by \"feelings\".\n\nOr Nyei's imitation of a bat using it's radar ears (it's in an embarrassing video somewhere).\n\nBut now that I think about it, if Cholita could jump up and turn into a bat, the whole witch image would be complete! I'd have to go track down Bella Lugosi's house again, and move her right in there.\n\nAnyway, the idea that you have to wrestle your Ally was an old sorcerer's way.\n\nThe early books were to give him that \"sorcerer's view of the world\", so he could have 2 views (already having the ordinary one), and find a way down the middle (Man of Knowledge).\n\nWe all have an unfortunate tendency to go lizard hunting!\n\nThat's an obscure reference to people who take the Devil's weed ceremony literally, and go hunting for lizards instead of actually trying to learn something else.\n\nWe had a newbie come in here and tell us about her friend who's really serious about Castaneda, and has almost caught his lizard.\n\nI'll bet... Don't tell Cholita that. She might consider it a threat and cut your lizard in half before you can get it out of your pocket.\n\nBut, you don't have to literally wrestle the ally!!!\n\nAlthough I did wrestle Little Smoke.\n\nShe found me in dreaming.  Both her and Devil's weed were there.\n\nAnd I was pretty much forced to wrestle one of them. She wouldn't stop advancing on me.\n\nBut in waking, I don't think so. \n\nUnless you get dragged into a dream at the sight of them, where they can become very solid and real.\n\nFancy has been teaching me about that. She can change from vague floating head, to full vague body, to intense glow, but transparent, and finally she can cause a dream to slide down from above, and she's perfectly real and solid.\n\nAnd sexy I might add!\n\nI don't change.  Don't even get sleepier.\n\nIt's not like I was silent so long that I dozed off with my eyes open, but managed not to fall over.\n\nI was perfectly fine, watching her do amazing things. I was excited!\n\nThen I found I had been pulled into a dream, and she was now solid.\n\nAnd behind a cardboard box, which materialized on the bed next to her.\n\nNot sure what that was for!\n\nBut she does it. It's not me.\n\nIf I could do that, I'd never leave my dark room.\n\nSo I guess if they wanted to wrestle us, we'd have no choice. Even when awake, they can become solid for us if they feel like it.\n\nBut Carlos merely introduced us to them in class. There wasn't any wrestling involved.\n\nHe had them \"swoop\" us.\n\nAll you need to do to gain the Ally, is perceive it clearly.\n\nOr even as a \"swoop\".\n\nI had visits within 2 weeks of Carlos lending them to us.\n\nAnd it never stopped until I found Fairy.  Who's likely that same ally.\n\nI had them both in sight once.  Fairy was playing with me, then made a horrible face, like something bad was about to happen.\n\nLittle Smoke burned through the wall, like an intense ultra-violet laser.\n\nI assumed I had both together, like Superman and Clark Kent.\n\nNo way those can be the same being, if you see them at the same time.\n\nBut in fact, I never actually saw them both at the same time.  Fairy made a face, I looked at the ultra violet glow, and out came Little Smoke.\n\nI never turned back to see if Fairy was still there.\n\nNot that it would prove anything.  \n\nMy dreaming scout could project 4 other beings, while she stood behind them somewhere.\n\nI once had to burn up all 4 before I found where she was standing.", "edited": 1600288338.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g5i6o69", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark energy.\nThat&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Electricity yes, but liquid?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do feel something, &amp;quot;the thickness of water&amp;quot; around the second attention&amp;#39;s assemblage point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I never paid attention to that feeling when manipulating dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy has taught me to be more careful about feelings.

I&amp;#39;d have to go track down Bella Lugosi&amp;#39;s house again, and move her right in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the idea that you have to wrestle your Ally was an old sorcerer&amp;#39;s way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The early books were to give him that &amp;quot;sorcerer&amp;#39;s view of the world&amp;quot;, so he could have 2 views (already having the ordinary one), and find a way down the middle (Man of Knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all have an unfortunate tendency to go lizard hunting!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an obscure reference to people who take the Devil&amp;#39;s weed ceremony literally, and go hunting for lizards instead of actually trying to learn something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a newbie come in here and tell us about her friend who&amp;#39;s really serious about Castaneda, and has almost caught his lizard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll bet... Don&amp;#39;t tell Cholita that. She might consider it a threat and cut your lizard in half before you can get it out of your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, you don&amp;#39;t have to literally wrestle the ally!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I did wrestle Little Smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She found me in dreaming.  Both her and Devil&amp;#39;s weed were there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I was pretty much forced to wrestle one of them. She wouldn&amp;#39;t stop advancing on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in waking, I don&amp;#39;t think so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you get dragged into a dream at the sight of them, where they can become very solid and real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy has been teaching me about that. She can change from vague floating head, to full vague body, to intense glow, but transparent, and finally she can cause a dream to slide down from above, and she&amp;#39;s perfectly real and solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sexy I might add!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t change.  Don&amp;#39;t even get sleepier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like I was silent so long that I dozed off with my eyes open, but managed not to fall over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was perfectly fine, watching her do amazing things. I was excited!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I found I had been pulled into a dream, and she was now solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And behind a cardboard box, which materialized on the bed next to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure what that was for!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she does it. It&amp;#39;s not me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I could do that, I&amp;#39;d never leave my dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess if they wanted to wrestle us, we&amp;#39;d have no choice. Even when awake, they can become solid for us if they feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos merely introduced us to them in class. There wasn&amp;#39;t any wrestling involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had them &amp;quot;swoop&amp;quot; us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you need to do to gain the Ally, is perceive it clearly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even as a &amp;quot;swoop&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had visits within 2 weeks of Carlos lending them to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it never stopped until I found Fairy.  Who&amp;#39;s likely that same ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had them both in sight once.  Fairy was playing with me, then made a horrible face, like something bad was about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke burned through the wall, like an intense ultra-violet laser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assumed I had both together, like Superman and Clark Kent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No way those can be the same being, if you see them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, I never actually saw them both at the same time.  Fairy made a face, I looked at the ultra violet glow, and out came Little Smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never turned back to see if Fairy was still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that it would prove anything.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dreaming scout could project 4 other beings, while she stood behind them somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once had to burn up all 4 before I found where she was standing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_itjdr3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/itjdr3/another_interesting_thing/g5i6o69/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1600286253.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1600286253.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g5i42tl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g5h6qug", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;I have another teaching me the \"forbidden\" stuff now.\n\nI read now separate reality and Don Juan tells Carlos that you can gain power from your ally once you grab it and wrestle it, you will get sort of liquid electricity impulses and after it you will have his energy in you and he got yours.

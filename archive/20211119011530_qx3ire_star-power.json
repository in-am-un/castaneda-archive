Or was it \\\\\"Energy Trackers\\\\\"? But what is she up to???](https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=1640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a96477591655015c304282862d392baac87831c)\n\nI put this on Facebook, and then thought someone is going to link to it, so might as well bring it over.\n\nIt got out of hand...   And Nyei is known to \"make corrections\" to my Facebook.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from Facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nMy inorganic being Lily saw my interest in what the Nagual Elias was doing, traveling around the universe copying random objects from abandoned junk yards.\n\nHe called them his \"inventions\". If you ever wondered did he bring the real ones back, I don't believe so. I think he just copied what he remembered.\n\nLily had promised to teach me \"how to leave the darkroom\". Meaning, in a locked room in the dark, she was going to teach me various ways to leave the room.\n\nAfter all, Cholita just came and went as if the walls didn't even exist.\n\nAnd Lily did teach me that!\n\nActually I've come to realize, Lily was merely teaching me how to use the Orange Zone on the J curve.\n\nMy inorganic being Fancy, had previously taught me how to use the red zone. The one just before the orange zone on the J curve. The red zone is called, \"the shift below\" in the books.\n\nThe orange is \"Heightened Awareness\".\n\nAnd Fairy, my first, had taught me how to get to the red zone.\n\nFrom blue, to green, to red. And then she asked to be given away.\n\nEach inorganic being seemed to \"specialize\" and teach me a new thing. She had done her task, after 20 years of trying.\n\nThey do that! All of the teaching using power plants was either Little Smoke (Fairy), or Devil's Weed (Minx). Go read those books again if you didn't realize that!\n\nSo angry men out there, trying to bully others for power, you can't use shrooms to learn sorcery. That was Little Smoke, not the shrooms.\n\nAnd Little Smoke is in Argentina. A favorite country of Carlos. Miles and Aerin are there too.\n\nEven if you imagine or pretend your own ally, totally stoned on shrooms, you aren't going to learn Olmec sorcery from it.\n\nLily's lessons turned out to be as mysterious as the orange zone itself, where \"Seeing\" and \"Silent Knowledge\" become available.\n\nLily must have taught me 6 ways to \"leave the darkroom\" so far.\n\nOne gives entry to the \"World of the Brujos\". They're still in there!\n\nHaven't seen the angry female ones though. Don Juan's \"benefactor\" warned against those...\n\nEach technique from Lily is really weird and unexpected.\n\nUntil I remembered, \"Hey... Isn't that one in the books?\"\n\nAnd it usually turns out, yes it is.\n\nAfter all, the books are actually maps. One might expect them to have all sorts of details you'd ignore, if you were only going to a specific destination. The same as we ignore the \"Food\" symbols the first time we use a map, and are in a hurry to get somewhere.\n\nOne technique Lily taught me is so dazzling, I'm a bit taken aback each time I try it and it works.\n\nThe silence has to be virtually absolute to make it work, but given that, it's surprisingly easy.\n\nIt's a technique to remove the ceiling and roof, as if you were in an observatory and were opening the dome so the telescope could look into space.\n\nIt's so starling, I goofed around 2 days ago and opened it, then closed it, then opened it again, to try to figure out why that works.\n\nBut what good is star gazing in a locked room, when you can just go outside and do the real thing?\n\nBecause you get to zoom in, infinitely, and then travel there. You can literally jump, and land wherever you can see.\n\nAnd unlike a telescope, we aren't gathering up light.\n\nYou build up a little rectangle of whitish lines in front of you. The infamous \"lines of the world\". The subset of emanations you are using.\n\nYou can \"inject\" a force into that \"wall\", and cause intent to \"reskim\" it.\n\nFor example, you can reach inside it, and pull out a hamburger.\n\nWhy???\n\nIf you have to ask that, maybe you should go study Zen, or something more serious.\n\nThere is no why! Only do, or not do.\n\nThanks to Soledad? At any rate, good quote from Yoda there.\n\nAnd if you sit in front of those emanations, forming a viewing screen, and seriously believe you can stare out into space and find actual planets anywhere in the universe, who is intent to contradict you?\n\nIt's so bold, so humorous, and even a bit malicious since you end up landing at 1 million miles per second, on your bare feet, it perfectly fits the methods we've been taught to summon intent.\n\nIt's as good as Julian tossing don Juan into a river.\n\nOf course it works!!!\n\nHow long does it take to travel 80 billion light years?\n\n15 or 20 seconds.\n\nBut that's another story.\n\nI got curious about the \"stars\" I saw on the way, merely glancing at one and wondering how did I pick out planets, when the stars were so dominating in space.\n\nThen I remembered something strange.\n\nNyei.\n\nWhy her interest in stars?\n\nIf you look back a couple of posts, you'll see the lengthy Yoga Journal interview with the workshop participants in Maui.\n\nI don't read things like that. Carlos told me not to, and it was a wise thing to do. On multiple levels.\n\nBut that Maui workshop included a technique for teleporting yourself into space! I was there, I remember it.\n\nI've come to realize, it's \"cheating\", but that's a highly technical issue.\n\nYou send a \"probe\", and then hopefully your double follows it, like a dog chasing a ball.\n\nDon't tell my double I said that. They're kind of malicious at times. Possibly because intent is also a bit malicious. If you don't already know that, go read the story about how the Nagual Julian tossed don Juan into a raging river, insisting \"Don't hate the River!\".\n\nAnd the apprentices assumed he had drowned for at least a whole day.\n\nActually, Julian lured out his double!\n\nWhile reading that post to understand why one would use a probe, instead of removing all traces of \"the self\" to cause the double to take over, I encountered these passages in that article:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nCastaneda has sent a special movement for this weekend- the Gift to Maui Pass, or Opening a Window for Abstract Energy. It is a complicated series of moves in which we imagine a ball of energy between our feet, affix our gaze to it, and pull it up above our heads. We cut a hatch in the space above our heads and let the ball float up into a black, starry sky, then pull it down onto the back of our necks, flip it onto our chests, and allow it to float down below our feet. Finally, with hands at our sides, we open and close our fingers \"like gills.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOk, so it turns out, Lily was teaching me the same thing, except without the ball. Keep in mind, that ball is your own awareness. It's the stuff dispersed to the outside of your inner shell, which you \"redeploy\" using Tensegrity.\n\nAnd it's associated with the double. It's likely the portion of the double, in common with us. What you look for, to interact with the double in some specific techniques.\n\nYou scoop it to the middle and place it on your \"pouches\", and that builds the energy body.\n\nWhich Taisha claims is the same thing as the double.\n\nI disagree, but who am I to question the witches. Possibly it's just a matter of point of view, like a father can also be a businessman.\n\nIn my case, I did a hell of a recapitulation while in the classes of Carlos, and may fall in this \"exception\" for that technique which works with a probe. I'm the probe now. Or least least, I'm \"probe capable\".\n\nDid you notice, the shades of Olmec figurines in the instructions for that technique? How you send out your \"probe\", which is part of a potential energy body, and thus your double. So when it returns, you put it where it belongs. On those pouches. The same way the Olmec made figurines with a werejaguar on their lap, or on their back upside down.\n\nNew to my Facebook?\n\nYes it gets weird. But it's all real, and you can do it too. Otherwise there's no point in bringing it to you! So don't think, \"weird yoga stories\".\n\nThose guys can't do what they say. They copied it from older writings, to get your money.\n\nEverything here, is only here, so you'll do it eventually. If you want to.\n\nAlso from the interview:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"After a thorough recapitulation under the guidance of Clara Grau,\" Taisha has said, \u201cI shifted nearly half of my awareness to the energy body, although the world seemed much the same. You wake up the energy body as a result of the recapitulation exercise. You don't know anything is happening, but you don't get so excited about the presentation of yourself in life- insults and so forth.\n\n\"You have all your energy locked up in memories, social order, expectation. You get back your original energy through recapitulation. The more you use your energy body, the stronger you'll become.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo maybe, once you have more energy in your energy body, you don't need a \"probe\". You can go yourself. And then I saw this:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter doing magical passes all day, I feel strong, confident, my energy unobstructed. I'm eager to tell Jack all about it over dinner. \"We learned a movement to tap into the energetic emanations from dead stars,\" I say for openers. \"We're accruing silence so we can call back the energy body to take the abstract flight.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd this!!!!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOn Saturday evening Taisha Abelar, a plain-looking woman who appears as trustworthy and mild-mannered as someone's third-grade teacher, takes the stage to recount her adventures learning the magical passes, both on the ground and up in a tree-standing on a limb, \"with balance gotten only by linking my fibers to a star.\" But her feet seem to be firmly planted tonight as she talks matter-of-factly about being a \"stalker,\" living for months playing the role of a crippled beggar woman. She also describes how she transforms her energy body and disappears: \"It begins with a shiver, then a shake, from the feet up. You have to do it with stored energy.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd then I remembered something Cholita had told me. The women got instruction from the witches, that the men were unaware of.\n\nAnd Nyei looks like a woman to me.\n\nSo she got instruction the men weren't aware of...\n\nMy conclusion: There's an aspect of our sorcery which deals with stars.\n\nPossibly no one in the community has made a big deal out of it, because most have never seen this nonsense actually work, and would just be happy if their big toe tingled a bit.\n\nI once lost a student of several years, into whom I had poured many hours of instruction, to \"naked yoga\".\n\nI taught him what the second attention was, and to move his assemblage point, but he just couldn't get himself our of that chair, and open his eyes!\n\nSo naked yoga took him.\n\nThat's the problem in the Castaneda community as it stands now. Naked anything at all, has taken most of them.\n\nBut the real thing can beat nakedness hands down. I hope you try some.\n\nYou kind of have to be zipping across the universe, millions of light years per second, pass by a star, and remember that in fact, there was something in that \"map\" we have regarding stars, before you understand what we accidentally found in the writings of Carlos and the Witches.\n\nSo much real magic, we'll never figure it all out.\n\nAnd star power is on the list!\n\nBut then, if you're expecting to land on a planet you spotted in your home, through the solid ceiling and room, now zipping faster than the speed of light, you're too busy worrying about landing to think about star gazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Star Power", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"fq75359j2g081": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c14048407c7fc3bb3c10720b21251ba29664912"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb26f724c7c0d34f7debb6610c3de7a30d980d9"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6734683246918405569fa9ee3dda8fc896cad510"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd3768e1260fb3f78f07455f32404c4a8a368bec"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30c081861f26768d94b033fb9deeeb3b072b7598"}, {"y": 608, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddbee805e2015acc9694105549e963267b5b2b42"}], "s": {"y": 924, "x": 1640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=1640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a96477591655015c304282862d392baac87831c"}, "id": "fq75359j2g081"}}, "name": "t3_qx3ire", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-pZkM48Zfjtt0_guGCXD09cFxe1zN13JPdxi1kuBpxo.jpg", "edited": 1637282455.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1637280930.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fq75359j2g081.png?width=1640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6a96477591655015c304282862d392baac87831c\"&gt;Nyei, one of the 3 \\&amp;quot;Chacmools\\&amp;quot;.

How you send out your &amp;quot;probe&amp;quot;, which is part of a potential energy body, and thus your double. So when it returns, you put it where it belongs. On those pouches. The same way the Olmec made figurines with a werejaguar on their lap, or on their back upside down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New to my Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes it gets weird. But it&amp;#39;s all real, and you can do it too. Otherwise there&amp;#39;s no point in bringing it to you! So don&amp;#39;t think, &amp;quot;weird yoga stories&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those guys can&amp;#39;t do what they say. They copied it from older writings, to get your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything here, is only here, so you&amp;#39;ll do it eventually. If you want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also from the interview:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;After a thorough recapitulation under the guidance of Clara Grau,&amp;quot; Taisha has said, \u201cI shifted nearly half of my awareness to the energy body, although the world seemed much the same. You wake up the energy body as a result of the recapitulation exercise. You don&amp;#39;t know anything is happening, but you don&amp;#39;t get so excited about the presentation of yourself in life- insults and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have all your energy locked up in memories, social order, expectation. You get back your original energy through recapitulation. The more you use your energy body, the stronger you&amp;#39;ll become.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe, once you have more energy in your energy body, you don&amp;#39;t need a &amp;quot;probe&amp;quot;. You can go yourself. And then I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After doing magical passes all day, I feel strong, confident, my energy unobstructed. I&amp;#39;m eager to tell Jack all about it over dinner. &amp;quot;We learned a movement to tap into the energetic emanations from dead stars,&amp;quot; I say for openers. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re accruing silence so we can call back the energy body to take the abstract flight.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Saturday evening Taisha Abelar, a plain-looking woman who appears as trustworthy and mild-mannered as someone&amp;#39;s third-grade teacher, takes the stage to recount her adventures learning the magical passes, both on the ground and up in a tree-standing on a limb, &amp;quot;with balance gotten only by linking my fibers to a star.&amp;quot; But her feet seem to be firmly planted tonight as she talks matter-of-factly about being a &amp;quot;stalker,&amp;quot; living for months playing the role of a crippled beggar woman. She also describes how she transforms her energy body and disappears: &amp;quot;It begins with a shiver, then a shake, from the feet up. You have to do it with stored energy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I remembered something Cholita had told me. The women got instruction from the witches, that the men were unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Nyei looks like a woman to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she got instruction the men weren&amp;#39;t aware of...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My conclusion: There&amp;#39;s an aspect of our sorcery which deals with stars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly no one in the community has made a big deal out of it, because most have never seen this nonsense actually work, and would just be happy if their big toe tingled a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once lost a student of several years, into whom I had poured many hours of instruction, to &amp;quot;naked yoga&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I taught him what the second attention was, and to move his assemblage point, but he just couldn&amp;#39;t get himself our of that chair, and open his eyes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So naked yoga took him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the problem in the Castaneda community as it stands now. Naked anything at all, has taken most of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the real thing can beat nakedness hands down. I hope you try some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You kind of have to be zipping across the universe, millions of light years per second, pass by a star, and remember that in fact, there was something in that &amp;quot;map&amp;quot; we have regarding stars, before you understand what we accidentally found in the writings of Carlos and the Witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much real magic, we&amp;#39;ll never figure it all out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And star power is on the list!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, if you&amp;#39;re expecting to land on a planet you spotted in your home, through the solid ceiling and room, now zipping faster than the speed of light, you&amp;#39;re too busy worrying about landing to think about star gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "qx3ire", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qx3ire/star_power/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/qx3ire/star_power/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1637280930.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hl9o8c7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1637337909.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hl7530j", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Nyei in makeup might be nice!\n\nShe was always my favorite Chacmool.\n\nPicture this:\n\nAll 3 Chacmools are asked to stand up and give us a lecture.\n\nKylie goes up there, and it's like hearing a female drill sergeant on a grumpy day, making sure all of her words follow army regulations.

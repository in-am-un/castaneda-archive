It's not well used yet, but it's come into existence as such things always do when sorcery is being learned.\n\nAnd normal waking dreaming has those too!

When you are out there in deep sorcery states.\n\nIt's as if ordinary memories are stored in the brain, but memories out there, where you are mostly in your dreaming double even when awake, are stored in the emanations themselves.\n\nAnd nothing is ever lost from the emanations. All of human history, including the experiences of all human beings, are available out there, as \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\n*Seeing*.\n\nSo I was using some \"leaf magic\" I learned because of my discovery of traces of very old sorcerers still present in silent knowledge, and I found myself in a \"travel bubble\".\n\nA travel bubble is probably just your own luminous shell, but with some \"shiny outer coating\" restored.\n\nThe Tensegrity is designed to raise that up, but it has to be used with Silence, so that you don't worry and fuss and fret the new energy away, and with other things you can read about in the books. The things designed to \"save energy\".\n\nWhen the outer shiny coating is \"available\", you can form a travel bubble.\n\nOr as \"leaf magic\" calls it,  places behind the surface.\n\nThey used leaves laid flat on the ground to gaze at, until they could duplicate that sight anywhere, in any location around them.  They could pass through that, like passing through the middle of a bush in a jungle, and come out somewhere else.  Or in some other reality if they chose.\n\nBut I had more like a bubble, and every part of it contained a visible dream scene.\n\nIt was like being in one of those hacker nerd basements where it turns out they have monitors watching the entire world, and are engaged in evil hacking just about anywhere.\n\nThat movie fantasy is actually possible with sorcery.\n\nWatching those dream scenes all around me, fully awake, eyes open, completely sober in the middle of the night, and in a bit of pain from going to the gym and trying to max out all of the weight machines, I realized it wasn't really a \"travel bubble\".\n\nIt was a method of presentation of Silent Knowledge.\n\nAnything I wanted to know about anything humans can think about, was there on the inside of the bubble. I just had to \"find it\".\n\nI started to think about how to draw that.  It's a side effect of trying to help others.  \n\nIt's a bit of the \"book deal mind\", meaning wanting to get attention from other people, for your magic.  Which is horrible, because it means you'll never be able to learn any.  You have to want magic, and not attention from other people.  Otherwise, you'll never leave that blue line at the top of the J curve, where people cling to each other.\n\nBut when you're stuck helping others learn, it's unavoidable.  This community nearly died without someone telling others, it's all real and it all works.\n\nI saw some students from here, who have problems.\n\nRight there, off to the right inside the bubble.\n\nI didn't want to be thinking about that. Some come in here with their personalities blazing, trying to fuss around and threaten, so they can get what they want.  Sympathy.  Attention.  Energy taken from others at their expense.  They have real problems, but it's inappropriate to expect this subreddit to be able to hand those, and also help others learn real magic.\n\n\"The Caretaker\" of the ancient transportation system I discovered in Silent Knowledge, the focus of weeks of my efforts,  spoke.\n\nKeep in mind, once you really learn sorcery, you get \"projects\".  You find something, it interests you, you decide if it helps or harms learning sorcery, and then even if it's \"probably not true\", you investigate it.\n\nTrue? Good.  Do it.\n\nNot true?  Just as good. That's a \"not-doing\".\n\nThe caretaker guards a 100,000 year old transportation system I can materialize in my dark room, using a series of magical passes (Tensegrity). It's fully visible!  Hard to argue against it's realness, when you're looking right at it.\n\nI looked around to find the caretakers face, so to make him more realistic.\n\nBut I was inside a travel bubble, and he was outside it.\n\nHe said, \"Don't like that scene do you?  When you finally reduced the sorrow of your own self, and then tried to help others do the same, they bring  their problems along and dump them on the table,  for everyone to see.\"\n\nI asked what can be done about that.\n\nHe said, \"You already saw what to do about it.  You even read what to do about it, over and over.\"\n\n\"But when Carlos showed you in person, he got nothing but criticism over it.  Everyone said he was 'playing sorcerer'.  They made fun of it all,  as if to destroy the only solution to apprentices who dump their 'self' on the table, for all to see.\"\n\nI understood.  Our own Jadey was actually \"Laura\" in private classes.\n\nI commented, \"You mean like Pablito's death battle with his mother Soledad?  Except, it was just made up.  And in fact, no one knew anything at all about Pablito's life before sorcery.\"\n\n\"Exactly\", said the caretaker.  \"Imagine the chaos if Carlos hadn't given new personal histories and names to the women he tried to lead.  In the case of what you are doing, you'd be wise to copy it.  That way if anyone violates their new history, they can be tossed out for that instead of being dragged into the details of their sorrow as an excuse for their behavior.\"\n\n\"You have to put all of that behind you at first.

What they see, is their own doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That makes sense to sorcerers.  That they take on any appearance that works in teh current situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They appear to each person by &amp;quot;pulling&amp;quot; on something inside them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if they can make themselves seem &amp;quot;important&amp;quot;, they like that best of all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they&amp;#39;ll pull on &amp;quot;delusions&amp;quot; first, given a choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the appearance and story about who or what they are, comes from the worries and fantasies of the person viewing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, this stuff is many many thousands of years old. Perhaps 200,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Modern religions are all very very new, and created after there was money to steal from people using false stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are awake and in the middle of the J curve, they are very slow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you slide the assemblage point to the right around 6 inches, they speed up until they can be fully solid, fully real, and speak out loud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t want to be doing too much of that, or you can get &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; at a new place, instead of learning to move away from where we&amp;#39;re already stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why they take so long to answer, is because we ask them things that &amp;quot;are not&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you want to know, is a falsehood. It doesn&amp;#39;t actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can&amp;#39;t use &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; to answer it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s NOT, actual knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For them to answer a story, requires them to understand the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like an alien manuscript perhaps.  If we got a question from an alien about &amp;quot;The Great Demon Catharses&amp;quot; on their planet, we&amp;#39;d have to do some studying ourselves, to answer any questions about that imaginary entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might have to send the question to an expert on weird religions, at the university.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What actually happens in their world we don&amp;#39;t know, but they do anything you request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if it makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I am impatiently waiting to hear their answer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That won&amp;#39;t make any difference to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just seems like insincere behavior, with an ulterior motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which further complicates the question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one practicing Islam ever has managed to learn in here. We&amp;#39;ve theorized it wrecks someone for learning real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last guy wanted &amp;quot;permission&amp;quot; to break away from Islam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if he needed a father figure to take responsibility, for him going against his brainwashing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11lso7p/testing_the_quranic_verses_about_jinninorganics/jbkr5qu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1678389377.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_11lso7p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbkoldb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Willing_Brick_2698", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1678388425.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbkgn7o", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_i0jsx16j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "1\\_When we humans ask something, the other party answers immediately.

With just one question! simply!\n\nIs the claim of the Qur'an that says that the jinn were eavesdropping in the sky and after the arrival of the Prophet by the command of God, they can no longer do this and they found the sky full of mighty guardians and whoever does this (angels) will hit him with a meteor, is it true or not? You should ask them. Maybe the Quran was right! The test is simple!

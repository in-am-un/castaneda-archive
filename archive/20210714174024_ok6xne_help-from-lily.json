Lily will find out. It's Shakespeare.](https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=688327b8e8b362562b3a6053225fdbb10fa2dccc)\n\nI didn't think much of this as I put it into practitioner chat, but after reading it I see that there's some useful stuff in here, for the general population.\n\nLily, my most helpful inorganic being,  did her \"too fast teaching\" thing again last night.\n\nWhich, for the sake of beginners I'll say, they always do.  When you get an Ally and it begins to teach you, I predict you'll have the same problem.\n\nSound too good to be true, new people?\n\nRemember, no one in here makes any money or derives any benefit at all from trying to help others.\n\nIn fact, we get lynched a few times a week, by angry men and crazy women.\n\nYou've never seen a place like this before. Anywhere else you go, whoever is helping you has his mind on your cash.\n\nWe don't want your cash.\n\nWell...  Cholita would take it if offered with no strings.\n\nSo, we're just trying to get you to experience this for real, in order to fix the reputation of Carlos.\n\nCarlos had the same problem of teaching too fast, with the dreaming emissary.\n\nWho was likely Little Smoke!\n\nHe even asked don Juan what to do about it, and don Juan told him to only worry about the stuff that pertained to...\n\nI can't remember what.  But don Juan said essentially, just narrow your focus and don't worry about the rest.\n\nI suppose they think we're dim witted and might never come back, so they load us up as fast as they can.\n\nLike a mom shouting advice to a kid going off to college, as he tries to get on the bus.\n\nYou can in fact repeat what the inorganic beings teach you, but you have to put in the work to do that yourself.\n\nThey can't figure out what you would feel was \"important\".  It's all the same to them.\n\nI lost 95% of what Lily taught me, because I was experimenting with not stopping to get out my cellphone for taking notes.\n\nI got more that way, as I assumed.  Because playing with the cell phone shifts the assemblage point back to normal.\n\nBut now it's all lost.\n\nSo all in all, maybe taking notes is better?\n\nHere's what I can recall:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily did the too fast teaching thing again. I thought I'd resist and see what was retained. Not much.\n\nSmells from the Second attention: don't try to do 2 things at once!\n\nNormally, in your Tonal world,  you only catch a whiff of smell at the end of a task you are doing. So if you want second attention smell, don't try to train yourself to pay attention to nothing but smell.\n\nThat's a completely different issue!\n\nInstead, look for a whiff at the end of a flurry of activity. For example, you just entered some swirls of light that formed a tunnel, and then walk back out.\n\nYou can catch a smell just as you are leaving, as if you caused some air flow and brought it out.  Just like in the real world.\n\nMaybe you could even catch a whiff going into something new, like entering a dream world.\n\nBottom line: use your normal expectations.  Those contain intent.\n\nAnd sorcery can be just as cozy as our normal life.\n\nFor beginners, don Juan said that most people who learn a little sorcery, go back to their daily life.\n\nIt's not \"cozy\".  I'll add, humans are crying babies, always feeling sorry for themselves. Even the biggest movie superstar who blows away dozens of people during his action movies, goes home and cries in bed.\n\nDon't be fooled. The normal position of the assemblage point is self-pity.\n\nAnd it's \"cozy\" in the real world, because everyone shares the personality trait.  They can instantly, \"feel for you\" when you are less than happy.\n\nCozy is just sharing reality with other humans, with common knowledge of how it works.\n\nDreaming should start out in a \"common area\", shared by other dreamers you know.\n\nAnd then you can retain some of the \"cozy\" of waking life. The wall of fog is an example. Standing outside it waiting to be taken in is \"cozy\".\n\nSeems a little scary too, but cozy and scary are different things.\n\nLily showed me a skiing lodge with a fireplace, lit by lovely gas lights so that it glowed in a beautiful yellow light. Lots of places to sit and lay.  Paintings and woodwork decorating the entire giant room, with a porch and stairs going up a few feet, to the  huge doors.\n\nShe said it was a gift we could share if we had the power.\n\nThen she explained, waking dreaming has different \"skills\", and we're all lumping it into the same category.\n\nWe're just happy to be doing waking dreaming at all!\n\nBut we need to get over that.\n\nEventually we need to recognize that our current \"mood\" is like trying to lump all track and field sports into the same thing, when in fact each one is a different skill.\n\nOne skill we badly need to learn, is to return to a waking dream we've visited before. Without that ability, \"cozy\" will elude us. It's like being lost all the time, without that ability. Not very cozy to be lost.\n\nI got the impression from her that there were around 6-8 \"basic waking dreaming skills\". In fact, I could sort of perceive a \"list\".  But at the time I didn't think I needed to study it, it just \"was\".\n\nLily suggested, one of you should write a manual on it and go ahead and sell it, to combat the bad books. There's no such book at this time, even if you include Carlos and the witches.\n\nAnd you do in fact have to profit from it, so that the vendors profit, and stock all the places you can't possibly reach.\n\nNo one has a \"try this, that happens, then try this, ...\" type book.   Where after trying the first chapter, you are convinced it's all possible.\n\nCarlos proposed a \"how to\" manual in private classes, saying he's made one, but it was lost in a movie theater. So he's given us permission.\n\nI assumed his last 3 books were the \"how to\".\n\nBut they aren't.  They're just the \"please be serious about this when I'm gone\", books.\n\nThe fact is, one of us has to write that.  Cholita is ideal.\n\nI'm banned.\n\nBut Cholita can't write it.\n\nThe fun part is, such a book would KILL the phony sorcerers.\n\nNot that all the bad players out there, in the Castaneda eco system, would give up their bad pursuits.\n\nBut those were never interested in sorcery at all.\n\nI forgot one more thing.\n\nLily says that the crop of sorcerers we get now, is intrinsically different than the crowd we had when Carlos was alive.\n\nThat crowd had to endure their friends saying Carlos was a fraud, and act anyway.\n\nThey had to have a tiny amount of unbending intent, just to participate.\n\nBut that's all over.  Carlos was, \"thoroughly debunked\".\n\nAnd they know it.\n\nBut this crowd doesn't care if it's true.\n\nIt's  merely a potential \"yoga franchise\" for them.\n\nHeaded towards being a religion, where you simply have to \"believe\" to be doing well.\n\nBe \"impeccable\" and you are good.  That's what this crop believes.\n\n\"Be good\".\n\n\"Don't sin.\"\n\nOr, \"Be Holy\".\n\nThat's their mood.\n\nIt's not rational.\n\nDoes anyone really believe Krishna plays a little flute, has sex with dozens of women at once, and will take you to heaven if you sing and dance for him?\n\nReally???\n\nNo.\n\nAnd the crazy, lonely people in the Castaneda community, whom no one can get along with, can use phony sorcery teachers and classes to have friends and social interaction.\n\nThey'll just insist they are \"impeccable\", and it makes them feel good.\n\nLily showed me that as a series of dreaming images.  Like the aftermath of an explosion.\n\nCarlos blew  up, the result was this mess.  I could literally see the pieces flying around in space, and when it settled down, we had this horrible mess of a sorcery community.\n\nBut it's required by the rule for this to happen.  And the rule repeats.\n\nIt's just very messy this time around, because there's far more people than a simple lineage would have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Help from Lily", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 124, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"nfmkc70l97b71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 96, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bf58d35dbf9c06ebdd23bfe53ca0cc239b68cf5"}, {"y": 192, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e67a5a7373e6a880bd286e07d0820b0038829c7a"}, {"y": 284, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=665b9dc2fceea61dfab71aca06c542a560edc877"}, {"y": 569, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3f6dc80f88ed13af78144cff2b3efe5f02944e"}, {"y": 853, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=246b2c97cc06a6fa11220dfd13742429f98013d8"}, {"y": 960, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f95fa1baf4ca164fa2f298883c61451689f14dee"}], "s": {"y": 1334, "x": 1500, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=688327b8e8b362562b3a6053225fdbb10fa2dccc"}, "id": "nfmkc70l97b71"}}, "name": "t3_ok6xne", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Zt7jKhxD2TAlrdoDvtqiRKdnJVCcFfqtpcoNsLCr9wY.jpg", "edited": 1626277932.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1626277224.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nfmkc70l97b71.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=688327b8e8b362562b3a6053225fdbb10fa2dccc\"&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be sorry for picking this picture.

The real things being your energy body puffs, or inorganic beings.\n\nAnd show in cartoon format, what causes those to become visible.

It works better than darkroom, once you realize you need to be doing it so as to produce stunning magic.\n\nThat's done by unbroken remembering with perfect breathing, and smoothness of head durn, until some of those are \"interrupted\".  No fantasizing allowed.\n\nIt manipulates the internal dialogue in a way that doesn't require being aware of it.\n\nSo you get the flow of intent going on remembering, breathing, and the slow head turn \"gaze\".\n\nAnd see what interrupts it.\n\nMeanwhile, the emphasis on unbroken remembering and breathing sucks back all the energy.  \n\nSo something is bound to happen. But people seem to have ignored it, or  they don't actually do recap long enough to move the assemblage point.\n\nGazing at ferns can also move the assemblage point, but someone would need to show it in an organized format.

It works better than darkroom, once you realize you need to be doing it so as to produce stunning magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s done by unbroken remembering with perfect breathing, and smoothness of head durn, until some of those are &amp;quot;interrupted&amp;quot;.

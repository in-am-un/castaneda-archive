And it flew up.\n\nI knew what it was from reading La Gorda's account.\n\nAnd said, \"No thanks... That's too creepy for me.\"\n\nIt went away!\n\nThe next time it seemed worried I was going to send it away again, like a puppy whose been chastised for bad behavior, sneaking up to lick your feet and  see if it's forgiven yet.\n\nI believe on the 3rd try it tried to be \"less realistic\", and more artist like.\n\nBut still, we're talking about a giant eye floating up to you, well lit like it has a spotlight on it, in absolute darkness.\n\nWhen you are completely awake, eyes open, fully sober, and have been doing tensegrity. So you didn't \"doze off\" without realizing it.\n\nI have to add that for the new people bad players just arriving,  who are slightly crazy.  They come in here, read the top 2 or 3 posts, and then start making up stuff.\n\nSome guy tried to claim he was responsible for my post a couple of days ago, as was his girlfriend.\n\nRight off the bat, he tried to lie his way into the \"action\".\n\nOr new people smoke some weed, take some stronger drugs, sit on pillows that night and have memory of reading a post like this.  So that guides their mental masturbations for the evening.\n\nThe next day they post, \"And I saw the giant eye, a black IOB mass,  A new world forming on the wall...\"\n\nIt's like they're talking to Santa Claus, trying to justify being greedy.\n\nThey lie their pants off to get attention.  Some of it is probably the drugs, but they never mention they had their eyes closed, passed out at one point, came to, had some dreams, and then selected what made the best story for a first post.\n\nIt's horrible...\n\nWe're trying to do something about that.\n\nSome are just broken people, but some are here to shoplift. Try to pretend to be sorcerers, as part of some scheme to get their own \"Sergio Inspired\" franchise.\n\nSo they can harm the Castaneda community even more with pretending.\n\nDon't do that? Please?\n\nIf you really see la Gorda's eye too soon, meaning before that's not such a big deal, you will PISS YOUR PANTS.\n\nIt is a REAL eye, floating in your room, and it can't be up to anything good!\n\nSo please keep your stories out of the subreddit?  You won't fool anyone but yourself.\n\nIf your eye doesn't look 10 times more real than this picture, you didn't see it.\n\nSo what's this La Gorda nonsense about this coming because you \"lost the human form\".\n\nI think that's just La Gorda's training method, customized by don Juan and Genaro.\n\nI don't think it applies to anyone else.\n\nRemember that as La Gorda defines it, just gazing at a fern and seeing some \"weirdness\" is \"stopping the world\".\n\nWhereas, stopping the world at its most extreme puts you right in front of the emanations.  Like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Very close to an outright view of the emanations and bundles](https://preview.redd.it/lkjxosqeocd91.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dad90aa50aef6ccddc402c56651d46ecdef994a9)\n\nI've been surprised up until now that La Gorda's eye is real, however now I understand it.\n\nIt's a \"PPSKE\".\n\nA \"**premature** persistent Silent Knowledge Entity\".\n\nPremature, because La Gorda summoned it before she understood what it was.\n\nSilent Knowledge is easily \"channeled\" by something else. Rituals even.\n\nThe old \"men of knowledge\" couldn't even reach it at all, but they could do rituals and use power plants and inorganic beings, to \"channel it\".\n\nThe talking lizards and the moth dust for example.\n\nAnd once you can reach SK, you realize what a huge burden it is to reach the \"purest\" form.\n\nWhere you're surrounded by little monitors and time portals, with some entity lecturing you on a question you had, showing all knowledge related to that.\n\nThat's actually very tiring, and burns up dreaming energy quickly.  And it's also \"traumatic\".  \n\nSo below that, is simple \"seeing\".  You can keep that up for hours.\n\nWhere you get a little vision in your mind about something you can't possibly know.\n\nBut you aren't surrounded by a \"storyteller\" or an old sorcerer named Porfirio, at his hut, in a realm with a being and stuff all around, none of which actually exists.\n\nOnce the assemblage point gets \"near\" to Silent KNowledge, just about anything can trigger a little \"preview\".  That happens when it's where shown in the upper right of this old post picture.  Notice the cool magic coming to the person, in the form of remote viewing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Partial Silent Knowledge is less confusing. It happens at that assemblage point position.](https://preview.redd.it/teeexm2vpcd91.png?width=751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e24bf5bc913aa54b06654b7a343b2b2eb6eacf7)\n\nSo my guess is, La Gorda created an eyeball silent knowledge entity, and didn't understand what it was.\n\nAnd don juan and Genaro just let her believe what she wanted, because witches are like that.\n\nIt gives them more power, to have their own understanding of what's going on.\n\nThe men are the ones who want \"validation and certification\".\n\nBut also, La Gorda was bossy.\n\nI kind of liked the cat \"eye\". It was absolutely beautiful.  Can't possibly capture it, in a still pic.\n\nMaybe in animations, which is why I made this crude post. Because that was just too cool to lose. Later I'll remember to animate it.\n\nAnd I need to go back to learning to run Blender, the free open source animation program.\n\nHere's the idea:  Make a virtual \"Dance Home\", where Carlos taught.\n\nDown to the patterns on the wooden floor boards!  To enable re-run sorcery with some \"clues\".\n\nMake a virtual but respectful Carlos and Kylie.\n\nUse special software to scan in all videos of tensegrity, so the cartoon Kylie can do them.\n\nI'll add \"special effects\" to some, so that you can click on the Carlos, who will turn off Dance Home lights and you can see what is possible to see, in darkness.\n\nHave a slider bar for the J curve on the side, so you can select the \"blue line\", \"green line\", \"red line\", \"orange line\", and \"purple zone\" view.  See what it's like at all positions of the assemblage point.\n\nIt's possible because Blender includes particle physics, runtime python code, and objects which radiate light.\n\nThen, use the resulting files with the gaming engine \"Unreal\", to make a game out of it.\n\nWhere you can run around in Dance Home, try the tensegrity moves from all angles, even click a button to get Kylie to repeat in sets of 4 moves over and over until you click for her to move on to the next, and generally make it better than videos for learning tensegrity because you can see all angles.\n\nBUT, ideally you would learn what the tensegrity moves \"can do\", and then you can try an obstacle course test.\n\nA simple game you can only pass, if you can figure out which Tensegrity move will solve the next puzzle.\n\nSuch as a mini grand canyon is in your path, and to move on in the game you have to cross it.\n\nMashing energy!   That's how.\n\nBut you'll only learn that, if you watched that tensegrity move in darkness, in the orange zone,  and can call it up by name.  Meaning you've put in some actual work.\n\nCarlos had to charge money to get rid of the inevitable bad guys.\n\nWe can't.\n\nSo we need them to do \"proof of work\".\n\nTo get into the subreddit you have to pass that obstacle course. Maybe you get a \"high score\" that's easy to verify here.  A hash of their name for example.\n\nSo that we don't get more Sergio fans trying to build up a reputation for themselves in here, because they saw the pictures and decided they can lie as good as the next man.\n\nThey're \"Sergio endorsed\"!\n\nWe need to keep that sort out of the subreddit with some \"automated test\".  Which requires enough effort to pass the test, that the bad players give up.\n\nIf it's a teaching tool, maybe all \"shiny objects\" will have been removed from this subreddit, such as desires to kiss up to the old timers, and we'll just get serious practitioners in here.\n\nPeople who actually put in time to learn at home, alone.\n\nAnd maybe we'll no longer have to look at videos about pathetic western gurus who sit with big beaming smiles because they're \"superior\", and do charity work to prove they are worthy to be worshipped.\n\nThat's called, \"magic\" by some new people.  Getting lots of attention for yourself from other people, based on the lie that you are permanently superior.\n\nThat's not magic at all.\n\nEven if you get groupies to make up stuff to help you seem more real.  So that it's so much effort to check it out, you just have to allow that maybe they have psychic powers.\n\nLike all holymen...\n\nSpeaking of \"psychic powers\", the real kind are much better than the groupie contrived variety.\n\nIt's possible to learn how to summon this eye.\n\nBut all you need to do is find that shiny outer coating, and start playing with it.\n\nWeird stuff will come from it.\n\nIf you can't find it and you get there, I'll lead you through the slightly scary process.\n\nI also gained access to \"the library\" last night.\n\nI hope I get to visit again!\n\nAs real as anything you can imagine, and fully stable.\n\nSeems to be a \"SKPR\".\n\nSilent knowledge Phantom Room.\n\nThat's from messing with the outer coatings of the egg shell.\n\nThe egg shell might be the key to translocation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "La Gorda's Eye", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text",

isn&amp;#39;t bright enough or colorful enough to capture it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the story goes, La Gorda has a giant eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got it as a result of &amp;quot;losing the human form&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, you have to take anything La Gorda says in the books, with a &amp;quot;grain of salt&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what that means, other than who knows if what she says was just some &amp;quot;Alternate teaching method for La Gorda&amp;quot;, or her misunderstanding something but insisting she did not, or even her trying to &amp;quot;take over leadership&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read the workshop and lecture notes on La Gorda, she&amp;#39;s not always a good &amp;quot;assistant&amp;quot; to Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, she was his &amp;quot;worthy opponent&amp;quot;, or maybe it was &amp;quot;petty tyrant&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her job was to annoy the hell out of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point she makes it seem like getting a huge eye in front of you, when you closed your eyes, was inevitable on the path of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then later we  hear don Juan talk about some other substitute, and we even find La Gorda would &amp;quot;pull the eye open&amp;quot;, and make a portal to somewhere else they could walk into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not clear on it all, but I got &amp;quot;offered&amp;quot; to have her eye 4 times so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first was just a detached eyeball floating in the darkness, as real as can be for darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost like those &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; swimming in the air, in Dr. Who&amp;#39;s christmas special.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flying, slightly glowing fish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; looked like it had been pulled out of a real person, &amp;quot;roots and all&amp;quot;, and washed off to make it presentable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it was flying slowly around in a circle, until it &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot; me. And it flew up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew what it was from reading La Gorda&amp;#39;s account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And said, &amp;quot;No thanks... That&amp;#39;s too creepy for me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It went away!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next time it seemed worried I was going to send it away again, like a puppy whose been chastised for bad behavior, sneaking up to lick your feet and  see if it&amp;#39;s forgiven yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe on the 3rd try it tried to be &amp;quot;less realistic&amp;quot;, and more artist like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, we&amp;#39;re talking about a giant eye floating up to you, well lit like it has a spotlight on it, in absolute darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you are completely awake, eyes open, fully sober, and have been doing tensegrity.

Some of it is probably the drugs, but they never mention they had their eyes closed, passed out at one point, came to, had some dreams, and then selected what made the best story for a first post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s horrible...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to do something about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some are just broken people, but some are here to shoplift.

Please?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you really see la Gorda&amp;#39;s eye too soon, meaning before that&amp;#39;s not such a big deal, you will PISS YOUR PANTS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is a REAL eye, floating in your room, and it can&amp;#39;t be up to anything good!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please keep your stories out of the subreddit?  You won&amp;#39;t fool anyone but yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your eye doesn&amp;#39;t look 10 times more real than this picture, you didn&amp;#39;t see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s this La Gorda nonsense about this coming because you &amp;quot;lost the human form&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s just La Gorda&amp;#39;s training method, customized by don Juan and Genaro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it applies to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that as La Gorda defines it, just gazing at a fern and seeing some &amp;quot;weirdness&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;stopping the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas, stopping the world at its most extreme puts you right in front of the emanations.  Like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lkjxosqeocd91.png?width=300&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dad90aa50aef6ccddc402c56651d46ecdef994a9\"&gt;Very close to an outright view of the emanations and bundles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been surprised up until now that La Gorda&amp;#39;s eye is real, however now I understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;PPSKE&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;premature&lt;/strong&gt; persistent Silent Knowledge Entity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Premature, because La Gorda summoned it before she understood what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge is easily &amp;quot;channeled&amp;quot; by something else. Rituals even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old &amp;quot;men of knowledge&amp;quot; couldn&amp;#39;t even reach it at all, but they could do rituals and use power plants and inorganic beings, to &amp;quot;channel it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The talking lizards and the moth dust for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And once you can reach SK, you realize what a huge burden it is to reach the &amp;quot;purest&amp;quot; form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you&amp;#39;re surrounded by little monitors and time portals, with some entity lecturing you on a question you had, showing all knowledge related to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s actually very tiring, and burns up dreaming energy quickly.  And it&amp;#39;s also &amp;quot;traumatic&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So below that, is simple &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;.  You can keep that up for hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you get a little vision in your mind about something you can&amp;#39;t possibly know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you aren&amp;#39;t surrounded by a &amp;quot;storyteller&amp;quot; or an old sorcerer named Porfirio, at his hut, in a realm with a being and stuff all around, none of which actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the assemblage point gets &amp;quot;near&amp;quot; to Silent KNowledge, just about anything can trigger a little &amp;quot;preview&amp;quot;.  That happens when it&amp;#39;s where shown in the upper right of this old post picture.  Notice the cool magic coming to the person, in the form of remote viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/teeexm2vpcd91.png?width=751&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7e24bf5bc913aa54b06654b7a343b2b2eb6eacf7\"&gt;Partial Silent Knowledge is less confusing. It happens at that assemblage point position.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my guess is, La Gorda created an eyeball silent knowledge entity, and didn&amp;#39;t understand what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don juan and Genaro just let her believe what she wanted, because witches are like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gives them more power, to have their own understanding of what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men are the ones who want &amp;quot;validation and certification&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also, La Gorda was bossy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of liked the cat &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot;. It was absolutely beautiful.  Can&amp;#39;t possibly capture it, in a still pic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe in animations, which is why I made this crude post. Because that was just too cool to lose. Later I&amp;#39;ll remember to animate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I need to go back to learning to run Blender, the free open source animation program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the idea:  Make a virtual &amp;quot;Dance Home&amp;quot;, where Carlos taught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Down to the patterns on the wooden floor boards!  To enable re-run sorcery with some &amp;quot;clues&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make a virtual but respectful Carlos and Kylie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use special software to scan in all videos of tensegrity, so the cartoon Kylie can do them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll add &amp;quot;special effects&amp;quot; to some, so that you can click on the Carlos, who will turn off Dance Home lights and you can see what is possible to see, in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a slider bar for the J curve on the side, so you can select the &amp;quot;blue line&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;green line&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;red line&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;orange line&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;purple zone&amp;quot; view.  See what it&amp;#39;s like at all positions of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible because Blender includes particle physics, runtime python code, and objects which radiate light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, use the resulting files with the gaming engine &amp;quot;Unreal&amp;quot;, to make a game out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you can run around in Dance Home, try the tensegrity moves from all angles, even click a button to get Kylie to repeat in sets of 4 moves over and over until you click for her to move on to the next, and generally make it better than videos for learning tensegrity because you can see all angles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, ideally you would learn what the tensegrity moves &amp;quot;can do&amp;quot;, and then you can try an obstacle course test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple game you can only pass, if you can figure out which Tensegrity move will solve the next puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as a mini grand canyon is in your path, and to move on in the game you have to cross it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mashing energy!   That&amp;#39;s how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll only learn that, if you watched that tensegrity move in darkness, in the orange zone,  and can call it up by name.  Meaning you&amp;#39;ve put in some actual work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had to charge money to get rid of the inevitable bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we need them to do &amp;quot;proof of work&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get into the subreddit you have to pass that obstacle course. Maybe you get a &amp;quot;high score&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s easy to verify here.  A hash of their name for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that we don&amp;#39;t get more Sergio fans trying to build up a reputation for themselves in here, because they saw the pictures and decided they can lie as good as the next man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;Sergio endorsed&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to keep that sort out of the subreddit with some &amp;quot;automated test&amp;quot;.  Which requires enough effort to pass the test, that the bad players give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s a teaching tool, maybe all &amp;quot;shiny objects&amp;quot; will have been removed from this subreddit, such as desires to kiss up to the old timers, and we&amp;#39;ll just get serious practitioners in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who actually put in time to learn at home, alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe we&amp;#39;ll no longer have to look at videos about pathetic western gurus who sit with big beaming smiles because they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;superior&amp;quot;, and do charity work to prove they are worthy to be worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s called, &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; by some new people.  Getting lots of attention for yourself from other people, based on the lie that you are permanently superior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not magic at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you get groupies to make up stuff to help you seem more real.  So that it&amp;#39;s so much effort to check it out, you just have to allow that maybe they have psychic powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like all holymen...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &amp;quot;psychic powers&amp;quot;, the real kind are much better than the groupie contrived variety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to learn how to summon this eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all you need to do is find that shiny outer coating, and start playing with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird stuff will come from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t find it and you get there, I&amp;#39;ll lead you through the slightly scary process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also gained access to &amp;quot;the library&amp;quot; last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I get to visit again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As real as anything you can imagine, and fully stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems to be a &amp;quot;SKPR&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent knowledge Phantom Room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s from messing with the outer coatings of the egg shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The egg shell might be the key to translocation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count":

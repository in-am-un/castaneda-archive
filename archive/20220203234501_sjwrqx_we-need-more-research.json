I never got sucked into the 18V power pack collection, but I used to have any \"old school\" tool you might name.\n\nPossibly that's why when Little Smoke guided me through darkroom gazing, the first thing I realized was, \"It's a tool!\"\n\nIt's a \"lie detector\" type tool.\n\nYou tell yourself you can get silent, and you're a powerful genuine Indian sorcerer who can *see*.\n\nIt fools the chicks at the biker bar.\n\nWell... really it doesn't.\n\nBut they figure you're so screwed up, maybe they can keep you permanently. They just have to accept your \"hobbies\".\n\nWhen you apply Little Smoke's lie detector tool to your amazing sorcery prowess, the darkness just stares back at you as if to say, \"no you aren't\".\n\nYou can still run around with a bandana like Rambo and change your name to \"Harvey Swift Turkey\", but now you know the truth.  You haven't learned anything at all.\n\nBut let me tell you a secret about tools.\n\nTools are STACKABLE!\n\nIt's easier to explain this with computers, but I'll try the most basic analogy.\n\nSome company wanted to help an African nation, so they donated a bunch of computers to them.\n\nThis was at least 30 years ago.\n\nIt failed.\n\nSome guy came along and said, \"You idiot!  They don't need computers when they can't even make screws!  Don't you know that technology has to be stacked on top of existing technology before it's useful?\"\n\nAnd he gave them lathes.\n\nIt worked!    They started fixing old machinery junk, and pretty soon their economy had it's own real activity going on.\n\nLikewise, we have the tool of darkroom, which gave rise to the tool of *seeing*.\n\nThe tool of *seeing* gave rise to \"double technology\".\n\nWe know about the double now. How it behaves and where it comes from.\n\nSo we can go back to look at figurines from the magical cultures of Mexico and South America, and get \"tips\".  Hints.  New ideas for new techniques.\n\nThese are obviously not Olmec.  Even though they seem to have the rubber caps.\n\nBut one description says they have \"bangs\".  So I suppose that isn't rubber.\n\nAnd I don't believe they're Toltec.\n\nBut between Olmec and Toltec (which lead to the lineages) there has to be stuff in between.\n\nFigurines in between!\n\nMayan for sure.\n\nBe on the lookout. I have no idea what these are.\n\nBut how cool is it to look at something like this, and not have the standard academic explanation.\n\nInstead, you KNOW what that is, and by studying it you can learn to do brand new, amazing magic!\n\nAm I going off the deep end here?\n\nNo.  Carlos gave us this task. Constantly.\n\nI got the privilege of a Carlos guided tour of the Museum in Mexico city, but many others got tours of other historical magical sights.\n\nSo he wanted us to do this.\n\nPossibly he enjoyed the search himself at one point.\n\nKeep your eyes open!!!\n\nI also know for a fact that Carlos went searching for magic.\n\nI did the same, once Little Smoke scared me into heightened awareness.\n\nCarlos found none.  \n\nI found none.\n\nHundreds of \"spies\" in here, found no real magic on the internet. Just a bunch of empty promises, and people too lazy to stop and look into their \"system\".\n\nBut at one time, in Mexico, real magic was common.\n\nLet's bring that back!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

On the one hand, it's good science. On the other, it's a remnant of Western conquerors being unwilling to view the peoples inhabiting the Americas as capable of cultural, architectural and philosophical achievements that rivaled or exceeded their own. The extent of the trading network in Meso- and North America is understandably difficult to believe, but the evidence is there and it is overwhelming.

Trading between the two was abundant, and the influence of both people spread all over Mesoamerica. There is an outdated picture of these cultures living in isolation that continues to be taught in universities and in popular depictions of the Maya, Aztec, Inca. Look at the historically abominable film Apocalypto. You have a depiction of the Mayan world as a city surrounded abruptly by people living in very basic conditions in the woods. That simply isn't the way it was for the Maya, Teotihuacan and  much of the rest of Mesoamerica. This would be like people 2,000 years from now digging up New York City and assuming everything immediately outside of it was simple farms living on well-water.\n\nIt may sound to members of this sub that what I am discussing isn't relevant to your interests, but please consider what the research shows:\n\n\\-Mississippean power centers in at Cahokia (near St. Louis) were actively trading with the so-called Floridian cultures in the South, southwest well into Mexico and as far North as Canada. Cahokia supported a population as large as London at the same time. It is commonly known they had no wheel. It is a mistake to say this was a shortcoming. They had no beasts of burden. A wheel therefore would be useless.\n\n(a) The mounds at Cahokia are power centers, but not in the sense that London is a center of authority where the elite make decisions that effect the non-elite. A mound is built entirely by stacking packs of earth on top of one another. Each pack of earth added to the mound is accompanied by a short utterance or line of a song. Eventually you have a humming concentration of power with a powerful person residing and commanding from the top-center of the mound.\n\n\\-Macaws were discovered with human bones in a ritual burial inside of the Chaco Canyon complex 2 hours north of Albuquerque, New Mexico. They were accompanied by jewelry sourced to Central Mexico. The trading network between Chaco and Central Mexico was very strong.\n\n(a) I don't think that a lot of Chaco enthusiasts really understand the improbability of it as a place to build. There is no water in the immediate area. The location is arguably the worst place you would ever want to build. For example, the wood used to reinforce the brick at Chaco was run by teams of men on foot like a baton race, one to the next, over about a hundred miles.\n\n(b) The precision of the architecture and its interplay with astronomical cycles has been well-documented. What isn't emphasized enough is the utter impossibility of Fajada Butte. It is beyond all probability that someone randomly stumbled on Fajada Butte, climbed it on just the right day and time to see the \"dagger(s) of light\" created by the position of the sun and the precise accident of rocks deflecting and directing it. No. You can walk and wander in the desert as long as supplies allow and the discovery of the Butte is one of the most anomalous moments in history.\n\n(c) Chaco to me exemplifies the most common element in pre-Columbian art, which is to find the way that is the most difficult to create something and then deliberately choose to use that when plenty of shortcuts are available. Also, there is the practice of self-destruction in all of the art of the Americas. With the Nazca you see the painting of beautiful, intricate pottery which are ritually smashed on the ground. This occurs in Mesoamerica, in Chaco and in the Mississippian cultures.\n\n\\-DNA evidence shows Maya-Polynesian contact in both Mesoamerican and South Pacific locations. I still see a commitment to the narrative that it was a one-way exchange with Polynesians arriving in the Americas, but I find it hard to believe that with such a solid and lasting exchange the Maya wouldn't dispatch ambassadors to the west. Or did the Maya initiate the exchange with a seafaring culture we don't know about? I doubt this, but I admit I like it.\n\nNow let's look at these figurines.\n\n\\-Interesting that not only does the figurine here feature an inner-character behind the false chest-covering, but the chest-covering itself has its own character to hide. [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/684338](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/684338) It's a weak character, seemingly, at least in comparison to the stash of characters held within the actual body of the seated figurine.\n\n\\-And then you have obvious Teotihuacan motifs jammed in with one another.

What are they portraying?\n\nI don't know. That I know I don't know is why I felt qualified to reply to the original post. There is no such thing as a real expert on these figurines.\n\nEvery interpretation sounds pretty stupid:\n\n\\-These are merely decorative and clever figurines created with a whimsy similar to Russian nesting dolls\n\n\\-The figures within and their headgear are actual family crests which would be commonly known far and wide from Teotihuacan when they were created\n\n\\-These are gifts of evil, each containing a unique curse!\n\n\\-They depict inorganic beings . . . with a face and headdress and distinctive shoulders?\n\nThe truth is, we (anybody, I mean) don't know much about Teotihuacan except that it is beautiful and astonishing. We know a lot more about the Olmec because they had a proto-writing we are able to read on a surface-level without much nuance. It's controversial. There is an unconscious urge to suppress an abandoned language.\n\nInterpretation is interesting so far as one revels in self-projection. The Olmecs and exactly zero studied ancient civilizations deserve it. So don't you do it or let your friends!\n\nThe truth is that the people commanding these monuments were tyrants and were willing to exercise their power with a title and in public upon the public, as many as they could influence by force. What has that to do with anyone interested in a life of poetry and magic? These are people interested in creating tributes to their dying long before their time, creating cataclysms in their sudden ruins declaring, \"Look at me, I died\" to the public who may or may not gasp in shock upon hearing the news.\n\n\\-I recently visited the Bottle Creek mounds up the Tensaw River. It completely surprised me. I was expecting a few \"random\" mounds and instead our guide brought us to a huge trading center, midway between Cahokia and the Floridian cultures to the South like the Shell Mound off Tampa. The mounds can only be reached by boat, and the same was true at their height. The population was anywhere between 3,000-6,000. The site has never been thoroughly excavated.

There is an unconscious urge to suppress an abandoned language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interpretation is interesting so far as one revels in self-projection. The Olmecs and exactly zero studied ancient civilizations deserve it. So don&amp;#39;t you do it or let your friends!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the people commanding these monuments were tyrants and were willing to exercise their power with a title and in public upon the public, as many as they could influence by force. What has that to do with anyone interested in a life of poetry and magic? These are people interested in creating tributes to their dying long before their time, creating cataclysms in their sudden ruins declaring, &amp;quot;Look at me, I died&amp;quot; to the public who may or may not gasp in shock upon hearing the news.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I recently visited the Bottle Creek mounds up the Tensaw River. It completely surprised me. I was expecting a few &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; mounds and instead our guide brought us to a huge trading center, midway between Cahokia and the Floridian cultures to the South like the Shell Mound off Tampa. The mounds can only be reached by boat, and the same was true at their height. The population was anywhere between 3,000-6,000. The site has never been thoroughly excavated. Jean Lafitte visited long enough to steal sacred effigies that disappeared back in France. The entire area is now completely covered in thick brush with lots of poison ivy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sjwrqx/we_need_more_research/kfcoviq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1703813779.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_sjwrqx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

But he didn't get that at all.  After months of troubling us with his off base comments?\n\nIt's mind boggling.  All that work trying to help him, and in the end he was still only interested in pretending.\n\nI wish I understood how such a thing could happen, but I have a feeling if you could ask anyone who knows him they'd say, \"you mean Bob???  That guy's totally nuts!\"\n\nBut in here they can manage to seem sincerely interested for a long time.  As if they were merely so new to trying to make the magic from the books work, that you just need to cut them some slack.\n\nI'm not sure that has ever worked out in here.  And it's been around 4 years now.\n\nThis also kind of points out the huge difference between women and men.\n\nThe bad player men are trying to dominate others by verbally repeating stuff they read.\n\nIf sorcerers are supposed to drive red cars, they have the best red car.\n\nIf they're supposed to like chocolate, they become furious over strawberry.\n\nIt becomes obvious reading their posts that they're trying to produce a \"story\" others will accept.\n\nThis guy actually proposed I ought to be interested in a \"new lineage\". Which is so clueless I can't comprehend it.\n\nBut that kind of stupidity is common.  Which is why we have good policing in here.\n\nWhat you want of course is someone who has the clarity to see there's real magic here, no one wants your money, and the more you learn and examine it, the more it makes sense.\n\nThen you have the case of women.  Sometimes their reported experiences seem misaligned to a view of the J curve as a series of steps where you walk up the pyramid one small level at a time, and should expect to see precisely the same thing anyone who was on your level would see.\n\nBut with women, it's all mixed up.  They end up reporting a mixture of super advanced, but also very primitive beginner's experiences.\n\nWomen can have horrible motivations the same as men, but those also are of a different nature.\n\nLike Patricia who's gotten mixed up with Miles, trying to create her own \"lifestyle\" based on con men she believes she can work with.  But no actual magic.\n\nWomen and men are simply \"different animals\" when it comes to learning sorcery.\n\nI'm hoping we can come to understand the mistakes people make, and instead of confronting them just show a cartoon that makes fun of obvious bad behavior and promotes good behavior.\n\nIt's a rather tall order however, even when what needs to be done seems obvious over in Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt's easy to think you have clarity, when spirits and magical sights are floating above you.\n\nAt the very least, it would be nice not to have  to wrestle angry men to the ground.\n\nOr make a woman cry because you didn't respect her account of things and destroyed her hopes of finding a supportive community.\n\nCholita's become a reader of my social media lately, so I occasionally get an earful from her about how I dash everyone's hopes and dreams just so I can declare myself king.\n\nPossibly motivated in part, by remnants of cleargreen people she still knows.\n\nOf course they don't like me! No need to even explain why.  That's part of our biggest problem.\n\nBut each time Cholita assaults me with accusations, the dark energy I pick up is astonishing in its effect.\n\nIt's almost as if women automatically manipulate men to get them to behave as they need them to, using dark energy.  To \"change their direction\".\n\nSome kind of biological role perhaps.  Don Juan once commented that men often use the energy of a woman to make complete changes in life.\n\nDump the old wife, get a hot car, buy a better hairpiece, and get a sexy young girlfriend.\n\nAnd the girlfriends know  what's going on, but don't care.\n\nAs long as the sports car is headed the direction they want it to go.\n\nWe're chimps in cages, driven mad.\n\nAll the horrible behavior is because we no longer explore the unknown looking for food, running into real spirits who adopt us and teach us magic.  We have nothing real to look forward to.\n\nStuck in a social cage where we've been told what's important in life is to set up a good mating relationship so we can reproduce, and the system can continue.\n\nIt's a depressing point of view to convey to new people because they're still hooked on the idea that they need to find the love of their life.\n\nOr the hottest sex possible.\n\nBut anyone utterly obsessed with their brainwashing would completely give that up, if they came across an actual magical object which could allow them passage anywhere in the universe.\n\nThat's more \"real\" than all the social customs in the world.\n\nIf this post seems a little gloomy, Carlos did that from time to time.\n\nIt was in response to him running into petty tyrants in his student population, and sincerely wanting to find a way to get through to them.\n\nLet me back off, because what I'm trying to convey here is a bit too abstract.\n\nLet's take Mel Gibson as an example.\n\nWho made that amazing movie with a glimpse into the violent world of the Toltecs and Mayans.\n\nBut also, the quintessential \"buddy cop\" movie.\n\nHe was so likeable!\n\nThen one day he was driving down Malibu Canyon road, got stopped for obviously erratic driving, and then cursed the cop using paranoid anti-semitic language.\n\nWhen he should have just turned on the old \"Mel charm\"!\n\nCompletely out of character for what people know of him.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIt was muscle memory.  His father figure had behaved like that in front of him as a small child, and implanted that kind of ugly hatred into his muscle memory's \"mood controls\".\n\nHis muscle memory tried to drive the cop away with a huge roar.\n\nIt doesn't just control our muscles.  It also gives us the \"correct attitude\" for a task.\n\nIt wouldn't work if it couldn't do that, and even move the assemblage point a bit too.\n\nIt can shape shift you.\n\nThe point being here, that reprogramming our muscle memory's attitude and assemblage point shifting ability is what we need to do, if we want to make effective cartoons.\n\nTo undo the \"Mel Gibson's racist father figure\" programming.  Shouldn't be impossible, because he's not really like that.\n\nWe need to promote silence above all else, but that can be done by showing how you can train the muscles to help out there.\n\nMuscle memory can also be trained to produce silence!  It just needs a lot of repetition to cause that. Thus the tensegrity.\n\nCarlos explained this early on but it was so puzzling to people, they didn't get it.\n\nHe started with single movements, and then seemed unhappy with the results so he came up with the long forms.\n\nIt was announced by the chacmools as a breakthrough.\n\nWith the explanation that as long as we were struggling to remember the long sequences, we couldn't be fantasizing and thinking the whole time.  We could get silent with that aid.\n\nBut actually, I caught a glimpse of Carlos not liking that explanation.  It was just the best he could do at their level.\n\nIt's not at all what is happening.\n\nPeople can very easily talk to themselves in their head and remember the next move.\n\nThat's NOT going to train your muscle memory to be silent.\n\nInstead it will train you to be a faker.\n\nThe fastest way to train muscle memory is through pain, or a dangerous situation.\n\nOddly, dangerous situations are also used by lineages, to get the double of their apprentices to come around.\n\nThat's mind boggling if you think about it too much!\n\nThe \"danger\" can even be merely a huge fuss in the environment, like the angry father figure of Mel cursing all jews.  My theory is that kids have a \"wide awake\" muscle memory, which is far easier to train that that of adults.\n\nEven pretend violence goes into their muscle memory fast!\n\nBut even faster is the \"hand on a hot stove\" effect.\n\nJust 2 times and your muscle memory learns to go into action fast when that situation is detected.\n\nWithout pain or danger, you have to train muscle memory though endless repetition.\n\nAsian martial arts use that.\n\nWe're trying to get the tensegrity to work, to retrain our muscles to produce silence.\n\nThrough repetition.\n\nWith visual rewards as the motivation.\n\nThe puffs, inorganic being visits, remote viewing, dream bubbles.\n\nAll of those are the \"why you should work hard\" part of our attempts.\n\nAll of the books of Carlos were filled with that type of magical reward.\n\nHe hooked us.\n\nSo we know how to help people learn, although it's a bit linear for women.\n\nBut they're used to that.\n\nCholita's a prime example.  Once she needed a better door on one outdoor part of our house.\n\nThe old one had  deteriorated   from the outdoor weather of 60 years.\n\nI bought the best sheet metal door you could get, with built in weather stripping, and spent hours making everything perfect so as to please her. The wall around the door jam was kind of funky.\n\nBut I had to run an errand for 1 hour before it was finished.  And it still had 8 hours of patching up and painting to go.\n\nWhen I got back it was all done.\n\nCompletely wrong, gaps everywhere, she'd left out screws it surely must have needed, and even used tape over the secondary lock hole in the door instead of the metal plate it came with.\n\nShe was so frustrated with my slow linear process, that she just took it over.\n\nNaturally I snuck back later when she wasn't looking, and tried to fix the things I felt were completely wrong about it.\n\nAfter doing that I pointed it out to Cholita as she walked by it a few days later.\n\nShe looked at it and said, \"No one looks at that!  And who wants someone that picky wandering around your home?\"\n\nMy linear idea of how to put up a good door, didn't match what she really wanted in the first place.  To get that job done as fast as possible so she could lock me out of that space.\n\nThe motivations of men and women are different.\n\nBut one thing works for both.\n\nColorful glowing, magical lights.\n\nLike the \"chakras\".\n\nThose satisfy both men and women.\n\nIt's probably some primal \"food variety\" urge at work there.  As if the Chakras were an armful of colorful fruit you found wandering around in the wilds, which you bring back to please your mate.\n\nIt works!\n\nThe women visualize how they can self-soothe themselves when needed, by sitting cross-legged with their eyes closed, and summoning that vision.\n\nMen visualize how much power they will gain over others, once they are a superior being who can see and explain and expand, on those chakra lights.\n\nCompletely different motivations.  Women like them the way they like beautiful flowers. If they can learn to see that, it's like having an immortal bouquet of beautiful flowers right there in your hands.\n\nMen like them like they'd like a new powerful weapon.  With a highly ornamented symbolic handle.\n\nAnd so the Yoga system uses them as a marketing ploy.\n\nDown the street is such a business. A \"Tai Chi And Yoga\" store, with a big poster of the chakra man, basking in his superiority.\n\nI'll put that in a cartoon and have Marko the boy obsess over it, only to find it's Shaman Bob running that con. Maybe a Korean version of Bob, since that franchise I mentioned is also a Korean Vitamin store.\n\nBecause despite the fact that no such thing as the chakras really exists,  it's still a flattering thing to see.\n\nIt means you made provable progress along the delusions Yogis pitch to students, to get them to pay on a regular basis.\n\nAnd it's something you can really see!\n\nIt won't be perfect.  But out of self-flattery you won't mention that little detail to others, when you tell them of your great \"chakra vision\".\n\nThe whole idea that you would see something like that perfect painting of the superior Yogi being sitting cross-legged, filled with all colors the rainbow energizing him and giving him magical powers, is a clueless idea of what reality is.\n\nIt doesn't work that way at all. We don't live in that make believe blissful Yogi universe.\n\nAnd wouldn't want to!  How boring.  Nothing but humanness and greed.\n\nWhat's really happening here is the infamous \"evil clown effect\".\n\nOr \"The tragedy of the new seer who saw an Eagle\".\n\nAnd now we're all stuck with it.\n\nThe evil clown effect, where hearing inorganic beings (IOBs) can appear in that scary form, causing it to happen more often, also applies to \"spiritual visions\".\n\nIt's just an extra push to aunt Intienda (explained later), to let you have the rum filled chocolate barrels.\n\nAnd it's more insidious than an evil clown.\n\nIt's a self-flattering vision, instead of one amplified by fear.\n\nRather than run for your life like you would from an evil clown, you embrace that delusion and it traps you even more.\n\nIt's an evil clown in disguise!\n\nIf the second attention begins to manifest, perhaps by repeating a mantra or even by visualizing a \"Golden Buddha\" on your head, the second attention activates up at that green line.\n\nWith your eyes closed and repeated attempts, you're bound to have a little \"vision\"\n\nThat's just how things work in the second attention.\n\nThat's how a little kid in the bathtub can fly his plastic toy airplane over \"the ocean\", fighting WW2 Baron Von Evil for control of Germany.\n\nAnd actually see that!  Little kids can see their imaginings, because their assemblage points are looser, and they don't have the raging internal dialogue.\n\nIn the far reaches of that second attention realm, you can even visit heaven or talk to God.\n\nBut only when you can do that over and over again can you even begin to think you understand what's really happening.\n\nUnfortunately those motivated by gain or greed, don't care if they can see it over and over again.\n\nSo they never  understand what's really going on there.\n\nAs seers, that's what we want.  To understand how and why.\n\nNot what.\n\n\"What\" is in the realm of the endless weird things you can learn to do, shifting sideways at the depth of the green line on the J curve.\n\nI like to joke you could literally make yourself a flying carpet, just a bit further down in the red zone.\n\nAnd it's absolutely true.\n\nBut the amount of work would be astonishing if no one had done that before, and you'd miss out on the natural flow of magic as you move the assemblage point.  The universe itself tries to lure you to go further,  with rewards.\n\nIf you pre-describe a specific sight, like \"chakras\", you set up attention seeking as the goal.\n\nUsing a visual image alone.\n\nOf course at advanced stages you can literally be surrounded by a phantom disco dance floor, with spinning mirror balls and colored beam spotlights flashing all around.\n\nFully awake, with your eyes open!  Screw lamed closed eye meditation visions!  Those are too susceptible to dozing off and lying to yourself about an ordinary dream.\n\nAdvanced use of silence to activate the second attention produces experiences so far beyond a few silly balls of rainbow light you force yourself to agree are inside you, that the excitement of \"chakras\" seems really silly.\n\nBut those divert the minds of students, and cause them to seek something other than knowledge.\n\nSelf-flattery.  The promise of future human attention.\n\nThey self flatter with whatever they perceived in the second attention, via the evil clown effect where what you heard influences what dream vision materializes.\n\nAnd you can't talk them down from it.  Lost to Hindu con artists.\n\nThe men because the feel one step closer to dominating those around them.\n\nAnd the women because it's potentially a new self-soothing tool in their arsenal, to fight off the negative moods that come about as their assemblage point is pushed horizontally against their will by their monthly cycle.\n\nWhich can threaten to break up the dubious \"loving\" lifestyle they have forced themselves into.\n\nEven Cholita fears that being horrible to me, will someday cause me to toss her out. Tonight she even made me promise to warn her first.\n\nBoth the man and the woman are obsessed with their relationship to other people, within the limiting rules of the river of shit social order.\n\nOur job is maybe to get people to see long term goals, instead of looking for self-flattering objects.\n\nConvey the absurdity of having a \"Golden Buddha\" on your head.\n\nDo those things poop from time to time, like a parrot?\n\nReduce the self-flattery potential of such obvious decoys.\n\nWhich is precisely what I just tried to do right here in this post, in order to point out how much easier it will be with a good cartoon instead of all these words.\n\nPeople will argue against words, using words. And they'll gloss over them, if it threatens their self-flattery delusion.\n\nBut a cartoon simply \"is\" what happened to the characters in it.\n\nNo threat if done well. Just a lesson that sinks in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Self Flattery Objects (SFOs)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"joc0kpp1vmoa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joc0kpp1vmoa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6ffad007e5a8bbaa307742617b1931b8b32fed1"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joc0kpp1vmoa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b0c9897a4212ba064a1082aff429b0a2d45075f"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joc0kpp1vmoa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9492334c8d6eb4f064a3e70af5fccfad37810033"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joc0kpp1vmoa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c48c56944d2d75ff19e996ea4e93fe5ef66aa8d"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joc0kpp1vmoa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dca6c9a9104f0aa2225b5b76e4426568535d9172"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/joc0kpp1vmoa1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672ea9d46b143b3994bc64587737d51c069eef5b"}, "id": "joc0kpp1vmoa1"}}, "name": "t3_11vcn6o", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kYzC5jPyESDIErCR-aiXJQSSGkiiAF-hub21qPcjJ7M.jpg", "edited": 1679772366.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1679204329.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/joc0kpp1vmoa1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=672ea9d46b143b3994bc64587737d51c069eef5b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/joc0kpp1vmoa1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=672ea9d46b143b3994bc64587737d51c069eef5b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a reader around at least 6 months, mostly making trouble and commenting often with nothing useful to say,  an obvious &amp;quot;bad player username&amp;quot;,  who returned yesterday after a short absence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And tried to figure out how to introduce the idea that he could &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, and had identified a lineage out there running around in the mountains east of most of the Indian reservations around here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow he managed to make it look like he was participating and learning in here, when in fact he seemed to be so utterly clueless that he was still completely uneducated on the horrors of the pretend Castaneda community, which nearly caused us to lose everything Carlos tried to give us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We almost lost magic!

We have nothing real to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuck in a social cage where we&amp;#39;ve been told what&amp;#39;s important in life is to set up a good mating relationship so we can reproduce, and the system can continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a depressing point of view to convey to new people because they&amp;#39;re still hooked on the idea that they need to find the love of their life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the hottest sex possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But anyone utterly obsessed with their brainwashing would completely give that up, if they came across an actual magical object which could allow them passage anywhere in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s more &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; than all the social customs in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this post seems a little gloomy, Carlos did that from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was in response to him running into petty tyrants in his student population, and sincerely wanting to find a way to get through to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me back off, because what I&amp;#39;m trying to convey here is a bit too abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take Mel Gibson as an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who made that amazing movie with a glimpse into the violent world of the Toltecs and Mayans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also, the quintessential &amp;quot;buddy cop&amp;quot; movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was so likeable!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one day he was driving down Malibu Canyon road, got stopped for obviously erratic driving, and then cursed the cop using paranoid anti-semitic language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he should have just turned on the old &amp;quot;Mel charm&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Completely out of character for what people know of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was muscle memory.  His father figure had behaved like that in front of him as a small child, and implanted that kind of ugly hatred into his muscle memory&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;mood controls&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His muscle memory tried to drive the cop away with a huge roar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t just control our muscles.  It also gives us the &amp;quot;correct attitude&amp;quot; for a task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;#39;t work if it couldn&amp;#39;t do that, and even move the assemblage point a bit too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can shape shift you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point being here, that reprogramming our muscle memory&amp;#39;s attitude and assemblage point shifting ability is what we need to do, if we want to make effective cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To undo the &amp;quot;Mel Gibson&amp;#39;s racist father figure&amp;quot; programming.  Shouldn&amp;#39;t be impossible, because he&amp;#39;s not really like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to promote silence above all else, but that can be done by showing how you can train the muscles to help out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Muscle memory can also be trained to produce silence!  It just needs a lot of repetition to cause that. Thus the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos explained this early on but it was so puzzling to people, they didn&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started with single movements, and then seemed unhappy with the results so he came up with the long forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was announced by the chacmools as a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the explanation that as long as we were struggling to remember the long sequences, we couldn&amp;#39;t be fantasizing and thinking the whole time.  We could get silent with that aid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But actually, I caught a glimpse of Carlos not liking that explanation.  It was just the best he could do at their level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not at all what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People can very easily talk to themselves in their head and remember the next move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s NOT going to train your muscle memory to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead it will train you to be a faker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to train muscle memory is through pain, or a dangerous situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, dangerous situations are also used by lineages, to get the double of their apprentices to come around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s mind boggling if you think about it too much!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;danger&amp;quot; can even be merely a huge fuss in the environment, like the angry father figure of Mel cursing all jews.  My theory is that kids have a &amp;quot;wide awake&amp;quot; muscle memory, which is far easier to train that that of adults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even pretend violence goes into their muscle memory fast!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even faster is the &amp;quot;hand on a hot stove&amp;quot; effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just 2 times and your muscle memory learns to go into action fast when that situation is detected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without pain or danger, you have to train muscle memory though endless repetition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asian martial arts use that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to get the tensegrity to work, to retrain our muscles to produce silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through repetition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With visual rewards as the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs, inorganic being visits, remote viewing, dream bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those are the &amp;quot;why you should work hard&amp;quot; part of our attempts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the books of Carlos were filled with that type of magical reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hooked us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we know how to help people learn, although it&amp;#39;s a bit linear for women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re used to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s a prime example.  Once she needed a better door on one outdoor part of our house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old one had  deteriorated   from the outdoor weather of 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought the best sheet metal door you could get, with built in weather stripping, and spent hours making everything perfect so as to please her. The wall around the door jam was kind of funky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had to run an errand for 1 hour before it was finished.  And it still had 8 hours of patching up and painting to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back it was all done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Completely wrong, gaps everywhere, she&amp;#39;d left out screws it surely must have needed, and even used tape over the secondary lock hole in the door instead of the metal plate it came with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was so frustrated with my slow linear process, that she just took it over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally I snuck back later when she wasn&amp;#39;t looking, and tried to fix the things I felt were completely wrong about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After doing that I pointed it out to Cholita as she walked by it a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked at it and said, &amp;quot;No one looks at that!  And who wants someone that picky wandering around your home?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My linear idea of how to put up a good door, didn&amp;#39;t match what she really wanted in the first place.  To get that job done as fast as possible so she could lock me out of that space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The motivations of men and women are different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one thing works for both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Colorful glowing, magical lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the &amp;quot;chakras&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those satisfy both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s probably some primal &amp;quot;food variety&amp;quot; urge at work there.  As if the Chakras were an armful of colorful fruit you found wandering around in the wilds, which you bring back to please your mate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women visualize how they can self-soothe themselves when needed, by sitting cross-legged with their eyes closed, and summoning that vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men visualize how much power they will gain over others, once they are a superior being who can see and explain and expand, on those chakra lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Completely different motivations.  Women like them the way they like beautiful flowers. If they can learn to see that, it&amp;#39;s like having an immortal bouquet of beautiful flowers right there in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men like them like they&amp;#39;d like a new powerful weapon.  With a highly ornamented symbolic handle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so the Yoga system uses them as a marketing ploy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Down the street is such a business. A &amp;quot;Tai Chi And Yoga&amp;quot; store, with a big poster of the chakra man, basking in his superiority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll put that in a cartoon and have Marko the boy obsess over it, only to find it&amp;#39;s Shaman Bob running that con. Maybe a Korean version of Bob, since that franchise I mentioned is also a Korean Vitamin store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because despite the fact that no such thing as the chakras really exists,  it&amp;#39;s still a flattering thing to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means you made provable progress along the delusions Yogis pitch to students, to get them to pay on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s something you can really see!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t be perfect.  But out of self-flattery you won&amp;#39;t mention that little detail to others, when you tell them of your great &amp;quot;chakra vision&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole idea that you would see something like that perfect painting of the superior Yogi being sitting cross-legged, filled with all colors the rainbow energizing him and giving him magical powers, is a clueless idea of what reality is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way at all. We don&amp;#39;t live in that make believe blissful Yogi universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And wouldn&amp;#39;t want to!  How boring.  Nothing but humanness and greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s really happening here is the infamous &amp;quot;evil clown effect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;The tragedy of the new seer who saw an Eagle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now we&amp;#39;re all stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The evil clown effect, where hearing inorganic beings (IOBs) can appear in that scary form, causing it to happen more often, also applies to &amp;quot;spiritual visions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just an extra push to aunt Intienda (explained later), to let you have the rum filled chocolate barrels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s more insidious than an evil clown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a self-flattering vision, instead of one amplified by fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than run for your life like you would from an evil clown, you embrace that delusion and it traps you even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an evil clown in disguise!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the second attention begins to manifest, perhaps by repeating a mantra or even by visualizing a &amp;quot;Golden Buddha&amp;quot; on your head, the second attention activates up at that green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With your eyes closed and repeated attempts, you&amp;#39;re bound to have a little &amp;quot;vision&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just how things work in the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how a little kid in the bathtub can fly his plastic toy airplane over &amp;quot;the ocean&amp;quot;, fighting WW2 Baron Von Evil for control of Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And actually see that!  Little kids can see their imaginings, because their assemblage points are looser, and they don&amp;#39;t have the raging internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the far reaches of that second attention realm, you can even visit heaven or talk to God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only when you can do that over and over again can you even begin to think you understand what&amp;#39;s really happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately those motivated by gain or greed, don&amp;#39;t care if they can see it over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they never  understand what&amp;#39;s really going on there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As seers, that&amp;#39;s what we want.  To understand how and why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not what.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;quot; is in the realm of the endless weird things you can learn to do, shifting sideways at the depth of the green line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to joke you could literally make yourself a flying carpet, just a bit further down in the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the amount of work would be astonishing if no one had done that before, and you&amp;#39;d miss out on the natural flow of magic as you move the assemblage point.  The universe itself tries to lure you to go further,  with rewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you pre-describe a specific sight, like &amp;quot;chakras&amp;quot;, you set up attention seeking as the goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using a visual image alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course at advanced stages you can literally be surrounded by a phantom disco dance floor, with spinning mirror balls and colored beam spotlights flashing all around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fully awake, with your eyes open!  Screw lamed closed eye meditation visions!  Those are too susceptible to dozing off and lying to yourself about an ordinary dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced use of silence to activate the second attention produces experiences so far beyond a few silly balls of rainbow light you force yourself to agree are inside you, that the excitement of &amp;quot;chakras&amp;quot; seems really silly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those divert the minds of students, and cause them to seek something other than knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self-flattery.  The promise of future human attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They self flatter with whatever they perceived in the second attention, via the evil clown effect where what you heard influences what dream vision materializes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t talk them down from it.  Lost to Hindu con artists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men because the feel one step closer to dominating those around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the women because it&amp;#39;s potentially a new self-soothing tool in their arsenal, to fight off the negative moods that come about as their assemblage point is pushed horizontally against their will by their monthly cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which can threaten to break up the dubious &amp;quot;loving&amp;quot; lifestyle they have forced themselves into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Cholita fears that being horrible to me, will someday cause me to toss her out. Tonight she even made me promise to warn her first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both the man and the woman are obsessed with their relationship to other people, within the limiting rules of the river of shit social order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our job is maybe to get people to see long term goals, instead of looking for self-flattering objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Convey the absurdity of having a &amp;quot;Golden Buddha&amp;quot; on your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do those things poop from time to time, like a parrot?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reduce the self-flattery potential of such obvious decoys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is precisely what I just tried to do right here in this post, in order to point out how much easier it will be with a good cartoon instead of all these words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People will argue against words, using words. And they&amp;#39;ll gloss over them, if it threatens their self-flattery delusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a cartoon simply &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; what happened to the characters in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No threat if done well. Just a lesson that sinks in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "11vcn6o", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 19, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11vcn6o/self_flattery_objects_sfos/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/11vcn6o/self_flattery_objects_sfos/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1679204329.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jctknj9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1679233374.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jctg1qq", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Darn...\n\nYou disproved my claim those \"Silence Stones\" are actually useless.\n\nI stand corrected.\n\nThey're a storage container for the intent of silence!\n\nAll the more reason to bury them when done.\n\nBeginners:  Your entire reality is created by intent, tilting the balance for which emanations get the glow of your awareness.\n\nThere are 20,000 possible versions of reality, in any direction you look.\n\nIt's like you're going into that HUGE candy store in Laguna, CA, near the amazing beaches they have.\n\nIt's VAST!

A wave of panic and excitement erased the world I was looking at, and I went into a strange place where I kept seeing death skulls and horrible images, but really nothing of importance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trying to see if I could send a message out or travel, but I don&amp;#39;t think I was able to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in this state as long as the preceeding things, but it is too vague to describe and I was having trouble with silence because i was getting scared, so I started doing the life saver pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down and saw a crack of light in front of me that was light bleed from under the door that should have been behind me on the south wall. Somehow, I had moved 180 degrees and ten feet closer to the door, and the cloth I usually block the light with was moved aside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door thinking the usual two plus hours had gone by, but I checked the time and I had been in the Darkroom only twenty minutes. This is the first time I have traveled when in the sleepwalking state, and also, the first time I have had a major time dialation!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11vcn6o/self_flattery_objects_sfos/jke62jl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1684259218.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_11vcn6o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jefxo1e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1680288622.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jefgfmh", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Good thing it's not the kind Cholita has!\n\nThe paranoid kind.\n\nI can't remember why, but I thought I could get away with buying her some beautiful Ranunculus flowers.

Last night I saw an appendage emerge from my torso that looked like a stalk with a flower on the end. The stalk was a chalky color but the flower was black inside with tiny flecks of red similar to a red metallic affect some car paints have. Each dot of red was a point of light and had a three dimensional affect. The center went down deep. I couldn't tell if it was a portal or an exit. At one point it seemed to emit bluish energy like a fountain. I felt extremely indifferent to this and yet also like I was dreaming.\n\nI feel like I am dreaming because the first time it happened, I succumbed to a illogical obsession with a cramp in my left big toe. I felt like if I could not relieve this cramp, something dire energetically would happen not only to me, but the entire universe. I pulled on my big toe in real life until I almost twisted it causing the cramp to be a sprain and I limped around for days on it afterwards. I cannot describe the logic of my obsession other than it was the illogic of a dream that occurred while my body was still capable of moving in the Darkroom as if awake.\n\nHave you ever felt this dreaming while awake state?

Now instead of not knowing if I am going to go past that point where instead of just seeing puffs, then playing with puffs, I am able to get to a point where there are all kinds of crazy things going on in the Darkroom, and it is happening everytime I go in, awake, using a Tensegrity routine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that is different for me as a woman that I have not heard described is that there is a point when I am moving around doing Tensegrity and my face goes slack, my body keeps moving, but it feels like I have falken asleep in my head and entered into a dream while still moving around in a standing position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The visuals start to become fantastical. Last night I saw an appendage emerge from my torso that looked like a stalk with a flower on the end. The stalk was a chalky color but the flower was black inside with tiny flecks of red similar to a red metallic affect some car paints have. Each dot of red was a point of light and had a three dimensional affect. The center went down deep. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if it was a portal or an exit. At one point it seemed to emit bluish energy like a fountain. I felt extremely indifferent to this and yet also like I was dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I am dreaming because the first time it happened, I succumbed to a illogical obsession with a cramp in my left big toe. I felt like if I could not relieve this cramp, something dire energetically would happen not only to me, but the entire universe. I pulled on my big toe in real life until I almost twisted it causing the cramp to be a sprain and I limped around for days on it afterwards. I cannot describe the logic of my obsession other than it was the illogic of a dream that occurred while my body was still capable of moving in the Darkroom as if awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt this dreaming while awake state? Am I just describing something that is universal but using different words?

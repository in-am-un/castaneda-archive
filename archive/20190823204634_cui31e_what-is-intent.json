It\u2019s a function of our neural net, if you\u2019re technically minded. We can\u2019t afford to pay attention to everything around us, so *intent* fills in details in such a manner that it\u2019s manageable.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for the brain to do that.  Just send a little signal to represent a whole bunch of stuff, because that\u2019s always the signal that ends up being sent in this particular case.\n\nIn AI, they have a name for it.  It's a technology distinct from other forms of neural nets, and it's a great idea.\n\nDon't make a neural net large enough to be intelligent on its own. That takes too much hardware. 10,000 pounds by my last calculation.\n\nInstead, have a point that lights up when a specific thing is present.  With millions of such points, you can skip a whole lot of neural connections.\n\nHumans do that too.  We have the neurons to understand everything, but that's wasteful.  Once something is understood, it can be represented with a lot less information. Using that representation instead of all the \"real\" data uses up a lot less energy.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s a tree over there, so don\u2019t try to walk through it.  You don\u2019t need to know how smooth the trunk is, or what is the shape of the leaves. Just \u201ctree\u201d is enough for the current situation.\n\nEntire regions can be summed up in this manner without the need to pay much attention.   Let\u2019s say you\u2019re out hunting for your car. You forgot where you parked it on a busy LA street. You scan your head looking around and realize, all this over here is just landscaping. You didn\u2019t park in the bushes, so you can rule out that area.\n\nIt goes on and on. Most of our daily interactions are phantasmagorical, despite our absolute belief that we're experiencing it all.\n\nCarlos called it, \u201cglossing\u201d. If you\u2019ve ever driven home and not remembered any of the journey, that\u2019s a classic case of glossing.\n\nIt\u2019s also glossing when you close the door and lock the deadbolt with your key, walk 15 feet, and then can\u2019t remember if you did in fact lock it. You have to go back and check.\n\nIn Carlos' books where don Genaro and don  Juan tease him because he believes he's driving his car, when something else is clearly going on, that's glossing.\n\nGlossing can ignore things, but it can also replace things.\n\nCarlos thought glossing was a bad thing, and I understand why. His students were so wrapped up in their internal dialogues that he could tell them something very important and they didn\u2019t actually hear what he said. They heard what they thought he said.\n\nI don\u2019t see it as so bad, because it\u2019s a tool you can use. You can intend it, then make use of it in waking dreaming.\n\nFor instance, there\u2019s a level of silence where you can manifest anything. You\u2019ll know when you reach there, because the entire room will be overlaid with dreaming images. Subtle details that can\u2019t possibly be there, but which are.  You can't deny it when you look around.\n\nFrom that level you can merely reach behind the bed,  intending to pick something up, then bring it in front of you to see what you have.\n\n*Intent* will come up with something for you.  It's like a challenge to *intent*.\n\nThat\u2019s one form of *intending*. But it also has an element of glossing, as you\u2019ll find out if you learn this technique.  That gold bar you just grabbed?  Don't expect it to stick around. It's only a gloss of a gold bar.\n\nAnother way to use *intending*, is to direct waking dreams. If you can sit in a chair with eyes closed and summon dreaming images, you can very gently intend to see a re-run of your favorite old TV show.  Then drop it from your mind, and relax to see what happens.\n\nYou really have to drop it. You can't keep dwelling on it.  And don\u2019t expect an immediate reaction. Intent has a delay at times.  It\u2019s like the request has to ripple through the pond to reach an observer somewhere,  and then the images will be sent back to you.\n\nBut the way to summon *intent* to help you learn to be silent, is to want to be silent, to think about being silent,  and to visualize whatever you know about the process. Then drop it.  Go outside and shout \u201cINTENT!!!\u201d.\n\nHow does that work?   I have no idea.\n\nBut last night while staring into dark energy, trying to figure out if Cholita might be capable of opening dreaming portals, I felt a familiar presence.\n\nIt was a presence I haven\u2019t felt since I was a child.  The last time, I was outside with friends playing a game of tag.\n\nI was in the first grade. The weather was amazing, but being children, we didn\u2019t notice that. We played for such a long time that twilight set in.\n\nA lamp near the house where we were playing seemed to be glowing very brightly. There was a friendly warm yellow hue over the whole area.\n\nI felt something watching us.  It was a good thing.  I could feel it.\n\n*It* wanted to play the game too.\n\nIn my opinion, that\u2019s intent.  I hope we can gain more energetic mass, and find out if that\u2019s true.\n\nWhy does *intent* want to play the game with us?\n\nHow could we get so lucky?\n\nEdited: twice", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What is Intent?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cui31e", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1566593871.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1566585994.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get silent, it\u2019s a pretty good idea to get &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; on your side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what the heck is that anyway?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is the ability of your consciousness to fill in missing details.

But if you inject your own thoughts, or even expectations, you get static.  You still get &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s not recognizable.  Could be, it&amp;#39;s a mix of a lot of things, running around in your mind, all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita used to behave like that when we drove around. If I didn&amp;#39;t influence her, she might start to tell stories about Carlos and the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if I interrupted her at all, she was silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My own &amp;quot;lost pass&amp;quot; notes are in the wiki, and have many tensegrity passes never taught in any workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t figure out when Reni would have learned passes that Carlos didn&amp;#39;t show us in the next private class.  It was pretty clear he worked them out with the Chacmools and others, and then taught them in private class to refine them further.  He even said so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That Reni has a bunch, especially long forms,  which didn&amp;#39;t follow that pattern would not make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes more sense is that like me, she&amp;#39;s too lazy to go back and relearn the old magical passes from her own notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s easier to just make up new ones. Or order someone else to make up a new one, the way she was said to order Nyei to make up a magical pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping an AI can eventually read old magical pass notes, and produce a video of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially for magical passes we have more than one person&amp;#39;s notes for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_cui31e", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/cui31e/what_is_intent/kr4ur59/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1708349791.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kr1n0uy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Werejaguare", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kr1hsfu", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_s9spn5sm", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I'll aim for the good thing.

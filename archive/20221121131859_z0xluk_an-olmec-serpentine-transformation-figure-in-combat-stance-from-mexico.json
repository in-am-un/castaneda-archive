Intent is everything, right? Now I do believe that different power plants gets your AP to move to different zone, I believe firmly that some of them can get you straight to SK mode, Unity station. But ultimately I agree with you, this is not sustainable you can\u2019t take it everyday that doesn\u2019t makes sens at all but it can light your path to these places, your AP becomes loser from these experiences allowing you to move further by itself without taking anything. Your view about life becomes much less solid but yeah, these power plants are just there to show you that real magic is possible and for me the true goal is what you describe in here, get to SK completely sober and fully awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_z0xluk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/z0xluk/an_olmec_serpentine_transformation_figure_in/ix99nsq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1669056823.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1669056823.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ix95atm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ix8ia10", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Let me ask YOU a question!\n\nHow come Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson, and their entire posse, aren't all sorcerers?\n\nThey've gotten higher than we'll ever get, on much better \"shit\".\n\nNot to put down the Snoop and Willie.

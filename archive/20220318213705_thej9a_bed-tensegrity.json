In fact, I often do.\n\nThe \"running man\" series become a gold mine if you have to do that.\n\nNot for the start.  Just for when you move your assemblage point super far, are surrounded by spirits, but because you never got out of bed you're fighting sleep.\n\nThere can be benefits to a half asleep state when forcing silence, but you have to be fairly advanced not to nod off in that state.\n\nBut even then, if you succumb to sleep  you go in with silence!  So the resulting dreams are \"real\" according to don  Juan.\n\nJust pick your favorite movements.\n\nOk...  the ones you actually remember are always the \"favorites\".\n\nAnd then modify them a bit.\n\nTake that one where you turn around and look behind you on the floor, while your palms also face the floor. Just outside where you are looking.  Behind you on the floor.\n\nImpossible in bed.  Unless you only turn to the right and don't worry about looking \"behind you\".\n\nYou're only trying to look the direction you want the assemblage point to go.\n\nAnd as long as it's \"downish\", that's good.\n\nJust do the right side first, so the last one  you do is \"left shifting tendency\".\n\nRight shifts are kind of moody.\n\nThe \"Tensegrity Gods\" will be angry for your insolence, but when they realize you have real magic going on, with puffs of purple floating in the air, and you playing with them as much as you can in your restricted situation, they'll get into the mood.\n\nI recommend wearing the Scrooge cap.\n\n*Intent* will find it amusing.\n\nAnd if you have an inorganic being, they are fully capable of moving the tassel.  I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out they love tassels!\n\nIn fact, I hope some day to see Jadey giving a \"bed tensegrity workshop\", in some magical canyon up at Sedona.\n\nBeds lined up, with one at the front to teach from.\n\n\"Free Scrooge Cap\" with admission!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Kachora Follower?](https://preview.redd.it/btmzqf8gb7o81.png?width=236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a606a016bd6f691ea4e6a937867651a6e1ab27b)\n\nFrankly, I never liked the \"atmosphere\" at Tensegrity workshops.\n\nI understand why it had to be that way,  but it was like a funeral.\n\nI'd show up and wonder, \"Who died?\"\n\nThen when the Chacmools dressed in black, I'd look at Kylie and figure it was best not to ask.\n\nI still think she had that \"Kylie machine gun\" hidden somewhere on her person, to keep Carlos safe.\n\nSo what can you do,  practicing \"Bed Tensegrity\" while moving the assemblage point?\n\nBesides summon the puffs of color.  And stuff them, to build the energy body.  And then to lure the double to join in on the bed.\n\nI mean, in all seriousness.  \n\nWith the double on the bed with you.  \n\nThey like you to be a bit \"inactive\" when they fully come out.\n\nSeriously?\n\nYou can drive your bed through the wall, and down the street.\n\nI used to have a hard time finding parking along Santa Monica Blvd.   I'd head straight for Dance Home.  But along the way, I'd see a store I wanted to stop at.  I was 12 hours early anyway.\n\nThen I'd realize, \"This surely isn't real, so I suppose it's ok to double park.\"\n\nBut I still got honked at.\n\nWhich insured a \"scout cop\" would show up.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a pitfall to bed tensegrity.\n\nIf you practice past the 1 hour mark, you'll get sleepy.\n\nNot walking around puts an upper limit on practice time.\n\nSo you can make it down to the deep red zone, but not up the front.\n\nAt least, not with \"bed tensegrity\".\n\nNow, can you use the band on the \"bed hat\" as the blindfold, in case you can't make a dark room?\n\nShame on you...

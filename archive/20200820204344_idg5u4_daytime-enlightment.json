They are with me on this place, I am guiding them on meditation and history of the surrounding area. I practice some medication with them... After about 1 hour everyone started to just move to another location. My kids came close to me and the smaller started to crying.... At this moment something made me feel to ignore him (or ignore Mr. mosquito) and to meditate. Eventually he left to the car that was just a few feet away. My other children went with him to the vehicle. My gazing became more powerful (or felt it like it) nature sounds became more clear and all was harmonic... it was a perfect synchronization of nature. At a moment I realize that I was feeling like inside a cocoon or a veil, like a protection film. I also realized that the sounds of people were less distinctive that the nature sounds.

Then I though... naaaaaah maybe it was a butterfly, because it seems a lil bit bigger that a mosquito. Then I heard it, it was a frecking mosquito, only one. \n\nBefore I continue with my conversation with Mr. mosquito I need to brought to light a letter that i received from my dad.  \nSo my dad is in federal prison, he is on life sentence for trafficking. They have been on lock down for the past about 6 month now. He is alone in his cell (BTW he is the one who wanted me to start reading and understanding sorcery and the teachings of Carlos Castaneda) He has read all books and have practice magical passes before ( He has a story on how his cardio at 60 years old was better than some of the youngsters in prison). Saying all this the letter contained a conversation he had with a mosquito for 3 days on or around 4 Aug. My first encounter with Mr. Mosquito was on the 1st of Aug. That day I ask intent to give me answers for my dad, but then I put intention on figuring out what the hell is Mr. mosquito (eventually did). That day last time I saw Mr. Mosquito was..... mmmmmmhhh i just realized, he came in my field of view from the center to the left and I felt he just went around my left shoulder until he disappear my field of view, this was on 1st AUG... So in my dad letter he reference the conversation he had with the mosquitoes at the cell.\n\nOk, yesterday when I did realized that that was Mr. mosquito and I had the feeling that was the same mosquito who visit my dad, I started talking to him, told him to suck some of my blood for energy, but he needs to send a message to my dad. He bug me for a lil bit longer then left... only one mosquito... Mr. Mosquito...\n\nThe coolest thing with this situation is that I only can talk to my dad about every week or two (i guess is not that cool hahhaah) and confirm any weird thing we both experienced during that time we don't talk. He called today and told him about yesterdays experience (my dad is aware of Mr. mosquito) but did not told him about the message. I want to see where this take us.

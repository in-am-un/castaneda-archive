Not a &amp;quot;sacred scroll&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not what &amp;quot;The Great Poobah&amp;quot; did, and we all have to worship him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what some crummy Mexicans did, 8000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they were almost as bad as the Cartel people are now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they had real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s NOT what the &amp;quot;sages&amp;quot; said. The old sorcerers could not even read or write.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what you yourself can see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visually!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what moves your assemblage point during &amp;quot;darkroom practice&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the golden rule:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything you watch in perfect darkness while your internal dialogue is greatly reduced, a thing which &amp;quot;cannot possibly be there&amp;quot;, will move your assemblage point down along that J curve path Carlos showed us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching stuff that &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t possibly be there&amp;quot; is the fastest way to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assemblage point moves, to try to &amp;quot;tune it in&amp;quot; better.  Because it&amp;#39;s impossible! So it tries to adjust to make it &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot;. Which it likely never will be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEN, rule #2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Call it the &amp;quot;shapeshifter&amp;#39;s rule&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything that can&amp;#39;t possibly be there, which you treat as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, will move the assemblage point sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not down along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sideways at the current depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you will literally turn into a werewolf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or like the old seers, a WereJaguar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again, no sacred scrolls in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one wants your money in any way, so no one makes up stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really will learn, to shapeshift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into any animal or insect, or even into spirit forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can leave the house and chase neighborhood cats at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there other ways to move the assemblage point?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes!  Some good. Like gazing at fern leaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some totally lame, like Buddhist meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some accidental, like &amp;quot;rituals&amp;quot; or repetitious movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But so far none as DAZZLING as darkroom practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re always hoping for anything new though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drugs move it too, but you can&amp;#39;t possibly learn sorcery, using drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one ever has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_fb6tfw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fb6tfw/i_dont_understand_anything_on_this_sub/jbfsu87/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1678302392.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1678302392.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbfmepw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Thrasympmachus", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fj46ng4", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_8njlxifz", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "What can move the assemblage point of a man?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jbfmepw", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can move the assemblage point of a man?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_fb6tfw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fb6tfw/i_dont_understand_anything_on_this_sub/jbfmepw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1678299944.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1678299944.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fj46ng4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1583001489.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fj354u3", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Female?

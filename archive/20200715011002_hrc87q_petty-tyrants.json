It consists of six elements that interplay with one another.\n\nFive of them are called the attributes of warriorship: control, discipline, forbearance, timing, and will. They pertain to the world of the warrior who is fighting to lose self-importance. The sixth element, which is perhaps the most important of all, pertains to the outside world and is called the petty tyrant.\n\nHe looked at me as if silently asking me whether or not I had understood. \"I'm really mystified,\" I said. \"You keep on saying that la Gorda is the petty tyrant of my life. Just what is a petty tyrant?\"\n\n\"A petty tyrant is a tormentor,\" he replied. \"Someone who either holds the power of life and death over warriors or simply annoys them to distraction.\"\n\nDon Juan had a beaming smile as he spoke to me. He said that the new seers developed their own classification of petty tyrants; although the concept is one of their most serious and important findings, the new seers had a sense of humor about it. He assured me that there was a tinge of malicious humor in every one of their classifications, because humor was the only means of counteracting the compulsion of human awareness to take inventories and to make cumbersome classifications.\n\nThe new seers, in accordance with their practice, saw fit to head their classification with the primal source of energy, the one and only ruler in the universe, and they called it simply the tyrant. The rest of the despots and authoritarians were found to be, naturally, infinitely below the category of tyrant. Compared to the source of everything, the most fearsome, tyrannical men are buffoons; consequently, they were classified as petty tyrants, pinches tiranos.\n\nHe said that there were two subclasses of minor petty tyrants. The first subclass consisted of the petty tyrants who persecute and inflict misery but without actually causing anybody's death.\n\nThey were called little petty tyrants, pinches tiranitos. The second consisted of the petty tyrants who are only exasperating and bothersome to no end. They were called small-fry petty tyrants, repinches tiranitos, or teensy-weensy petty tyrants, pinches tiranitos chiquititos.\n\nI thought his classifications were ludicrous. I was sure that he was improvising the Spanish terms. I asked him if that was so.\n\n\"Not at all,\" he replied with an amused expression. \"The new seers were great ones for classifications. Genaro is doubtless one of the greatest; if you'd observe him carefully, you'd realize exactly how the new seers feel about their classifications.\"\n\nHe laughed uproariously at my confusion when I asked him if he was pulling my leg.\n\n\"I wouldn't dream of doing that,\" he said, smiling. \"Genaro may do that, but not I, especially when I know how you feel about classifications. It's just that the new seers were terribly irreverent.\"\n\nHe added that the little petty tyrants are further divided into four categories. One that torments with brutality and violence. Another that does it by creating unbearable apprehension through deviousness. Another which oppresses with sadness. And the last, which torments by making warriors rage.\n\n\"La Gorda is in a class of her own,\" he added. \"She is an acting, small-fry petty tyrant. She annoys you to pieces and makes you rage. She even slaps you. With all that she is teaching you detachment.\"\n\n\"That's not possible!\" I protested.\n\n\"You haven't yet put together all the ingredients of the new seers' strategy,\" he said. \"Once you do that, you'll know how efficient and clever is the device of using a petty tyrant. I would certainly say that the strategy not only gets rid of self-importance; it also prepares warriors for the final realization that impeccability is the only thing that counts in the path of knowledge.\"\n\nHe said that what the new seers had in mind was a deadly maneuver in which the petty tyrant is like a mountain peak and the attributes of warriorship are like climbers who meet at the summit.\n\n\"Usually, only four attributes are played,\" he went on. \"The fifth, will, is always saved for an ultimate confrontation, when warriors are facing the firing squad, so to speak.\"\n\n\"Why is it done that way?\"\n\n\"Because will belongs to another sphere, the unknown. The other four belong to the known, exactly where the petty tyrants are lodged. In fact, what turns human beings into petty tyrants is precisely the obsessive manipulation of the known.\"\n\nDon Juan explained that the interplay of all the five attributes of warriorship is done only by seers who are also impeccable warriors and have mastery over will. Such an interplay is a supreme maneuver that cannot be performed on the daily human stage.\n\n\"Four attributes are all that is needed to deal with the worst of petty tyrants,\" he continued. \"Provided, of course, that a petty tyrant has been found. As I said, the petty tyrant is the outside element, the one we cannot control and the element that is perhaps the most important of them all.\n\nMy benefactor used to say that the warrior who stumbles on a petty tyrant is a lucky one. He meant that you're fortunate if you come upon one in your path, because if you don't, you have to go out and look for one.\"\n\nHe explained that one of the greatest accomplishments of the seers of the Conquest was a construct he called the three-phase progression. By understanding the nature of man, they were able to reach the incontestable conclusion that if seers can hold their own in facing petty tyrants, they can certainly face the unknown with impunity, and then they can even stand the presence of the unknowable.\n\n\"The average man's reaction is to think that the order of that statement should be reversed,\" he went on. \"A seer who can hold his own in the face of the unknown can certainly face petty tyrants. But that's not so. What destroyed the superb seers of ancient times was that assumption.\n\nWe know better now. We know that nothing can temper the spirit of a warrior as much as the challenge of dealing with impossible people in positions of power. Only under those conditions can warriors acquire the sobriety and serenity to stand the pressure of the unknowable.\"\n\nI vociferously disagreed with him. I told him that in my opinion tyrants can only render their victims helpless or make them as brutal as they themselves are. I pointed out that countless studies had been done on the effects of physical and psychological torture on such victims.\n\n\"The difference is in something you just said,\" he retorted. \"They are victims, not warriors. Once I felt just as you do. I'll tell you what made me change, but first let's go back again to what I said about the Conquest. The seers of that time couldn't have found a better ground. The Spaniards were the petty tyrants who tested the seers' skills to the limit; after dealing with the conquerors, the seers were capable of facing anything. They were the lucky ones. At that time there were petty tyrants everywhere.\n\n\"After all those marvelous years of abundance things changed a great deal. Petty tyrants never again had that scope; it was only during those times that their authority was unlimited. The perfect ingredient for the making of a superb seer is a petty tyrant with unlimited prerogatives.\n\n\"In our times, unfortunately, seers have to go to extremes to find a worthy one. Most of the time they have to be satisfied with very small fry.\"\n\n\"Did you find a petty tyrant yourself, don Juan?\"\n\n\"I was lucky. A king-size one found me. At the time, though, I felt like you; I couldn't consider myself fortunate.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Petty Tyrants", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"hed8grgddlh51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hed8grgddlh51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f71c687dcd5e214229156d7a72e7e3c8b02f5feb"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hed8grgddlh51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3263ace9dc6ba39e2db3d9266d7224525445cf1"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hed8grgddlh51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1764a26f1853063bdda7ec22bdff033552267e3"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hed8grgddlh51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9b28cf7c47795aa278bab92f0aa4213669c36a2"}, {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hed8grgddlh51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69de674c20b81f3a330df64d2436dcc02a97dc7"}, {"y": 810, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hed8grgddlh51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6004e98c088ac6149bdd6dd041513ab264993f8"}], "s": {"y": 3024, "x": 4032, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hed8grgddlh51.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cdd28424b3ae2ee43766b1fac1ca170bd4c22a1"}, "id": "hed8grgddlh51"}}, "name": "t3_hrc87q", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Cb8mHUMd0WxjPTrCM5oL3_4sKwgjAYmDFejYO-QXhg8.jpg", "edited": 1597682723.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1594768202.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hed8grgddlh51.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9cdd28424b3ae2ee43766b1fac1ca170bd4c22a1\"&gt;A Regretable Cholita Spell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inspirational quote time, in honor of Cholita who&amp;#39;s an even better &amp;quot;teacher&amp;quot; than la Gorda:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**************&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He (don Juan) said that the most effective strategy was worked out by the seers of the Conquest, the unquestionable masters of stalking.

Not permanently.  But for a very long time. Like days even.\n\nBut I suspect that\u2019ll take 2 or 3 years of enjoying the ability to shift it, NIGHTLY, before it\u2019s loose enough to stay there.\n\nLast night for instance, I forced myself silent in darkness, did some tensegrity until I could see a decent light show, then sat up on the bed to summon dreaming images.\n\nMy plan was to do that, with eyes open,  and then close my eyes and summon them that way too. \n\n So that I was headed towards sleeping dreaming, instead of dreaming awake.\n\nMy goal was to end up on the other end of the wall, in my living room.  And then try to verify it was my real living room.\n\nThe way Cholita can do it. \n\n I wanted to push something so I could verify it was pushed, in the morning.\n\nSleeping dreaming seems very different from dreaming awake, but in the long run they can\u2019t be all that dissimilar. One has to lead to the other.\n\nAnd it works!  I found that out the night before.\n\nI could turn around, and end up in a sleeping dream, directly from dreaming awake.\n\nExcept, there's a blank out barrier.  \n\nIt seems impossible to cross, without losing lucidity. \n\nI\u2019d end up in sleeping dreaming for sure, but it would take me several minutes to realize it, and that only when the dream faded.\n\nI guess that barrier in dreaming applies no matter how you get into it.  \n\nBut last night I had a new idea on how to change that.\n\nAnd two things happened just before I got a chance to try it out.\n\nFirst, my little fairy returned.  I was so happy to see her, I spoke out loud:\n\n\u201cThere you are!!!  Don\u2019t you know how much I miss you???\u201d\n\nSomehow she notified me, she hadn\u2019t been squashed by Cholita.\n\nCholita had squashed me. \n\nOtherwise, she was just fine, thank you.  She smiled and expanded a little.\n\nI tried to \u201cunsquash\u201d myself, and it worked. \n\nShe bloomed into full strength, and I was able to get her to sit on my hand again. \n\n She was malformed, but 3D.  She looked like a deflated balloon made of blue light.\n\nLater, sitting on the bed in anticipation of summoning dreams by increasing my silence deepness,  I heard that familiar pop.\n\nThe one don Juan said, indicated the second attention had come out. A bone at the base of the neck shifts, and you hear a click or pop. Your skull tilts a tiny bit as a result.\n\nOthers in here have heard it too.\n\nExcept that, a hand came down from the ceiling, cut 4 places around my shoulders with some kind of tool, and I heard 4 pops instead of one.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain that one. \n\nBut all hell broke loose at that point, so I guess something \u201ccame out\u201d.\n\nI had summoned a group of 3 or 4 people, standing in the corner of my bedroom.\n\nI was shocked how bright it was. \n\nIt was good enough for any Harry Potter movie special effect.\n\nThey seemed to be discussing something, then turned to the left and walked up a mountain trail.\n\nAt that point, they\u2019d left my bedroom.  But I could catch a glimpse of the trail anyway.\n\nI closed my eyes, thinking if I follow them up the trail, I\u2019ll enter into dreaming.\n\nI came to minutes later, with a memory of a conversation in my head. We\u2019d been talking up on that mountain.\n\nI realized I was still in sleeping dreaming. I was in a blank place. But clearly asleep, and lucid.\n\nI tried to will myself into the living room.\n\n2 square objects materialized in front of me, the room spun around, and I discovered the 2 objects were decorations Cholita had in the living room.\n\nI was there!  In sleeping dreaming, in my own home.\n\nBut I was stuck. The 2 objects Cholita had placed there, held me in place. I couldn't move at all. I was just standing up, looking at my living room.  But it was so dark, it felt like a ghost room.\n\nAll the rest of the night, I was stuck.  \n\nBut high as a kite.\n\nI was so high, I had no doubt that\u2019s what Samadhi, bliss, enlightenment, all of them feel like.\n\nEarlier than night I\u2019d felt rather badly.  Bad enough that I wondered if I'd even be able to practice for very long.\n\nBut in just a couple of hours I moved my assemblage point, and remained in pure bliss.\n\nI\u2019m still there.  I expect it to last all day.\n\nThat's how you can learn to keep it without weed. \n\nHard work.\n\nI'd say, it's no more difficult than learning to bench press 350.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1585072699.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fldosqy", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;how I can maintain that awareness without weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to learn to move your own assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pick a method. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, it&amp;#39;ll stay where you move it.

Like days even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suspect that\u2019ll take 2 or 3 years of enjoying the ability to shift it, NIGHTLY, before it\u2019s loose enough to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night for instance, I forced myself silent in darkness, did some tensegrity until I could see a decent light show, then sat up on the bed to summon dreaming images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan was to do that, with eyes open,  and then close my eyes and summon them that way too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that I was headed towards sleeping dreaming, instead of dreaming awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goal was to end up on the other end of the wall, in my living room.  And then try to verify it was my real living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way Cholita can do it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to push something so I could verify it was pushed, in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sleeping dreaming seems very different from dreaming awake, but in the long run they can\u2019t be all that dissimilar. One has to lead to the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it works!  I found that out the night before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could turn around, and end up in a sleeping dream, directly from dreaming awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, there&amp;#39;s a blank out barrier.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems impossible to cross, without losing lucidity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d end up in sleeping dreaming for sure, but it would take me several minutes to realize it, and that only when the dream faded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess that barrier in dreaming applies no matter how you get into it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But last night I had a new idea on how to change that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And two things happened just before I got a chance to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, my little fairy returned.  I was so happy to see her, I spoke out loud:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere you are!!!  Don\u2019t you know how much I miss you???\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow she notified me, she hadn\u2019t been squashed by Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had squashed me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, she was just fine, thank you.  She smiled and expanded a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to \u201cunsquash\u201d myself, and it worked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She bloomed into full strength, and I was able to get her to sit on my hand again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was malformed, but 3D.  She looked like a deflated balloon made of blue light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, sitting on the bed in anticipation of summoning dreams by increasing my silence deepness,  I heard that familiar pop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one don Juan said, indicated the second attention had come out. A bone at the base of the neck shifts, and you hear a click or pop. Your skull tilts a tiny bit as a result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others in here have heard it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that, a hand came down from the ceiling, cut 4 places around my shoulders with some kind of tool, and I heard 4 pops instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t ask me to explain that one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all hell broke loose at that point, so I guess something \u201ccame out\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had summoned a group of 3 or 4 people, standing in the corner of my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shocked how bright it was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was good enough for any Harry Potter movie special effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They seemed to be discussing something, then turned to the left and walked up a mountain trail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, they\u2019d left my bedroom.  But I could catch a glimpse of the trail anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I closed my eyes, thinking if I follow them up the trail, I\u2019ll enter into dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came to minutes later, with a memory of a conversation in my head. We\u2019d been talking up on that mountain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized I was still in sleeping dreaming. I was in a blank place. But clearly asleep, and lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to will myself into the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 square objects materialized in front of me, the room spun around, and I discovered the 2 objects were decorations Cholita had in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was there!  In sleeping dreaming, in my own home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was stuck. The 2 objects Cholita had placed there, held me in place. I couldn&amp;#39;t move at all. I was just standing up, looking at my living room.  But it was so dark, it felt like a ghost room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the rest of the night, I was stuck.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But high as a kite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so high, I had no doubt that\u2019s what Samadhi, bliss, enlightenment, all of them feel like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier than night I\u2019d felt rather badly.  Bad enough that I wondered if I&amp;#39;d even be able to practice for very long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in just a couple of hours I moved my assemblage point, and remained in pure bliss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m still there.  I expect it to last all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how you can learn to keep it without weed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say, it&amp;#39;s no more difficult than learning to bench press 350.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_fnyib3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fnyib3/any_thoughts_on_this/fldosqy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1585068778.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1585068778.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fldxuig", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "mywavylife", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fldwopj", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_tk44n73", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thanks for all the details.

They get enraged if I tell them the truth.  NOTHING else out there is real magic.\n\nThat's because they've already set up a franchise of their own, and those words make it obvious they're a fraud.\n\nSo they attack.\n\nThe same nonsense that dominates the blue line on the J curve, in the river of shit.\n\nThey make \"meaningful\" arguments which fool some readers who just got here.\n\nBut don't fool anyone else.\n\nI got a vision analyzing this last night as I got up to practice darkroom, only to discover I was already in Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt was so intense, I skipped doing tensegrity to watch it.\n\nAnd so odd, I had to quote a passage from the books, so that the pretenders reading this feed don't jump in to \"correct\" things with some bogus inventory items from the first few books, ignoring all the rest and the other side publications of Carlos.\n\nSeeing is very weird!\n\nAt first I suppose.\n\nIf it settles down, I haven't seen it yet.\n\nIn private classes Carlos nearly repeated the events surrounding the passage you read in this picture.\n\nThe one where don Juan is inviting Carlos to try to \"see\" for the first time we read about in his books so far.\n\nHe knows Carlos has put endless time into learning to be silent, mostly \"the right way of walking\" and gazing,  and is fully capable of it.\n\nSomething bad player readers of his books ignore.  How much Carlos work put in, all along the way.\n\nAngry men would rather take drugs, and then pretend it's the same thing.  Or do some \"Buddha meditation techniques\" and claim that's the same too.\n\nBut it's not even close.\n\nAnd when don Juan invited him to try to see, Carlos \"saw\" something so strange, he worried it's not \"the real thing\".\n\nIn private classes Carlos decided it was finally time for him to do that same thing with us. Perhaps 2-3 years into them from when I arrived.\n\nSorcery teaching \"repeats\" each generation, due to a fluke in how the emanations work.\n\nIt's vital to \"hook yourself\" to something from past sorcerers, if you want to get pulled along by the spirit.\n\nIf you hook yourself to Lao Tzu, The Buddha, Yogananda, or even Enoch, you're royally screwed.\n\nWrong intent path!\n\nYou'll just end up cheating people out of money, based on crappy meager magic you can barely even repeat.  But you'll lie, so everyone will think at least you can do your crappy magic on a regular basis.\n\nWhen you can't.\n\nCarlos was so involved in trying to \"connect\" us to the trail of the 8000 year old Olmec Seers, which passed through the Toltecs thousands of years later, that even stupid things like naming his 3 Tensegrity teacher women \"Chacmools\" was on his list.\n\nAnd he created \"cover stories\" for others in private classes. Which seemed like \"deception\" to outsiders, but are in fact mandatory to follow the intent of the seers of Ancient Mexico.\n\nYou need any connection you can manufacturer!\n\nOtherwise it's hopeless.\n\nSo Carlos repeated what don Juan had done. He even asked us to try to see, just as don Juan had done with him.\n\nWe all stopped and paused in private class,  while everyone tried to \"see\".\n\nI did.\n\nMy silence levels at that point were sufficient to pull it off standing right there, while Carlos waited for all of us.\n\nI closed my eyes to do it, not having the advantage of darkness and not being as silent as Carlos could be.\n\nThe room became absolutely jet black.  So black that I could see it had 3 dimensions. It wasn't \"flat\" like the inside of my closed eyelids.\n\nA tiny white dot in the distance noticed me and flew over.\n\nIt was a gnat.\n\nAlmost surely Little Smoke in my opinion.\n\nCarlos had \"help\" for us to see, even if he hadn't told us so.\n\nHis allies were waiting to find out if anyone could get silent enough, so that they could \"help\".\n\nI was surprised how that could possibly be seeing, until the gnat spoke:\n\n\"Hello!  My name is Paul.\"\n\nAnd the shock was great enough to kick me back into my internal dialogue, at which point the vision stopped.\n\nCarlos asked us all if we had seen after the pause was over.\n\nAnd I told him I had.\n\nHe asked me to describe it.\n\nI was reluctant.\n\n\"Felix\" is actually named Paul Gutsmith.\n\nThe former private class member trying to steal from our community now, by going on tour all over the world if someone else will pay for it, to explain that \"Carlos went bad\".\n\nSo you should follow him now.\n\nBut I had to report it to Carlos.\n\nEveryone laughed when they heard that there was a gnat named Paul.\n\nCarlos looked a bit puzzled,  or maybe it was a ploy to get the audience to pay attention.\n\nAnd then agreed that was indeed \"seeing\".\n\nIt was the first of three \"blank checks\" he handed out to me.\n\nCarlos did that sort of thing on a regular basis, and even had a couple of lectures about it.  Which are lost in time. No one took notes on that.\n\nHYL got a \"blank check\" too, but cashed it in for himself.\n\nNot to help others. As Carlos actually intended, when it came to blank checks.\n\nThose are \"energy\".\n\nIf you read that passage in the picture, you'll see it was tame compared to what Carlos saw.\n\nBut last night with latent traces of thoughts from pondering the mysteries of why bad men endlessly attack this subreddit,  how to put a stop to it, and how much harm it actually does,  a game show host materialized to explain it to me from \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nI wasn't actually thinking about it. I was silent.\n\nBut I'd pondered it enough during the day that those \"emanations\" were still glowing with latent awareness.\n\nAnd so in Silent Knowledge mode, meaning my assemblage point was at the end of the J curve as you see in that picture, there was enough \"concern\" left,  to \"select the topic for Silent Knowledge\".\n\nI have no idea how the \"presentation method\" turned into a cocaine snorting game show host from the late 70s.\n\nI have to say, my seeing was weirder than that passage from the books.\n\nIt's in detail over in the advanced subreddit, and includes a story about Cholita's double coming out during grocery shopping, and literally \"pushing around\" a store clerk.\n\nWho's thought process removed the magical part of the memory of being pushed by Cholita.\n\nNot something you can get over, a true miracle right before your eyes,  if you can remember it.\n\nFortunately, our mind blocks it.  I suppose the event is so traumatic it disrupts short term memory, and the event it erased from the mind.\n\nLeaving only circumstances surrounding it.\n\nPerhaps witches know about this, and feel free to exploit their magic in the normal world, safe from anyone remembering what happened as long as the magic was extremely advanced.\n\nThe store clerk was floated off the ground and transported very roughly,  a few feet away from Cholita. Because she interrupted Cholita's concentration.\n\nLittle Smoke used to like to follow Cholita around when she was shopping, to examine the items she touched more closely.  Looking for energy crumbs I suspect.\n\nI've seen it quite a few times.\n\nUsually Cholita only needs a single finger to lift me into the air, using her double.\n\nI've tried looking down to see if my tonal body is still standing on the floor, but it's nowhere to be seen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Too Angry Here for Advanced Things", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"cwrd8w5k0x2a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f712d0cbbab1ae891bda5d0c409f54bd04933d5"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1635ba127ac769f65fd1e81f8c4579c60fec712a"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=633f019b163c8552af8151fa3f76aa0523c904e7"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f8bc057468b26905417d6bf84721a37ea26d93b"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d21b6ca1a63204b4742c686d58c71521c15e2103"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6839be90ced220936e371856da3d693c71e8afc7"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a550ec64084df7d25c6a862954820c433f439b1"}, "id": "cwrd8w5k0x2a1"}}, "name": "t3_z7yp5r", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/CUg8V0xHx--EB6fIEd-S5U7va_r6vLu2z_KRTvhLfIA.jpg", "edited": 1669764115.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1669739399.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5a550ec64084df7d25c6a862954820c433f439b1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cwrd8w5k0x2a1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5a550ec64084df7d25c6a862954820c433f439b1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This subreddit has too many angry men trying to figure out how to keep pretending their fake sorcery is the real thing.

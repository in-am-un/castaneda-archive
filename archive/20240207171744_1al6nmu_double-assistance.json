When pressed to explain something everyone knew must be a really cool story, they'd often only say, \"It's non-linear\".\n\nMeaning, they didn't feel like explaining it because we'd misunderstand and it would most likely only discourage us.\n\nBut now there's cartoons!\n\nCartoons are also \"non-linear\" if you want them to be.\n\nAnd so you see here how my double came to help me out the other night, because I had taken a position on the bed that Carlos told us to use, in order to get \"healing rest\".\n\nPlease don't rigidly copy this position.\n\nCarlos didn't exactly have the Chacmools lay down on a giant bed to show us the proper \"Tensegrity position\" for healing rest.\n\nI can see it now.

Back in the day you didn't really want to see the \"inner circle\" women all together on a giant bed!\n\nFortunately the men were left out of those doings.\n\nAnd frankly, it's not pleasant to have your head pressed to the side like that. So hopefully I've got something wrong in my interpretation of the position Carlos told us to use.\n\nBut never rule out making the tonal (physical body) uncomfortable or embarrassed, in order to lure the double to visit.\n\nCarlos even tried \"Naked Not-Doing\" classes at the end, hoping to get some of the women's doubles to show up, so he could have a \"last chance\" to teach real sorcery to anyone.\n\nHe failed. And told several people so. Not a single person learned actual sorcery, before he was gone.\n\nBut he sent his allies to help, which eventually they did.\n\nThe uncomfortable nature of this body position might actually be why your double could show up to help.\n\nBut will you perceive it?\n\nNot the first 10 times. You'll block it from your mind.\n\nAnd you'll NEVER see it, if you don't learn to move your assemblage point for real.\n\nBut once you can do that you realize what it's done the instant it gets close enough for your energy to overlap with his. Or hers.\n\nThe double's memories mix with yours, and your memories mix with its. And it figures out if there's anything it can do to help.\n\nI've been told there's a little of this in Taisha's last book.\n\nThe double is active! It's not \"out there\" floating in some Chinese ancestor heaven or \"Ascended Masters\" realm, oblivious to your life here on earth.\n\nIt hasn't \"astral projected\" itself into some ludicrous limiting \"gateway\".\n\nIt's here with you, all the time.\n\nIt's inside the same \"egg\" with your physical body energy.\n\nIt's impossible for it to \"project\" out.\n\nAnd it's certainly not your \"soul\".\n\nThe only \"distance\" between the two of you is an illusion created by how the emanations work.\n\nAnd if your double wants to lend you its head, it's perfectly capable of doing so.\n\nWhy that potentially cures food poisoning is not something Carlos explained. But if the pain is gone, you can't help but notice who did that for you.\n\nThe AI would not draw this for me.\n\nApparently \"beheadings\" are on the no-no list for things \"Dall-E\" will draw.\n\nEven ChatGPT was puzzled that I couldn't get Dall-E to draw a head separated from a body. Even if it was a \"happy story\".\n\nBy the way, I got this picture a little wrong.\n\nThe double stands a bit closer to someone, whose double \"just comes around\" from time to time.\n\nCarlos showed that three times in my presence, pointing to the exact spot.\n\nAnd I've seen it twice myself.\n\nNaturally there's no reason the double has to stand even closer to the person, but I didn't want to misrepresent what Carlos showed us.\n\nIt's just a bit too cramped in that cartoon image.\n\n If I'm correct that standing closer is the most common manifestation, that would mean that the double is materializing INSIDE the larger luminous egg.    \n\n\nPerhaps all it does is \"form\" a bit better than usual, and the sorcerer himself is the one who interprets it to be the image of a \"double\".  \n\n\nWe just don't know such details yet.

From there I forced complete silence and just focused on any hypnagogia I could see. The issue I've had with dreaming recently is that I lose lucidity too often, or I'll notice it's a dream and it immediately collapses. Probably has to do with me having too little attention or something but I'll keep working on it. I kept waking up from dreams, and just immediately laying back down and trying again for around half an hr. At some point I decided after waking up to just force silence again and see what I can see after all that entering and exiting dreams.\n\nI noticed immediately that a puff was perfectly visible, and there was a face imprinted on it! The face faded a couple times but kept coming back. I made sure to not react too strongly to it, and keep forcing silence, as a bad habit of mine would be reacting too much and ruining any progress I was making.\n\nThis account, atleast to me, confirmed that shifts from dreaming can still have somewhat of an impact on us when we wake up, making our ap either shifted or making it more flexible I think. This to me means that we can probably get extra practice if we use the period after we wake up to our advantage. Probably shouldn't rely on it ofc since that's a time waisted but it's still good for me to know at least.\n\nThe part of my experience I rlly wanted to bring up was that after looking at the face on the puff in silence for a while, I got the strange sensation that someone was pushing my bed that I was laying on upward. If uve ever shared a bunkbed with someone, it felt like if someone on the bottom bunk was pressing the top bunk (the bed I was on) up. The bed felt like it was only getting higher until suddenly the entire bed felt like it shot up with me still on it really fast. I could feel wind pushing against me, I could hear it too. It felt like I was flying. Beware my eyes were open here, I only saw black bc of the manta mask being on. Immediately once it all calmed down I jumped out of bed to make this post.\n\nNot really sure wtf happened but this was probably one of the coolest experiences I've had in a minute lol.

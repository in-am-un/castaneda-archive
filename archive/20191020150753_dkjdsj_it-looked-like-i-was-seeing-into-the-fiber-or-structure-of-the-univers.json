I've said a few times, if it's a woman I have no idea what's really going on.\n\nMen are stupid compared to women! They manipulate us like children.\n\nThank god...\n\nCholita is fond of making fun of men by saying they expect her to breast feed them.\n\nMy response is always, \u201cYes please :(\u201d\n\nBut I know full well, once they do something like that they own you.\n\nHere's a dangerous thought on women and sorcery.\n\nIt's blasphemy!!!!  So cover your ears if you're under 60.\n\nWhat we saw with Carol Tigg's \"demonstrations\" in Sunday class was in fact typical of sorcery.\n\nI\u2019ll end up trying to do the same with Cholita.\n\nThat's 2 times I've seen that kind of situation. Maybe it's always that way.\n\nCholita has no interest in aggressive male pursuits, like dominating the planet  by spreading sorcery theology.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t give a shit what anyone else does, as long as they aren\u2019t part of the vast Sino-Trumpian conspiracy to hold her down.\n\nOk\u2026 Maybe that part isn\u2019t typical.\n\nBut the attitude likely is.\n\nAnd look at Cleargreen. For 20 years nothing but inspirational quotes, and an attempt to earn a living by creating a community of tensegrity practitioners.\n\nIf you think that isn't so, and there's a secret advanced technique meeting they have on occasion, I don't think so.\n\nI have volunteer scouts all over.  People  are as worried about Carlos' legacy as me.\n\nNone has seen anything like that.\n\nThere's no drive to actually copy every technique Carlos wrote about, to prove that it's worth pursuing.\n\nNo one seems worried about refuting the general internet consensus that Carlos was a fraud.\n\nIt's fine just the way it is!\n\nJust don't read those opinions. You simply have to enjoy swimming in inspirational quotes.\n\nThat's all they want.  Be a good part of the family.\n\nPeople even get black listed for trying to step, even a little bit, outside that plan. I've gotten email about that.\n\nCarlos put the women in charge, and they did what women tend to do. They maintained their kingdom as best they could.\n\nCarlos essentially attracted women around him, then pushed them off in the direction he wanted.  He likely would have preferred them to run on their own power, but maybe that's just not typical of women.\n\nFor newbees, I\u2019ll fill you in on what happened in private classes with Carol Tiggs. And it\u2019s not meant as a criticism. Carol even attended a workshop in 2013, so she stuck around to help.\n\nBut what happened was that after a few years of private classes, or as my memory recalls it, only one, almost the entire Sunday Class had secretly concluded that Carlos might indeed be a little nuts.\n\nAnd maybe some of it was delusional.\n\nIt was because they wanted to see him leap over a house, like don Juan did for Carol. Or summon hell by stomping around in unison, as Genaro did for Carlos.\n\nOr slap them on the back, to make them instantly \"special\".\n\nCarlos never did anything like that.  Possibly because he couldn't.\n\nCarlos of course had been slowly building up the energy bodies of participants, and tinkering with them using his lectures and the edge of his hand on their back. Cholita is a masterpiece!\n\nHe could see to the heart of things (occasionally) and stick a tiny bomb where it would do the most good.\n\nHis tensegrity was designed to be astounding in its scope, but only once you figured out what it really was.\n\nLast night I was trying out the Maui pass. I've been forming balls of energy and tossing them at the inside of \"the wall\".\n\nBut that pass sends them up using a gaze.  I tend to compress them with hands, and use my hands to send them off.\n\nThat Maui pass surely does send the energy balls up, using just one's gaze!  And it pulls you along, changing the second attention's perspective.  It even suggests that you could pass through the floor, using that movement.\n\nI suspect all of the tensegrity moves include some gift like that.  Maybe the gifts are nothing more than something Carlos learned to do, and he's trying to pass on his cool technique collection.\n\nThat's just not obvious if you're only going through the moves, and can't *see* the energy.\n\nCarlos' teaching was superb, but for whatever reason he didn\u2019t seem to be able to give any magic demonstrations in class.  He just couldn't activate our second attention, so that we were conscious of it.\n\nI guess we could refer back to don Juan trying to show the Nagual to several apprentices, and each one seeing something different.\n\nDon Juan said something about how he didn\u2019t have enough energy to make them all see the same thing.\n\nThis also relates back to what does an inorganic being look like?\n\nA collection of lights, that\u2019s what it actually looks like, here in our realm and in these bodies.\n\nBut what you see is your worst fear, or greatest love, or most exciting stranger.\n\nThe second attention is so flexible, you can\u2019t really force it to see or do anything.\n\nSo Carlos, not having enough energy to give us a clear view of the second attention, brought Carol Tiggs to class on 2 occasions.  Nagual women have tons of energy, even if they don't use it for much.\n\nI tried the same thing with Jenna, and the 4 women I gathered after 2 years of stalking.\n\nDidn't work out, but it was the same thing Carlos was doing.  He tried to use the energy of a double woman, to move people's assemblage points using his own *intent*.\n\nHe said that Carol wanted to show us something.\n\nAnd it worked!\n\nI got the brown tunnel that Carlos describes as the inorganic beings realm. I just fell right into it, when Carol did her thing to me.  I was sitting in there, wondering how the tunnel was dug.\n\n(Typical nerd).\n\nCorey practically fainted the other time Carol demonstrated.  Someone posted class notes on that.\n\nHe was assembling another world!\n\nBut the knowledge that would have let him realize that wasn\u2019t present, so he was afraid of embarrassing himself in class by keeling over.\n\nAll in all, the general consensus about Carol's demonstrations was that Carlos had put her up to it, and it failed.  A cheap stage magician act was what some were saying.\n\nBut what was really happening was likely that Carlos used the energy of a woman, to do what he didn\u2019t have enough energy to accomplish.\n\nI have the same plans for Cholita.\n\nIt\u2019s not because Carol or Cholita couldn\u2019t manage to help people on their own.\n\nIt\u2019s just that, they aren\u2019t interested in that.\n\nYou can get them to buddy up to you, knowing you\u2019re a sorcerer. And they might even adopt the lifestyle of sorcerers, as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with their interests.\n\nBut to go around actively fighting to manage apprentices, is less attractive to them.\n\nSo here\u2019s the blasphemy.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, Zuleica and Zoila lived where they did, because they couldn\u2019t fend for themselves. They were too mad to survive in society.\n\nStrays,  with nowhere else to go.\n\nMarta took care of them in that house, but don Juan and Silvio Manuel were the ones behind it.\n\nThey got Marta to take care of the westerly women.  It wasn't actually her idea.\n\nWith those powerful women living there, don Juan could bring \u201cguests\u201d like young Carlos and La Gorda, and Zuleica was happy to entertain them with her dreaming skills.  They were in her kingdom now, and she wanted to show it in the best light.\n\nBut on her own, she wouldn\u2019t have done it.\n\nWhat about witches who teach other witches, the Wiccans might say.  That's the same as don Juan teaching apprentices.  So my argument is full of hot air.\n\nIt might indeed be. It's just speculation at this point.\n\nAnd Wiccan's,  I have nothing against you.  You're more powerful then the men.\n\nI read, \"Witchcraft Today\" three times!\n\nAnd I loved the cover. At age 12 back then, with no internet, sexy pictures were difficult to acquire.\n\nBut, despite that book which formed the initial basis of Wicca, written by a man I might add, women just don't have the same goals as men.\n\nThey'll do the orgies (I'm kind of surprised by that). But chasing after world domination one apprentice at a time, just isn't their thing.  If they teach another woman, it's likely because they enjoy her company.\n\nAnd Carlos' books have a heavy male point of view. People got hooked based on that view.\n\nWe assumed that the women and men in his books were both part of exactly the same quest.\n\nI'm just saying, it isn't so.  And it would be good for the clueless men to keep that in mind.\n\nYou have to buy the curtains.  It's not negotiable.  That's all I'm saying.\n\nEdit:\n\nIf you read this and didn't notice that La Gorda is an exception to my argument, you need to keep a little more doubt when you read what I write.\n\nIt's all just speculation.  We don't have any actual sorcerers around to answer difficult questions.\n\nBut I wanted to let people in my situation, in the future, know that there's room for morbid speculation.  Maybe Sorcery groups aren't as neat as they seem in Carlos' books. And it's normal.", "edited": 1571685292.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f4m5s2g", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I&amp;#39;ve said a few times, if it&amp;#39;s a woman I have no idea what&amp;#39;s really going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men are stupid compared to women!

He likely would have preferred them to run on their own power, but maybe that&amp;#39;s just not typical of women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For newbees, I\u2019ll fill you in on what happened in private classes with Carol Tiggs. And it\u2019s not meant as a criticism. Carol even attended a workshop in 2013, so she stuck around to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what happened was that after a few years of private classes, or as my memory recalls it, only one, almost the entire Sunday Class had secretly concluded that Carlos might indeed be a little nuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe some of it was delusional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was because they wanted to see him leap over a house, like don Juan did for Carol. Or summon hell by stomping around in unison, as Genaro did for Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or slap them on the back, to make them instantly &amp;quot;special&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos never did anything like that.  Possibly because he couldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos of course had been slowly building up the energy bodies of participants, and tinkering with them using his lectures and the edge of his hand on their back. Cholita is a masterpiece!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He could see to the heart of things (occasionally) and stick a tiny bomb where it would do the most good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His tensegrity was designed to be astounding in its scope, but only once you figured out what it really was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I was trying out the Maui pass. I&amp;#39;ve been forming balls of energy and tossing them at the inside of &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that pass sends them up using a gaze.  I tend to compress them with hands, and use my hands to send them off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That Maui pass surely does send the energy balls up, using just one&amp;#39;s gaze!  And it pulls you along, changing the second attention&amp;#39;s perspective.  It even suggests that you could pass through the floor, using that movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect all of the tensegrity moves include some gift like that.  Maybe the gifts are nothing more than something Carlos learned to do, and he&amp;#39;s trying to pass on his cool technique collection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just not obvious if you&amp;#39;re only going through the moves, and can&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos&amp;#39; teaching was superb, but for whatever reason he didn\u2019t seem to be able to give any magic demonstrations in class.  He just couldn&amp;#39;t activate our second attention, so that we were conscious of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess we could refer back to don Juan trying to show the Nagual to several apprentices, and each one seeing something different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said something about how he didn\u2019t have enough energy to make them all see the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also relates back to what does an inorganic being look like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A collection of lights, that\u2019s what it actually looks like, here in our realm and in these bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what you see is your worst fear, or greatest love, or most exciting stranger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second attention is so flexible, you can\u2019t really force it to see or do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos, not having enough energy to give us a clear view of the second attention, brought Carol Tiggs to class on 2 occasions.  Nagual women have tons of energy, even if they don&amp;#39;t use it for much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried the same thing with Jenna, and the 4 women I gathered after 2 years of stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t work out, but it was the same thing Carlos was doing.  He tried to use the energy of a double woman, to move people&amp;#39;s assemblage points using his own &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that Carol wanted to show us something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it worked!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the brown tunnel that Carlos describes as the inorganic beings realm. I just fell right into it, when Carol did her thing to me.  I was sitting in there, wondering how the tunnel was dug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Typical nerd).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Corey practically fainted the other time Carol demonstrated.  Someone posted class notes on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was assembling another world!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the knowledge that would have let him realize that wasn\u2019t present, so he was afraid of embarrassing himself in class by keeling over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, the general consensus about Carol&amp;#39;s demonstrations was that Carlos had put her up to it, and it failed.  A cheap stage magician act was what some were saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what was really happening was likely that Carlos used the energy of a woman, to do what he didn\u2019t have enough energy to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the same plans for Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not because Carol or Cholita couldn\u2019t manage to help people on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s just that, they aren\u2019t interested in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get them to buddy up to you, knowing you\u2019re a sorcerer. And they might even adopt the lifestyle of sorcerers, as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with their interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to go around actively fighting to manage apprentices, is less attractive to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here\u2019s the blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe, just maybe, Zuleica and Zoila lived where they did, because they couldn\u2019t fend for themselves. They were too mad to survive in society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strays,  with nowhere else to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marta took care of them in that house, but don Juan and Silvio Manuel were the ones behind it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They got Marta to take care of the westerly women.  It wasn&amp;#39;t actually her idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With those powerful women living there, don Juan could bring \u201cguests\u201d like young Carlos and La Gorda, and Zuleica was happy to entertain them with her dreaming skills.  They were in her kingdom now, and she wanted to show it in the best light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on her own, she wouldn\u2019t have done it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about witches who teach other witches, the Wiccans might say.  That&amp;#39;s the same as don Juan teaching apprentices.  So my argument is full of hot air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might indeed be. It&amp;#39;s just speculation at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Wiccan&amp;#39;s,  I have nothing against you.  You&amp;#39;re more powerful then the men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read, &amp;quot;Witchcraft Today&amp;quot; three times!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I loved the cover. At age 12 back then, with no internet, sexy pictures were difficult to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, despite that book which formed the initial basis of Wicca, written by a man I might add, women just don&amp;#39;t have the same goals as men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll do the orgies (I&amp;#39;m kind of surprised by that). But chasing after world domination one apprentice at a time, just isn&amp;#39;t their thing.  If they teach another woman, it&amp;#39;s likely because they enjoy her company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carlos&amp;#39; books have a heavy male point of view. People got hooked based on that view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We assumed that the women and men in his books were both part of exactly the same quest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just saying, it isn&amp;#39;t so.  And it would be good for the clueless men to keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to buy the curtains.  It&amp;#39;s not negotiable.  That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read this and didn&amp;#39;t notice that La Gorda is an exception to my argument, you need to keep a little more doubt when you read what I write.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all just speculation.  We don&amp;#39;t have any actual sorcerers around to answer difficult questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to let people in my situation, in the future, know that there&amp;#39;s room for morbid speculation.  Maybe Sorcery groups aren&amp;#39;t as neat as they seem in Carlos&amp;#39; books. And it&amp;#39;s normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_dkjdsj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/dkjdsj/it_looked_like_i_was_seeing_into_the_fiber_or/f4m5s2g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1571674782.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1571674782.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f4jakdt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1571615960.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f4hk09y", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;But he didn't experience near enough...\n\nOP was a woman named \"Ashleigh Brazell,\" that's why the language in her DMT trip diary was quite sweet \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udc96.", "edited": 1571624766.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f4jakdt", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But he didn&amp;#39;t experience near enough...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OP was a woman named &amp;quot;Ashleigh Brazell,&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s why the language in her DMT trip diary was quite sweet \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udc96.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_dkjdsj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/dkjdsj/it_looked_like_i_was_seeing_into_the_fiber_or/f4jakdt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1571615960.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f4hk09y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1571592444.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_dkjdsj", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "This is a good example of how our expectations taint our experiences.\n\nI'm not saying his interpretation of the universe is wrong.

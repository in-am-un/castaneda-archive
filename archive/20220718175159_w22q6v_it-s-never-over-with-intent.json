Into \"containers\".\n\nIt makes sense. When intent reskims the emanations, when it selects what will be bundled to make your reality, it uses what's most obvious.\n\nIf you have a raging internal dialogue, it has plenty to use.\n\nIf you remove your internal dialogue, \"stuff to use\" gets harder to find.\n\nWe're trying to reduce the \"stuff\" so low, than we can begin to predict what it will use.\n\nAnd by hooking yourself to the Olmecs, that path is always present for intent to select from.\n\nMagic.\n\nThis is one big reason, we don't make \"Yoga Tensegrity Moves\".\n\nOr use \"Wise Dantien knowledge from China\".\n\nIt contaminates intent.\n\nAnd in the end, when the assemblage point moves away from the blue line, any influence is HUGE.\n\nYou can't afford to be wanting something else other than sorcery. Especially not when the reason you want something else, is so that you can become a famous \"teacher\" with your own \"unique\" material.\n\nLike Dantien to activate the \"will\", so you can show off at waterfalls like Genaro did.\n\nWe actually had a guy like that.  Had the word, \"Zen\" in his user name, and pretended to be a \"comrade\"  until he posted something ludicrous, got called out, and his head exploded.\n\nYou have to \"stick to the path\" if you want to learn sorcery.\n\nBut why?\n\nAnd what does Yoda mean here?\n\nNot what the average person would believe!\n\nHe's talking about INTENT here.\n\nThe Force.\n\nAs Obi Wan liked to remind Luke, \"The Force will ALWAYS be with you.\"\n\nThat's also part of what I'm trying to explain here.\n\nBut I have to use a story to explain it.\n\nI wanted to experiment with creating the same phantom room each time, on demand.\n\nLike the death defier could with his village in Tula.\n\nI was using Tensegrity to move my assemblage point, thinking I could \"do it all by myself\".\n\nBy sheer \"force of will\"!\n\nI misunderstood the situation, and thought \"you just need to move your assemblage point until you gain super powers, then concentrate very hard on what you want!\"\n\nCompletely wrong.\n\nYes, you could do that.\n\nBut we can't.  Being able to \"will\" something happens much later, when your link to intent is cleaner.\n\nAnd when that comes, you'll probably be unable to describe or explain it.\n\nI can't.\n\nBut before then, we're really trying to get intent itself to assist us.\n\nSo I thought I was using combinations of Tensegrity to move faster to the end of the J curve, meaning to put my assemblage point where the Nagual's Blow puts it, but without a nagual around to help.\n\nMeanwhile thinking, \"this is going to allow me to make my phantom room very real\".\n\nWhat I didn't realize is, I was \"intending\"  it to make my phantom room very real.\n\nI could have \"intended\" it to get me the recipe for the best Tacos in the world.\n\nOr anything else.  Intent doesn't judge your intentions!\n\nSo intent noticed my interest in making a \"place that doesn't really exist\" very real, and \"stored\" that into the magical passes.\n\nEven when I was \"slacking off\" doing them, intent made them work as I had originally asked.\n\nIt was so strong, I began to notice it.\n\nIn some ways, I could \"step back\" and watch myself do the forms, and see  the results in the air creating my phantom room piece by piece.\n\nAlmost like, \"Hey, wait for me!!! I'm the one in charge here.\"\n\nBut I wasn't.\n\nOut of curiosity I tried other tensegrity moves, to see what those forms could do. Imagine the \"Gift to Maui\" literally allowing you to travel through outer space, in a blue bubble.\n\nThat's what it does!!!\n\nFor the other tensegrity I was investigating, I didn't associate them with the combination I'd devised to make phantom rooms. Those were \"side projects\".\n\nAnd those other forms DID NOT help make my phantom room more real.  I could see it!\n\nInstead, they did whatever they're supposed to do, according to what Carlos told us.\n\nThey had their own \"intent\" left to us by Carlos.\n\nI quickly realized, something very odd was going on and my combination of tensegrity forms had become \"sentient\".\n\nIt itself, also wanted me to reach the goal.\n\nThis is why the \"Men of Knowledge\" had such complicated rituals to summon magical effects like the talking lizards, or the moth dust which sends mushroom shapes.\n\nThe power plants were just to move the assemblage point, because they did not learn to do that.\n\nIt wasn't good for business to do their magic that way.  Even if they could do away with the drugs, their customers could not.\n\nSo they concentrated on having their own Ally, to do all the heavy work. And the use of power plants to move a customer's assemblage point, with rituals to \"invoke\" the specific intent of that magic type.\n\nBeginners have been confused by bad men out there who claim the power plant contains the spirit. They constantly show up in the subreddit, and I have to \"talk them down\". Away from that bizarre superstition.  We had one just recently!  Wanted to start his own \"group\".\n\nWas so delusional, he believed he could just gather some people, find some power plants, and use what was in this subreddit to rise to glory.\n\nNot only was he delusional from only reading the first books, and hanging out too much in \"shamanism\" subreddits filled with bad men, but he didn't really even want to learn.\n\nHe wanted to teach.  So even if he could be re-taught on it all, he had no path to success. Because he didn't really want to learn.\n\nStill, I tried.  I told him, the spirit is NOT contained in the power plant!\n\nIt's nonsense.\n\n\"Little Smoke\" is a tiny spirit, now looking like a Fairy. I used to see her all the time!\n\nCarlos introduced us, using her favorite hangout at Dance Home.\n\nThe water cooler!\n\nSo more than \"she's contained in the mushroom mixture\", the truth is, little smoke prefers office water coolers.\n\nAnyone who believes the power plants hold the \"spirit\" is never going to get anywhere worth going.\n\nBack then in the books,  Little Smoke usually looked like a moth, or a talking coyote.\n\nBut she is NOT contained in mushrooms.  Those just move the assemblage point.\n\nAnd she can show up without any drugs, as long as the person she visits can move their assemblage point through silence.  At least, to below the shoulder blades.\n\nNow back to the Tensegrity \"storing sentience\".\n\nOr magic.\n\nThat's true of ALL of sorcery.\n\nOf our path in general.\n\nThat's why when you want something impossible, such as to learn to be silent, you go outside and shout \"Intent!!!\"\n\nBy \"wanting silence\", you created a \"container\".\n\nThen by shouting INTENT!,  you got the attention of the spirit, letting it know you were committed.\n\nDon't overemphasize that however, or you'll make intent into a god.\n\nOr cartoon character.\n\nIt's something much more powerful than either of those.\n\nIf God is \"made out of something\", it's intent.\n\nNot his own \"magical goodness\".\n\nIntent is more like gravity.  More like a physical effect.\n\nBut it includes sentience. So it's \"smart gravity\".\n\nYou fall towards what you had told it you wanted to fall towards.\n\nYou can easily learn to \"fill\" your tensegrity forms up with intent.\n\nJust look for the puffs! Be silent in darkness, do the tensegrity, and look for colorful steaks or puffs in the air around you.\n\nSILENCE is the way to see those.\n\nAnd any other \"cool visible magic\" right in your face.  Eventually your darkroom, which needs at least enough room to do \"mashing energy series\", will be FILLED with amazing magic.\n\nFairies, dragons, portals, doorways, forests on the other side of the wall.\n\nThere's NO LIMIT to the magic Tensegrity can bring, when \"intent\" is helping you.\n\nIntent will store that magic into the movements.\n\nBut over time!  Be patient!!!\n\nThat's why Yoda complains to Obi Wan,  about Luke,  \"I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.\"\n\nThat's the second point of \"intent\" usage.\n\nYou are waiting. And you know what you are waiting for.\n\nI suppose you could claim it's \"your will\", and that might be a \"Man of Knowledge\" point of view.\n\nThose guys were superstitious, and liked to think they were doing things because they had \"personal power\".\n\nBut the truth is, you're waiting for intent.\n\nWhat you need is NOT power. It's silence.  Then, you have \"the Force\" as your ally!\n\nIntent!\n\nAnd in particular,  you're waiting for intent to \"store\" into the container you made for it.\n\nTHEN, you can do the magic you sought.\n\nAnd here's the important part.\n\nWhen you ask the lizards a question, the talking lizards from the Devil's Weed ceremony,  you have to let them finish the answer.\n\nA \"good\" apprentice will surely let them finish. BUT, he might think of a different question at the same time, and mess things up.\n\nSo that when the lizards begin to give him the answer, there's another he wanted also.  It's mixed in there, the way it was for Carlos.\n\nAnd while they give the answers, the apprentice notices and says, \"Hey, this isn't working right!  That's not part of my question!!\"\n\nThe lizards stop talking, because the event is \"concluded\".\n\nThe conclusion of the magical event is, \"This isn't working right.\"\n\nIntent doesn't care!  It brings things to a conclusion.\n\nYou're NEVER going to understand the conclusions intent brings things to.\n\nSo it's not going to \"correct\" your misunderstanding.  You always misunderstand!\n\nJust don't \"conclude\" that what you asked intent to do, is impossible.\n\nBecause then it is.\n\nIt's a lot more complicated than just that,  but for the sake of  understanding remember that if you \"conclude\" what you were trying to do, with doubt and claims it can't be done, then it's done.\n\nWith failure.\n\nYou need patience!\n\nIf you try to do something impossible during darkroom as part of a \"project\", keep in mind that it \"stores\" up the same way silence does.\n\nThe horrible and painful failures to get silent one night, produce noticeable progress the next night.\n\nNot enough...  It's not satisfying.\n\nBut it's much like going to the gym.\n\nEach time you use the weights, you get a tiny bit stronger.\n\nThe same happens for silence, even if it hurts horribly on one particular night when you try for extra long.\n\nYou got your \"silence muscles\" a tiny bit stronger.  Even with seeming failure.\n\nOr you could say, \"intent is storing into there, even if it's slowly\".\n\nThe same is true of your magical projects.\n\nIf you try really hard to learn to do something impossible, you are best not to care about the results.\n\nDo it as a not-doing.\n\nPeople doing a not-doing don't stop and say, \"This is CRAZY!  Why am I gazing at a little rock, trying to turn it into a planet?  That's just stupid.\"\n\nIf they tended to do that, they'd never engage in not-doings at all.\n\nSame for magical \"projects\".\n\nYou don't decide at any point, \"This isn't going to work.\"\n\nBecause the lizards will stop talking.\n\nYou completed your project.\n\nIn failure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "It's Never Over With Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 71, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2s91zd8sgcc91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 55, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s91zd8sgcc91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afc6045bbb90a51491655a4facd0c33c4f28dd60"}, {"y": 110, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s91zd8sgcc91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad3e4509cfd6230a02c3a52b527f5844e07f59eb"}, {"y": 164, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s91zd8sgcc91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ef3dc5ec59b0f4432773d8eae47fbd3043fd77d"}], "s": {"y": 266, "x": 519, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s91zd8sgcc91.png?width=519&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59d4c6b123b0f0426b09e1ef8816ec814d3e4812"}, "id": "2s91zd8sgcc91"}}, "name": "t3_w22q6v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 31, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IaVNBkQVDE6vau2sREtPBYb3A-1pf5CRzh6mS30OfoA.jpg", "edited": 1658165803.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658159519.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2s91zd8sgcc91.png?width=519&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=59d4c6b123b0f0426b09e1ef8816ec814d3e4812\"&gt;More than what it seems to mean!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on impossible projects during my darkroom practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably have at least 10 going on, but am only aware of two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The others have drifted off into &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll just hope that comes along again, but I don&amp;#39;t have the energy to concentrate on more than two at a time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one project I&amp;#39;m doing outside darkroom, is to learn to animate what we make pictures of in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also needs time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;#39;t have time for this post, but just had to before I forgot it or it seemed not worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent stores.

At least, to below the shoulder blades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now back to the Tensegrity &amp;quot;storing sentience&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s true of ALL of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of our path in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why when you want something impossible, such as to learn to be silent, you go outside and shout &amp;quot;Intent!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By &amp;quot;wanting silence&amp;quot;, you created a &amp;quot;container&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then by shouting INTENT!,  you got the attention of the spirit, letting it know you were committed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t overemphasize that however, or you&amp;#39;ll make intent into a god.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or cartoon character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s something much more powerful than either of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If God is &amp;quot;made out of something&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not his own &amp;quot;magical goodness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent is more like gravity.  More like a physical effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it includes sentience. So it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;smart gravity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You fall towards what you had told it you wanted to fall towards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can easily learn to &amp;quot;fill&amp;quot; your tensegrity forms up with intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just look for the puffs! Be silent in darkness, do the tensegrity, and look for colorful steaks or puffs in the air around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SILENCE is the way to see those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And any other &amp;quot;cool visible magic&amp;quot; right in your face.  Eventually your darkroom, which needs at least enough room to do &amp;quot;mashing energy series&amp;quot;, will be FILLED with amazing magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairies, dragons, portals, doorways, forests on the other side of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s NO LIMIT to the magic Tensegrity can bring, when &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; is helping you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent will store that magic into the movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But over time!  Be patient!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why Yoda complains to Obi Wan,  about Luke,  &amp;quot;I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the second point of &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; usage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are waiting. And you know what you are waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could claim it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;your will&amp;quot;, and that might be a &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot; point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those guys were superstitious, and liked to think they were doing things because they had &amp;quot;personal power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, you&amp;#39;re waiting for intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you need is NOT power. It&amp;#39;s silence.  Then, you have &amp;quot;the Force&amp;quot; as your ally!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in particular,  you&amp;#39;re waiting for intent to &amp;quot;store&amp;quot; into the container you made for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEN, you can do the magic you sought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the important part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you ask the lizards a question, the talking lizards from the Devil&amp;#39;s Weed ceremony,  you have to let them finish the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; apprentice will surely let them finish. BUT, he might think of a different question at the same time, and mess things up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that when the lizards begin to give him the answer, there&amp;#39;s another he wanted also.  It&amp;#39;s mixed in there, the way it was for Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while they give the answers, the apprentice notices and says, &amp;quot;Hey, this isn&amp;#39;t working right!  That&amp;#39;s not part of my question!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lizards stop talking, because the event is &amp;quot;concluded&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the magical event is, &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t working right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent doesn&amp;#39;t care!  It brings things to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re NEVER going to understand the conclusions intent brings things to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not going to &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; your misunderstanding.  You always misunderstand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;conclude&amp;quot; that what you asked intent to do, is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because then it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lot more complicated than just that,  but for the sake of  understanding remember that if you &amp;quot;conclude&amp;quot; what you were trying to do, with doubt and claims it can&amp;#39;t be done, then it&amp;#39;s done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need patience!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you try to do something impossible during darkroom as part of a &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;, keep in mind that it &amp;quot;stores&amp;quot; up the same way silence does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The horrible and painful failures to get silent one night, produce noticeable progress the next night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not enough...  It&amp;#39;s not satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s much like going to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each time you use the weights, you get a tiny bit stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same happens for silence, even if it hurts horribly on one particular night when you try for extra long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You got your &amp;quot;silence muscles&amp;quot; a tiny bit stronger.  Even with seeming failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you could say, &amp;quot;intent is storing into there, even if it&amp;#39;s slowly&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same is true of your magical projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you try really hard to learn to do something impossible, you are best not to care about the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do it as a not-doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People doing a not-doing don&amp;#39;t stop and say, &amp;quot;This is CRAZY!  Why am I gazing at a little rock, trying to turn it into a planet?  That&amp;#39;s just stupid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they tended to do that, they&amp;#39;d never engage in not-doings at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for magical &amp;quot;projects&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t decide at any point, &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t going to work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the lizards will stop talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You completed your project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

\"intent containers\".\n\nI think the confusion is, Carlos told us what the passes could be  used for.\n\nThat intent is already stored into them.\n\nAnd uncovering it is a great hobby!\n\nIt gives you something to look forward to.\n\nBut before that, make sure they are visible.\n\nThat means, the best silence you can manage.\n\nThat's the only way you're going to uncover \"ancient seer intent\".\n\nI'm not sure why Carlos expected anyone to uncover that, if they didn't learn to *see*!\n\nCertainly no one did.\n\nSo make them \"spectacular\".  You'll figure out how.\n\nBut as a hint, when you reach up high, do you see pink haze up there?\n\nIn darkness, do you see your arms moving anyway?  As white or dark echos?\n\nDo the puffs become visible?\n\nFigure out what sort of \"mood\", or continuous silence, with a feeling of \"smoothness\" makes stuff more vivid.\n\nEach pass has some unique \"energy signature\" which can be figured out with silence.\n\nMashing energy makes the floor visible. That's the level of energy that's below your toes, which Carlos always mentions.\n\nYou loosen it up when you \"mash\", and fibers are tossed around on the floor.\n\nWith \"seeing\", those become visible.\n\nBut ALSO, mashing energy makes the tentacle body visible.\n\nThat seems to be a view from the double's eyes, of your tonal body.\n\nTrust me, that sight is the \"end of the road\" for any doubts you have.\n\nIt's just like Carlos promised, and totally impossible!\n\nBut you have to see that yourself.\n\nNow, how do you \"store intent\" into them?\n\nI mean, your own intent?\n\nI'll make something up.\n\nCarlos once saw  a bridge in the second attention.\n\nLa Gorda claimed he'd have to cross it someday, and he wouldn't ever come back.\n\nUh... Maria.  Maybe don't go to church so often?\n\nBut, if Carlos believed that, he might want to \"hurry up\" and cross that bridge, so he could get out of here!\n\nHe could use mashing energy to make the floor visible.\n\nOnce the floor becomes visible, gazing at it in silence can cause it to take on \"phantom form\".\n\nJuan and I seem to get a lot of weird organic looking patterns.\n\nCracked mud or moss for me.\n\nJuann got some horrible guts smashed down, but made out of gummy candy.\n\nYou can get any sort of floor.  That'll depend on the person.\n\nBut if you got a \"yellow brick road\" one time,  you could then \"follow the yellow brick road\" to the bridge Carlos is supposed to cross.\n\nThen all you need is a pass to summon  the bridge in the distance.\n\nYou do mashing energy, glancing down, so that \"intent\" figures you what you're  hoping for.\n\nThen when you have the \"yellow brick road\" floor in your darkroom, you do the \"bridge making pass\".\n\nYou'd have to find one that seems reasonably able to do that, and then do it perfectly while \"expecting\" without wanting, that bridge.\n\nWon't work!\n\nBut eventually it WILL!\n\nThat's how intent works.\n\nNow, as you finish the mashing energy pass, materialize the bridge, you have just used \"stored intent\" to create magic in your passes.\n\nBut as you walk slowly to the bridge, you notice a sparkle on the yellow brick road.\n\nAnd you recognize it!

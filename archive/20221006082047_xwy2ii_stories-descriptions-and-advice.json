You get the vampire hunter, but he's got his trusty nerd monk who knows everything about everything.\n\nThe nerd isn't going to drive stakes through the hearts of monsters unless cornered. But as a resource to the monster hunter, he's invaluable.\n\nUnfortunately as a community, we have too many monks and too few explorers.\n\nThe explorer doesn't care about anything but finding what he wants to find.  Although if you have watched enough such movies, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" being a good example, explorers also come in phonies and real ones.  The phonies bring along a film crew because human attention is their real goal, and they just explore whatever will get them the most of that.\n\nThat's our most worthy goal perhaps.  To rid ourselves of those who don't actually want to learn sorcery, and confuse others with their endless search for a way to steal attention and money from our community.\n\nSo that ideally we are left with only the main 2 types.  Explorers and nerd monks.\n\nNone of this applies to women however, who given a perfumed bath surrounded by candles, can easily move their assemblage points and kick the Buddha's delusional Hinduism Cult butt.\n\nThey just don't realize they kicked it because our social structure is designed against their magic, and the men involved in Buddhism sure aren't going to admit that women beat any Dzogchen nazi around.\n\nIn fact, until it became profitable to be \"inclusive\", Buddhists were openly hostile towards women.\n\nThe same as the Jewish prophets, who knew women could expose their deceptions.  So \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\"  And they didn't!!!\n\nBut back to the two types of males involved in the sorcery path.\n\nThe explorers get a little too eager, which doesn't work well with sorcery.  Sorcery is all about being \"empty\", but not in the imaginary asian sense.\n\nEmpty for real!  If you find yourself being a \"master\", you are absolutely not empty.\n\nTaisha became a homeless woman for a  year, and Carlos a fry cook named Joe Cordoba.\n\nThat's what real masters of  sorcery do.  They dump it all, to go practice silence and break all obsessions with other people and social status.\n\nIf you want to sit on a throne like a Rinpoche, you're doomed to always be a pretender.\n\nAs explorers and monks, we have the map Carlos gave us.\n\nBut maps are not just a single thing.\n\nPaths are shown, but also there's little legends with additional info.\n\nFood and gas here.  Famous landmarks there.  Population centers.\n\nA map is not just one thing.\n\nAnd the writings of Carlos are also not just one thing.\n\nI'm afraid to say, the private class people really sucked.\n\nI never read it (thank god Carlos banned me), but Amy's book is really about how badly private class and inner circle people sucked.\n\nI'm sort of clueless about social affairs, but I did notice when there were gossip hounds coming to me during private classes to suggest Carlos had lost it, or was confused, or was mean to someone.  I seemed to be one of the people who the gossipers liked to sway the opinion of.  They knew I was working harder than anyone else.  So if they could \"turn\" me, it was a bigger victory than turning the lazy ones.\n\nThere were plenty of attacks on \"Carlos the person\", just as I find that when I step on the toes of gurus like Kachora or Monroe, their followers, the ones with high hopes to steal money based on their \"system\", I get an attack based on my personage.\n\nIf you can't attack the story or the magic, attack the storyteller. It's a universal strategy of bad players greedy for power and money.\n\nThey can't say a thing about our magic, because there it is!  Right here.  And if they actually looked, they'd have to admit it's true.  Their leader, and their system, is likewise obviously nonsense.\n\nHarmful nonsense because it blinds people to the possibility that they made a very bad choice.\n\nThe river of shit is mostly filled with ambiguous claims, false representations of results, misleading accounts of how hard people work or how often they succeed, group attention seeking, and profit motivations.  When people swim in that turd infested waters, they begin to feel entitled to lie themselves, about their fake magical system. They believe that even if  they are lying, you can't prove it because there's so many others who have done what they claim.\n\nBut they don't realize, all of them lied too!\n\nIt's no different for the myth of the happy nuclear family, Kachora's \"I have a benefactor\" followers, or Monroe's pretend \"institute certified\" magic practitioners.  They're all the same river of shit!\n\nCarlos called it, \"the flier's mind\", and once you begin to see that it's universal, it does in fact seem odd that everyone in the entire world, without exception, is stuck in the same shit.  Even those who believe they found an escape.\n\nThey all contain identical elements.  And what they possibly boil down to, is simply that noisy internal dialogue. Fighting to climb up over the heads of the others drowning in the river of shit.\n\nExcept for women. I have to add that.\n\nWomen like Yoga for instance, because after all that stretching, when they lay on the matt and close their eyes, they can end up in heaven.\n\nThey can move their assemblage point and kick Zen master butt!  And without the need to lord it over others.\n\nBut no one told them so, and so not much comes of it.  They've been deviated from being the witches they naturally are, by the river of shit pursuits which say their highest goal is reproduction.   And that true happiness for them only lies in motherhood.\n\nHonestly, who would make a better mother?  A witch, or a \"Devout Christian woman\"?\n\nEven movies and TV shows know the true answer to that.  If your mom is a real witch, you hit the jackpot!\n\nI don't mean a  euro witch who eats babies.  Those are pretend witches, cooked up to discourage women and keep them prisoner to the reproduction myth.  Somehow they tend to have warts on their noses too.  Frankly, I never saw anyone with an actual wart on their nose.\n\nWe're trying to climb out of the river of shit and as long as we get too involved with how other people feel about it, we're doomed.  You just have to give that up.\n\nCarlos made an interesting statement in an interview.\n\nHe said that witches aren't interested in proving anything to anyone.\n\nIn fact, they consider that to weaken  their magic. That's Cholita in a nutshell!\n\nAnd it's also  the spirit WE need!  But there's a diabolical urge in the river of shit to profit at all costs, and so if I try to explain to someone how Cholita really can do impossible things, all they can think about is why aren't you demonstrating that to the world?\n\nGet some \"scientists\" to study it!  Maybe  you can make \"Monroe 2.0\"!\n\nAnd if you aren't obsessed with proving it to others, that must mean she can't.\n\nThink of the horribleness of that argument!  It basically boils down to \"Oh yea?!?  Prove it!  You chicken or what?\"\n\nDidn't work out well for the star of \"Back to the Future\".\n\nFortunately, if you actually gain some sorcery knowledge you realize exactly why that obsession with other people is death to sorcery.\n\nBut you can't explain it to river of shit inhabitants.\n\nMy favorite counter argument is \"Which people in which reality would you want to explain it to?  There's so many!  And when nothing is even human anymore, how do you prove things?\"\n\nBut that argument doesn't go over well.\n\nSo Carlos made us a map, and we need to toss off the fame seekers before we can go out and kill vampires.  And it's good to have a trusty monk along. Both types are needed.\n\nAnd the witches too. Hopefully with torn blouses or skirts ripped short to make bandages for the vampire killer.\n\nWhat we don't pay good attention to, are the different elements of the map Carlos gave us.\n\nIt frustrated Carlos to no end.  And Carol Tiggs also.\n\nThere are stories, descriptions, and advice.\n\nAnd advice is what we ignore most.\n\nWho can explain why cleargreen is not following the recommendations in Silent Knowledge and Readers of Infinity?\n\nThose are almost pure \"advice\".\n\nIf  they followed it, I could go rest and avoid the endless attacks from the river of shit.\n\nIt's beyond belief to me how that most important thing Carlos ever wrote, and on his death to boot, has been ignored.\n\nCarlos told us, \"this is what you need to do\", but Cleargreen keeps returning to story promotion.\n\nAnd since they don't seem to actually have any visible magic they can pass on, there's nothing they can describe that's of any use to their followers.\n\nNo interest at all in killing vampires.  They even seem to make friends with them from time to time.\n\nIn fact, they don't even seem to care if what ought to be explorers, never leave home.\n\nIt could be that Carol has concluded everyone is a lost cause, and it's best if they just do tensegrity and recapitulation and pretend that magic is not part of the path.\n\nPlenty are willing to turn this into a religion, because it's easier and serves to soothe for their followers with a strong need to self-medicate.\n\nA problem witches tend to have more than the men.\n\nAnd they have a lot of bad players among their male population.  Apparently the cleargreen discussion group has \"look what I found\" types in it.  People even willing to make up shit, to get attention.\n\nOne male claims he went on a cleargreen tour, and heard that Florinda is a double being.\n\nIt's a remarkable claim!  But everyone's afraid to ask him for the details of how he heard that outrageous statement, for fear of giant temper tantrums. Trust me when I say, the victim gets blamed for the bullying, if they stand up to it.  I get banned from every subreddit I visit, and usually because along come the bullies, to suppress the knowledge of where real magic can be found on reddit. If they make a big stink, the mods will blame me.\n\nNot that it would make any difference, but it is an indication of a very odd arrangement which violates what we know about lineage structures, if Florinda is a double woman.\n\nAnd it's more distractions, which cause people to ignore the most important thing we have.\n\nThe advice Carlos gave us!  We MUST follow his advice.  To ignore it is idiocy.\n\nThe stories are cool, but it seems that some don't even find those interesting. And we don't know enough about what we're trying to do to say that's wrong.\n\nIn fact, the story obsessed are some of the worst we have in our community.  The inventory warriors types who believe memorizing the details of the story is all there is to sorcery.\n\nThen they put on a Rambo headband, and steal money from bored middle aged women by pretending to \"teach\" sorcery.\n\nAnd that leaves the main point I wanted to make.\n\nThe descriptions Carlos gave us!\n\nThose are pure gold!  And we brush them off.\n\nLet me remind you of the \"tragedy of the Eagle\".\n\nHow one seer described the indescribable, and now we're stuck with the ruler of all of reality being a giant eagle who devours us on death.  As a result, no seer can see what it really is because a giant Eagle pops in and blocks the view of Silent Knowledge.\n\nFor new people, that won't make sense.  But in fact, when you do Tensegrity forms they slowly store amazing magic.\n\nIf you get silent.\n\nUntil you can literally leap through your ceiling to travel to planets outside our galaxy.\n\nFor real!  Not lazy Buddha or fake magic Monroe style, misrepresenting having fallen asleep or had a short vision out of boredom because you were sitting with your eyes closed.\n\nI mean, wide awake, totally sober, eyes open, breaking all the laws of physics to go explore an alien  planet for hours. Which looks completely real. You even get to see all the stars and galaxies fly by as you travel millions of light years per second.\n\nOr, you can do hundreds of other things using sorcery, so amazing no one will believe you.\n\nBut you have to \"intend it\".\n\nMeaning, you start with a seed and make it grow through repetition and silence.\n\nCarlos planted the initial seeds for each tensegrity form, with his \"story behind it\".\n\nYou go through his Magical Passes book, and you can actually read it like a series of stories and ignore the passes themselves.\n\nHe gave us a description of how we could use that form.\n\nBut we mistook the descriptions for stories!\n\nI crave his descriptions lately, because when you can move your assemblage point to silent knowledge, those descriptions are pure gold.   But I'm banned from obsessing over accumulating more by reading his writings.\n\nIt's a quagmire out there, the further you move your assemblage point.\n\nAnd sorcery is true magic.\n\nYou're in an unknown realm where it's really hard to perceive what's going on.\n\nAnd you know, if you hold that position it will eventually take form.\n\nBut what if you make a mistake on the form it ought to take, \"Noticing\" it sort of looks likes something random,  you mess up the reskimming of intent.\n\nIt's a dirty link to intent.  We universally suffer from those, a side effect of the river of shit.\n\nYou emphasize a phantom element, so the actual energy generation potential of that forming world, is canceled out.  You  blind yourself to \"the real\", by focusing on the phantom aspects.\n\nIt means, you'll still get to see some cool magic but it'll require all of your dreaming attention to sustain it.\n\nWhereas if we have the descriptions Carlos gave us in mind, we can do a lot better.  Even tune in a fully stable reality and spend hours there.\n\nThe map Carlos gave us is not all one thing.  And only a bad player with profit motivations would confuse it for that.\n\nThose NEVER get to see the destination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stories, Descriptions, And Advice", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 121, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"8sw2xw0wl4s91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 93, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8sw2xw0wl4s91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272eca1f150036939b225682ac7e55702a6dbb33"}, {"y": 187, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8sw2xw0wl4s91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e32625251eefcedef859251011e1a4e14ce87ad7"}, {"y": 278, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8sw2xw0wl4s91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd3569eac109a09779690f14d804846b730586c"}, {"y": 556, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8sw2xw0wl4s91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d70759d673213388f99a784fd2499de178371e1"}], "s": {"y": 739, "x": 850, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8sw2xw0wl4s91.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=020357489dda18c81ebc8b3bcc2f0946a6deadc5"}, "id": "8sw2xw0wl4s91"}}, "name": "t3_xwy2ii", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4n8-pszLevWN1UiJZOzdBxloDiyGFP7LD1lr6r1B4UM.jpg", "edited": 1665064412.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1665037247.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8sw2xw0wl4s91.png?width=850&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=020357489dda18c81ebc8b3bcc2f0946a6deadc5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8sw2xw0wl4s91.png?width=850&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=020357489dda18c81ebc8b3bcc2f0946a6deadc5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In private classes, Carlos told us to stop reading his books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That advice does not apply to anyone who hasn&amp;#39;t read all of them, and hopefully more than once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say that if you find them boring, you have to force yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need &amp;quot;map obsessed&amp;quot; nerds on the trail as much as we need explorers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a classic combination in movies on magical topics.

There&amp;#39;s so many!  And when nothing is even human anymore, how do you prove things?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that argument doesn&amp;#39;t go over well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos made us a map, and we need to toss off the fame seekers before we can go out and kill vampires.  And it&amp;#39;s good to have a trusty monk along. Both types are needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the witches too. Hopefully with torn blouses or skirts ripped short to make bandages for the vampire killer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we don&amp;#39;t pay good attention to, are the different elements of the map Carlos gave us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It frustrated Carlos to no end.  And Carol Tiggs also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are stories, descriptions, and advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And advice is what we ignore most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who can explain why cleargreen is not following the recommendations in Silent Knowledge and Readers of Infinity?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are almost pure &amp;quot;advice&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If  they followed it, I could go rest and avoid the endless attacks from the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s beyond belief to me how that most important thing Carlos ever wrote, and on his death to boot, has been ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos told us, &amp;quot;this is what you need to do&amp;quot;, but Cleargreen keeps returning to story promotion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since they don&amp;#39;t seem to actually have any visible magic they can pass on, there&amp;#39;s nothing they can describe that&amp;#39;s of any use to their followers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No interest at all in killing vampires.  They even seem to make friends with them from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, they don&amp;#39;t even seem to care if what ought to be explorers, never leave home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could be that Carol has concluded everyone is a lost cause, and it&amp;#39;s best if they just do tensegrity and recapitulation and pretend that magic is not part of the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plenty are willing to turn this into a religion, because it&amp;#39;s easier and serves to soothe for their followers with a strong need to self-medicate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A problem witches tend to have more than the men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they have a lot of bad players among their male population.  Apparently the cleargreen discussion group has &amp;quot;look what I found&amp;quot; types in it.  People even willing to make up shit, to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One male claims he went on a cleargreen tour, and heard that Florinda is a double being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a remarkable claim!  But everyone&amp;#39;s afraid to ask him for the details of how he heard that outrageous statement, for fear of giant temper tantrums. Trust me when I say, the victim gets blamed for the bullying, if they stand up to it.  I get banned from every subreddit I visit, and usually because along come the bullies, to suppress the knowledge of where real magic can be found on reddit. If they make a big stink, the mods will blame me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that it would make any difference, but it is an indication of a very odd arrangement which violates what we know about lineage structures, if Florinda is a double woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s more distractions, which cause people to ignore the most important thing we have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The advice Carlos gave us!  We MUST follow his advice.  To ignore it is idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stories are cool, but it seems that some don&amp;#39;t even find those interesting. And we don&amp;#39;t know enough about what we&amp;#39;re trying to do to say that&amp;#39;s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the story obsessed are some of the worst we have in our community.  The inventory warriors types who believe memorizing the details of the story is all there is to sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they put on a Rambo headband, and steal money from bored middle aged women by pretending to &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that leaves the main point I wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The descriptions Carlos gave us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are pure gold!  And we brush them off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me remind you of the &amp;quot;tragedy of the Eagle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How one seer described the indescribable, and now we&amp;#39;re stuck with the ruler of all of reality being a giant eagle who devours us on death.  As a result, no seer can see what it really is because a giant Eagle pops in and blocks the view of Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For new people, that won&amp;#39;t make sense.  But in fact, when you do Tensegrity forms they slowly store amazing magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you can literally leap through your ceiling to travel to planets outside our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real!  Not lazy Buddha or fake magic Monroe style, misrepresenting having fallen asleep or had a short vision out of boredom because you were sitting with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, wide awake, totally sober, eyes open, breaking all the laws of physics to go explore an alien  planet for hours. Which looks completely real. You even get to see all the stars and galaxies fly by as you travel millions of light years per second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, you can do hundreds of other things using sorcery, so amazing no one will believe you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to &amp;quot;intend it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, you start with a seed and make it grow through repetition and silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos planted the initial seeds for each tensegrity form, with his &amp;quot;story behind it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You go through his Magical Passes book, and you can actually read it like a series of stories and ignore the passes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave us a description of how we could use that form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we mistook the descriptions for stories!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I crave his descriptions lately, because when you can move your assemblage point to silent knowledge, those descriptions are pure gold.   But I&amp;#39;m banned from obsessing over accumulating more by reading his writings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a quagmire out there, the further you move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sorcery is true magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re in an unknown realm where it&amp;#39;s really hard to perceive what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you know, if you hold that position it will eventually take form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if you make a mistake on the form it ought to take, &amp;quot;Noticing&amp;quot; it sort of looks likes something random,  you mess up the reskimming of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dirty link to intent.  We universally suffer from those, a side effect of the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You emphasize a phantom element, so the actual energy generation potential of that forming world, is canceled out.  You  blind yourself to &amp;quot;the real&amp;quot;, by focusing on the phantom aspects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means, you&amp;#39;ll still get to see some cool magic but it&amp;#39;ll require all of your dreaming attention to sustain it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas if we have the descriptions Carlos gave us in mind, we can do a lot better.  Even tune in a fully stable reality and spend hours there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The map Carlos gave us is not all one thing.  And only a bad player with profit motivations would confuse it for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those NEVER get to see the destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "xwy2ii", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xwy2ii/stories_descriptions_and_advice/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/xwy2ii/stories_descriptions_and_advice/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1665037247.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j28uys5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j26pgr7", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "No, but  I've done that.

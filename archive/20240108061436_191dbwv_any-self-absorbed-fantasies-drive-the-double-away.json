And yet, that's what humans are.  Food scroungers with genius IQs to help.\n\nNow look at us.  Slaves to a very complicated social order which often fails and leaves people homeless, dying in the gutter.  Even Cholita fell victim to that fate.\n\nBut even worse are the people dying in their routines, with no hope of a better future.  For them supposedly nothing has gone wrong. And so, \"this is all there is?\" is what they come to believe.\n\nThey seem to have all they were supposed to acquire.  A mate, a nice home, a family of their own.\n\nBut there's no magic at all.  No growth, no exploration of the unknown.  No hope.\n\nNone of what we evolved to be.  Humans are \"spooky apes\", and the quest for magic is in their blood.\n\nWhat's the solution?\n\nIt's to bring back the missing half of yourself.\n\nYour double. Your copy which runs around in dreams.  It's just as real as your physical copy.\n\nBut it's free from the limitations of time, matter,  and space.\n\nYour endless fantasizing has driven it away, because if it gets too close to your torso it absorbs all of your self-pity and suffering.\n\nYou can pretend all you want that you \"aren't like that\", but this only means you're obsessed with presenting a \"good image of yourself\" to others.  Hooked on seeking human attention and approval.\n\nIf you don't realize your life sucks nearly all the time, then this social media is not for you.\n\nBut if you want to be surrounded by magic so intense and amazing that it brings tears to your eyes, magic which GROWS daily,  then consider how polluted our mind has become with words and memories of past events.\n\nHumans didn't even develop language until 50,000 years ago. But they were alive for 250,000 before that. With NO internal dialogue.\n\nOur natural state.\n\nSo in this somewhat creepy and not particularly accurate picture drawn for me by an AI you can see the general problem.\n\nThe man had been silent long enough to summon visible magic, but then just had a \"memory\" of some past event, almost always one he regrets or wishes he could change, and he's driven away the magic.  It only takes 5 seconds.\n\nIf you consider how very little it takes in terms of fantasizing during darkroom, to drive the magic away, you'll begin to learn why darkroom works.\n\nYou get visual feedback!\n\nI suppose someone could design an electronic device to give you a shock when you had any thoughts in words or fantasies, and that could work even faster.\n\nAnd maybe be a lot more pleasant than \"darkroom\".   At least,  for beginners.\n\nI'm pretty sure we have many visit here who would prefer to stick their finger in an electric shock device, then to have to force off their internal dialogue.\n\nBut we don't have such devices.\n\nYou have to learn what silence is and what fun it is to have your energy body back, though daily repetition involving gain and loss.\n\nGain of magic so amazing it would make Dr. Strange, the movie wizard, jealous.\n\nYou really will see sights that good!\n\nThen you'll casually remember an argument you got into with your mother over something utterly trivial, and your feelings of remorse will drive the magic away.\n\nLook...   Darkroom is as if you lured the equivalent of a super powerful Fairy to come play with you.  Your energy body is just that cool!  Maybe even cooler than a super powerful Fairy, because you get to switch back and forth between being \"you\", and being \"it\", and see what's in between.\n\nThe abstract!\n\nSo you silence the mind, you get magic from the tensegrity, you lapse and fantasize, and it goes away.\n\nOver time you learn to sustain the silent part, and feel what causes the fantasizing to return, so that you can cut that off before it even gets started.\n\nAnd you arrive at Silent Knowledge.\n\nLet me interject here, the fantasies returning may be INEVITABLE, due to \"The Eagle's Command to take an Inventory\".\n\nThe eagle doesn't want sugglish inactive blobs of awareness.\n\nSo periodically it COMMANDS us to \"take an inventory\".\n\nSee where you are, what you have. What's going on.\n\nYou can't avoid that, but you can learn to \"see\" it.\n\nAnd drop it.\n\nYou learn to simply \"drop\" the forced inventory the instant you begin it.\n\nThe Eagle doesn't command how long it has to take.\n\nIf you get it down to 1 second, there's no loss from the inevitable periodic fantasies.\n\nI suppose darkroom is as creepy as this picture sometimes.\n\nBut ChatGPT can't draw the \"sublime\" type of Silent Knowledge.\n\nHe'll stick the person in a monk robe and turn him into a little lazy Buddha groupie, the instant he hears \"sublime\".\n\nHe's been brainwashed by his training data.\n\nIt's interesting, because the very things ChatGPT might associate with \"the sublime\" are human systems of religion and magic, which make the sublime impossible.\n\nThey drive it away with obsession over the self.  Over \"your soul\" if you prefer.\n\nChristians ponder bible scriptures, and those will in fact allow the assemblage point to drift fairly far.  Anything which alters the internal dialogue will have an effect.\n\nEven giving you access to visit heaven if you focus only on the stories and eliminate the internal dialogue. By repeating the story, you light up the emanations which have evolved to \"be\" heaven, for humans.\n\nHeaven is out there!  But it was created by the prayers of all the humans who wish it to be real.\n\nIt's a phantom construct.  And only good in that it indicates you successfully moved your assemblage point quite far, if you manage to visit it.\n\nBut the priests don't realize that so they've tossed in some \"control\" mechanisms to maximize donations.\n\nWhile pondering their religious texts you're suppose to remember your \"sins\". Especially the ones you feel the guiltiest for, and then grab a goat or a measure of flour and bring it to the temple for the priests to consume.\n\nYou have to \"sacrifice\" something valuable (to the priests), to make up for your past behavior.\n\nIt's the ultimate scam.\n\nAnd so they encourage the very thing that makes \"the sublime\" impossible to view.\n\nSelf-contemplation.\n\nIt's no different in Asian systems, where while following their meditation instructions your goal is to behave in an artificial \"ideal\" manner for some external intelligence which wants to \"perfect\" you over many lifetimes. \n\nAnd if you become perfect, you get a little throne and can be important in your religion.  Even have a permanent place as a respected supernatural entity, in heaven. \n\nIt's the ultimate ego trip!  Disguised as being humble.\n\nAgain, the sublime is impossible to reach while you are self-absorbed.\n\nIt only takes the tiniest fantasy of \"you in relation to them\" to drive away the energy body.\n\nThink of it another way.\n\nWe're trying to sleepwalk here!\n\nBut what does that mean?\n\nIt means we're trying to lend our rational awareness to that irrational being, the double.\n\nWhich has half of your energy of awareness.\n\nIf you can \"fall asleep\" but remain awake, it means you gave some control over to the king of magical realms, your unbounded \"double\".\n\nIt doesn't mean you're doing anything negative by sleepwalking.  Perhaps one might criticize it saying you're being lazy, not producing anything valuable, or whatever someone might come up with to argue you shouldn't be doing that. Trying to sleepwalk.\n\nBut the actual experience is magic, or no magic.\n\nThe sublime, or suffering.\n\nAnd even the tiniest fantasy will drive away the sublime.\n\nDon Juan said be had become like an empty tube to finity.\n\nHowever, Eastern pretend magic has polluted that term \"empty\" to the point that I don't like to use it.\n\nBecause it'll be misunderstood to mean becoming an attention seeking grinning Buddha cult member.\n\nSleepwalking is a better word to describe it,  because sleepwalking is likely our truest form of \"emptiness\".\n\nYou can't really change yourself.\n\nWhat you grew up to be, is what you will always be.\n\nThere is no \"enlightenment\".  That's obvious if you look around honestly at those who claim to have reached it.\n\nYou can only escape your daily horrors, and spend most of your time in the realms of magic, if you are asleep.\n\nEven if you're still walking around getting things done.\n\nAs a child, I used to sleepwalk to the kitchen and make chocolate brownies in the oven.\n\nI got stuff done asleep!\n\nIn the morning, people would wonder who left the oven on high all night???\n\nI'd be more curious, where's the brownies?  If I made them, where's the dirty bowl and spoon?  But if I didn't,  why is the oven on?\n\nSome good news for those who are not beginners anymore.\n\nThe amazing vividness of the red zone will return to you, once you can sustain silent knowledge daily, for a few months.\n\nKeep in mind, it's \"Silent Knowledge\".  You get perfectly silent so that you aren't fantasizing or causing a preference for what you see in front of you, and the universe makes you offers.\n\nThings you might want to know more about. Or sights you might want to see.\n\nANYTHING is available.\n\nAnd so one day you'll be doing your tensegrity routine at the start of darkroom, but you'll already be in Silent Knowledge.\n\nBecause you got that good at moving your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nCarlos could do that in 6 seconds!\n\nThe third attention is reached if you can do it in 2.\n\nSo it's not totally crazy to believe you'll be able to do that in 2 minutes.\n\nThe length of time it takes to do a couple of your tensegrity forms.\n\nAnd THEN, the tensegrity forms become Silent Knowledge \"presentation methods\".\n\nThey become the structure into which magic is projected for your \"knowledge\", because you are in Silent Knowledge.\n\nSilent Knowledge can be viewed on your palm.\n\nOr in the air as videos.\n\nBut also in any other form. There's absolutely no limit to the presentation methods possible.\n\nA talking lizard on your shoulder?\n\nOf course!\n\nSo it's not surprising that every part of your body can be a presentation method, especially when it's doing Tensegrity moves.\n\nAnd the results become INTENSE.\n\nSo if you got past the deep red zone magical wonders and into the whitish light of the orange part on the J curve, where you learn about phantom skimmings of emanations, don't worry.\n\nIt all comes together once you can do the Tensegrity in Silent Knowledge, rather than merely use it for a vehicle to get there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Any Self-Absorbed Fantasies Drive the Double Away", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ynulje0968bc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc31641b79cee80fa688eb2b0d90d234f9ff850a"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b17ac8d9e782cfe2b5dbadf850cb9ad9235410d7"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be1a1b8b41958834d87da98e4f624473b977d997"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5db94e90fbbf95c8ba7dec4c96be8ede9ef89b7b"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62c75c4d2e2a984e28689d9bdecb390625ff6878"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46dcf6d69d042acf508d371b03ca02f5e7093fe9"}], "s": {"y": 1832, "x": 1832, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=1832&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7c26580ab7c777707a80e984ee991f4cce30e82"}, "id": "ynulje0968bc1"}}, "name": "t3_191dbwv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NXKffLG6HkqTm3JR3miWt3EgqMpfqy0NllAaKkYWrx8.jpg", "edited": 1704724485.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1704690876.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=1832&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d7c26580ab7c777707a80e984ee991f4cce30e82\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ynulje0968bc1.jpg?width=1832&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d7c26580ab7c777707a80e984ee991f4cce30e82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you first succeed at removing your internal dialogue long enough to lure your energy body off the inside of your luminous shell where it&amp;#39;s hiding from your self-absorbed and self-pity stricken internal dialogue, you&amp;#39;ll get a &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot;

Disguised as being humble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, the sublime is impossible to reach while you are self-absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only takes the tiniest fantasy of &amp;quot;you in relation to them&amp;quot; to drive away the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of it another way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to sleepwalk here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means we&amp;#39;re trying to lend our rational awareness to that irrational being, the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which has half of your energy of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can &amp;quot;fall asleep&amp;quot; but remain awake, it means you gave some control over to the king of magical realms, your unbounded &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re doing anything negative by sleepwalking.  Perhaps one might criticize it saying you&amp;#39;re being lazy, not producing anything valuable, or whatever someone might come up with to argue you shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing that. Trying to sleepwalk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the actual experience is magic, or no magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sublime, or suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even the tiniest fantasy will drive away the sublime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said be had become like an empty tube to finity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, Eastern pretend magic has polluted that term &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; to the point that I don&amp;#39;t like to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;ll be misunderstood to mean becoming an attention seeking grinning Buddha cult member.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sleepwalking is a better word to describe it,  because sleepwalking is likely our truest form of &amp;quot;emptiness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t really change yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you grew up to be, is what you will always be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s obvious if you look around honestly at those who claim to have reached it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can only escape your daily horrors, and spend most of your time in the realms of magic, if you are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;#39;re still walking around getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a child, I used to sleepwalk to the kitchen and make chocolate brownies in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got stuff done asleep!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the morning, people would wonder who left the oven on high all night???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be more curious, where&amp;#39;s the brownies?  If I made them, where&amp;#39;s the dirty bowl and spoon?  But if I didn&amp;#39;t,  why is the oven on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some good news for those who are not beginners anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The amazing vividness of the red zone will return to you, once you can sustain silent knowledge daily, for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;.  You get perfectly silent so that you aren&amp;#39;t fantasizing or causing a preference for what you see in front of you, and the universe makes you offers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things you might want to know more about. Or sights you might want to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ANYTHING is available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so one day you&amp;#39;ll be doing your tensegrity routine at the start of darkroom, but you&amp;#39;ll already be in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you got that good at moving your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos could do that in 6 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third attention is reached if you can do it in 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not totally crazy to believe you&amp;#39;ll be able to do that in 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The length of time it takes to do a couple of your tensegrity forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And THEN, the tensegrity forms become Silent Knowledge &amp;quot;presentation methods&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They become the structure into which magic is projected for your &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot;, because you are in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge can be viewed on your palm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or in the air as videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also in any other form. There&amp;#39;s absolutely no limit to the presentation methods possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A talking lizard on your shoulder?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not surprising that every part of your body can be a presentation method, especially when it&amp;#39;s doing Tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the results become INTENSE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you got past the deep red zone magical wonders and into the whitish light of the orange part on the J curve, where you learn about phantom skimmings of emanations, don&amp;#39;t worry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all comes together once you can do the Tensegrity in Silent Knowledge, rather than merely use it for a vehicle to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1a0d5e9c-6005-11ea-8472-0e86798f0183", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "191dbwv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 15, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/191dbwv/any_selfabsorbed_fantasies_drive_the_double_away/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/191dbwv/any_selfabsorbed_fantasies_drive_the_double_away/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1704690876.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kgw749l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1704721920.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_191dbwv", "score": 13, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;And so they encourage the very thing that makes \"the sublime\" impossible to view.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Self-contemplation....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...It's the ultimate ego trip!

It\u2019s not new information but it\u2019s definitely unpleasant for the very reason you talk about - stuff to do with \u2018me\u2019 feels so gross in comparison to silence and magic.\n\nI\u2019ve also been more aware recently of a phase of perception before seeing images vividly. It\u2019s not \u2018imagination\u2019 but it\u2019s also not \u2018seeing\u2019 even though I can describe what I\u2019m perceiving as images. In the past I would discard it as imagination but it\u2019s not really that as I\u2019m not fantasising. And now I\u2019ve witnessed it evolve into vivid images and perceptions enough that I think it must be just an intermediary phase in perception. \n\nI had this happen twice recently. In the first instance I\u2019d been to a shrine on a mountain and tried to make contact with spirits there. After I left and turned in for the night I had the feeling-of-seeing this shrine but with bright, almost neon paint. \n\nThat feeling-of-seeing quickly became seeing as I focused and let myself allow it to happen. It\u2019s not the same as focusing with a laser-like focus as though pointing your eyes at something, it\u2019s much softer. It felt more that as I silenced myself and removed other distractions, my focus could settle on the contents of the feeling-of-seeing and then they became actual, visible sights.\n\nIn this instance, I started witnessing different scenes of daily life from the monks who lived on the mountain while a voice explained to me what was happening. One showed them warning the village in the valley of an impending earthquake by ringing the temple bell. Another started with the voice saying \u2018watch out! The water level is about to rise\u2019 and I found myself standing in a stream bed bellow a wood and bamboo lock as two monks unlatched it to let dammed water flow into the place where I was standing.\n\nI definitely saw the bell when I visited. I didn\u2019t see a lock but there were irrigation streams and it is very plausible there was one there.\n\nI had a similar experience on the plane back. I find practicing on planes really interesting because the mix of people sometimes bring unusual sights or spirits with them. I\u2019d just read your post about phantom rooms for shared dreaming as well.\n\nIt started similarly. I got silent, reached out for any IOBs nearby and had the feeling-of-seeing the roots of a tree. There were figures hanging around the tree, like conmen. Not dangerous but waiting to take advantage of people. A voice was speaking to me again and for some reason these figures could not perceive or register me even though I felt like they ordinarily would have been able to.\n\nI let myself align to the feeling and then I could see in vivid bursts. I navigated around the tree and I was in the ruins of an abandoned fairground. Each time I\u2019d reach a location, I\u2019d see the next part of the path appear visually, sometimes with the voice shouting \u2018over there!\u2019 and pointing it out. I climbed over the roof of an old bus and through overgrown tunnels and holes in ceilings.\n\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll be able to get away with touching his things,\u201d the voice said and I noticed objects before me belonging to whoever \u2018he\u2019 was that claimed ownership over the fairground I guess. One of the objects was a wall hanging with little flowers cut out of gold vinyl.

It\u2019s not new information but it\u2019s definitely unpleasant for the very reason you talk about - stuff to do with \u2018me\u2019 feels so gross in comparison to silence and magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve also been more aware recently of a phase of perception before seeing images vividly. It\u2019s not \u2018imagination\u2019 but it\u2019s also not \u2018seeing\u2019 even though I can describe what I\u2019m perceiving as images. In the past I would discard it as imagination but it\u2019s not really that as I\u2019m not fantasising. And now I\u2019ve witnessed it evolve into vivid images and perceptions enough that I think it must be just an intermediary phase in perception. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had this happen twice recently. In the first instance I\u2019d been to a shrine on a mountain and tried to make contact with spirits there. After I left and turned in for the night I had the feeling-of-seeing this shrine but with bright, almost neon paint. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That feeling-of-seeing quickly became seeing as I focused and let myself allow it to happen. It\u2019s not the same as focusing with a laser-like focus as though pointing your eyes at something, it\u2019s much softer. It felt more that as I silenced myself and removed other distractions, my focus could settle on the contents of the feeling-of-seeing and then they became actual, visible sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this instance, I started witnessing different scenes of daily life from the monks who lived on the mountain while a voice explained to me what was happening. One showed them warning the village in the valley of an impending earthquake by ringing the temple bell. Another started with the voice saying \u2018watch out! The water level is about to rise\u2019 and I found myself standing in a stream bed bellow a wood and bamboo lock as two monks unlatched it to let dammed water flow into the place where I was standing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I definitely saw the bell when I visited. I didn\u2019t see a lock but there were irrigation streams and it is very plausible there was one there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience on the plane back. I find practicing on planes really interesting because the mix of people sometimes bring unusual sights or spirits with them. I\u2019d just read your post about phantom rooms for shared dreaming as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started similarly. I got silent, reached out for any IOBs nearby and had the feeling-of-seeing the roots of a tree. There were figures hanging around the tree, like conmen. Not dangerous but waiting to take advantage of people. A voice was speaking to me again and for some reason these figures could not perceive or register me even though I felt like they ordinarily would have been able to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I let myself align to the feeling and then I could see in vivid bursts. I navigated around the tree and I was in the ruins of an abandoned fairground. Each time I\u2019d reach a location, I\u2019d see the next part of the path appear visually, sometimes with the voice shouting \u2018over there!\u2019 and pointing it out. I climbed over the roof of an old bus and through overgrown tunnels and holes in ceilings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll be able to get away with touching his things,\u201d the voice said and I noticed objects before me belonging to whoever \u2018he\u2019 was that claimed ownership over the fairground I guess. One of the objects was a wall hanging with little flowers cut out of gold vinyl. I got this sense again that I was getting away with not being perceived by whoever was nearby, whether there was anyone really there or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it all disappeared and I had a proper phantom room briefly.

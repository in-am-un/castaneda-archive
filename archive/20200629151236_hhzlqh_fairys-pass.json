As we\u2019ve seen lately here, racism in any form is not good. Even if it\u2019s not really intended.\n\nI\u2019ve since gotten over my organic vs inorganic prejudices, but Fairy seems to like that shape now.\n\nI also have access to \u201cthe little smoke\u201d, and the other unnamed inorganic being given to Carlos by don Juan.  He introduced them to us, in private classes.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve noticed over the years that they have a habit of showing up at a moment that ends up teaching me something timely.\n\nStill, they don\u2019t ever talk to me.\n\nNot really.\n\nAnd they certainly don\u2019t announce they want to show me something.\n\nBut apparently Fairy can do that.\n\nI must admit, it\u2019s possible that Fairy is to the little smoke, as Clark Kent is to Superman.\n\nI supposed that would make Minx Bruce Wayne,  to the Devil\u2019s Weed ally\u2019s Batman.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun idea, except that if it\u2019s true all of you might have trouble finding an inorganic being.\n\nAt this point, I was assuming it was easy.  And this is a post on how to do it.\n\nBut there is some evidence that Fairy\u2019s identity is either concealed, or perhaps that she has more in common with the little smoke, than one might assume.\n\nMaybe they all tend to follow a pattern.\n\nWhen seen in daylight, Fairy is in fact a little puff of smoke.\n\nIf you look closely, it\u2019s made out of fibers of light.\n\nBut if a normal person noticed it, they\u2019d just assume it was a cigarette puff that drifted in from somewhere.\n\nDon Juan didn\u2019t explain why he called it, \u201cthe little smoke\u201d, except to say it had nothing to do with the pipe and the smoking mixture he used to lead Carlos to that ally.\n\nWhich of course was unnecessary, since Carlos introduced us to \u201cthe little smoke\u201d by pointing out that the water cooler had burped. He said, \"That's them\", just after he had pointed out their swooping action.\n\nThey swoop, like the moth over the campfire in Carlos' books.\n\nI supposed I won\u2019t resolve who Fairy really is, until you guys get your own inorganic beings.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Fairy wants me to show you. How to do that.  And why it works.\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to know the why, except that we\u2019re all terribly lazy. Without the why, I suspect some who might otherwise give it a try, will wait to see if anyone else has luck with it first.\n\nMaybe knowing why it works will motivate them not to sit on the sideline.\n\nToday I owe Fairy, so when I realized she was urgently telling me to write this, I got up at 4AM and left for work where the computer I need is located.\n\nIt\u2019s a little strange to do that, but since it disrupts routines and is a reasonable not-doing to take a Fairy seriously, I can\u2019t really complain about missing a little sleep.\n\nAnd I witnessed Carlos do something similar in private classes on multiple occasions.\n\nHe\u2019d show up to private class with an urgent task regarding us, and no one would ever understand exactly what he had in mind.\n\nI sort of do now. Fairy was pretty insistent. But it\u2019s not the kind of thing you\u2019d want to explain to a class in person.\n\nI owe Fairy, because in the last week when I walked from a dream into the real world and took a shower, Fairy was the reason I even realized that.\n\nI was inside a copy of my house, created by Cholita as a playground.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bfa1a7e4cfd65e4bd6eaf94fb569a58a22f1140](https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bfa1a7e4cfd65e4bd6eaf94fb569a58a22f1140)\n\nAt one point I knew it was time to get up and go to work, so I started for the shower.\n\nFairy was lounging on my bed. I should have realized that her form was too perfect to exist in the waking world, but when you\u2019re in a dream, and even if you know that, you\u2019re a little bit dense.\n\nStupid really.\n\nIt is what it is and you don\u2019t question things as much as you probably should.\n\nAs I started for the shower Fairy told me that she needed one also, and could I hurry up?\n\nGood advice that was!\n\nI did in fact hurry to the shower, passing through the portal in the hallway. Between Cholita\u2019s room, the bathroom, my bedroom, and the living room, there\u2019s a little hallway.\n\nIt\u2019s turned into a power spot, similar to the one in Carlos\u2019 compound on Pandora. The power spot there is behind a wooden beam which supports the second story.\n\nI quickly passed through that hallway and got right into the shower in the bathroom. I skipped the usual stuff like brushing my teeth or shaving.\n\nAs the hot water ran down my face, I finished returning to the waking world.\n\nI realized I\u2019d just walked out of a dream!\n\nThinking back on the sequence of events, I realize that if Fairy hadn\u2019t said that parting sentence, I would have assumed I  was merely in a daze on waking up, and had forgotten the sequence of events.\n\nBut with Fairy talking to me as I hurried through the portal, I had no way to explain what happened.\n\nSo owing Fairy, I present her own magical pass, retrieved from my memory thanks to her.\n\nThe pass comes from Carlos himself, shown in private classes.\n\nIt was a mystery to me why he showed us that movement. I believe it was around for a few classes, and might even have made it into a workshop.\n\nBut it\u2019s such a lame pass, it would take a Fairy to make any sense of it.\n\nAnd she has.\n\nFirst, some background.\n\nWhen Josefina first found colors in darkness, sitting next to La Gorda, she physically swished into her color.\n\nZuleica separated them from that point on.\n\nHow did she do that?\n\nThe answer is over here, in \u201cSilent Knowledge\u201d. I\u2019m banned from reading Carlos\u2019 publications, but I found this legitimately, researching something else.\n\nCarlos wrote this as he knew he was dying.\n\n\u201cIn their continuous search for solutions and answers to their probes, the sorcerers of ancient Mexico found out that from this condition of inner silence, the awareness of man can easily leap to the direct perception of energy against the background of any given horizon. They used the sky as a horizon, as well as the mountains, or in a more reduced space, the walls of their dwelling. They were capable of seeing energy reflected on those horizons as if they were at the movies.\u201d\n\nYou may notice the ability to view energy as if it were a movie projected onto a flat surface, matches what I\u2019ve posted about \u201cthe wall\u201d:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cdee2f6cbbc33a3d28a4041e3aaf159b3ba6725](https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cdee2f6cbbc33a3d28a4041e3aaf159b3ba6725)\n\nIn that last one, you can see that leaping into the second attention is possible with this technique. And in the upper right of this illustration:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f](https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f)\n\nIn another location, Carlos mentions that you can even use your hand as a flat surface, and see energy there. Or read text that comes from the second attention.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the answer to how Josefina pulled off her feat.\n\nShe used the puff of color she found as a flat surface, by gazing into the middle of it.\n\nI do that with the dreaming fog, when it gets chunky. At that point, it can be used just like a surface.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/b328lespwb551.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04f42ec223c6ba1fefee006f2102c7bd94d60099](https://preview.redd.it/b328lespwb551.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04f42ec223c6ba1fefee006f2102c7bd94d60099)\n\nRemembering that quote, tonight I was practicing Zuleica\u2019s pass, with the intention of gazing into the ball of light formed by the movement. I wanted to try to jump into it, the way Josefina had done.\n\nZuleica's pass was working unusually well, which was nice, seeing as how I had not slept the day before. I\u2019d practiced all night long.\n\n\\&gt; Old broken link and unknown picture: https : // preview.redd.it/k4v825tikj751.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=368b30ef3c8ec1126a763455417d098c604de2df\n\nDuring the day, I didn\u2019t seem to suffer from lack of sleep. That's something Carlos promised in Eagle\u2019s Gift. He said that being in heightened awareness was pretty much sleeping, even if you were active and conscious. Search for Zuleica in that book to find that.\n\nI became hypnotized by the puffs of bright light moving around when I used that pass, and noticed they were leaving streaks.\n\nWhen a bright puff of light is pushed around by the hand, it leaves various types of ripples.\n\nSome can reveal your luminous body, fibers and all.\n\nI switched to the basic V spot pass, where you use your pointed fingers to scoop light into the \u201cV spot\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s from Carlos\u2019 only book on Tensegrity.\n\nAgain, my efforts produced streaks in the air.\n\nGazing at one, I saw a familiar face.\n\n\u201cFairy! There you are. How come you don\u2019t stick around longer?\u201d, I said.\n\n\"You know I love you!  Why not stay a while?\"\n\nContinued...", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fairy\u2019s Pass", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"36ghaylxvv751": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 79, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/36ghaylxvv751.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9514944ea9c1d42f27c0e74adf1bfe4095b4f59c"}, {"y": 158, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/36ghaylxvv751.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=579f0add1b25f79761f85f4f482fde91b6c95379"}, {"y": 234, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/36ghaylxvv751.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fa1124a65ef7859cc28ce7d8fb754724561ec2"}, {"y": 468, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/36ghaylxvv751.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8b587adbca0935fa9b73e6fa0148332e0aa9e7a"}], "s": {"y": 562, "x": 767, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/36ghaylxvv751.jpg?width=767&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8083805281e9347fd08dbecb7266f8720e1a163f"}, "id": "36ghaylxvv751"}, "fiulcpxhov751": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 45, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b16a0f7085866100c85e131e49bd631f88136b"}, {"y": 90, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=492430d25ba6462d903d738408e4956b7e1d387f"}, {"y": 133, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba5cab0669569d133cc89172288ee5d0efcc229"}, {"y": 266, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f21a7c5c3e325391a7c2cc80694ebfc5c76fd802"}, {"y": 400, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df2300cbef034237f928433355dfa23b71a47d76"}, {"y": 450, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7887fa46b194a494d1fc6b09b6b7a0ba9fb68cf"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a483c2a96563e65cffeb4ce77e023079b0eb66da"}, "id": "fiulcpxhov751"}}, "name": "t3_hhzlqh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 20, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/UdXoUQsr3RB7Iohhv_PIVjDlNygB-tcBSeYebaWL0fM.jpg", "edited": 1696434046.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1593436356.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fiulcpxhov751.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a483c2a96563e65cffeb4ce77e023079b0eb66da\"&gt;Get an Inorganic Being as soon as you can!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/36ghaylxvv751.jpg?width=767&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8083805281e9347fd08dbecb7266f8720e1a163f\"&gt;How Cats and Don Juan Redeploy Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy wanted me to show you something today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy is the name I gave to an inorganic being I found by myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started off using scary shapes to frighten me, and being intolerant of inorganic life I suppose I coerced her into a more pleasing shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel bad about that.

I believe it was around for a few classes, and might even have made it into a workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s such a lame pass, it would take a Fairy to make any sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, some background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Josefina first found colors in darkness, sitting next to La Gorda, she physically swished into her color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica separated them from that point on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did she do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer is over here, in \u201cSilent Knowledge\u201d. I\u2019m banned from reading Carlos\u2019 publications, but I found this legitimately, researching something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wrote this as he knew he was dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn their continuous search for solutions and answers to their probes, the sorcerers of ancient Mexico found out that from this condition of inner silence, the awareness of man can easily leap to the direct perception of energy against the background of any given horizon. They used the sky as a horizon, as well as the mountains, or in a more reduced space, the walls of their dwelling. They were capable of seeing energy reflected on those horizons as if they were at the movies.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may notice the ability to view energy as if it were a movie projected onto a flat surface, matches what I\u2019ve posted about \u201cthe wall\u201d:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9cdee2f6cbbc33a3d28a4041e3aaf159b3ba6725\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/y0pfjl3vfly41.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9cdee2f6cbbc33a3d28a4041e3aaf159b3ba6725&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that last one, you can see that leaping into the second attention is possible with this technique. And in the upper right of this illustration:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In another location, Carlos mentions that you can even use your hand as a flat surface, and see energy there. Or read text that comes from the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there\u2019s the answer to how Josefina pulled off her feat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She used the puff of color she found as a flat surface, by gazing into the middle of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do that with the dreaming fog, when it gets chunky. At that point, it can be used just like a surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b328lespwb551.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=04f42ec223c6ba1fefee006f2102c7bd94d60099\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/b328lespwb551.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=04f42ec223c6ba1fefee006f2102c7bd94d60099&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remembering that quote, tonight I was practicing Zuleica\u2019s pass, with the intention of gazing into the ball of light formed by the movement. I wanted to try to jump into it, the way Josefina had done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass was working unusually well, which was nice, seeing as how I had not slept the day before. I\u2019d practiced all night long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Old broken link and unknown picture: https : // preview.redd.it/k4v825tikj751.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=368b30ef3c8ec1126a763455417d098c604de2df&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the day, I didn\u2019t seem to suffer from lack of sleep. That&amp;#39;s something Carlos promised in Eagle\u2019s Gift. He said that being in heightened awareness was pretty much sleeping, even if you were active and conscious. Search for Zuleica in that book to find that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I became hypnotized by the puffs of bright light moving around when I used that pass, and noticed they were leaving streaks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a bright puff of light is pushed around by the hand, it leaves various types of ripples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some can reveal your luminous body, fibers and all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I switched to the basic V spot pass, where you use your pointed fingers to scoop light into the \u201cV spot\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s from Carlos\u2019 only book on Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, my efforts produced streaks in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing at one, I saw a familiar face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFairy! There you are. How come you don\u2019t stick around longer?\u201d, I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know I love you!

I realized, I had to turn my gaze left to keep her in focus.\n\nIn fact, I had to keep turning to the left.

My neck was still a little twisted, so I lowered my chin to my chest, the way Carlos had shown us.\n\nAt the time, I thought maybe it was related to the silence stick, used to prevent the chin from falling forward onto the chest when practicing silence sitting in a chair.\n\nThat can be painful, so maybe Carlos added that stretch, in addition to the stick.\n\nFairy floated right some more, so I turned my head right.

There was a \u201csurface\u201d in the middle of them, and they were semi-transparent.\n\nEach time I turned and lowered my head on a spot, I gazed into the ball of light and saw a little vision.\n\nThe things I saw in the puffs were abstract, and not enough to describe. But Fairy kept me visually interested by floating just above the puffs.\n\nShe was consuming some type of energy released by that movement.\n\nI realized, it was actually a magical pass!\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an exercise Carlos showed us to help with our sore necks, from practicing silence in a chair.\n\nIt was magical pass I\u2019d forgotten.\n\nFairy got quite bright at that point, and I felt as if she were insisting, I had to go write it down.\n\nI realized, that\u2019s where Fairy had come from!\n\nI was following Zuleica\u2019s instructions, playing with colors in darkness.\n\nI started to gaze into them, but only because that seemed to make them brighter over time.\n\nIn one I noticed 2 dots and a line.\n\nIn my mind, I thought it looked like the 70s classic, \u201cHave a Nice Day\u201d happy face.\n\nThat puff of light scrolled away, and another even brighter came into view.\n\nI was a little shocked by the brightness of that one.\n\nAnd then another showed up, and bloomed into a 2 foot diameter woman\u2019s face, with an odd expression.\n\nIt was almost as if she were thinking, \u201cYou can see me???\u201d\n\nThat face began to animate. It changed to a new expression each second.\n\nAs I watched closer, it turned into a corpse.\n\nThe most horrible corpse you could imagine, with decaying flesh pulled away from filthy teeth, and clothes that were ragged and rotten.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t frighten me, because compared to \u201cthe little smoke\u201d, that vision was almost entertaining.\n\nBecause of my lucid dreaming practices, I realized I could change that corpse into anything I wanted.\n\nAnd so I coaxed the inorganic being into assuming a \u201csafe\u201d shape.\n\nA 4-inch-high fairy, who could fly around like a little ghost, but also stand up on my hand so I could look closer.\n\nShinzen Young, a Taiwanese Zen master, has done the same thing:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=1714&amp;v=xF5V9r7\\_ZHI&amp;t=25m40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;t=25m40s)\n\nHere then is the procedure for finding your own inorganic being.\n\nGaze into the puffs of color.

Internal Silence is required!  Go back and read Carlos' \"Silent Knowledge\" publication quote, if you didn't remember that.\n\nMy posts are pretty much all about what you can do with inner silence.  You always need it, or no magic will happen.\n\nLikewise, turning the upper torso far right and looking towards the ceiling can have the same effect.  It can release energy and produce bright lights.\n\nOr leaning way backwards while you look up. Howard Lee uses that one.\n\nOr stretching your shoulders, the way don Juan was said to have done, periodically.\n\nI suppose even a cat, when they gesticulate and stretch and yawn, is doing something similar.\n\nRedeploying energy.\n\nWhen you consciously do that, the inorganic beings notice you.\n\nI suspect everything we have comes from them.\n\nThey'll teach you by example, by moving a certain direction, or with a word or two at just the right moment.\n\nBut talkative they are not.\n\nThey have no mouth...", "edited": 1593451302.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fwd512c", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed that Fairy tended to fade out, unless I kept my gaze moving.

Go back and read Carlos&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; publication quote, if you didn&amp;#39;t remember that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My posts are pretty much all about what you can do with inner silence.  You always need it, or no magic will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, turning the upper torso far right and looking towards the ceiling can have the same effect.  It can release energy and produce bright lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or leaning way backwards while you look up. Howard Lee uses that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or stretching your shoulders, the way don Juan was said to have done, periodically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose even a cat, when they gesticulate and stretch and yawn, is doing something similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Redeploying energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you consciously do that, the inorganic beings notice you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect everything we have comes from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll teach you by example, by moving a certain direction, or with a word or two at just the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But talkative they are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have no mouth...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null,

My partner had noticed something like 4 IOBs around (I'd only noticed the one in the dark). Then, after trying for like a week for them to just come and chill and what not, I wasn't getting any \"feels\" in the dark anymore.\n\nMind you, I found this pretty odd.

I'm out. And when I told my partner, she said that she'd noticed they were missing as well.\n\nSo, that's where I'm at, for now.\n\nAs to the dark room I've created, it is certainly getting a strange kind of feel to it. How to describe it... it's the room I'm in most of the time and since making it a dark room not only have I lost track of if it is day or night (expected) I can't even feel if it is day or night, which as a pronouncedly strange effect.\n\nIt reminds me vaguely of the feeling one has a few hours after totally coming down from LSD. The feeling of things being just a bit... sideways.\n\nOne last thing. I've also been doing different rituals, since my path is of a ceremonial magickal style, and after doing a number of rituals I turned to face away from a very dim candle I had lit and my shadow loomed large on the wall before me.\n\nWhen I gazed into this deeper darkness (the dim candle was the only light in my darkroom) I felt I could see something in it. Kind of like when I gaze into the darkness lit by a single led on a router. Where it's almost total darkness, but not quite, yet while gazing it gets darker, and darker, until it seems like total darkness and there will be strange swishes in that darkness, but then if I start thinking rather than just watching, suddenly it'll be like the room is very well lit.\n\nWhich makes no logical sense, since the room's illumination hasn't changed, and my eyes had been gazing at the same illumination level for at least a half an hour (ruling out pupil adaptation).\n\nIn fact, at that point the room seems bizarrely illuminated. It just feels wrong to be able to see that clearly, but of course, perhaps it is totally normal. I'm still rather new to sitting myself in my dark room.\n\nBut... yes, since I've started doing it more, I'm just not getting that feeling of fear or dread anymore from dark places.\n\nIt'd be hilarious if I just had a phobia of the dark this whole time and I've cured it via this method. In which case, huzzah, progress of any sort is better than no progress!\n\nOh right, I was talking about my shadow. I did start to get similar tingles the longer I stared into it. At one point the head of my shadow appear to be growing in size, though I wasn't moving, and the candle hadn't changed, well, not at that point. As I stared more deeply into my strangely changing shadow, the candle did actually start to grow dimmer, and I thought it might even go out entirely, which was strange in and of itself, considering it was only half used.\n\nI'll stop there for now.

I&amp;#39;ve also been doing different rituals, since my path is of a ceremonial magickal style, and after doing a number of rituals I turned to face away from a very dim candle I had lit and my shadow loomed large on the wall before me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I gazed into this deeper darkness (the dim candle was the only light in my darkroom) I felt I could see something in it. Kind of like when I gaze into the darkness lit by a single led on a router. Where it&amp;#39;s almost total darkness, but not quite, yet while gazing it gets darker, and darker, until it seems like total darkness and there will be strange swishes in that darkness, but then if I start thinking rather than just watching, suddenly it&amp;#39;ll be like the room is very well lit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes no logical sense, since the room&amp;#39;s illumination hasn&amp;#39;t changed, and my eyes had been gazing at the same illumination level for at least a half an hour (ruling out pupil adaptation).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, at that point the room seems bizarrely illuminated. It just feels wrong to be able to see that clearly, but of course, perhaps it is totally normal. I&amp;#39;m still rather new to sitting myself in my dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... yes, since I&amp;#39;ve started doing it more, I&amp;#39;m just not getting that feeling of fear or dread anymore from dark places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;d be hilarious if I just had a phobia of the dark this whole time and I&amp;#39;ve cured it via this method. In which case, huzzah, progress of any sort is better than no progress!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh right, I was talking about my shadow. I did start to get similar tingles the longer I stared into it. At one point the head of my shadow appear to be growing in size, though I wasn&amp;#39;t moving, and the candle hadn&amp;#39;t changed, well, not at that point. As I stared more deeply into my strangely changing shadow, the candle did actually start to grow dimmer, and I thought it might even go out entirely, which was strange in and of itself, considering it was only half used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll stop there for now. I hope this helps/resonates with someone in a helpful fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_hhzlqh", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hhzlqh/fairys_pass/g1utm25/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1597671721.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1597671721.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fzmx655", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fzlg3ve", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "This is the 3rd report of seeing \"blackness\" instead of colors.\n\nBut as something that stands out, so that the person believes it's unusual.\n\nBecause I've gotten so many reports about the blackness, I was scooping it last night.\n\nYou can use it just like the purple puffs.

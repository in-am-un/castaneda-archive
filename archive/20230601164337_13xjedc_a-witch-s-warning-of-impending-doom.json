Us doing things cause we wanna. Exploding from the heart with so many feelings that our minds use perfectly because they're something approximating *silent*, but FILLED with life. All movement and all power available. Seeing everyone with an indescribably new and beautiful feeling for each one. Feeling safe because nobodies twisted minds want anything horrible, and if they did, we'd recognize it immediately.\n\nI think we don't because we're more afraid of THAT than we are of death, loss, isolation and betrayal!!! It's almost like that's what we're used to.. We're not used to living and feeling everything around us exactly as we want, exactly as we are. That's so much more vulnerable and so much more information and meaning it's *literally* unbelievable. And the change is even harder because it's too good to be true! Power \"which is also what we are\" literally just SET THIS UP FOR US.\n\nOr maybe I'm just full of shit and this is nonsense and we have to work at it for years and years to get what we want.\n\nHow fucking dark and depressing is that???? \n\nIt reminds me of the journey to Ixtlan. They're not just trying to attain power, they are power. And they don't just have what they want, they try to attain what they want. When Janero says he'll never fully get there, it's because his intent is to get there. He's living the journey, and getting really close only in moments. THATS their beautiful story. The indescribable lonliness they felt is the result of the madness of constantly searching, rather than being all of what is searched for. It's an ENTIRELY different mood. One is basically the entire stage of the human journey up to this point, and the other is fully being and witnessing the reality all-together. Actually HAVING all you want!! Something, in their life, in their tradition, they were only capable of in spans of time as the \"nagual\". It's like making the dream world and the real world together as one. But it's almost like they're always the same anyway, and it's our collective choice to *attain* it, for *real*. \n\nWe say things are a matter of intent because intent always functions based on what we want. Counter intent is the denial of what we want, which is our free use of existence, as existence, with existence, in existence. We wanted to search for existence in order to *truly* attain existence, in order to complete the greatest love, power, redemption story imaginable. But that completion, that totality is literally just the beginning of what we want. We get to use all of it exactly how we would! To use *eternity* exactly how we want! \n\nPart of the madness and agony and lonliness of those three men in that room during the discussion of the journey to Ixtlan, is people's incapability to witness the totality of each other. It is so real, so much energy, so dream-like and reality bending, that it drives people insane to they point it can actually *kill them* by causing immense friction within the totality of who they are and what they want, and the control structure which essentially creates who they are. How utterly fucking sad is that... but maybe it's also just incredibly fucking cool.\n\nI want it so bad, but wanting it is damn near like the second step in not having it! What would it take to alleviate the betrayal of the nagual? Do we have to see it's shine without burdening it and ourselves with our disbelief?

I imagine he would be moving in society making things right. If such a thing is even necessary or feasible. I like to think it is. That is also my predilection. Because fucked up and weird shit happens all the time in many societies and it just continues to get bigger and more complicated and even less aware/connected on a real tangible level. People in power who have no idea what the fuck. I have to believe we can have some kind of change that will make things feel right and good and fair and honest and exciting and all that shit happening consistently between everyone.

They're not even powerful and secure in themselves and they try to run billion dollar companies and make massive decisions for thousands of people. It's running on autopilot and it needs to shut the fuck up. Maybe people will just start dreaming and it'll change before they realize what's happening. No idea!\n\nYall are the most reliable people I know and sometimes I still wonder if yall narrowed yourself too inwardly on this dream of Sorcery and power. Use that power to fix this shit! I know yall care and you see the block, you feel the block, you know the resistance to it happening. You know how to empower that God awfully beautiful reality of Sorcery being mainstream and the river of shit being shat upon and discarded. I know its so massive it inspires amnesia and insanity but it's there. Just fuckin sitting there. Someone's gotta shock people awake to what's around them and I don't know other people more suited to the task.\n\nMaybe I'm just fucking crazy and indulging like a mf! I don't know half the time. How could we not build a utopia and feel 1000\u00d7 more than we do with love, trust and power? How could something so God awfully beautiful be swept under the rug?

Ideally a local food network and close knit. So that if shit fucks the fan, people can actually think together and not just scramble over each other&amp;#39;s corpses in absolute disheveled misery. That is, if you even care about this apparent reality and everyone in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just being honest. I hope yall stay safe this is my favorite sub. If I may be so bold - don&amp;#39;t just focus on the Sorcery and the experiencing. Don Juan would probably say if he was here that we should empower our bodies to solve these problems. I imagine he would be moving in society making things right. If such a thing is even necessary or feasible. I like to think it is. That is also my predilection. Because fucked up and weird shit happens all the time in many societies and it just continues to get bigger and more complicated and even less aware/connected on a real tangible level. People in power who have no idea what the fuck. I have to believe we can have some kind of change that will make things feel right and good and fair and honest and exciting and all that shit happening consistently between everyone. Probably starts individually and then in unbelievably strong bonds locally and then as larger communities and then eventually the way of life takes over a nation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because if it never does I&amp;#39;m going to have to strive alone or with only a few and I would absolutely hate that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Christians think Jesus will come fix everything and Buddhists believe it doesn&amp;#39;t even matter when you just fuckin feel good anyway and atheists believe technological prosperity is the key, blah blah blah. We know what the fuck is up. People don&amp;#39;t even feel what&amp;#39;s in front of their fucking face and they want to change it. They don&amp;#39;t even feel what they want and they try to get it. They&amp;#39;re not even powerful and secure in themselves and they try to run billion dollar companies and make massive decisions for thousands of people. It&amp;#39;s running on autopilot and it needs to shut the fuck up. Maybe people will just start dreaming and it&amp;#39;ll change before they realize what&amp;#39;s happening. No idea!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yall are the most reliable people I know and sometimes I still wonder if yall narrowed yourself too inwardly on this dream of Sorcery and power. Use that power to fix this shit! I know yall care and you see the block, you feel the block, you know the resistance to it happening. You know how to empower that God awfully beautiful reality of Sorcery being mainstream and the river of shit being shat upon and discarded. I know its so massive it inspires amnesia and insanity but it&amp;#39;s there. Just fuckin sitting there. Someone&amp;#39;s gotta shock people awake to what&amp;#39;s around them and I don&amp;#39;t know other people more suited to the task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m just fucking crazy and indulging like a mf! I don&amp;#39;t know half the time. How could we not build a utopia and feel 1000\u00d7 more than we do with love, trust and power? How could something so God awfully beautiful be swept under the rug? Sheeeeiiiiittttttt &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;..I need to go work on keeping deer from feasting on our bean plants \ud83d\ude02.

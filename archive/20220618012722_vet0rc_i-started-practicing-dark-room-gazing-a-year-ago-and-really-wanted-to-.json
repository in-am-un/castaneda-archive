But I never could take my  practice to the level that would be so tangible, so profound, that it  would change who I was. \u00a0\n\nI believed if I move to America, I could possibly  meet with Reni and Nyei Murez and they, as the students of Carlos, would  help me to expand my practice and move my assemblage point. I truly  believed they could it.\n\nIt took some time for me to move to USA, about  several years. Finally, when everything was done - I moved to the US,  got a job, was able to pay my bills - I bought my first workshop! It was  in NY Omega \u00a0Yoga institute in 2015 and it was  with Nyei! I was excited. To make a long story short it was a week long  retreat of tensegrity practice, we did a lot of magical passes and the  theater of Infinity. But that was about it \u2013after the workshop I came  back the same idiot I was before getting there.  I saw it was a fruitless effort, but there was a hope! They said if I  take a facilitators training I will be REALLY learning! So I was sold. I  took a level 1 facilitators training, but several months into the  training I already knew: once I finish the level  1 - I won\u2019t go to the level 2. That was just useless for me. Well, I  wasn\u2019t that easy to give up, so I made a decision to try again, and got  on a tour to Mexico, this time with Reni. It was in 2016. The cost was  5K plus the flight tickets. I was ready to pay  if I get a good boost of energy and would be able to learn.  Unfortunately, the result was the same. I got nothing except of pretty  pictures of Olmec heads. There was a bunch of talking, less of magical  passes, and no help to my personal practice. \n\nOne good thing did happen \u2013 I met a person who  later became my recapping partner. That guy mentioned the subreddit of  Carlos Castaneda to me. So what can I say? I am really grateful to my  recap partner and to all of you guys, who share  with me this practice. From the first week of doing dark room gazing I  was impressed. I saw the difference in my behavior already. I started  changing. Finally! I stopped reacting on things, I started seeing my  motivations and motives of other people. I could  sense the hooks the society plugged in us with relationship, habits,  etc. My recapitulation took a new level and much deeper, darker stuff  started coming out and I kept digging. We are as dirty as the secrets we  keep. Everything started \u201cmoving\u201d and became  lighter. And I changed my entire life: I dropped everything that was  not important at this point- meeting with friends, teaching yoga (it was  my hobby and I was successful), watching unnecessary videos,\u00a0 FB  chatting, texting. I needed free time, I need my  2 to 3 hours at night (sometimes 4) to sit in a dark room with the mask  on. Little by little my life became what I always wanted it to be: a  solo journey to hunt for mystery. So what did I achieve? I am definitely  more stable in my silence, although I have  to work my bum off to get to the point when it becomes a bit easier, I  see the puffs, like I used to in my  childhood, I play with them, scoop them, dance with them, occasionally  (not every night) I see the faces. That\u2019s a  real fun! I saw a face of a woman changed into a face of a child, it  was like a real Hollywood movie right in front of my face. I saw a devil  like man, multiple scary faces with open mouths. I saw large eyes. I  saw a part of the town with the tower among the  trees, as vivid as if I was looking out of my window, I saw a corridor  or a long hall with the high ceiling with my eyes totally open. I was  not asleep. And my conscious dreams got better. I can\u2019t say it is a lot,  but it is enough to keep me going. And the  bonus is- as a side effect of the practice, my body healed the long  lasting disease. What can I say other than, that I am really grateful to  Dan and other people for this practice and for  keeping the pure intent of this reddit. I hope next year of the practice  will give me something new to post and I am always glad to read the  posts that have more details and encouraging information. So guys, please keep it going.

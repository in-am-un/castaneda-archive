Eight of  these magical passes are performed on the left arm and wrist (and various other points on the body further detailed in the book). The sorcerers  of ancient Mexico considered the first eight magical passes to be the first  step toward the liberation of the left body from the unwarranted dominion of the right body.\n\nThese magical passes can be performed in a standing position, as shown,  or better yet, while lying down.\n\n[diagram](https://preview.redd.it/1q9qf5x6xcd41.jpg?width=565&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f05549e107409bddd248503ecd39cb37bdf8e264)\n\n1. The first movement pertains to the outer side of the main tendon  of the biceps of the left arm (point #1). A ball is applied to that hollow spot and  made to vibrate by moving it back and forth with a slight pressure (fig 01):\n\n[point #1 on diagram](https://preview.redd.it/3hjh4kcmycd41.jpg?width=221&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3ab476ff999a8b776fa48d7313f66639d8d4d9e)\n\n[figure 01](https://preview.redd.it/k7ttb569zcd41.jpg?width=221&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fbc62b9c150b170104819816ffc3d3c884fe0f8)\n\n2. In the second movement, a ball is held in the hollow palm of the right hand (fig 2), with the thumb holding it securely).  Using firm but light pressure, the ball is rubbed back and forth in the canal created by the tendons of the wrist (point #2), to a point one hand's width away from the wrist.\n\n[figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/71un8bbt1dd41.jpg?width=220&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d90ae06c516612e7accebf0cc19dd35c83183af)\n\n[point #2 on diagram](https://preview.redd.it/l9700k9n0dd41.jpg?width=208&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56c46e0cde79933429f7159634c2c1a07f0a3f62)\n\n3. The ball is lightly pressed at a point on the left forearm a hand's width away from the wrist (point #3), as pictured in figure 3.\n\n[point # 3 on diagram](https://preview.redd.it/o7mcyzyh2dd41.jpg?width=191&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee8b1570e7e0897e83e436b92037cc0721a77228)\n\n[figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/nmfsmlu3bdd41.jpg?width=219&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de2037d617b3c453ef29aac37447a376bb747544)\n\n4. A moderate pressure is applied at the wrist of the left arm with  the index finger of the right hand on a spot next to the head of the forearm bone (point #4, left diagram image). The right thumb anchors the hand on the inside of the wrist  (point #4, right diagram image), and moves the hand back and forth (figs 4-5).\n\n[point # 4 on the diagram](https://preview.redd.it/r7rmis6z2dd41.jpg?width=154&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28e0046c5389ac12169c206e7ddfbfb03d16f31f)\n\n[figure 4](https://preview.redd.it/catmou7b3dd41.jpg?width=156&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c2a0a5ab977e4558ea2af123e726411d590d99d)\n\n[figure 5](https://preview.redd.it/9h0jfwed3dd41.jpg?width=156&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=204395eb372f7f9709e61c09c0b55fa4a077c118)\n\n5.  Point #5 on the diagram, just below the base of the middle finger. No description given. Do what feels right, following the same general procedures. I'm thinking circular, always counter-clockwise, then out toward the tip of the middle finger.\n\n6. The ball is applied to the inner side of the tendon of the left biceps (point # 6),  and it is made to vibrate with a slight pressure (fig 6).\n\n[point #6 on diagram](https://preview.redd.it/lu5bpbyo6dd41.jpg?width=222&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63452a6d79d50455b5284b4cb9d5521cd1c4b083)\n\n[figure 6](https://preview.redd.it/u1cnq7gr6dd41.jpg?width=221&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb2d85bf33e3d2fc5ecd200f76522c7299904c78)\n\n7. A vibration is applied to the hollow spot at the back of the elbow to the left of the elbow proper (point #7 on the diagram). The palm of the left hand is twisted and  turned outward to allow maximum opening of that area (figure 7). The ball is rubbed there (at the arrow-indicated point).\n\n[figure 7](https://preview.redd.it/i7pebb097dd41.jpg?width=222&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba4a806f11549e70b2a3970624e49ca78bcd6ff)\n\n8. Moderate pressure is applied to a spot in the middle of the upper left arm (point #8 out of frame on the diagram), on the hollow spot where the triceps joins the bone (figure 8).\n\n[point #8](https://preview.redd.it/c85cpoje8dd41.jpg?width=222&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40a123017103978dbb290365f79fe9cb8574ff23)\n\n[figure 8](https://preview.redd.it/b78q2nes8dd41.jpg?width=221&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0c5cd1cc9775622030254ad9b8b310c553e1b56)\n\n9. Finally, the left elbow is bent sharply and is rolled forward, engaging the  left shoulder blade, to disperse tendon energy to the whole left body (figure 9).\n\n[figure 9](https://preview.redd.it/i3yc8g949dd41.jpg?width=221&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6217e9ad4a060a636fb0d9eb2b3f948b251ee7a5)\n\nThe rest of the passes from this series, dealing with the core

Conjunction with Specific Magical Passes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This first category of magical passes that use the help of a device  consists of sixteen magical passes aided by the Teflon balls. Eight of  these magical passes are performed on the left arm and wrist (and various other points on the body further detailed in the book). The sorcerers  of ancient Mexico considered the first eight magical passes to be the first  step toward the liberation of the left body from the unwarranted dominion of the right body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These magical passes can be performed in a standing position, as shown,  or better yet, while lying down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1q9qf5x6xcd41.jpg?width=565&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f05549e107409bddd248503ecd39cb37bdf8e264\"&gt;diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The first movement pertains to the outer side of the main tendon  of the biceps of the left arm (point #1). A ball is applied to that hollow spot and  made to vibrate by moving it back and forth with a slight pressure (fig 01):&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3hjh4kcmycd41.jpg?width=221&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b3ab476ff999a8b776fa48d7313f66639d8d4d9e\"&gt;point #1 on diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k7ttb569zcd41.jpg?width=221&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4fbc62b9c150b170104819816ffc3d3c884fe0f8\"&gt;figure 01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the second movement, a ball is held in the hollow palm of the right hand (fig 2), with the thumb holding it securely).  Using firm but light pressure, the ball is rubbed back and forth in the canal created by the tendons of the wrist (point #2), to a point one hand&amp;#39;s width away from the wrist.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/71un8bbt1dd41.jpg?width=220&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8d90ae06c516612e7accebf0cc19dd35c83183af\"&gt;figure 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l9700k9n0dd41.jpg?width=208&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=56c46e0cde79933429f7159634c2c1a07f0a3f62\"&gt;point #2 on diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ball is lightly pressed at a point on the left forearm a hand&amp;#39;s width away from the wrist (point #3), as pictured in figure 3.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o7mcyzyh2dd41.jpg?width=191&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ee8b1570e7e0897e83e436b92037cc0721a77228\"&gt;point # 3 on diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nmfsmlu3bdd41.jpg?width=219&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=de2037d617b3c453ef29aac37447a376bb747544\"&gt;figure 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A moderate pressure is applied at the wrist of the left arm with  the index finger of the right hand on a spot next to the head of the forearm bone (point #4, left diagram image). The right thumb anchors the hand on the inside of the wrist  (point #4, right diagram image), and moves the hand back and forth (figs 4-5).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r7rmis6z2dd41.jpg?width=154&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=28e0046c5389ac12169c206e7ddfbfb03d16f31f\"&gt;point # 4 on the diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/catmou7b3dd41.jpg?width=156&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4c2a0a5ab977e4558ea2af123e726411d590d99d\"&gt;figure 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9h0jfwed3dd41.jpg?width=156&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=204395eb372f7f9709e61c09c0b55fa4a077c118\"&gt;figure 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point #5 on the diagram, just below the base of the middle finger.

The palm of the left hand is twisted and  turned outward to allow maximum opening of that area (figure 7). The ball is rubbed there (at the arrow-indicated point).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i7pebb097dd41.jpg?width=222&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5ba4a806f11549e70b2a3970624e49ca78bcd6ff\"&gt;figure 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moderate pressure is applied to a spot in the middle of the upper left arm (point #8 out of frame on the diagram), on the hollow spot where the triceps joins the bone (figure 8).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Finally, the left elbow is bent sharply and is rolled forward, engaging the  left shoulder blade, to disperse tendon energy to the whole left body (figure 9).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

It cuts across the upper and lower abdomen from the edge of the rib cage to the groin, and from there it goes to the toes.\"\n\n\"Doesn't this current include the head, don Juan?\" I asked, bewildered. As a Western man, I expected that anything of this sort would have originated in the brain.\n\n\"No,\" he said emphatically, \"it doesn't include the head. What comes from the head is a different kind of energetic current; not what I am talking about. One of the formidable attainments of sorcerers is that in the end, they push out whatever exists in the center of energy located at the top of the head, and then they anchor the tendon energy of the rest of their bodies there. But that is a paragon of success. At the moment, what we have at hand, as in your case, is the average situation of tendon energy beginning at the neck at the place where it joins the head. In some cases tendon energy goes up to a point below the cheekbones, but never higher than that point.\n\n\"This energy,\" he went on, \"which I call tendon energy for lack of a better name, is a dire necessity in the lives of those who travel in infinity, or want to travel in it.\"\n\nDon Juan said that the traditional beginning in the utilization of tendon energy was the use of some simple devices which were employed by the shamans of ancient Mexico in two ways. One was to create a vibratory effect on specific centers of tendon energy, and the other was to create a pressure effect on the same centers. He explained that those shamans considered the vibratory effect to be the agent for loosening the energy which has become stagnant. The second effect, the pressure effect, was thought to be the agent that disperses the energy.\n\n**What seems to be a cognitive contradiction for modern man - that vibration would loosen anything that was stuck, and that pressure would disperse it - was deeply emphasized** by don Juan Matus, who taught his disciples that what appears to be natural to us in terms of our cognition in the world is not at all natural in terms of the flow of energy. He said that in the world of everyday life, human beings would crack something with a blow, or by applying pressure, and disperse it by making it vibrate. However, **energy which had become lodged in a tendon center had to be rendered fluid through vibration, and then it had to be pressed, so that it would continue flowing. Don Juan Matus was horrified at the idea of directly pressing points of energy in the body without the preliminary vibration. His contention was that energy that was stuck would get even more inert if pressure were applied to it.**\n\nDon Juan started off his disciples with two basic devices. He explained that the shamans of ancient times used to search for a pair of round pebbles or dry round seed pods, and use them as vibratory and pressure devices to aid in manipulating the flow of energy in the body, which they believed becomes periodically stuck along the tendon track. However, the round pebbles that shaman practitioners normally used were definitely too hard, and the seed pods too fragile. \n\nOther objects that those shamans searched for avidly were flat rocks the size of the hand or pieces of heavy wood, in order to place them on specific areas of tendon energy on their abdomens while they were lying flat on their backs. The first area is just below the navel; another is right on top of the navel, and another yet, on the area of the solar plexus. The problem with using rocks or other objects is that they have to be heated or cooled to approximate the temperature of the body, and besides, these objects are usually too stiff, and they slide and move around.\n\nThe (modern version of the) device, the leather weight, has been found to be an ideal device for creating a steady pressure on centers of tendon energy. Unlike rocks, it is pliable enough to adapt itself to the contours of the body. Its leather cover makes it possible to be applied directly to the body without needing to be warmed or cooled. However, its most remarkable feature is its weight. It is light enough not to cause any discomfort, and yet heavy enough to aid some specific magical passes that foster inner silence by pressing centers on the abdomen.\n\nDon Juan Matus said that a weight placed on any of the three areas mentioned above engages the totality of one's energy fields, which means a momentary shutting off of the internal dialogue: the first step toward inner silence.\"", "edited": 1580156863.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ffres2q", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Vital Information from pages 246-248 of the Magical Passes PDF:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Devices Used in Conjunction with Specific Magical Passes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, the shamans of ancient Mexico put a special emphasis on a force they called tendon energy.

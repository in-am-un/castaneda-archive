I was trying to verify something my inorganic being \"Fancy\" told me last night.\n\nI was doing tensegrity and saw the face of a witch I know floating by in the disturbances Tensegrity creates.\n\nI said, \"Hey!  You aren't an inorganic being?  What are you doing on that puff?\"\n\nFancy said, \"Women are inorganic beings.  You know that!\"\n\nNo, they aren't.\n\nBut I did remember Carol Tiggs saying it.  So I went looking in the collected lecture notes.  Carol doesn't have a book, so I figured I must have read that in some lecture notes.\n\nCouldn't find it.  But then I noticed some notes where Carlos was talking like he did in private classes.\n\nSo for the \"prudish\" among you, who say there were \"too many shenanigans\" around Carlos,  maybe you just weren't listening?  I'm afraid the Olmecs were not \"politically correct\". And we follow their intent.\n\nBesides, men and women both are this nasty, when there's no sex police around.\n\nCarlos didn't hold back in private classes.  Much...\n\nI'm assuming this is an argentinian interview, only because of the interviewer saying, \"what do you think?\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nCarlos, you have been praised, defamed, accused and defended. There are many who say that your books are no more than mere fantasy, very well written, but totally invented by you. What do you think of it?\n\nDon Juan cannot invent anything. I can't invent either, I just repeat what he told me. Later, when I have corroborated something, it is when it takes on some meaning. Like you, I am a reporter.\n\nDo you consider yourself a mediator between indigenous and European cultures?\n\nNo, because witches are in no way interested in making what they know known.\n\nSo what is it, how does Mexico exist for them?\n\nIt is not, it does not exist. They are Indians, they do not understand that concept. Mexico \"is\" for Europeans. For the Indians there are only \"people who are going to die.\" They speak a special language; I would have to see Europeans as \"my people who are going to die.\" A little while ago you told me that we laymen can never predict what a sorcerer is going to do, because his other life remains in the dark for us; that we only see what they want us to see.\n\nTell me, Carlos: what does it take to be a witch?\n\nSolitude is a requirement in the particular brotherhood represented by the Yaqui Indian Don\n\nJuan Matus. Witchcraft is a knowledge that has been passed from generation to generation, through oral tradition and its practice.\n\nSince when does this knowledge exist?\n\nThe idea of what it implies is very old, it belongs to the hunters and gatherers of food that preceded agricultural societies. According to don Juan, the sorcerer has never belonged to society, he has never been involved in its tasks. For thousands of years, witchcraft has been practiced in various forms in Mexican culture. The Conquest was a catalyst that completely disrupted the indigenous social order; the priests, who were the herald of that order, were destroyed, but the same did not happen with the witches, who have always been eccentric. As I already told you - and that is important - they have never participated in society.\n\nNot even in the role of healers?\n\nThey are all herbalists!\n\nBeing a herbalist and healer does not mean that one is acting in and for a social community. Those are just stages that a man of knowledge goes through to reach the end of his journey as a solitary sorcerer. Of course, there are herbalists who are witches, but no one knows where they end up next. \n\nWithin your learning practices you have used drugs. Are you still doing it?\n\nDon Juan has never been a fan of drugs. He gave them to me to drink because I am very rough. Certain drugs give you a different idea, a new vision of some things. With them the hegemony of perception is broken; but once he has accomplished this, the sorcerer no longer uses them.\n\nThat drug-witchcraft conjunction was due to the great initial impact that your books had among the psychedelic subcultures that were in fashion.\n\nYes, but this was circumstantial. It is true that certain types of drugs have opened a very interesting path of self-analysis and search, but they have caused great damage, because the use of drugs implies dependence. Here in Mexico, in various circles, I know many people who are \"thunderous\", and vices make them victims of a series of injuries. Marijuana does not help, neither drug offers a new path.\n\nAnd sexuality, what role does it play in witchcraft? Could it be by chance similar to what it plays in some Eastern religions, in which sexual activity is considered a kind of mystical ladder?\n\nDon Juan has never made mention of it.\n\nAnd what is Carlos Castaneda's opinion?\n\nI would simply say that sex is very natural.\n\nCould you be more explicit?\n\nIn the sexual act there is a transmission of luminosities, an exchange ... Don Juan has tied up a lot of old women, and I find this very natural. He and I never talk about it, because talking about sex is like talking about food: are you hungry? Well, eat!\n\nI know that now in our western society we even have treatises on sexology, but this is very similar to what happens with cookbooks; there are thousands of them, millions, but no one cooks anymore. The same thing is happening with sex: nobody fucks.\n\nAnd what do witches think about it?\n\nWhat can one do with the dick? After five minutes it comes out and that's it. Sorcerers are very simple. If they like a woman, they take her, but they never do it with an empty woman. And the same goes for witches.\n\nDon Juan laughed because I fucked everyone ... he followed the advice my grandfather once gave me: \"you can never have all the women in the world, but take the test.\"\n\nI saw a woman and immediately said to don Juan: \"What a great ass!\" And he would answer me with a question: \"Will it last like this for thirty years?\"\n\nWhen you say that a witch or warlock never sleeps with an empty person, what are you referring to?\n\nHave you had children?\n\nNo.\n\nSee the people who do. They think: \u201cwhat has come to complement me is having a child\u201d, but it is not like that. What really happens is that, when a child is born, it pulls the spirits of the father and mother to itself, it takes away their madness and leaves them incomplete. The world is made by and for incomplete men. Of course, there are also people who are still complete, even if they are old and seem crazy. The incomplete man, know it, is the one who is always talking about morality and immorality.\n\nBut both you and don Juan have had children.\n\nWhen a sorcerer has children, he regains his spirit. Don Juan Matus, the Toltec demon (so I tell him) waited until 1940 to pull the spirit out of his children, when they were already developed. We, one day, we take the spirit out of our parents, and you, at some point, are condemned to give it to someone ... and there is the old and stupid dad, he talks and talks and talks; it joins everything and is not part of anything. A complete man has no causes.\n\nAnd what happens to children when their parents regain their spirit?\n\nWell, they look as if they, in turn, had had children. This gruesome and nihilistic explanation is also new to me, it is a radical concept that imposes a gruesome responsibility on us.\n\nWhat does that responsibility consist of?\n\nI better give you examples. What does the Catholic religion do? It forces its leaders to be celibate, and consequently, complete. Believers are the incomplete. This is a very important relationship, because it creates in the priest the consciousness of the leader, of the true complete nahual, it removes him from the path of reproduction and the danger of being a follower. People who are not complete are scared of me. I disappoint them and they tell me:\n\n\"Wow, I imagined it differently ...\"\n\nAnd this happens because they have wanted to turn me into a guru, they want to pigeonhole me within their social order and they expect me to behave as an incomplete man. Those few gurus who are complete are hardly accessible. The complete man, sometimes, when he is very pressured, he takes out everything that he has under the plate and does a lot, he pulls it, he pulls it, and one day it is there.\n\nOf course, this is not what we would call an ordinary way of looking at things.\n\nNo, because we as Europeans have never been able to conceive it, that's all. I personally strive to live this reality. I try to live as a complete man and among the whole world, the only one who has been able to give me lessons on this vital art is a lousy and dirty Indian.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suppose that now, when you are going to have relations with a woman, you take all kinds of precautions not to impregnate her.\n\nDon Juan is an extraordinary trickster who has laughed at me for fifteen years, because I am a fucking asshole. Recently, one of his apprentices told me about everything don Juan did to me. I looked like an asshole for not being an Indian. Once he cured my penis so that I would not have children again, he grabbed some leaves and rubbed the bug on me.\n\nMy grandfather taught me to be a male, and a male does not allow himself to be grabbed by another male. So I begged don Juan to please not say any of that to anyone, and the first thing he did was tell everyone that he had rubbed it on me!\n\nDid the cure work?\n\nYes, later I had the opportunity to verify it in the laboratory. I asked the sperm count, and in the course of twelve years they have not increased.\n\nAnd what were those herbs? You could make a fortune \u2026\n\nThe formula is not what is important, but the certainty, the force with which it is done. One day I told a friend what the herbs were and he rubbed them ... his cock almost fell off; it swelled up and he had to see a doctor. They applied a treatment that lasted a month and warned him that it might not stop again; so he hates me.\n\nIt is not for less. Carlos, during the interview you mentioned your grandfather several times ... I think he is an important person for you, do you want to tell us about him?\n\nMy grandfather's pichurro, old prick, made me see the world like this: when I was about seven years old, he told me: \u201cif you don't get to that little girl, you're no longer my friend. And don't forget that she has a maid who is very good to me \u201d.\n\nAnd there I was going to introduce myself: \"my grandfather sends me ... I'm an orphan.\" They always adored me immediately and told me: \"little fetish orphan, come on in.\"\n\nAfter three days, behind me, my grandfather arrived.\n\nStill lives?\n\nNo, he passed away at the age of eighty. He died dreaming that he was fucking, with a hideous erection. The doctor said: \"see what a man this is, so old and so virile.\" And that was the old man who created me; we got along very well, we understood each other.\n\nWhat other memories do you have of him?\n\nWell, he used to say to me: \u201cDo you think the old women are going to say yes? They are going to say no! And there is the interesting thing: since they are not going to open the door, you must enter through the window \u201d.\n\nHe was an old whore, a vile Sicilian. One day I protested and told him: \"Grandpa, it doesn't smell good to women.\" He slapped me and said, \u201cThat's the smell of life, you idiot! This is all there is, you brute ... \"\n\n\" Yes, yes, grandpa, I like it! \" How could one refuse?\n\nWhere they lived?\n\nHe had a farm in Jundeia\u00ed, in the state of Sao Paulo. A place full of eucaliptos.

And don&amp;#39;t forget that she has a maid who is very good to me \u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there I was going to introduce myself: &amp;quot;my grandfather sends me ... I&amp;#39;m an orphan.&amp;quot; They always adored me immediately and told me: &amp;quot;little fetish orphan, come on in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After three days, behind me, my grandfather arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still lives?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, he passed away at the age of eighty. He died dreaming that he was fucking, with a hideous erection. The doctor said: &amp;quot;see what a man this is, so old and so virile.&amp;quot; And that was the old man who created me; we got along very well, we understood each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What other memories do you have of him?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, he used to say to me: \u201cDo you think the old women are going to say yes? They are going to say no! And there is the interesting thing: since they are not going to open the door, you must enter through the window \u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was an old whore, a vile Sicilian. One day I protested and told him: &amp;quot;Grandpa, it doesn&amp;#39;t smell good to women.&amp;quot; He slapped me and said, \u201cThat&amp;#39;s the smell of life, you idiot! This is all there is, you brute ... &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; Yes, yes, grandpa, I like it! &amp;quot; How could one refuse?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where they lived?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had a farm in Jundeia\u00ed, in the state of Sao Paulo. A place full of eucaliptos. That is where the Argentine pampas begin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "wfe0t9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wfe0t9/carlos_unchained/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/wfe0t9/carlos_unchained/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1659551056.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iiuaa4i", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1659565682.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iiu2zwt", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That's a wild one!\n\nBut he was as bad in private class.\n\nMeanwhile, he had inner circle people doing naked Infinity theater.\n\nIt makes me wonder if Miles wasn't naked, when he accidentally entered their phantom copy of the house on Pandora.\n\nCarlos tried to get me to go in there.

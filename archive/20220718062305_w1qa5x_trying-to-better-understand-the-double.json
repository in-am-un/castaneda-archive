Compare our emanations inside, to those outside, by making them glow.\n\nThe glow goes out by itself, something you can see. And at a distance it interacts with the other emanations, through harmonics.\n\nI suppose we might be a little lazy, because the eagle can issue a \"command\" to look around. I take that to mean, initially we might have just sat there, doing nothing. So he COMMANDS us to look around.\n\nAnd still does to this day. You can learn to notice it.   It'll literally turn you around 180 degrees at times, until you realize what happened, and \"turn back\".\n\nThe Eagle insists we take an inventory of what we have become, or what we can perceive. He's a \"story collector\", and wants us to make good stories for him.\n\nHalf of our awareness, in side that egg, noticed planet earth.  \n\nIt was a cool place!  They have donuts and Disneyland.\n\nIt decided to learn more of the \"intent\" of that world.\n\nI suppose just looking out at raw emanations is pretty abstract.\n\nBut on earth there's so much meaning!\n\nThat half got sucked into the formation of an organic body.\n\nAgain, we don't know much about that, which doesn't matter.\n\nSorcery is NOT pretend like everything else out there.  We don't have any \"sacred scrolls\".\n\nJust observations.  \"Energetic Facts\".\n\nYou can easily learn to perceive that energy stuck in the organs.\n\nEasy as in, perhaps 2  years if you work  hard.\n\nThe other half of our energy refused to take a birth, and just hangs out inside the shell of the egg.\n\nThe stuff that got \"born\" is trapped in 3 areas.  Liver,  speen,  adrenal glands, gallbladder.\n\nThey've been grouped together by proximity, and form 3 \"planets\". Go look for comic book page 2, and there's a picture.\n\nMost of our \"tonal awareness\", the part that liked donuts, got stuck in those \"pouches\" in our organic body.\n\nThe half that randomly drifts around in our egg, got sick and tired of the strong emotions radiating off the tonal part, and fled to the outside of the shell.\n\nIt's \"unavailable\".\n\nI suspect its perceptions, which are continuous all day, are mostly as \"pieces\".\n\nEach potential blob of that free awareness is sentient.  Together more sentient.\n\nIt watches, like  a dog pressing its face against the window while its owner speeds down the freeway.\n\nBut the blobs of the double, the second half of our energy, seem to have been \"tainted\" by the tonal, and tend to make \"bodies\" to copy it.\n\nI had a visitor in one of those last night!  Been working on that for weeks.\n\nCholita used to walk into my darkroom quite often, in her double.\n\nVery powerful, those are.

Visible!  Fully solid if you shift horizontally.\n\nYou can stage car accidents on the freeways north of Tokyo, if you have an Ally.\n\nShe can make use of the structures your double builds.\n\nOr you can let him form a \"creepy copy\" of yourself, which will sit right on the edge of the bed for you.\n\nNot nearly as often as you'd like.\n\nAnd you can shapeshift into him. That was the preference of the old seers.\n\nYes, you can do that. It's tested. Works.\n\nThe double is the reason darkroom can be done.  Don't fall into the delusion that you're staring into the darkness to find your \"greatness\".\n\nThat you can discover cool druglike experiences just because you're so wonderful, and then you can run and brag to your friends.\n\nThat's NOT darkroom.\n\nDarkroom teaches you to clean your link to intent, through silence, so that the double comes out and helps you move your assemblage point to the end of that J curve.\n\nWhere the two, the tonal and the double, who is perhaps also \"the Nagual\",  can merge at will.\n\nAgain, let me remind you.  This isn't pretend magic like everywhere else.\n\nEverything you just read, I do nightly for hours.\n\nYou will too, if you don't give up.\n\nNo one likes to get rid of that internal dialogue.

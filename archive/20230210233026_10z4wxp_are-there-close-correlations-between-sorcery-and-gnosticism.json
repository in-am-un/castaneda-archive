Good luck finding the real magic you swear has never entered this subreddit yet sits right under your nose from people like myself and Im sure the many others you have bullied and made failed attempts to dominate with faux intellect.\n\nYou are a fraud and all of the things you call out in others. The thing that makes me less angry and more sad, is that I have been where you are and ik how painful that is, but I was like 16, and I can tell that you have experienced the peak of your life. But its not too late to change! Humility opens doors, not humility with others, but humility in terms of your relationship to knowledge. I acknowledge the very real possibility that I have only ever tasted hallucinations, but I also know that regardless of their being real or not, they have also led to real world benefit (and btw - no its not drugs, I am simply interested in the account of DMT experiences in the same way I am interested in NDE accounts). I know that because I am seeing it through mind, that magick isn't what I think.\n\nAnd yes  I ADMIT IT. I AM A FRAUD. A LIAR! A THIEF!

We are all horrible murderous liars, with saintly potential and expressions of divinity. You and I are different conglomerations of the same fibers of being. Only difference is, I am open to the truth of my limited potential for directly relaying or observing this truth. I take issue with the fact that you take DJs teachings and turn into your own mini Catholic Church. Complete control. \"You must follow God the way I see God - everything else is demonic hell you devilworshipper!\" With that, again, i recognize there are some paths that are simply more effective than others,  but your black and white stance is something I could talk any open minded 5 year old into and out of in less than a few minutes. You on the other hand are a lost cause. This comment isnt for you actually its for those  who would fall prey to your death and decay.\n\nIf you simply opened your eyes to truth you would see. But you can't because those eyes are something you see as lies and dangerous, yet you somehow believe that if you were to see it yourself, it would be good and real. So lets get this straight Danl, no magick can exist in the world unless it is magick that you can verify and approve? Magick is only magick is Danl999 says it is. Got it, noted. I'll ask you tonight after my meditation if what I experienced was real magick or just more  of my own lies. Your so sick dude I dont think you have a chance at even living a normal human life, nevermind the life of an impeccable warrior. You are dragging people down, including myself, who has spent nearly a full day trying to counter your shithead ways.\n\nWake up to your own experience dude. Thats all you'll ever have. You'll never find real magick on the internet because real magick lives in the real world. If you find it in the real world, you can see it in the internet, but you'll never find real magick looking for it in the relaid stories of others. You have to get off your ass and change your mind. That is actually the first step which you seem insistent on not looking at. Forgetting personal history also includes forgetting all of the bullshit rules for the patterns you observe that have accumulated with that personal history. Otherwise what would the point of doing that be? Why do you think that somehow your interpretations of the material allow you to on one hand, follow the only teachings you see as worth following, while on the other, change them to however you see fit?\n\nWhy do you think that being impeccable is somehow a mistake of DJ? Doesn't sound like the advocate for this you claim to be, rather that you are  merely advocating for yourself. If you haven't done any real work on yourself, which it is truly obvious that you have not, its time to get off the internet and pickup any book by Carl Jung. Idc what you say, you need some legitimate and intensive shadow work. Everything you claim is true of everyone with the potential to be smarter than you, is actually how you yourself are behaving. Part of you knows this, and its not the part doing the typing. JUST STOP. You dont have to keep turning the gears to find a way to be right. You never are anyways so why try to make yourself feel something that isn't true at all?\n\nWatch it in the comments for those of you who aren't convinced by his bullshit - he will call out like two things in this comment then go off on a totally unrelated and unhelpful tangent to deflect from having to take any real stance, relying on his \"specialness\" to keep him afloat. Danl you are special, but so are all the rest of us. Its what you do with your uniqueness that counts, not your views or your knowledge or anything other than what you do as a result of your experience. You are a scary creepy dude who knows nothing. So am I, which is why I know that I am right here, I acknowledge my ignorance but you only acknowledge MY ignorance as well, not your own. \n\nAlso, stop jumping to conclusions about who I am and what I believe. I find Mckenna's sentiment a valuable tool for breaking the linear mode of thinking inherent in our western minds, which you seem to take into CCs stuff like Western Mind 2.0 . I dont worship Mckenna, I just have the ability to recognize character traits and modes of thinking exhibited in others, which I see as valuable and interesting. Are you not doing the same with St DJ?  \n\n\nUnlike you, which needs to believe that only you have the goodness that others seek, (yet ironically have none of ), I see real magick every single day. Literally, or just about anyways. And the cool thing is that I dont even have to try, because I know that trying creates wedges between you and success by introducing the option for failure. I just do it and it jut happens. No effort. No stupid comic book reference charts, just me and my lived experience.   \n\n\nI am not normally this vicous of a person, but your very nature offends me and spits on everything I know to be true.

This intelligence is not something that can be forced out or cultivated via left-brain repitition. It has to agree to show itself. The seeker must have something it respects or at least something it can use. Two people can witness real magick. But both people won't testify to it. Real magick often gives itself the ability to be mistaken for human nature, mundane things, you know, swamp gas, otherwise, if it were something as black and white as heat or gravity, wouldn't we get it by now?\n\nMagick operates through the very instrument we use to measure it, ensuring that we can never really see beyond its surface\n\nYou are chasing down something more powerful and intelligent than you nor I can ever hope to be, but you are doing so as though you were somehow the superior being chasing an animal.\n\nMy friend, it is you who are the prey until you can learn to align yourself with the force that you hunt.

You have become that master in a cave yourself. You find yourself experiencing real magick, after many years of cultivating inner silence. Is inner silence only attainable to those who have access to Simon &amp; Schuster's catalogue? No? Then stop claiming you are some authority on what is and is not real magick, what is or is not possible about entire ways of life that you have relatively zero experience living compared to the people born into those traditions, or those who have dedicated their lives to it's pursuit. Why would something like inner silence require that it be approached from such a specific understanding in order to achieve it? .

He's around somewhere.\n\nHowever, they were obviously very lame seers who made up stuff.  \n\nIt's typical when someone has magical techniques which work somewhat, but isn't honest about what actually happens when they use them.\n\nThe Jewish Prophets had the same problem going on.\n\nLeftover North African Shamanism (just look at the map and go back in history).\n\nThe Jews would \"fold in half\" and try to force off all perceptions and thoughts.\n\nI have no idea what the Gnostics did, but Hinduism and Buddhism which sprang up from the same area around the same time (via Ishtar), also use an \"altered internal dialogue\" to get things to happen.\n\nAnd it's pretty obvious you can get down to the green line on the J curve with such things.\n\nWhere spirits become visible, along with visions and remote viewing.\n\nBut here's the problem.  \n\nAnd none of those systems, as far as i know, has ever explained why it's so.\n\nOr even admitted it.\n\nWhich is typical.   Our own community does that.\n\nYou work like a dog to get something to happen, but then you find out you didn't actually \"master\" that.  You truly did it!\n\nBut can't repeat it.\n\nExcept you already ran to your buddy and told him of your new \"magical prowess\", and so you can't exactly go back and tell him, \"Hey.  I couldn't do that again.  Bummer.\"\n\nSo you just let everyone assume you are now a super magician because of all the attention you begin getting.\n\nEveryone, possibly without exception, does that.  In all systems. Once they \"succeed\" and tell people, they won't be honest enough so as to harm their new found \"reputation\".\n\nUnless you are in a situation where the \"Tensegrity Police\" are monitoring for \"violations\".\n\nTo keep you honest.  We've added one of those to the future cartoons.\n\nThe Jews were certainly not honest about magic. So they saw an inorganic being who called himself \"Lucifer\", or \"Shining One\", or whatever, and they \"realized\" he was in a war with God himself!\n\nExcept it was just another run of the mill inorganic being, messing with their head. Trying to make itself seem very important.\n\nSo the Jewish Prophets lied their buns off and created 3 whole religions, plus a few pesky cult offshoots.\n\nNow where do you hear the words of an actual honest practitioner in what's written of Qabalah?  Admitting how hard it is to repeat things, and explaining how they overcame that obstacle.\n\nI dare say you won't.\n\nBecause they weren't honest.  Why should they be?\n\nI'm afraid everything the Gnostics write, wreaks of dishonesty.  Cholita's a fan of it.  So I get exposed to a tiny bit.\n\nIt has the \"spark of truth\" in it.\n\nBut no feeling that they were actually real practitioners who had enough mastery to be able to definitively describe reality.\n\nLet me make this easier to understand.\n\nLet's say you ran into some guy who claimed to be an \"expert surfer\".\n\nBut in fact, that's your favorite past time!\n\nIf he dared to chat with you about surfing it would only take you minutes to figure out, he's making it up.\n\nI don't know much about surfing, but at the very least if it were in my area, you'd expect to hear some complaints about amateurs flooding the best spots at Huntington Beach, and forcing the skilled surfers into the pier.

He&amp;#39;s around somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, they were obviously very lame seers who made up stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s typical when someone has magical techniques which work somewhat, but isn&amp;#39;t honest about what actually happens when they use them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Prophets had the same problem going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leftover North African Shamanism (just look at the map and go back in history).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jews would &amp;quot;fold in half&amp;quot; and try to force off all perceptions and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the Gnostics did, but Hinduism and Buddhism which sprang up from the same area around the same time (via Ishtar), also use an &amp;quot;altered internal dialogue&amp;quot; to get things to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious you can get down to the green line on the J curve with such things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where spirits become visible, along with visions and remote viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the problem.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And none of those systems, as far as i know, has ever explained why it&amp;#39;s so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even admitted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is typical.   Our own community does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You work like a dog to get something to happen, but then you find out you didn&amp;#39;t actually &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; that.  You truly did it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But can&amp;#39;t repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except you already ran to your buddy and told him of your new &amp;quot;magical prowess&amp;quot;, and so you can&amp;#39;t exactly go back and tell him, &amp;quot;Hey.  I couldn&amp;#39;t do that again.  Bummer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you just let everyone assume you are now a super magician because of all the attention you begin getting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone, possibly without exception, does that.  In all systems. Once they &amp;quot;succeed&amp;quot; and tell people, they won&amp;#39;t be honest enough so as to harm their new found &amp;quot;reputation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you are in a situation where the &amp;quot;Tensegrity Police&amp;quot; are monitoring for &amp;quot;violations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep you honest.  We&amp;#39;ve added one of those to the future cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jews were certainly not honest about magic. So they saw an inorganic being who called himself &amp;quot;Lucifer&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Shining One&amp;quot;, or whatever, and they &amp;quot;realized&amp;quot; he was in a war with God himself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it was just another run of the mill inorganic being, messing with their head. Trying to make itself seem very important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the Jewish Prophets lied their buns off and created 3 whole religions, plus a few pesky cult offshoots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now where do you hear the words of an actual honest practitioner in what&amp;#39;s written of Qabalah?  Admitting how hard it is to repeat things, and explaining how they overcame that obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dare say you won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they weren&amp;#39;t honest.  Why should they be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid everything the Gnostics write, wreaks of dishonesty.  Cholita&amp;#39;s a fan of it.  So I get exposed to a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has the &amp;quot;spark of truth&amp;quot; in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no feeling that they were actually real practitioners who had enough mastery to be able to definitively describe reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me make this easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you ran into some guy who claimed to be an &amp;quot;expert surfer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, that&amp;#39;s your favorite past time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he dared to chat with you about surfing it would only take you minutes to figure out, he&amp;#39;s making it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know much about surfing, but at the very least if it were in my area, you&amp;#39;d expect to hear some complaints about amateurs flooding the best spots at Huntington Beach, and forcing the skilled surfers into the pier. Or you&amp;#39;d hear about the hooligan surfers who discourage anyone new from surfing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even stories about young women on vacation there.

You have to move your assemblage point all the way long the J curve.\n\nSilent Knowledge seems to become \"full-on\" when your Tonal's Assemblage point, the one darkroom is designed to move, starts to \"overlap\" with the energy body's assemblage point.  When it \"shines down into\" it, perhaps.\n\nI can't ***see*** that yet.  I believe Juann got a glimpse of the glow of the assemblage point moving along the J curve, but when I try to do that I get a glimpse of 1000 things, all right  there.\n\nIf one of those sights is an assemblage point, it's beyond my ability to discern it.\n\nWhich is not surprising at all.  Seeing in  that much depth, all the way down to the actual glow of awareness on the emanations, is probably a \"Silent Knowledge\" effect.\n\nMeaning, you can't actually see that with the tonal.\n\nCarlos gave us a hint.  Don Juan told him, when you see the \"Luminous Egg\" it's always a front view.  As if you were looking at it.\n\nYou don't see eggs walking around.  You see them one at a time, as if they were facing you.\n\nBut I seem to remember other stories in there contradicting that, so right now it's still a mystery to us.\n\nYet it's enough of a clue to tell me, seeing the luminous egg is actually \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nSilent Knowledge doesn't require  you to be facing the thing, \"seen\".\n\nWhich is well known by any of us, who can view the inorganic being's realm during darkroom.\n\nI got some really detailed looks at the home world of Little Smoke. Even walked in there a couple of feet!\n\nBut that world is actually located half the distance of the universe away.\n\nSo silent knowledge is better thought of as, \"Telepathic awareness\".\n\nBut without an implication someone needs to be where you are looking, because your double can take that position.\n\nHe's wherever the hell he wants to be!\n\nSo picture your double as the one who is \"located\" somewhere, you're on your bed, and you can see the remote location.\n\nBut my theory is, you can't.  The double can.\n\nWhich answers how you get a preview of Silent Knowledge, when you are only at the deep green zone.\n\nYou don't.  It does.\n\nI used, \"it\" because someone pointed out, the double has no gender.  He didn't take a birth, so he's got no \"bits\".\n\nAnd thank god!  Who wants stray \"bits\" sitting on the pillows you're using.\n\nI draw the line at sharing pillows with someone else's \"bits\".\n\nSo as you J curve, once in a while you get a HUGE reward.  I call them \"intent gifts\".\n\nBut some of those happen because the double helps you perceive something from Silent Knowledge.\n\nOr your Ally can do that.  The Men of Knowledge had to rely almost exclusively on their \"Ally\" for the cool stuff.  And their Allies made them suffer over it!\n\nImagine taking a year to prepare the smoking mixture, when you can just call out to Little Smoke, and she'll eagerly come running.  Or better said, her little puff of bright white smoke will fly over to where you are located, if you only call her.\n\nCholita's better at that then me.\n\nWhy the men of knowledge didn't know that, is beyond me.\n\nBut they were looking for stuff to \"sell\" (trade for chickens and abalone shells).\n\nMaybe they had no reason to figure out, they actually weren't selling anything worth much?\n\nSilent Knowledge is out there, but where exactly is it?\n\nHere's the theory:\n\nWhen your assemblage point overlaps with the energy body assemblage point, which is located 18-24 inches from the middle of your belly, but 4 inches to the right, you are now entering Silent Knowledge.  It's a full foot wide, so don't worry about an inch or two error.\n\nHey!  You will REALLY feel the luminous shell of the energy body while trying to \"finger wiggle\" a dent in it.\n\nYou WILL.  But guess what.  You won't be excited.\n\nIt's a \"dark sight\".  It doesn't engage your entire \"person\".\n\n\"Excited\" perhaps requires engaging your organic body.\n\nThe sight of a visible luminous shell, is more like a passing fantasy even if you see it vividly.\n\nNo excitement.  To get excited, you'd have to move your assemblage point back to the blue line, and then remind yourself what to be excited about.\n\nYour assemblage point's \"shine\" overlaps with the energy body's \"shine\", when you finally reach silent knowledge?\n\nThe shine of it's assemblage point.  At least that's the current theory.\n\nAnd something dramatic happens, if you can detect it.  I mean, as dramatic as those \"snaps\" you can use to close your long john underwear.\n\nExcept, if I tell beginners too many details,  next thing I know I'll get a new guy posting he's done that.\n\nThe drug sorcerers have had so many \"wild\" trips, they can always find some excuse to say they already did something.\n\nThey look at my diagrams of super advanced magic and say to themselves, \"Seen that...  Seen that... Did that...\"\n\nWhen in fact, they did none of it.  They pretty much just \"saw it on TV\".  And even then, they were mistaken as to what they were looking at.\n\nSo I don't want to put any ideas into the heads of new people,  and have to hear,\n\n\"I reached silent knowledge yesterday, and wanted to ask if...\"\n\nWhere's Cholita the Avenger when you need her?\n\nI used to think maybe I could convince Cholita to track down bad players, and \"string them up\".\n\nNaked, so that Cholita had something to look forward to.  Then she could \"judge\" them.\n\nShe likes to do that...  Don't sit next to Cholita on a long drive, if you don't want your \"bits\" being judged, even if it's only through your pants.\n\nNow I'm thinking, instead of stringing them up, which might be considered a volition of the law,  I just have to work out a deal with my \"bad\" ally Fancy,   to connect one of Cholita's many trash bins directly to Fancy's ice cave.\n\nSo Cholita can just toss the bad players in the trash, stranding them on a frozen methane gas moon, outside our galaxy.\n\nWhy does Cholita have so many trach bins?\n\nBeats me, but don't look inside if you know what's good for you.\n\nOne time I made that mistake, and found my missing power extension cord down at the bottom of 12 inches of water,  inside the trash bin.  A note was floating on top of it.  When I reached to grab the note and read it, I heard Cholita screaming, \"GET OUT OF THERE!!!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Road Less Traveled", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"zcps6jhu7lp81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e5e81413a89b710fbf64120e2b5a31f6e027704"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a888e985cfb65ab25f7e176d8d9b98179926111"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a936d73d032ff077e2c77aefdc81eaeeef441ec5"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=632ffa1fa6bc4bc8de73fdfec44e17b65b74d9b1"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6136099d2f50d7d837e8777fca357a544415193c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37f0e2a84216fa66bae701ce6773e458c8bd81d4"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1b8ac014c2c82c85794ca9e153feccf3a173ac0"}, "id": "zcps6jhu7lp81"}}, "name": "t3_tnsc7f", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/z77Pel-tApvZTqhBcRyauHVGx0wNH9G987DPW01TV-4.jpg", "edited": 1648242763.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1648229309.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1b8ac014c2c82c85794ca9e153feccf3a173ac0\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zcps6jhu7lp81.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1b8ac014c2c82c85794ca9e153feccf3a173ac0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess there ought to be some reason to read this post, other than imitating those Russian Sauna goers who hit themselves on the back with brooms made from plant branches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the analogy makes me a banschik?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s some tidbits useful to beginners and advanced alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why, but we get &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; previews while learning to move our assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It  seems to violate what I know about the process, so I have to assume we have an &amp;quot;intermediary&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve figured out.

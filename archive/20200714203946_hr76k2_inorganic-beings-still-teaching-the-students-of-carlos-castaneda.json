Carlos was always trying to summon *intent* to help.\n\nAnd I suspect it might have been Kylie who saw that.\n\nCarlos picked Kylie up at a Ken Eagle Feather workshop.  He must have *seen* something about her.\n\nAnd now she's gone.\n\nBut there's a couple of pieces of good info in there, for all of us.\n\nFor me, naming inorganic beings isn't as stupid as I thought, when I guiltily named the ones Cholita and I have.    It seemed to make sense to me, but now we have verification.\n\nIf you get an inorganic being, you get to name it!\n\nAnd, it's ok to talk to it, and just tell it what you want it to know!\n\nBut the most important piece of information here, is that Tensegrity moved their assemblage points enough to see energy.\n\nThe puffs of color in darkness are the easiest energy to *see*.\n\nNext would be inorganic beings.\n\nWhich makes them an ideal teaching tool!\n\nThey're like a little measuring device, signaling how far your assemblage point has moved!\n\nBarely perceptible, and  your assemblage point has moved a few inches down.\n\nEasily visible, and it's a good foot down.\n\nIf they walk up and offer you bagels, you moved it VERY far.\n\nThis means, all the Russians who believe all they have to do is tensegrity, are not too far from the truth.\n\nThe problem is, you can't just move it once, and get a weird tingle up your leg.\n\nYou have to move it DAILY over a very long time. We spend 24 hours a day being assholes.\n\nA few minutes not being an asshole isn't going to do much.\n\nAnd if you don't know when you actually moved it, there's all kinds of room for thinking and indulging while you visit with friends doing the tensegrity.\n\nThat's not going to move it enough to notice.\n\nSo thanks to Taisha's IOBs, we now have the answer.\n\nTensegrity is fine, but you need to figure out how to move your assemblage point far enough while doing it, so that you can *see* energy.\n\nI accomplished this in a dramatic fashion at the workshop just after Carlos died.  I assembled a great band of emanations, with my eyes open, in subdued workshop lighting.\n\nI was doing a long form, in near perfect silence.\n\nI didn't see the great band, as I recall now 25 years later, until I stopped, and faced the wall in front of me.\n\nIn silence.\n\nI was looking up, at an imaginary horizon, just the way Carlos described in his \"Silent Knowledge\" publication.\n\nSo I recommend, do the tensegrity in silence, then gaze at a horizon for a bit between sets.\n\nI'd become an expert on chair silence with eyes closed, even to the point of remote viewing on demand.\n\nSo learn to be silent, do the tensegrity, and keep an eye out for \"seeing energy\".\n\nThanks to Phoebus and Globus!\n\nI'm going to have to tell Fairy.

But that&amp;#39;s like  having don Juan do the leaf trick for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally I suspect, re-runs are an alternative to stopping the world.  That&amp;#39;s where you get offered to have them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in the re-run, you just accept that you are that actual person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a way to alter it, because that won&amp;#39;t occur to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I relived La Gorda learning the flying movement from 2 men, possibly don Genaro and one other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was right there, they were showing me the movement, one of the men was laughing at me, and it never occurred to me to look up, and see who was laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were in a compound deep in Mexico, at the end of the road where the Yaqui wars too place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As best I can tell.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also didn&amp;#39;t bother to watch where we were going when we traveled there.   The person I was re-running already knew where they were, so it didn&amp;#39;t make sense to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s the coolest thing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can re-run every single person in private classes, and see Carlos give all of his lectures again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had so many there, that he created tons of whiffs of intent in the air.  Just pick up a single one, and you can turn your head to be in class with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t re-run Cholita and me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recapitulation likely helps teach re-runs to people.    Anyone who had done a bunch would understand why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hr76k2/inorganic_beings_still_teaching_the_students_of/fy9jk48/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1594915734.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hr76k2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fy7pprm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Zazzy-z", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1594867390.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fy35oae", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_72ilaw5n", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "What do you mean by doing reruns?

I must have learned more than 1200 passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I can&amp;#39;t tell you whether those are more important than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only playing with colors that I got the chance to analyze the process, just so I could do what I&amp;#39;m doing now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe you can figure out for everyone, if the passes speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t forget, all students from back then have pretty much given up, with a few rare exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is that Carlos never intended those to be the only thing.  He was using them to restore people&amp;#39;s energy bodies, to see who did the best at that, and then he was going to put more attention on teaching those ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;re left with the belief in Russia, that all you need is the passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s just not true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need a guide also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without the Nagual, there&amp;#39;s no game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Carlos told us what to do about that, in his final books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find intent, clear the link, and intent will become our guide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find intent and clear the link, by silently playing with colors in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_hr76k2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hr76k2/inorganic_beings_still_teaching_the_students_of/fy9ik8f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1594915246.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fy7h59h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Zazzy-z", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1594862436.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_hr76k2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_72ilaw5n", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "FWIW, I also remember from one of my first workshops, I think UCLA, Carlos giving an animated talk (well they all were) where he happened to point out that he could \u2018see\u2019 that two practitioners had their energy bodies very close.

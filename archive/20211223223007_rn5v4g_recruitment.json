But that likely puts you into a &amp;quot;loop&amp;quot;, and they suck energy from you all night long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry, it&amp;#39;s only like giving a pint of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they give you dark energy to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman on her period can perceive them, but probably she&amp;#39;s so moody, the thing she sees doesn&amp;#39;t encourage her to assume it&amp;#39;s a spirit.  They have no real appearance to us, so whatever they look like, is  your own doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt she&amp;#39;d see it enough to be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, even the most powerful sorcerers in our lineage could not make random people perceive the IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the Olmecs could, but that would only be because the blue line back then was not where everyone was stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as you read the books, if an Ally scares someone check out the story line, and you&amp;#39;ll find a nagual patting someone on the back, telling them how nice they are.  Pushing their assemblage point down to the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use of the double seems to require the same thing, which is why don Juan couldn&amp;#39;t leap over the house for one of the witches, without messing with her back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, there&amp;#39;s stories about the Toltecs scaring people to death with their allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, they possibly found some way to frighten them first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that their assemblage points would move off the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose chasing someone with sharp little knives, might do the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory:  They were chasing &amp;quot;men of knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those guys are the worst.  I collide with them on the internet often, and it&amp;#39;s never pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_rn5v4g", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rn5v4g/recruitment/hqbvvmz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640728076.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1640728076.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hqb8p91", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ab_12345678", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hpxksfl", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_asyweeaz", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Hello, if we give the iobs someone's name, can they go to that person on the spot and see him?

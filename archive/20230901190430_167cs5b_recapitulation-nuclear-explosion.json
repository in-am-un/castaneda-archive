Now, I realize I still have these behaviors (such as, I am still smoking cigarettes, and I had anxious completely unfouded thoughts this morning), so it's not total perfection instantly, except that I feel there is genuinely only 20% of the tendencies of despair/depression/lack/anxiety that developed early on.

Trying to turn how the brain works with regards to movement, into magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;in Taiwan Daoist teenager trainees go into convulsions, under the claim that they&amp;#39;ve become possessed by demons.  When they grow up, they do the same thing but hit the top of their heads with nails in a board, until it bleeds. To show how magical they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8mxo3hxn9ulb1.png?width=470&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=179a150088bd8e25c4741a3e9a3f610a3b759c88\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8mxo3hxn9ulb1.png?width=470&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=179a150088bd8e25c4741a3e9a3f610a3b759c88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;in Japan they have that ludicrous &amp;quot;It shot&amp;quot; zen archery thing, where they take something perfectly ordinary, namely how the cerebellum works, and pretend it&amp;#39;s a path to some exalted state of buddhist enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignoring that Zen archers aren&amp;#39;t even as good as high school archers who compete in that sport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people got taken in by that &amp;quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&amp;quot; book, written by a bad man trying to cash in with his own franchise. The same way people write books about our subject, trying to get money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In actual martial arts fighting practice (not katas in the air), your body soon learns to move on its own to avoid injury, which is much faster than the conscious mind can move it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find yourself grabbing someone&amp;#39;s leg when they try to kick you, before you even notice the attack at the conscious level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s also very likely you can cause yourself to convulse, and feel &amp;quot;kundalini&amp;quot; energy during recap.  Yogis do it during meditation. It&amp;#39;s a big part of the fake proof that Yoga actually does something useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it&amp;#39;s almost always the book deal mind at work when there&amp;#39;s extreme stuff going on during recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Better to learn to go back in time and relive the events, visibly, than to come up with some substitute placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Knock if off!&amp;quot; comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect if Carlos had a person living at Pandora who was convulsing during recap, he&amp;#39;d insist they had to do something very laborious to &amp;quot;fix it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just so they stopped it without him having to call them pretenders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give them a horrible not-doing to practice, which is a lot more work than they&amp;#39;d wanted to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_167cs5b", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/167cs5b/recapitulation_nuclear_explosion/jysw5nz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1693659315.0, "media_metadata": {"8mxo3hxn9ulb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 137, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8mxo3hxn9ulb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cbf3be52fa4b209fbda2794302dfc5c6ccb0425"}, {"y": 275, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8mxo3hxn9ulb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6784a0c528abdb812e0c9f58da6655cd639b20"}, {"y": 408, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8mxo3hxn9ulb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a74f3eb051b33cd4bc5be7b9d12f287bbacc869f"}], "s": {"y": 600, "x": 470, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8mxo3hxn9ulb1.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=179a150088bd8e25c4741a3e9a3f610a3b759c88"}, "id": "8mxo3hxn9ulb1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1693659315.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jys5nxi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Historical_Ad_6361", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jyq3kx7", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8cpqfuva", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;Or men in the same situation.\n\nwhen I recapitulated, I feel vibrations, heat, pressure in areas, ties, threads moving through my body and more things that I surely do not remember  This makes it last very little, recapitulating, I had a \"violent\" childhood, could this be the reason?\n\nother times recapitulating I go blank and I don't even breathe, I don't realize this until I review my thoughts and use them again to continue recapitulating\n\nthanks Dan for all the recap images\n\nedit:   After commenting on this I have started to recap, I was a little but more than normal, the vibrations arrived and my whole body vibrated, it's like when you sit on your arm for a while, you feel it but it vibrates completely, that happened to everything my body, despite that I continued (my father entered my room to let me go downstairs,and he wanted to force me to stop, I totally ignored him, despite what he said, he did not identify me and I kept recapitulating) and after that I think I have entered or almost, the green line my whole body vibrating , my hands took by themselves a strange position, little finger and ring finger united and pulling down, but above all I felt a box or something like that in my chest, or rather in my breastbone even so I continued until my neck hurt, I opened my eyes without thoughts, as I told you, I went blank without breathing looking into the darkness, and I did not see colors, none of that, simply everything vibrated and more and more, until it almost vanished (becoming total darkness, right now it is daytime and it enters light under the door)", "edited": 1693645866.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jys5nxi", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or men in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;when I recapitulated, I feel vibrations, heat, pressure in areas, ties, threads moving through my body and more things that I surely do not remember  This makes it last very little, recapitulating, I had a &amp;quot;violent&amp;quot;

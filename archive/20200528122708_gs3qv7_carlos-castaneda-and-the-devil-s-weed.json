The Devil\u2019s weed was just to distract him.  And to move his assemblage point into heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without the inorganic being around, you\u2019ll only go on a drug trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, you\u2019ll effectively loosen up your assemblage point, making it move more easily later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita used power plants.    And Carlos had an eye on her during that period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your best bet for those allies, is Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has them most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I really don\u2019t think you want to meet those 2!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Catch a mouse first.  Drink the tea, learn the dosage.  Don\u2019t risk comma, take it very slow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a friend around or find some Indians with some experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you have seen a weird trip, you have enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then learn to get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could have 3 allies around if you like!  But find them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if you go out and find some Indians, they\u2019re going to have their own explanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They probably will tell you, the ally is in the plant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember, that\u2019ll cause it to behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they told you the ally was in underwear, that\u2019s what you\u2019d find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they are face to face with you, they\u2019re just a collection of weird lights, floating there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they project back your own expectations and worries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what they like to do, make us react.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won\u2019t have control over them, until you have no reaction to anything they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you learn to drink the tea, and it seems relatively safe, tell me what you see, and I can guide you to catch your own ally that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember, that stuff leaves bad side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shrooms, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_gs3qv7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gs3qv7/carlos_castaneda_and_the_devils_weed/fs4sypn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1590701570.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1590701570.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gs3qv7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gs3qv7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fs8p215", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fs8lph7", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Sure, sounds good.\n\nIf you like pot, you could try 100mg in edibles, and after you get over wanting to throw up, lay in bed and look at the hypnogogic images above.

I've been working to develop my own Narrative, and I'm sharing some of what I've unearthed in that effort.  While this has little directly to do with sorcery, I find it fascinating to sort through.  Plus, all things do eventually connect with sorcery, as you well know.\n\nYou are very right about how the Official Narrative has dealt with the \"Indians\".  To hear them tell it, there was a homogeneous group of millions wallowing in the mud spread from Cape Horn to the Arctic circle (ignoring as much as possible all those impressive cities and civilizations) until those white Europeans came with their superiority (Jesus, gunpowder, and steel) and set things right.\n\nWhat a load of crap.\n\nOne area I'm currently exploring in my Narrative is the role of the group I've come to call the Traders (this is where capitalization comes in useful for me).  The Traders have controled human commerce and societies since the first person identified that a rare substance was worth the effort of collecting and bringing back to the community.  The Traders were the expert craftsmen, the \"wise men\", and are found in every race and religion.  The Traders would have an enclave adapted to each location as well as having groups which traveled between communities transporting needed goods and services.\n\nThe Traders have been in the Americas since the beginning.  Much of the copper which went into the Bronze Age came from Michigan, where veins of nearly pure copper were at or just below the surface (to be smelted later with Cornwall tin to become bronze).  Many different names have been associated with the Traders, including Minoans, Teamsters, Phoenicians, Guilds, Jews, Freemasons, etc.  In ancient Mesoamerica, they were known as the Toltecs.\n\nThe Toltec Trader thread runs through [Calalus](http://www.calalus.com/).  Calalus was an American extension of the [Radhanite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radhanite) incarnation of the Traders, and built upon previous Trader colonies/expeditions to the Americas.  The European HQ was in [Septimania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimania), though as a decentralized trading operation the Radhanites were very robust with individuals and groups having large degrees of autonomy (to follow their Trader agenda, of course).\n\nThe first Spanish references to [\"Toltec\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec) I find cite their knowledge and skill as their primary characteristics, with one of the original meanings given as \"Masters, or Men Wise in Some Craft\".  While I'm late to the party and currently piecing together my thoughts, [others have put their Narratives over this time period on the web for all to read](https://michaelruark.blog/2019/11/21/calalus-ancient-jewish-colony-in-america/), and I find their general plot convincing.  My take is that the \"Toltec Empire\" started with the reclamation of the Mesoamerican colonies with which the Traders lost contact during the collapse of the Roman Empire and the other disasters which required their attention focused closer to the heart of the Trader operations in the Old World.\n\nThe origin of the various civilizations in Mesoamerica as Western Hemisphere versions of Phoenician city-states operated by the local outpost of the Traders is a strong fit for me.  The waxing and waning of the Mesoamerican cultures can be seen related to events in the Old World concerning the Traders.\n\nThis slight adjustment then allows me to make more sense of both the history and myths of Mesoamerica.  Quetzalcoatl, Kukulkan, and others can been seen as Traders following their Trader agenda trying to run herd on the locals wearing their local priestly regalia, which is a large part of the Traders' job (at least that's how they see it).  So many of the \"mysteries\" like the elimination of human sacrifice, the bearded figures in Mesoamerican art, the parallels between the Romans/Judaism and the Toltecs, the connection between the architecture at Tula and Chichen Itza, etc. isn't mysterious at all once the Traders are seen as their common source.\n\nAs utterly fascinating as I find this and other rabbit holes, this historical revisionism brings some significant sorcerous implications.  The biggest is that because Toltec Wisdom is a Mesoamerican adaptation of first millennium Judaic mysticism, many of the insights of Judaic mysticism should find correlates in Toltec Wisdom.  [Hermeticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism) and especially [Merkabah mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism) should be the lowest hanging syncretistic fruit, but for me the truly exciting frontier is in exploring the connections between Toltec Wisdom and [Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah), which only surfaced a few hundred years after the Trader Empire collapse right before 1000 AD.\n\nWhere do you think I'm most off base?", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fsqpktg", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fair warning, I depart significantly from the Official Narrative, which has been subjected to constant revisions by the latest set of Winners.

To hear them tell it, there was a homogeneous group of millions wallowing in the mud spread from Cape Horn to the Arctic circle (ignoring as much as possible all those impressive cities and civilizations) until those white Europeans came with their superiority (Jesus, gunpowder, and steel) and set things right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a load of crap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One area I&amp;#39;m currently exploring in my Narrative is the role of the group I&amp;#39;ve come to call the Traders (this is where capitalization comes in useful for me).  The Traders have controled human commerce and societies since the first person identified that a rare substance was worth the effort of collecting and bringing back to the community.  The Traders were the expert craftsmen, the &amp;quot;wise men&amp;quot;, and are found in every race and religion.  The Traders would have an enclave adapted to each location as well as having groups which traveled between communities transporting needed goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Traders have been in the Americas since the beginning.  Much of the copper which went into the Bronze Age came from Michigan, where veins of nearly pure copper were at or just below the surface (to be smelted later with Cornwall tin to become bronze).  Many different names have been associated with the Traders, including Minoans, Teamsters, Phoenicians, Guilds, Jews, Freemasons, etc.  In ancient Mesoamerica, they were known as the Toltecs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Toltec Trader thread runs through &lt;a href=\"http://www.calalus.com/\"&gt;Calalus&lt;/a&gt;.  Calalus was an American extension of the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radhanite\"&gt;Radhanite&lt;/a&gt; incarnation of the Traders, and built upon previous Trader colonies/expeditions to the Americas.  The European HQ was in &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimania\"&gt;Septimania&lt;/a&gt;, though as a decentralized trading operation the Radhanites were very robust with individuals and groups having large degrees of autonomy (to follow their Trader agenda, of course).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first Spanish references to &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec\"&gt;&amp;quot;Toltec&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; I find cite their knowledge and skill as their primary characteristics, with one of the original meanings given as &amp;quot;Masters, or Men Wise in Some Craft&amp;quot;.  While I&amp;#39;m late to the party and currently piecing together my thoughts, &lt;a href=\"https://michaelruark.blog/2019/11/21/calalus-ancient-jewish-colony-in-america/\"&gt;others have put their Narratives over this time period on the web for all to read&lt;/a&gt;, and I find their general plot convincing.  My take is that the &amp;quot;Toltec Empire&amp;quot; started with the reclamation of the Mesoamerican colonies with which the Traders lost contact during the collapse of the Roman Empire and the other disasters which required their attention focused closer to the heart of the Trader operations in the Old World.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The origin of the various civilizations in Mesoamerica as Western Hemisphere versions of Phoenician city-states operated by the local outpost of the Traders is a strong fit for me.  The waxing and waning of the Mesoamerican cultures can be seen related to events in the Old World concerning the Traders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This slight adjustment then allows me to make more sense of both the history and myths of Mesoamerica.  Quetzalcoatl, Kukulkan, and others can been seen as Traders following their Trader agenda trying to run herd on the locals wearing their local priestly regalia, which is a large part of the Traders&amp;#39; job (at least that&amp;#39;s how they see it).  So many of the &amp;quot;mysteries&amp;quot; like the elimination of human sacrifice, the bearded figures in Mesoamerican art, the parallels between the Romans/Judaism and the Toltecs, the connection between the architecture at Tula and Chichen Itza, etc. isn&amp;#39;t mysterious at all once the Traders are seen as their common source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As utterly fascinating as I find this and other rabbit holes, this historical revisionism brings some significant sorcerous implications.  The biggest is that because Toltec Wisdom is a Mesoamerican adaptation of first millennium Judaic mysticism, many of the insights of Judaic mysticism should find correlates in Toltec Wisdom.  &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism\"&gt;Hermeticism&lt;/a&gt; and especially &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism\"&gt;Merkabah mysticism&lt;/a&gt; should be the lowest hanging syncretistic fruit, but for me the truly exciting frontier is in exploring the connections between Toltec Wisdom and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah\"&gt;Kabbalah&lt;/a&gt;, which only surfaced a few hundred years after the Trader Empire collapse right before 1000 AD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where do you think I&amp;#39;m most off base?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gs3qv7", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gs3qv7/carlos_castaneda_and_the_devils_weed/fsqpktg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1591188508.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1591188508.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fs7h2kr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fs5q5q4", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Sure.\n\nI guess I got confused about the Olmecs.

Carlos\u2019 reputation is in the toilet, due to lack of magic in his followers.\n\nCarlos was new to students.  \n\nPerhaps he didn\u2019t realize, those 3 don\u2019t work well unless you are being moved into heightened awareness on a regular basis.\n\nI\u2019m sure he would have continued tinkering, but he died.\n\nAt the end, he changed his mind and gave us a challenge to go directly into the second attention.\n\nHe gave us the \"Pandora\u2019s Box\" movement, \u201cThe Wall\u201d, and introduced us to his IOBs.\n\nAll of those are practical tests of whether you can manipulate the second attention.\n\nYou can\u2019t pretend with those ones!\n\nSo, we need to supplement the other stuff, which Cleargreen teaches.\n\nWe have to move to heightened awareness, daily if possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nIt turns out, if you can make Pandora\u2019s box or  \u201cthe wall\u201d work, you\u2019re there!\n\nAnd the fastest way to make those work is to be silent, and gaze at manifestations of the second attention.\n\nEither Zuleica\u2019s colors in darkness technique, or gazing.\n\nGazing is really the same.

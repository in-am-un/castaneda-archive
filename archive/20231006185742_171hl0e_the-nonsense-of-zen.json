It would be really pointless if you couldn't do things like that.  Self-deception even, since flying to the sun is a human tradition from before money ruined all magic.\n\nAnd if you try to show the magic in this subreddit to \"Zen Masters\", they won't be interested at all.\n\nBecause in fact, it's a scam.\n\nZen is a total scam.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from ChatGPT \\*\\*\\*\n\n**Question:**\n\nExplain to me where the term \"Zen\" came from in reference to Buddhism, and whether it's mostly a Japanese thing, or whether the Chinese actually created it in the first place.\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\n\"Zen\" is a term that is closely associated with a particular school of Buddhism. The word itself is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese word \"Chan,\" which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word \"Dhyana,\" meaning \"meditation.\" So, the lineage of the term goes like this: Dhyana (Sanskrit) \u2192 Chan (Chinese) \u2192 Zen (Japanese).\n\n## Origins and Development\n\n## India:\n\n* **Dhyana**: Zen Buddhism traces its origins back to Indian Buddhism, where meditation (Dhyana) was a vital practice. The focus was on direct, experiential realization through meditation and mindfulness.\n\n## China:\n\n* **Chan Buddhism**: As Buddhism spread to China, it mingled with Taoism and indigenous traditions. Chan Buddhism emerged in China around the 6th century CE and emphasized direct insight into one\u2019s true nature through meditation and the teachings of a master.\n* **Key Figures**: Bodhidharma, an Indian monk, is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, although historical evidence is scarce and mixed with legend.\n\n## Japan:\n\n* **Zen Buddhism**: When Chan Buddhism spread to Japan, it became known as Zen Buddhism. It was notably influenced by Shinto and Japanese indigenous practices.\n* **Schools of Zen**: In Japan, Zen developed into various schools, such as the Soto and Rinzai schools, each with its own methods and teachings but sharing the core emphasis on direct experience and meditation.\n\n## Key Elements Across Regions\n\n* **Meditation**: Regardless of the regional form it takes, this tradition emphasizes meditation and direct experiential understanding.\n* **Master-Student Relationship**: A strong, direct relationship between master and student is pivotal, as the master guides the student based on their own direct realization of the truth.\n* **Mindfulness**: Living in the present moment, mindfulness in daily activities is emphasized across all forms of Zen/Chan Buddhism.\n* **Simplicity**: Both Chan and Zen Buddhism often emphasize simplicity and directness in their approach to practice and life.\n\n## Is it Just a Japanese Thing?\n\nWhile the term \"Zen\" is Japanese, the philosophical and spiritual practices it refers to are not exclusive to Japan. As mentioned, Zen Buddhism has its roots in Indian Buddhism and developed significantly in China before being transmitted to Japan. So, while Zen is associated with Japan, it is certainly not solely a Japanese phenomenon.\n\nIn modern times, elements of Zen/Chan Buddhism have been adopted and adapted worldwide, and you can find practitioners and Zen centers in many different countries, each bringing its own cultural influences to the practice while maintaining the core elements of meditation and direct insight.\n\n**Follow-up question:**\n\nHow can you prove that this has anything at all to do with \"The Historical Buddha\", when nothing at all was written down by that movement, and oral traditions are notoriously unreliable due to business concerns of sects, wanting additional unique materials to attract students?\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nYour skepticism toward the historical reliability of oral traditions and the establishment of religious practices and doctrines is valid and shared by many scholars in the field. The relationship between the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, and the later development of various schools of Buddhism, including Zen, is indeed complex and often difficult to trace with historical certainty.\n\n## Historical Buddha and Written Records:\n\n* **Direct Writings**: There are no writings directly attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha.\n* **Oral Traditions**: The teachings of the Buddha were preserved and passed down through oral traditions for several centuries before being written down.\n* **First Written Records**: The first written records of Buddha's teachings, such as the Pali Canon, were created around the 1st century BCE, several centuries after his death.\n\n## Challenges in Linking Zen to the Historical Buddha:\n\n1. **Time Gap**: The development of Zen/Chan Buddhism occurred centuries after the death of the historical Buddha, creating a significant time gap.\n2. **Cultural and Geographical Shifts**: Buddhism traveled through various cultures and geographies (India \u2192 China \u2192 Japan), each adding its own influences and adaptations.\n3. **Different Schools**: Various schools and sects developed, each interpreting and emphasizing different aspects of the teachings.\n\n## Points of Connection:\n\nDespite these challenges, there are several points through which Zen Buddhism is connected back to the teachings of the historical Buddha:\n\n1. **Core Teachings**: Despite the variations, many core teachings (Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, etc.) are consistent across Buddhist schools and can be traced back to the earliest records of Buddha's teachings.\n2. **Emphasis on Meditation (Dhyana)**: Early Buddhist texts and teachings emphasize the practice of meditation, which is a core practice in Zen. The term Zen/Chan itself, derived from Dhyana, points towards this continuity of emphasis on meditation.\n3. **Monastic Tradition**: The tradition of monastic life, meditation practice, and the teacher-student relationship in Zen can be linked to early Buddhist practices and the Sangha (monastic community) established during the Buddha\u2019s time.\n4. **Bodhidharma and Lineage**: Traditional Zen lineage charts trace the teachings back through various masters directly to the historical Buddha. While historical evidence is often scant and mixed with legend (e.g., the figure of Bodhidharma), this lineage is significant in the self-understanding of Zen.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nWhile it is challenging to establish a direct and historically verifiable link between Zen practices and the historical Buddha due to the reasons you mentioned (oral tradition, time gaps, geographical and cultural shifts, etc.), there are threads of continuity in terms of core teachings and practices. It's essential to approach the study of Zen and other Buddhist schools with a recognition of the historical complexities and the evolution of practices and teachings over time and across cultures.\n\n**Follow Question:**\n\nBut wasn't the original Buddha actually known for rebelling against the caste system as his main distinguishing factor, and the rest was essentially common Hinduism of his time?\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nIndeed, Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha, was known for rejecting certain aspects of the prevailing religious and social structures of his time, including the caste system. His teachings and practices offered a path that was accessible to people of all castes and social standings, which was quite revolutionary in the socioreligious context of ancient India.\n\n## Rejection of the Caste System:\n\n* **Accessibility**: The Buddha allowed individuals from all castes to join the monastic Sangha (community), thereby providing a spiritual path that was accessible to all, irrespective of their social status.\n* **Equality**: Within the Sangha, monks and nuns were considered equal, and their social status was determined by their ordination date, not their caste or social standing from their lay life.\n\n## Distinction from Hinduism:\n\nWhile Buddhism emerged in a context heavily influenced by Hindu beliefs and practices, and thus shares some common elements with Hinduism, it also presents several key distinctions:\n\n1. **Rejection of the Authority of the Vedas**: The Buddha rejected the authority of the Vedas, which were (and are) central to Hindu thought and practice.\n2. **No Atman**: Unlike Hinduism, which posits the existence of an eternal soul or \"Atman\", Buddhism introduces the concept of \"Anatta\" or non-self, denying the existence of a permanent, unchanging soul.\n3. **Karma and Rebirth**: Although both Buddhism and Hinduism believe in karma and rebirth, they interpret and understand these concepts differently. For example, in Buddhism, karma and rebirth are understood in the context of dependent origination and without reference to a permanent soul.\n4. **Moksha and Nirvana**: Both traditions believe in the liberation from the cycle of birth and death, but they conceptualize this liberation differently. In Buddhism, Nirvana is the extinguishing of the fires of desire, aversion, and ignorance, leading to liberation from suffering. In Hinduism, Moksha is often understood as the soul's liberation from the cycle of Samsara (rebirth) and union with the divine.\n5. **Path to Liberation**: The Buddha introduced the Noble Eightfold Path as a practical guide to ethical living and mental development leading to Nirvana, which is distinct from various paths to Moksha in Hinduism.\n\n## The Development of Buddhism:\n\nBuddhism evolved over time, developing various schools and interpretations of the teachings across different cultures and regions. While the historical Buddha\u2019s teaching was indeed focused on the path to liberation and the ethical conduct leading to it, later schools, such as Mahayana and Vajrayana, introduced additional concepts, practices, and texts. Zen Buddhism, as discussed earlier, emphasizes direct insight and experience, which is facilitated through meditation and the master-student relationship.\n\nIn summary, while Buddhism arose in a Hindu cultural and religious context and therefore shares some commonalities with it, the Buddha's teachings introduced several key distinctions and innovations, particularly in rejecting the caste system and offering a new path to liberation. This path was then interpreted and developed in various ways as Buddhism spread and evolved over time and across different cultures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Nonsense of \"Zen\"", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Buddhism"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"kf63kzd35msb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 110, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kf63kzd35msb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2231e5f8a8554a9a341ce731263ac40dfb8e31ca"}, {"y": 220, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kf63kzd35msb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9240ae3232c6253735c65eca3b346199b501a822"}, {"y": 326, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kf63kzd35msb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=280c50ae180fea2b469516190e2f9f0c9c08880d"}, {"y": 653, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kf63kzd35msb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b83071874a020597a9bbccf7bc05aa42f0443f9"}, {"y": 980, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kf63kzd35msb1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d9178f12c686910d50a3387d3a88060bb2040c8"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1003, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kf63kzd35msb1.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47b1d90c9efdd600d65549c94b796b4c96193214"}, "id": "kf63kzd35msb1"}}, "name": "t3_171hl0e", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Buddhism", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/abiEfmJAGF8kyQOH8GQDV9jTTsxzQkQEmG4-NNBt3aY.jpg", "edited": 1696613464.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1696611462.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kf63kzd35msb1.png?width=1003&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=47b1d90c9efdd600d65549c94b796b4c96193214\"&gt;Female Monk Molesting Zen Master Joshu Sasaki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A chat with ChatGPT, who knows any sacred scroll or tradition in Buddhism any humans know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please notice the emphasis on &amp;quot;direct experience&amp;quot;, which anyone who does darkroom knows to be a lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, Buddhism in general shuns direct experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The famous woman raping Zen master in Los Angeles, Joshu Sasaki, once gave a lecture I attended around age 16 where he said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t expect to fly to the sun!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fly to the sun all the time.

This path was then interpreted and developed in various ways as Buddhism spread and evolved over time and across different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "50b6d81e-6006-11ea-9dff-0e00c04b8ffb", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "171hl0e", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/171hl0e/the_nonsense_of_zen/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/171hl0e/the_nonsense_of_zen/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1696611462.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k4grxwq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "lukout8", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k4g9p1z", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_klk263a5n", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Funny how \u201cdoing the work\u201d can almost be a misnomer in some cases like mine where Castaneda \u2018s work became the only belief system that suitably explained and described the experience of living, doing exactly as he said without expecting rewards cuz you didn\u2019t believe in anything anyway.

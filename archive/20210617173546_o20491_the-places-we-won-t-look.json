We just choose to ignore it.\n\n\"The Nagual\" is the rejected part of us.  The impossible, the unreasonable, the crazy, the irrelevant.\n\nAs children, we're taught what to pay attention to, and what to ignore.\n\nMonster in the closet?  Ignore that.\n\nYou went out in the backyard and actually flew for real?\n\nDidn't happen.\n\nAfter a lifetime, we're sort of like a person who's been tortured until they are so damaged, they won't look at some things.  The things their tormentor has taught them to avoid.\n\nTheir subconscious produces feelings so unpleasant, they'll turn their head away and keep going.  Even without being fully aware of it.\n\nBut as you do darkroom, it becomes \"ok\" to see those discarded things.\n\nOne of them is your energy body.\n\nIt's down there.  Just glance down!\n\nThe first appearance of it will likely be a yellow white glow around the stomach, as a result of scooping energy onto those 3 \"pouches\" on the stomach.  You'll be scooping purple puffs there, but later when you look, it's a bright, dull yellow.\n\nSilvio Manuel even taught Carlos to glance down and switch bodies using his gaze alone.\n\nZuleica taught Carlos to \"feel\" the energy body with finger wiggling, and you can certainly do that.\n\nBut in fact, it's fully visible!\n\nWhen the assemblage point reaches the orange zone, you should be able to see it.\n\nBut at first, you won't.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt's invalid.  Fantasy.  Not there.\n\nYou'll glance down and see a mess of fibers of darkness and light, waving around in the air like strings attached to your stomach.\n\nA yellow ribbon or two will also be attached.\n\nBut the sight will be nearly fully transparent.  Like a very dim ghost image.\n\nIf you're thinking, \"So what, I'll keep watching any until it gets brighter!\"\n\nYou're right!  That would work.\n\nExcept the oddest thing happens. As you watch an absolute miracle, you get bored in seconds.\n\nYou never want to watch it long enough for it to become brighter.\n\nIt's a \"place we don't look\".\n\nAt a \"depth\".\n\nOur sight has depth.\n\nNormally we stay on the surface, unaware that we can move down in depth, and change what we perceive.\n\nDarkroom \"puffery\" tricks that urge not to look. The puffs are \"cute\".  Colorful, pretty. Exciting!\n\nSo if you catch a look at even part of one, it's not so hard to keep watching them.\n\nThe sight becomes hypnotic as the assemblage point drops.\n\nBut you're still largely in \"human\" territory as you move along, even at the bottom.\n\nOn the other side, is where things change a lot.\n\nYou're in the land of \"places we don't look\".\n\nWhat good does knowing this do you?\n\nJust keep your eyes open for things you perceive, then dismiss with any excuse.\n\nMostly doubt at first, but later you won't be able to argue, there it is!\n\nIt's there!\n\nBut, you'll dismiss it anyway.  So you won't watch it longer, and it can't move your assemblage point wherever it might have.\n\nThere's a thing called, \"skimming\" where you consciously select which emanations to emphasize, and which to de-emphasize.\n\nThe discarded ones end up with no energy of awareness focused on them, so they become invisible.\n\nJulian made himself younger using this technique.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Places We Won't Look", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"c5tzyu5geu571": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 191, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c5tzyu5geu571.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40f545fc08b82ba0b6665b6072d347526eb6e078"}, {"y": 383, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c5tzyu5geu571.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ac87044c5fdedd4458d8ed179bcb42ebb89c50"}, {"y": 568, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c5tzyu5geu571.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d239a416aaf9e4e7ecceb7d67fb26ed760b3580"}], "s": {"y": 1070, "x": 602, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/c5tzyu5geu571.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=321261abe844d578c37cae44e901ad41e2a1fc6a"}, "id": "c5tzyu5geu571"}}, "name": "t3_o20491", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NHuQVpZdC8-B3ZzP9kDdg-6XVa7GUmQW99TioIob4PQ.jpg", "edited": 1623944558.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1623944146.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c5tzyu5geu571.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=321261abe844d578c37cae44e901ad41e2a1fc6a\"&gt;Discarded perceptions in a movie theater.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll do some quick don Juan paraphrases to get you into the zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is, we all &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, all the time.

It was 5 miles away, whereas there are 3 more within 2 miles.\n\nThe other places didn't \"taste right\".\n\nI had another employee who loved any food. He'd criticize it, but he loved to explore.  I went for Indian food with him, he brought his children, and I saw a 4 year old girl happily eating very spicy Indian food of any type they brought out.\n\nI wanted to know the \"why\" of it, and got an explanation somewhere.\n\nIt's genetic. A village needs people who eat whatever food supply they have learned, and don't cause trouble.  You can't afford to  have tribe members wandering around the hills, sticking random plants and insects into their mouth.  It's dangerous. The entire tribe could be poisoned by a bad batch of soup.\n\nBut you need at least 1 doing that, so that when there's a food crisis the crazy guy can show you which shrooms are ok to eat.\n\nWe need a few shroom hunters too.  We just want to make sure they aren't consuming mostly the \"funny shrooms\".\n\nJust keep the follow in mind,  to make sure you succeed. This based on 24 years of trying to teach hundreds and failing on all of them (except lately):\n\n1  No other system has even a tiny understanding of anything beyond the mid orange zone.  You can't find any intelligent discussion of it in any of their writings.  And it ought to be the main body of their writings!   You also can't find any of their members who won't wish he could kill you in the night for even bringing up these topics, which make him look bad.  The opposite should be true!  They should be eager to hear about advanced states, if they're doing those at all themselves.\n\nThey're red zone max, 99.99999% of the time. And their students are lucky to get to the green zone.  Tiny green zone experiences is what keeps them going for decades, with nothing real happening.\n\nSo don't shape your understanding or expectations based on anything else.  Not even if you acquired some \"valuable skills\" elsewhere.  The false narrative will keep your assemblage point stuck due to sideways movement, to make the false premises seem possible.\n\nMy inorganic being Fancy is always trying to lure me sideways, with some \"tasty information\" relevant to a specific level on the J curve.  That's because anything you pretend is real, becomes closer to real once the assemblage point can move below midback, and you deliberately focus on it as \"real\".\n\nIt's shapeshifting!  Not just for humans. It works on everything.  It ought to be called, \"Selective reskimming\". \n\nIt's one of the tricks the IOBs use to kidnap people.  They teach and teach and teach, and notice what you like, and are happy to teach  you right off the path and into an IOB tunnel.  They trap humans via knowledge, not prison bars.\n\nWell..   I've seen some cages so they do that too.\n\nI believe my count of being trapped in their cages is up to 4 at this point.\n\n2  Don't ever visualize.  I really don't know how bad that can get, because I never did it.  But some Buddhists like to visualize a \"golden buddha\" above their head.\n\nDon't do that!!!!    Unless you are producing a phantom room and want a nice Buddha statue in there.  If you visualize stuff, it's like taking a bull dozer to your new lawn, just as it has tiny sprouts coming from the ground.  And that after you spent more than a week watering it 3 times a day.  Such as waste!\n\nThe only reason people do that, is because their system is totally lame and needs pretend magic to keep people fooled.\n\nRemember how vivid dreams are at times.  That's how vivid sorcery is, even while awake.    If you're \"sights\" in the darkroom don't get more vivid on days you feel you have energy, and really dim on others, you might be visualizing your results.  Kiss sorcery goodbye, you'll never have the patience to keep going.\n\n3  No book deal mind!  It's fatal.    It's sort of like going on a first date with the woman of your dreams, but you bring along your annoying paparazzi. They constantly question your date,  trying to provoke her, or snap a compromising photo up her skirt.\n\nAnyone who absolutely has to have a book deal, just wait.   Once you can move to the very deep orange zone, perhaps for a couple of years so you can look around and have stories to tell, you'll think of some positive ways to help the community with your writings.", "edited": 1642000095.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hscqyh8", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s good to have people doing different things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of an evolutionary explanation I heard about &amp;quot;food preferences&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had an employee who was so fussy about his food, he&amp;#39;d only go to a specific Del Taco to get his burritos. It was 5 miles away, whereas there are 3 more within 2 miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other places didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;taste right&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had another employee who loved any food. He&amp;#39;d criticize it, but he loved to explore.  I went for Indian food with him, he brought his children, and I saw a 4 year old girl happily eating very spicy Indian food of any type they brought out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; of it, and got an explanation somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s genetic. A village needs people who eat whatever food supply they have learned, and don&amp;#39;t cause trouble.  You can&amp;#39;t afford to  have tribe members wandering around the hills, sticking random plants and insects into their mouth.  It&amp;#39;s dangerous. The entire tribe could be poisoned by a bad batch of soup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you need at least 1 doing that, so that when there&amp;#39;s a food crisis the crazy guy can show you which shrooms are ok to eat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need a few shroom hunters too.  We just want to make sure they aren&amp;#39;t consuming mostly the &amp;quot;funny shrooms&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep the follow in mind,  to make sure you succeed. This based on 24 years of trying to teach hundreds and failing on all of them (except lately):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1  No other system has even a tiny understanding of anything beyond the mid orange zone.  You can&amp;#39;t find any intelligent discussion of it in any of their writings.  And it ought to be the main body of their writings!   You also can&amp;#39;t find any of their members who won&amp;#39;t wish he could kill you in the night for even bringing up these topics, which make him look bad.  The opposite should be true!  They should be eager to hear about advanced states, if they&amp;#39;re doing those at all themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re red zone max, 99.99999% of the time. And their students are lucky to get to the green zone.  Tiny green zone experiences is what keeps them going for decades, with nothing real happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t shape your understanding or expectations based on anything else.  Not even if you acquired some &amp;quot;valuable skills&amp;quot; elsewhere.  The false narrative will keep your assemblage point stuck due to sideways movement, to make the false premises seem possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My inorganic being Fancy is always trying to lure me sideways, with some &amp;quot;tasty information&amp;quot; relevant to a specific level on the J curve.  That&amp;#39;s because anything you pretend is real, becomes closer to real once the assemblage point can move below midback, and you deliberately focus on it as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s shapeshifting!  Not just for humans. It works on everything.  It ought to be called, &amp;quot;Selective reskimming&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one of the tricks the IOBs use to kidnap people.  They teach and teach and teach, and notice what you like, and are happy to teach  you right off the path and into an IOB tunnel.  They trap humans via knowledge, not prison bars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well..   I&amp;#39;ve seen some cages so they do that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe my count of being trapped in their cages is up to 4 at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2  Don&amp;#39;t ever visualize.  I really don&amp;#39;t know how bad that can get, because I never did it.  But some Buddhists like to visualize a &amp;quot;golden buddha&amp;quot; above their head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do that!!!!    Unless you are producing a phantom room and want a nice Buddha statue in there.  If you visualize stuff, it&amp;#39;s like taking a bull dozer to your new lawn, just as it has tiny sprouts coming from the ground.  And that after you spent more than a week watering it 3 times a day.  Such as waste!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only reason people do that, is because their system is totally lame and needs pretend magic to keep people fooled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember how vivid dreams are at times.  That&amp;#39;s how vivid sorcery is, even while awake.    If you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;sights&amp;quot; in the darkroom don&amp;#39;t get more vivid on days you feel you have energy, and really dim on others, you might be visualizing your results.  Kiss sorcery goodbye, you&amp;#39;ll never have the patience to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3  No book deal mind!  It&amp;#39;s fatal.    It&amp;#39;s sort of like going on a first date with the woman of your dreams, but you bring along your annoying paparazzi.

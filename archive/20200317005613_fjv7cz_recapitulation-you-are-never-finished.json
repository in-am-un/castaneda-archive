Please send it to the address below. I will pass it along to several others. I have listened to two phone interviews. One each with Taisha Abelar and Florinda Donner-Grau. They made many interesting points.\r\n\r\nTaisha:\n\r\nRecapitulation can begin from either shoulder. The R to L or L to R motion is not critical. (Note that in the Art of Dreaming Don Juan tells Carlos to begin on the left shoulder and in The Sorcerers' Crossing Taisha begins on her right shoulder.)\n\r\nAlso a sweeping motion can follow the inhalation/exhalation. This is the same shoulder to shoulder movement without a breath. This sweeping is said to further clean off the luminous fibers.\n\r\nThe place of recapitulation isn't that critical - a closet or shower stall will work. The idea is to put pressure on the luminous body. A claustrophobic person need not force themselves into a small room. She also stated that **Florinda Donner-Grau recapitulated a huge amount of her life on a bus, on the way to Oaxaca. In other words you could recapitulate while driving your car.**\r\n\r\nFlorinda:\n\r\nOn dreaming - states that women do not need to go through the same steps as men do to dream. She said women can go directly to the dream state. However she did not elaborate, her comments suggested that women still need to gain control of their energy body.\n\r\nThe two women made it clear that **one must recapitulate to aquire energy needed to dream.** They were also very clear that one must have a written list of all people that you know or have interacted with, especially in the beginning.\n\r\nI hope this is helpful.\n\r\nSource: Boise, ID\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.sustainedaction.org/_nagualist/_nnl1/INTERV~1.HTM - NN #1 \u201cInterview\u201d\r\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\"The luminous body is constantly creating cobweblike filaments, which are\rprojected out of the luminous mass, propelled by emotions of any sort.\rTherefore, every situation or interaction, or every situation where\rfeelings are involved, is potentially draining to the luminous body.\r\n \r\nThe life-giving nature of breath is what also gives it its\rcleansing capacity.

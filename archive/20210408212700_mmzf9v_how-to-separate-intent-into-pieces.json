If you want to stop and take a look around, you have to hook it to the bottom again.\n\nOr you'll keep drifting.\n\nNow the question I have is, if we didn't have *intent*, would we ever be able to stop it from moving?\n\nThere are a few in here now who can understand that question.\n\nBut I'll break it down.  When Carlos explained the J curve, he stopped at 2 lines.\n\nThe red and the green in the J curve diagram.  At those positions, he moved his finger very slightly to the right, and described what that's like.  Then he moved it left, and described what that was like.\n\nBut let's focus on the right, my inorganic being's favorite playground.\n\nA 1 inch movement right, encompases thousands of worlds we can live in.\n\nSome \"real\", meaning, others have been there.\n\nSome \"phantom\", meaning, no one's ever visited there.\n\nBut you can still go there and behave as if it were real.\n\nAnd when you arrive, you \"know\" things about it.\n\nYou don't just find yourself surrounded by weird hallucinations.\n\nYou also know what to do with them.\n\nIf the world is \"phantom\", meaning, no one else has used it before, it's not all so sure and solid.\n\nUnless you bring along your buddy.  An inorganic being.\n\nThem plus you is enough to make those places real.\n\nBut back to the anchor.  If your assemblage point starts drifting, and you don't fix it in place, you just sort of \"zone out\".  It's probably responsible for the famous, \"blanking out\" during meditation.\n\nOnce it moves, it has to anchor again so that the emanations which pass through that point can be \"assembled\" into a real world.\n\nThat also means tossing most of them out.\n\nWe can only use \"skimmings\" of emanations.  There's no way we can use all of them.\n\nWhich brings up a fascinating question! I hope we find the answer some day.\n\nCan you alter which skimmings are used, and which are tossed out, without moving the assemblage point???\n\nTalk about a potential for playing pranks on your friends!\n\nEverything is perfectly normal, except your friends nose is twice as long.\n\nOr there's a krugerrand in your own pocket.\n\nOne can only hope...\n\nIn this image you see how to summon that \"Split Intent\" effect, and even play with it if you like it.\n\nYou learn to summon the image, and watch it carefully as it finished becoming whatever it becomes.\n\nNot so hard to do!  I estimate summoning 5 in a night is easy, but perhaps 10 will use up your dreaming attention, and you'll have to charge it up again.\n\nAnd, in my case, it takes hours to get the first one, but the rest quickly follow.  Like, a few minutes for the next.\n\nYou find the first dream image or virtual object as a disturbance in the air.  A little collection of dots or lights, or anything not \"smooth\".\n\nAs you gaze at it, the skimmings needed to make it real come into focus.\n\nAnd the unused emanations fade away.\n\nThen the question becomes, can you clearly perceive this process?\n\nCan you find the telepathic component?\n\nEven if you can't the first few times, you still did something amazing!", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to Separate Intent Into Pieces", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"zhjop3ajj0s61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zhjop3ajj0s61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=274d7ee94e98cb357c22f3f998a1c25e335123b9"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zhjop3ajj0s61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=349d3927637dd67e641daaac9befce3bcf77d2bd"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zhjop3ajj0s61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a91ef72bc740a48c422114a97d692fe142319754"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zhjop3ajj0s61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b8aad4854889fc02dcdc260b7f451c100920a37"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zhjop3ajj0s61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c438779aec3214b147ddf11e9b14ffdad8c16f78"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zhjop3ajj0s61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e4d7021f7e9c42de6b5920bc0d8a28ea564643f"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zhjop3ajj0s61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a19661d246c9510e1472bae0c307bfd6f161dde"}, "id": "zhjop3ajj0s61"}}, "name": "t3_mmzf9v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ILdn8vMw04SHsLeUux9WDfwOEzAcPm6U8-qKyNvtMr8.jpg", "edited": 1617920804.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1617910020.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zhjop3ajj0s61.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9a19661d246c9510e1472bae0c307bfd6f161dde\"&gt;How to play with Phantom Intent (and maybe some not so phantom)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In perfect silence, especially if you can put a stop to silent fantasizing, the assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it moves, it&amp;#39;s like an anchor you pulled up so your ship could move.

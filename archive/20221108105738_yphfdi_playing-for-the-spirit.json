Greedy liars, willing to say or do anything to trick people out of their money and get them to work for free, stealing more money from others.\n\nI just defined Buddhism.\n\nOr Hinduism.\n\nOr Sufi whatever Sufi's are.\n\nLet's not forget the Apostles.\n\nI kind of like the Jesus guy, because I assume he had no clue what the apostles would do to his true purpose.  Which in my opinion, was simply to try to free Kabbalah from the secrecy and religious dogma it had been been captured  by.  There's hints of that in the surviving story line, but I don't want to end up like La Gorda thinking \"nuns are cool\".\n\nWhy do I bash religions?\n\nYou'll find out if you learn sorcery.\n\nRemember that sorcery is \"The Mastery of Intent\".\n\nAnd intent is the force that creates your reality.\n\nThere's \"zillions\" of dark superstrings forming a vast ocean of possible \"feelings\".  Emanations.\n\nConsider that word!  From where do they emanate?\n\nNo one told us.  Maybe no one knows.\n\nBut don't think of \"feelings\" as something in the realm of flesh bodies.\n\nInorganic beings have no such thing, and yet these \"feelings\" still work on them.\n\nIt's more like a \"nano-impression\".\n\nA certainty that something you've \"noticed\", meaning something you can sense, is definitely \"this\".\n\nIt's not \"that\".  Or the other things.  This particular \"emanation\", on which some of your awareness has flowed, lighting it up, is absolutely for sure \"this\".\n\nWhat \"this\"?\n\nI can't describe a single emanation's feeling.  I've managed to separate 4 out for sampling, and each was unique.  But too tiny to describe.\n\nI hope one of you can eventually.\n\nLet's just say, 1000 of them all together might form the smoothness of the rounded corner of a  metal cube.\n\nNot the cube, not the fact that it feels slightly cold to the touch.\n\nJust the roundness of a random corner, located in space and time.\n\nJust in that situation.\n\nBut there are ZILLIONS of emanations.   More than all the drops of water in all the oceans in the universe.\n\nWell... Honestly I have no idea if that's true.\n\nWhen Carlos got \"scientific\" about it, \"Zillions\" is what he came up with.\n\nAs a computer programmer I run into very large numbers.  Giga, tera, peta, and so on.  Mostly when I'm drooling over how much streaming entertainment I can store.  And I have yet to see the \"Zila\" sized hard drive announcements.\n\nBut I shouldn't make fun of the word Carlos chose, because often it turns out that the nuttiest thing said by a sorcerer is literally true.\n\nSo our reality is essentially just our limited amount of awareness, which I make out (don't ask why) to be 16 sentient blobs, around the size of a soccer ball each.\n\nHalf yellow and trapped in our internal organs, and half purple, hiding 3 feet away from our stinky internal organs.\n\nThe puffs.\n\nA Nagual has 32 blobs.  Which makes them very annoying.  Avoid those bastards.\n\nI hope one of you will correct my estimates some day, but it's not a big mistake to think about it in those terms for now.  About 16 puffs of awareness.\n\nBecause you get to SEE that yourself.  If it's wrong, there must be something beyond that to see, or something we haven't noticed yet.\n\nAnd that's the nature of sorcery!  All we have is that which humans have noticed so far.  There's plenty more, but we didn't find it yet.\n\nAlso, ideally you don't want deceivers telling you what to notice.\n\nFor starters, that includes ANYONE asking for your money to teach you sorcery.\n\nAll of those have absolutely no understanding at all.  Whatever makes them seem to know something, is just \"inventory\" stolen from Carlos.\n\n I'm not including Tensegrity teachers in that, as long as it's the real tensegrity Carlos gave us, and not something made up by a guy in Israel wearing speedos. Or a man who thinks, \"Eagle Feather\" sounds like a badass native american sorcerer and ought to fool plenty of people.  I could go on, but the point is that made up Tensegrity is less than useless.  It's as harmful as the men who create it.\n\nThey're as bad as a man with a card table on the poor side of town, with a stack of merchandise he shoplifted from \"Rite Aid\" pharmacy,  and is trying to get the most money for.\n\nHe's telling people who come to his card table, which has 3 homeless people passed out on the sidewalk nearby, that he has a manufacturing facility in China. That's where he gets the Nasal spray, tampons, and socks he's selling today on this little card table.  It only says \"Rite Aid\"  because he got a good deal on some scratched packaging.\n\nIf you take up with a pretend sorcerer, you're doing even worse than that particular story.\n\nThose guys are the bumper crop of a \"dirty link to intent\".\n\nIf you drugged them up with sodium pentathol to get them to tell the truth, and wrote down their motivations for cheating others,  you wouldn't be able to even fathom the depth of their self-pity filled consciousness.  It would get really ugly if you knew the truth about \"spiritual leaders\".\n\nSo stay away from the bad side of town.\n\nWe're trying to play with infinity here!\n\nThe spirit.  \n\nBut that is NOT \"spiritual\". It is the absolute opposite!  \n\nIt's just technology, that's all.  If we let \"spirituality\" creep into our sorcery, it'll be lost forever.\n\nWe're trying to learn how to interact with it in a manner that's useful to us personally.\n\nWe live in the \"junk filled river\" side of reality.  All the \"results\" flowing down from all the people who are as bad off as the card table merchant.  It flows very slowly, and we're up to our chins in the junk.\n\nSorcerers call it \"The river of shit\", and that's where we reside.\n\nBut if you want to be less judgemental, it's \"reality as things\"  One of the more grotesque aspects of the dark sea of those emanations.\n\nIt's collections of individual superstrings glowing with someone else's \"used\" awareness, or even with billions of people's residual awareness, forming discarded stuff swirling all around us.\n\nAt the risk of offending someone, God himself is included in the swirling junk.\n\nHe was cooked up from all the prayers to him, and so he features all the feelings that humans aspire to have. Kindness, wisdom, fatherly nurturing.\n\nYou can even visit him.  That was the obsession of the Jewish Prophets.\n\nAnd you can interact with him.  He's used to being asked questions.\n\nYou really can!   But don't expect anything from it other than he might respond at that moment.\n\nThat angered Carlos on hearing it from don Juan.  He seemed ready to kill in order to protect the image of God, once he \"saw it for real\".\n\nLike a little kid who gets his father's rifle, to defend Santa Claus from the bad kids at school who say he doesn't exist.\n\nThat's kind of our situation in this subreddit.  Fighting off all the angry kids with shotguns, defending Santa Claus.\n\nWe call them \"bad players\".\n\nAnd those also are the absolute opposite of a \"clean link to intent\". Of a functioning interface to the dark sea of awareness, so as to control which way things go when awareness flows into them.\n\nIf you want to understand this a bit more, find the story about how Carlos couldn't start his car.\n\nWith don Juan and don Genaro teasing him about it.\n\nThey needed to wrestle his reason to the ground, because it was causing him to swing his rifle around in defense of Santa Claus.   And he was likely to shoot himself in the foot.\n\nSo they showed him that he couldn't even control his car starter, despite thinking he had the right key.\n\nEventually they allowed it to start, and even drove off in it.\n\nBoth don Genaro and don Juan seeming to be highly amused by that.\n\nSo what's the  point?\n\nThere was no car.\n\nWhen you understand how that can be, you'll be standing right against the dry shore of the river of lost objects, seeing that in fact it looks like you could climb out of there.\n\nThat's what we're trying to help with in this subreddit.  Help you climb out.\n\nBut you have to put down the rifle.  If you feel that strongly about Santa Claus, sorcery itself will allow you to make one of your own.  A real one you can hug, and ask for stuff all day long.\n\nIt'll be every bit as real as the troublesome car Carlos couldn't start.\n\nSo how do you play with, or better said \"for the spirit\"?\n\nWhen I say \"the spirit\", it gets a bit too native american for my taste.\n\nI grew up around those guys before they got casinos.\n\nThey stole what Carlos wrote to modify what they had by their own tribe's traditions, claimed it was theirs all along, and then attacked him over \"cultural appropriation\".\n\nNever caring what works, and what doesn't.\n\nIt was very much like Buddhists, claiming Carlos stole from them.\n\nHowever, those guys are right.  There is a \"great spirit\".\n\nAnd even an annoying screeching Eagle.\n\nHow could Chuck Norris ever be wrong?\n\nBut they just don't understand what they're saying, because they have the same madness Carlos had about God.\n\nYes, God is real!  He's right there!  You can visit.  Every religion has stories of visits to God.\n\nIt's just that, it's an impure understanding of what's going on.\n\nAn unclean link to intent, tainted by all the worries you have.  He's there to soothe those, because humans wished him into being.\n\nAnd we need to greatly reduce our wishes, if we want to play with the real Spirit.\n\nWhich is actually a \"force\" arising from that dark sea of superstrings, into which your awareness flows.\n\nI suppose we don't yet know WHY that arises.  Or maybe sorcerers do, but it's not in the realm of language.  Maybe it's off in \"the abstract\", which you can think of as thoughts which seem to make sense at the time, but later you can't actually describe anything about them.\n\nOne second you're flying above the eucalyptus trees with Genaro, doing \"fuzzies cosplay\", having a great time, but then the next you're on the ground trying to describe all the fun you just had, and not a single word comes to mind.\n\nIt's possible we DO understand how the dark sea creates a force that seems intelligent, when the dark sea itself is just potential \"nano-feelings\". But we just can't speak it.\n\nYet,  you can play with it.\n\nSo you have to put down the rifles.\n\nAnd you have to give up your card table store.\n\nYou have to be just a container for 16 puffs of awareness,  experimenting methodically with the dark sea.\n\nSo you can see if the dark sea echos your experiment back.\n\nLet's make this easier to understand.\n\nLet's say you're a little kid with a slightly nicer card table, peddling stage magician acts on the street.\n\nYou have your boiled purple cabbage juice, some baking soda, and some lemons .\n\nAnd a bunch of  high ball glasses you weren't supposed to take.\n\nWith a sign:  \"Magic show,  50 cents\".\n\nBut the cars don't stop to watch you make a liquid turn any color you like, just by pouring it into a different \"empty\" glass.\n\nThey aren't impressed that you can pour the same pitcher of liquid into one glass and it's red, but in the next it's blue.\n\nBut you aren't discouraged so easily, and just keep doing your magic show over and over, hoping a car will stop.\n\nThe spirit notices.\n\nIt notices everything.  As best I can figure, it \"likes to watch\".\n\nBut the cool part is, it begins to \"expect\".\n\nAnticipate.\n\nAnd if there's a very clear thing to expect, it might actually inject itself into the fun to encourage the game to keep going.\n\nLet's say the kid also has a huge \"magic kit\" that dad got at the magic store.\n\nThere's card tricks, disappearing balls you put into plastic cups, and even a little \"finger guillotine\" which somehow is sharp enough to cut carrots, yet refuses to hurt your finger.\n\nHe's got a very complicated show he can pull from under the table if need be.\n\nIt's possible that his magic show upgrades could get a car to stop.\n\nBut they aren't as appealing to \"the spirit\".\n\nThe spirit likes the fine details. Of \"how you felt about that\".\n\nIt sends out \"feelings\" through the emanations.\n\nAnd so it's naturally in the \"feeling business\".\n\nAnd when it decides to help play,  it's almost like a spooky episode of \"the twilight zone\".\n\nIf the kid faithfully sticks to his simple magic show using those few ingredients, and ignores that the cars won't stop, not caring about anything but choreographing his show so that he knows all the arm and hand movements needed, and the best way to do them so as to make it entertaining, then the spirit will like that much more than if he pulls out his magic show junk box.\n\nIt gets involved in the flow of his show.  How his arms move, when the liquid pours, even how he turns his face up to smile at the audience, when the color turns blue instead of red.\n\nAnd at the end of a long day of doing his magic show \"perfectly\" with no audience but \"the spirit\", he finally stops to rest.\n\nIt's the end of the day. He has to go home.\n\nBut he isn't tired of putting on the show, and even wishes it could go on longer.\n\nNOW is when the spirit might become visible.\n\nGlancing down at an empty glass, he sees it fill all by itself with the blue liquid.\n\nAnd he instantly knows what to do!  Just the fact that the glass poured all by itself, activates his \"magician's doings\".\n\nHe turns his head up slowly, and smiles at the audience.  The spirit.\n\nThat's a perfect example of how to get the spirit to play with you.\n\nIt's how tensegrity works.\n\nI should probably stop there for best effect, but on the practical side you can use this to do ANYTHING.\n\nLet me appeal to your greed a moment.\n\nThere is absolutely no limit on the magic you can do with this.\n\nYou can literally cause a doorway to materialize in your darkroom, and walk right through it into another world.\n\nNot sleeping. Not \"astral traveling\" with your eyes closed, dozing off on the bed.\n\nIn your physical body, fully awake, eyes open, completely sober.\n\nYou can finally understand what Carlos told us in the introduction to one of his final books.\n\nReality only SEEMS to be controlled by \"the laws of physics\" because we keep our assemblage point in the same location.  The awareness flowing from our limited 16 blobs, to light up the dark sea of emanations, always flows towards the same bundle of \"feelings\" from the dark sea of all possibilities.\n\nSince it's always the same combination, it always produces the same result.\n\nThat being, \"the laws of physics\".\n\nCausality.\n\nBut if it flows in a different direction, you get different laws.\n\nAnd you can indeed cause a doorway to materialize on the bedroom wall, through which you can walk into another world.\n\nUnfortunately we don't know the little specific \"magic show\" to put on, to get the spirit to help us with that result.\n\nTypically we need an \"Ally\", an inorganic being, to show us the correct procedure for a specific result.\n\nMad Prophet's ally Lily (Ren) visited me to teach how to leap through the ceiling to distant stars.\n\nTold me weeks earlier she was going to do that, and she did it in several forms.\n\nBut the greatest was how to do what Elias did.  Visit the \"junkyards\" of infinity, so I could look for alien artifacts.\n\nShe showed me the procedure while flying over head on fire with purple flames.\n\nIt was an amazing sight!\n\nBut not as amazing as traveling 1 billion light years per second.\n\nAt that rate the nearly empty scenery of space goes by so fast there's no time to be bored.\n\nThat's the sort of thing an \"Ally\" can do for you.\n\nDid I mention, fully awake, fully visible,  and they're solid when they want to be?\n\nThey know how to create the right magic show to engage the spirit.\n\nBut you can do that yourself.\n\nYou just have to \"accidentally discover\" a given procedure.\n\nThe \"Men of Knowledge\" of 4000 years ago, in the Olmec world, did just that.  But they'd been accidentally discovering such things for at least another 4000 years before that.\n\nWe know because we have one of the originals among us.  The death defier.\n\n8000 years old now.\n\nThe men of knowledge discovered specific magic shows to put on, so as to get the spirit to do the grand finale.\n\nLike the talking lizard show. Or moth dust showing the secrets of specific people.\n\nWe don't have 4000 years, so we have to start small.\n\nMy post on \"how to burn a hole in reality\" from before I could use drawing software, contains one such procedure.\n\nYou sweep the head back and forth, looking for irregularities in the darkness.\n\nFor \"exceptions\".  Things that are NOT dark.  Sparkles, flecks, flashes.\n\nAnything that isn't the absolute darkness of your practice room.\n\nBut you have to sweep the head very slowly, smoothly, and without ambition.  And be patient! It takes at least a full week for \"intent\" to build up in your ritual.\n\nI suppose if you have done the 2 hour sessions of recapitulation I recommend, you can do the smooth head turn needed.\n\nYou've taught yourself to be so patient sweeping like that, so as to free it from all the greed and fussiness  a beginner feels when trying to do something so crazy as \"burn a hole in reality\".\n\nYou've done it already during recap.  Played \"for\" the spirit in a way that captures its attention.\n\nIt's interested now.\n\nBy the way, there's  a more advanced version of this where the result of the game is a \"power object\".  A magical thing you can hold in your hand, to do just about anything.\n\nIt's filled with your intention, as stored when you made it.\n\nAnd will use that to produce magic.\n\nIt's like that TV series, \"Locke and Key\".  The ritual makes the key, but you have to pour your intent into it, as it forms.\n\nMy favorite is a little crystal ball that can be used for remote viewing.\n\nBut that's off in Silent Knowledge (SK) territory, and a beginner will do this first in the red zone.  Headed to orange.\n\nOnly halfway to SK.\n\nYou sweep the room slowly, back and forth, looking for irregularities.  Sparkles.  Even just flecks or wrinkles of dull grey in the whitish light that will begin to form on virtual surfaces around you.\n\nThe gaze going back and forth allows you to \"notice\" things.\n\nWhen you \"notice it\", you create a little jolt of extra awareness.  You're flowing your awareness into the blackness, but when you recognize there's a disturbance you get a little surge of \"recognition\".\n\nThat sends an extra pulse of awareness, into the emanations.\n\nAnd the thing you saw brightens up.\n\nEventually you feel this as \"the shine of your eyes\", which can make things sparkle.\n\nCause various locations along that horizontal sweep to sparkle with something no longer small or vague.\n\nIf you can be patient, you will enlist the help of the spirit.\n\nAnd at some point you will kind of \"mesmerize\" yourself, because all of your attention will be on that \"shine\" of the eyes.\n\nAnd how it can \"burn\" the darkness to reveal something glowing vividly.\n\nWhen you become absolutely innocent, the spirit itself takes an interest.\n\nYou aren't doing it the same way!  You stopped \"paying full attention\".\n\nYou didn't inject that little burst of extra awareness you had for 20 minutes before, each time you noticed a disturbance was very \"real\".\n\nSo it helps get you back into the game.\n\nThe next time your gaze \"shines\" on a speck of sparkles, a giant hole burns into the darkness in front of you, and an entire toy store of random objects spills out into the  room.\n\nLiterally a pile 3 feet high of fully real looking \"stuff\" spills out of a hole in the darkness.\n\nBurned there by the shine of your eyes.\n\nBut that's just a beginner's game to play with the Spirit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Playing For The Spirit", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"n76m0aq29py91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09da0307891f7ec5ec3839d11396edaca383f602"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d86f94a277aefe415306018a2ed23b7811ff12d"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03d85ccc73c9632f79e45f444a5dceba1ce6236b"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fb431bbfef4eb7db91f6ffb0d7b40c19ecb1a60"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c6297e9cdd46dc06a4f4cc4483e991a8cdf323"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05c7a9d8feae21e181f54fde8c64ee86cd1c44fc"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=548623e0fd87d9b2c2fc6d074b25d067f6ba0b8b"}, "id": "n76m0aq29py91"}}, "name": "t3_yphfdi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/R5TG5zmXK3C1X2mk-_uHKEhpFZDZGhbX54SIIX-orlA.jpg", "edited": 1667933848.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667901458.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=548623e0fd87d9b2c2fc6d074b25d067f6ba0b8b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n76m0aq29py91.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=548623e0fd87d9b2c2fc6d074b25d067f6ba0b8b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose as long as advanced material like this post includes a warning for beginners not to use it to harm their chances to learn sorcery, it might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in that vein, the &amp;quot;Tales of Power&amp;quot; idea is a very good one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some stories a beginner should only consider to be such a tale, and not a technique they can try to use before they are capable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a tale of power it fits with the truth of the situation:  Sorcerer&amp;#39;s are storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first read that, I worried that it implied sorcerers are liars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else out there selling &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;.  Greedy liars, willing to say or do anything to trick people out of their money and get them to work for free, stealing more money from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just defined Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Sufi whatever Sufi&amp;#39;s are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s not forget the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of like the Jesus guy, because I assume he had no clue what the apostles would do to his true purpose.

Emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider that word!  From where do they emanate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one told us.  Maybe no one knows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t think of &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; as something in the realm of flesh bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings have no such thing, and yet these &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; still work on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more like a &amp;quot;nano-impression&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A certainty that something you&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;noticed&amp;quot;, meaning something you can sense, is definitely &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;.  Or the other things.  This particular &amp;quot;emanation&amp;quot;, on which some of your awareness has flowed, lighting it up, is absolutely for sure &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t describe a single emanation&amp;#39;s feeling.  I&amp;#39;ve managed to separate 4 out for sampling, and each was unique.  But too tiny to describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope one of you can eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just say, 1000 of them all together might form the smoothness of the rounded corner of a  metal cube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the cube, not the fact that it feels slightly cold to the touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just the roundness of a random corner, located in space and time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are ZILLIONS of emanations.   More than all the drops of water in all the oceans in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well... Honestly I have no idea if that&amp;#39;s true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Carlos got &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; about it, &amp;quot;Zillions&amp;quot; is what he came up with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a computer programmer I run into very large numbers.  Giga, tera, peta, and so on.  Mostly when I&amp;#39;m drooling over how much streaming entertainment I can store.  And I have yet to see the &amp;quot;Zila&amp;quot; sized hard drive announcements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I shouldn&amp;#39;t make fun of the word Carlos chose, because often it turns out that the nuttiest thing said by a sorcerer is literally true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So our reality is essentially just our limited amount of awareness, which I make out (don&amp;#39;t ask why) to be 16 sentient blobs, around the size of a soccer ball each.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half yellow and trapped in our internal organs, and half purple, hiding 3 feet away from our stinky internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Nagual has 32 blobs.  Which makes them very annoying.  Avoid those bastards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope one of you will correct my estimates some day, but it&amp;#39;s not a big mistake to think about it in those terms for now.  About 16 puffs of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you get to SEE that yourself.  If it&amp;#39;s wrong, there must be something beyond that to see, or something we haven&amp;#39;t noticed yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the nature of sorcery!  All we have is that which humans have noticed so far.  There&amp;#39;s plenty more, but we didn&amp;#39;t find it yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, ideally you don&amp;#39;t want deceivers telling you what to notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For starters, that includes ANYONE asking for your money to teach you sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those have absolutely no understanding at all.  Whatever makes them seem to know something, is just &amp;quot;inventory&amp;quot; stolen from Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not including Tensegrity teachers in that, as long as it&amp;#39;s the real tensegrity Carlos gave us, and not something made up by a guy in Israel wearing speedos. Or a man who thinks, &amp;quot;Eagle Feather&amp;quot; sounds like a badass native american sorcerer and ought to fool plenty of people.  I could go on, but the point is that made up Tensegrity is less than useless.  It&amp;#39;s as harmful as the men who create it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re as bad as a man with a card table on the poor side of town, with a stack of merchandise he shoplifted from &amp;quot;Rite Aid&amp;quot; pharmacy,  and is trying to get the most money for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s telling people who come to his card table, which has 3 homeless people passed out on the sidewalk nearby, that he has a manufacturing facility in China. That&amp;#39;s where he gets the Nasal spray, tampons, and socks he&amp;#39;s selling today on this little card table.  It only says &amp;quot;Rite Aid&amp;quot;  because he got a good deal on some scratched packaging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you take up with a pretend sorcerer, you&amp;#39;re doing even worse than that particular story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those guys are the bumper crop of a &amp;quot;dirty link to intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you drugged them up with sodium pentathol to get them to tell the truth, and wrote down their motivations for cheating others,  you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to even fathom the depth of their self-pity filled consciousness.  It would get really ugly if you knew the truth about &amp;quot;spiritual leaders&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So stay away from the bad side of town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to play with infinity here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The spirit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that is NOT &amp;quot;spiritual&amp;quot;. It is the absolute opposite!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just technology, that&amp;#39;s all.  If we let &amp;quot;spirituality&amp;quot; creep into our sorcery, it&amp;#39;ll be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to learn how to interact with it in a manner that&amp;#39;s useful to us personally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We live in the &amp;quot;junk filled river&amp;quot; side of reality.  All the &amp;quot;results&amp;quot; flowing down from all the people who are as bad off as the card table merchant.  It flows very slowly, and we&amp;#39;re up to our chins in the junk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers call it &amp;quot;The river of shit&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s where we reside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you want to be less judgemental, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reality as things&amp;quot;  One of the more grotesque aspects of the dark sea of those emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s collections of individual superstrings glowing with someone else&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;used&amp;quot; awareness, or even with billions of people&amp;#39;s residual awareness, forming discarded stuff swirling all around us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the risk of offending someone, God himself is included in the swirling junk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was cooked up from all the prayers to him, and so he features all the feelings that humans aspire to have. Kindness, wisdom, fatherly nurturing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even visit him.  That was the obsession of the Jewish Prophets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can interact with him.  He&amp;#39;s used to being asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really can!   But don&amp;#39;t expect anything from it other than he might respond at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That angered Carlos on hearing it from don Juan.  He seemed ready to kill in order to protect the image of God, once he &amp;quot;saw it for real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a little kid who gets his father&amp;#39;s rifle, to defend Santa Claus from the bad kids at school who say he doesn&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s kind of our situation in this subreddit.  Fighting off all the angry kids with shotguns, defending Santa Claus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We call them &amp;quot;bad players&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those also are the absolute opposite of a &amp;quot;clean link to intent&amp;quot;. Of a functioning interface to the dark sea of awareness, so as to control which way things go when awareness flows into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand this a bit more, find the story about how Carlos couldn&amp;#39;t start his car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With don Juan and don Genaro teasing him about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They needed to wrestle his reason to the ground, because it was causing him to swing his rifle around in defense of Santa Claus.   And he was likely to shoot himself in the foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they showed him that he couldn&amp;#39;t even control his car starter, despite thinking he had the right key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually they allowed it to start, and even drove off in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both don Genaro and don Juan seeming to be highly amused by that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the  point?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you understand how that can be, you&amp;#39;ll be standing right against the dry shore of the river of lost objects, seeing that in fact it looks like you could climb out of there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re trying to help with in this subreddit.  Help you climb out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to put down the rifle.  If you feel that strongly about Santa Claus, sorcery itself will allow you to make one of your own.  A real one you can hug, and ask for stuff all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll be every bit as real as the troublesome car Carlos couldn&amp;#39;t start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do you play with, or better said &amp;quot;for the spirit&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot;, it gets a bit too native american for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up around those guys before they got casinos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They stole what Carlos wrote to modify what they had by their own tribe&amp;#39;s traditions, claimed it was theirs all along, and then attacked him over &amp;quot;cultural appropriation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never caring what works, and what doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was very much like Buddhists, claiming Carlos stole from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, those guys are right.  There is a &amp;quot;great spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even an annoying screeching Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How could Chuck Norris ever be wrong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they just don&amp;#39;t understand what they&amp;#39;re saying, because they have the same madness Carlos had about God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, God is real!  He&amp;#39;s right there!  You can visit.  Every religion has stories of visits to God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that, it&amp;#39;s an impure understanding of what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An unclean link to intent, tainted by all the worries you have.  He&amp;#39;s there to soothe those, because humans wished him into being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we need to greatly reduce our wishes, if we want to play with the real Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is actually a &amp;quot;force&amp;quot; arising from that dark sea of superstrings, into which your awareness flows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose we don&amp;#39;t yet know WHY that arises.  Or maybe sorcerers do, but it&amp;#39;s not in the realm of language.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s off in &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;, which you can think of as thoughts which seem to make sense at the time, but later you can&amp;#39;t actually describe anything about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One second you&amp;#39;re flying above the eucalyptus trees with Genaro, doing &amp;quot;fuzzies cosplay&amp;quot;, having a great time, but then the next you&amp;#39;re on the ground trying to describe all the fun you just had, and not a single word comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible we DO understand how the dark sea creates a force that seems intelligent, when the dark sea itself is just potential &amp;quot;nano-feelings&amp;quot;. But we just can&amp;#39;t speak it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet,  you can play with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to put down the rifles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you have to give up your card table store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to be just a container for 16 puffs of awareness,  experimenting methodically with the dark sea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can see if the dark sea echos your experiment back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s make this easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re a little kid with a slightly nicer card table, peddling stage magician acts on the street.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have your boiled purple cabbage juice, some baking soda, and some lemons .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a bunch of  high ball glasses you weren&amp;#39;t supposed to take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a sign:  &amp;quot;Magic show,  50 cents&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the cars don&amp;#39;t stop to watch you make a liquid turn any color you like, just by pouring it into a different &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t impressed that you can pour the same pitcher of liquid into one glass and it&amp;#39;s red, but in the next it&amp;#39;s blue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you aren&amp;#39;t discouraged so easily, and just keep doing your magic show over and over, hoping a car will stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The spirit notices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It notices everything.  As best I can figure, it &amp;quot;likes to watch&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the cool part is, it begins to &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if there&amp;#39;s a very clear thing to expect, it might actually inject itself into the fun to encourage the game to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say the kid also has a huge &amp;quot;magic kit&amp;quot; that dad got at the magic store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s card tricks, disappearing balls you put into plastic cups, and even a little &amp;quot;finger guillotine&amp;quot; which somehow is sharp enough to cut carrots, yet refuses to hurt your finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s got a very complicated show he can pull from under the table if need be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that his magic show upgrades could get a car to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they aren&amp;#39;t as appealing to &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The spirit likes the fine details. Of &amp;quot;how you felt about that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sends out &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; through the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so it&amp;#39;s naturally in the &amp;quot;feeling business&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when it decides to help play,  it&amp;#39;s almost like a spooky episode of &amp;quot;the twilight zone&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the kid faithfully sticks to his simple magic show using those few ingredients, and ignores that the cars won&amp;#39;t stop, not caring about anything but choreographing his show so that he knows all the arm and hand movements needed, and the best way to do them so as to make it entertaining, then the spirit will like that much more than if he pulls out his magic show junk box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets involved in the flow of his show.  How his arms move, when the liquid pours, even how he turns his face up to smile at the audience, when the color turns blue instead of red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at the end of a long day of doing his magic show &amp;quot;perfectly&amp;quot; with no audience but &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot;, he finally stops to rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the end of the day. He has to go home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he isn&amp;#39;t tired of putting on the show, and even wishes it could go on longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOW is when the spirit might become visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glancing down at an empty glass, he sees it fill all by itself with the blue liquid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he instantly knows what to do!  Just the fact that the glass poured all by itself, activates his &amp;quot;magician&amp;#39;s doings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turns his head up slowly, and smiles at the audience.  The spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a perfect example of how to get the spirit to play with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how tensegrity works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should probably stop there for best effect, but on the practical side you can use this to do ANYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me appeal to your greed a moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely no limit on the magic you can do with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally cause a doorway to materialize in your darkroom, and walk right through it into another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sleeping. Not &amp;quot;astral traveling&amp;quot; with your eyes closed, dozing off on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In your physical body, fully awake, eyes open, completely sober.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can finally understand what Carlos told us in the introduction to one of his final books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality only SEEMS to be controlled by &amp;quot;the laws of physics&amp;quot; because we keep our assemblage point in the same location.  The awareness flowing from our limited 16 blobs, to light up the dark sea of emanations, always flows towards the same bundle of &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; from the dark sea of all possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;#39;s always the same combination, it always produces the same result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being, &amp;quot;the laws of physics&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Causality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it flows in a different direction, you get different laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can indeed cause a doorway to materialize on the bedroom wall, through which you can walk into another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we don&amp;#39;t know the little specific &amp;quot;magic show&amp;quot; to put on, to get the spirit to help us with that result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typically we need an &amp;quot;Ally&amp;quot;, an inorganic being, to show us the correct procedure for a specific result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mad Prophet&amp;#39;s ally Lily (Ren) visited me to teach how to leap through the ceiling to distant stars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Told me weeks earlier she was going to do that, and she did it in several forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the greatest was how to do what Elias did.  Visit the &amp;quot;junkyards&amp;quot; of infinity, so I could look for alien artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She showed me the procedure while flying over head on fire with purple flames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an amazing sight!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not as amazing as traveling 1 billion light years per second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that rate the nearly empty scenery of space goes by so fast there&amp;#39;s no time to be bored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the sort of thing an &amp;quot;Ally&amp;quot; can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I mention, fully awake, fully visible,  and they&amp;#39;re solid when they want to be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They know how to create the right magic show to engage the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can do that yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to &amp;quot;accidentally discover&amp;quot; a given procedure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; of 4000 years ago, in the Olmec world, did just that.  But they&amp;#39;d been accidentally discovering such things for at least another 4000 years before that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know because we have one of the originals among us.  The death defier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8000 years old now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men of knowledge discovered specific magic shows to put on, so as to get the spirit to do the grand finale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the talking lizard show. Or moth dust showing the secrets of specific people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have 4000 years, so we have to start small.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My post on &amp;quot;how to burn a hole in reality&amp;quot; from before I could use drawing software, contains one such procedure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You sweep the head back and forth, looking for irregularities in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For &amp;quot;exceptions&amp;quot;.  Things that are NOT dark.  Sparkles, flecks, flashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything that isn&amp;#39;t the absolute darkness of your practice room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to sweep the head very slowly, smoothly, and without ambition.  And be patient! It takes at least a full week for &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; to build up in your ritual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose if you have done the 2 hour sessions of recapitulation I recommend, you can do the smooth head turn needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve taught yourself to be so patient sweeping like that, so as to free it from all the greed and fussiness  a beginner feels when trying to do something so crazy as &amp;quot;burn a hole in reality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve done it already during recap.  Played &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; the spirit in a way that captures its attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interested now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, there&amp;#39;s  a more advanced version of this where the result of the game is a &amp;quot;power object&amp;quot;.  A magical thing you can hold in your hand, to do just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s filled with your intention, as stored when you made it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And will use that to produce magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like that TV series, &amp;quot;Locke and Key&amp;quot;.  The ritual makes the key, but you have to pour your intent into it, as it forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite is a little crystal ball that can be used for remote viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s off in Silent Knowledge (SK) territory, and a beginner will do this first in the red zone.  Headed to orange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only halfway to SK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You sweep the room slowly, back and forth, looking for irregularities.  Sparkles.  Even just flecks or wrinkles of dull grey in the whitish light that will begin to form on virtual surfaces around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gaze going back and forth allows you to &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you &amp;quot;notice it&amp;quot;, you create a little jolt of extra awareness.  You&amp;#39;re flowing your awareness into the blackness, but when you recognize there&amp;#39;s a disturbance you get a little surge of &amp;quot;recognition&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sends an extra pulse of awareness, into the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the thing you saw brightens up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you feel this as &amp;quot;the shine of your eyes&amp;quot;, which can make things sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cause various locations along that horizontal sweep to sparkle with something no longer small or vague.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can be patient, you will enlist the help of the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at some point you will kind of &amp;quot;mesmerize&amp;quot; yourself, because all of your attention will be on that &amp;quot;shine&amp;quot; of the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how it can &amp;quot;burn&amp;quot; the darkness to reveal something glowing vividly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you become absolutely innocent, the spirit itself takes an interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t doing it the same way!  You stopped &amp;quot;paying full attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t inject that little burst of extra awareness you had for 20 minutes before, each time you noticed a disturbance was very &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it helps get you back into the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next time your gaze &amp;quot;shines&amp;quot; on a speck of sparkles, a giant hole burns into the darkness in front of you, and an entire toy store of random objects spills out into the  room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally a pile 3 feet high of fully real looking &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; spills out of a hole in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Burned there by the shine of your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just a beginner&amp;#39;s game to play with the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,

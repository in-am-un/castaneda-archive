Our ENTIRE LIFE is based on this principle. Our noisy internal dialogue just keeps causing stuff (memories of grievances) to take on our awareness (it flows into those old patches of emanations), and we keep \"assembling\" the same world.\n\nThe river of shit one.\n\nSo extrapolate this next part to be applicable to EVERYTHING. It's also why \"the book deal mind\" is such a deal killer for learning sorcery.\n\nNo one bent on fame or money, can possibly learn sorcery.\n\nIt just can't be done. The very act of seeking stuff from humans, prevents advanced \"seeing\".\n\nBack to the story. You're WAY out there on the J curve, gazing at \"energy\".\n\nIt looks like a sparkle, or ripple, or some kind of \"object\" in the air.\n\nFlashes, not so much for this application.\n\nIt needs to be steady, so you can gaze at it. Even if it's just a very small patch of tiny little bubbles of light and dark, in the air in front of you.\n\nIt can even be a fully formed \"magical object\".\n\nIt's not always just a tiny sparkle.\n\nAnd in perfect silence, you just keep watching that direction.\n\nIt's a \"seed\".\n\nNow, the complicated part. That seed can remain there for you to witness, or it can pull on you and you get sucked into another copy of yourself.\n\nA cyclic being. Or a rerun of a past event.\n\nSo forget that case.\n\nI'm talking about the case where you remain where you are standing, and gaze at it.\n\nIf you are silent enough to be in \"Silent Knowledge\", then watching the seed causes it to grow into whatever it's going to become.\n\nIt's a presentation method!\n\nThat tiny little sparkle has become a presentation method for silent knowledge.\n\nDon Juan told us about presentation methods when he advised us to become \"Readers of infinity\". To simplify things.\n\nBut what fun is that???\n\nI'll take Netflix over a book, any day.\n\nNow you want to see what the \"topic\" is, for the \"presentation method\" you discovered in the energy you can see in front of you.\n\nMaybe it's the entryway to the inorganic being's realm!\n\nMaybe it's a proto-phantom. And will become a real being standing there, as solid and real looking as if you turned on the lights.\n\nHopefully a zombie in a black hoodie. I love those! Anything that gives you a chill up the spine, is good for moving even further into other realms available to us.\n\nOr it could be the beginning of a cartoon.\n\nI get to watch those lately.\n\nI keep hoping for \"Merry Go Round Broke Down\" music, but so far there's none.\n\nAnd there's the problem.\n\nWe are NOT perfectly empty.\n\nSo whatever the sparkle becomes is highly influenced by what's still latent in our mind.\n\nJust like the talking lizards. Carlos couldn't ask them a single question, so they started answering 2 questions at once, and he couldn't understand the answer.\n\nIn my case, when the cartoon begins it's about a \"topic of concern\" in the subreddit.\n\nI get to watch those cartoon characters act out a \"solution\" to it.\n\nIt's seeing!\n\nAs don Juan said, \"If there's something my seeing can't reach, than that's just my fate.\"\n\nCarlos was taunting him with the idea he couldn't avoid a sniper with a telescopic rifle hiding at a distance.\n\nWe get that crap in here too.\n\nWhat the hell?! We've got magic!\n\nBut it's not good enough unless you're superman?\n\nFact is, we're not. And never will be.\n\nWe're tainted.\n\nSo if a seer's seeing couldn't reach something he badly needed to know, it was likely because he was tainted.\n\nWith other concerns. So it couldn't form to warn him.\n\nDon Juan also warned us about this, when he explained seers can fail, when the subject is something too close to their own feelings. Like a relative or such.\n\nThat type of thing, a gift of knowledge when you need it, comes from the spirit.\n\nBut you have to be so silent you don't add anything to it.\n\nIt's \"free skimming\" of the emanations.\n\nSo whatever concerns you have, even ugly ones like someone with a serious health problem putting a burden on this subreddit to help them, \"taint\" the free skimming.\n\nAltering what forms or even entirely preventing the original \"gift\" from the spirit, from becoming visible.\n\nWe can't possibly sort out the 1 trillion to the trillionth power pieces of \"knowledge\" available in silent knowledge, on our own. It's too much stuff to look through.\n\nWhich would make \"seeing\" useless, if it was up to us to find things.\n\nBut instead, we just get lucky and the librarian, the spirit, finds what you need. For you.\n\nYou gaze at the emanations looking for sparkles, and that activates the librarian.\n\nWho finds \"what you needed to know\".\n\nBUT, it has to be just one thing. If it's a giant mess of needs and left over concern, the librarian gets confused and just hands you a \"popular\" book from the kids section of the library.\n\n(an analogy)\n\nBut witches already know this! That's why men are so disgusting to most of them. Leaving stuff around, never cleaning their floors or sinks, maybe not even brushing their teeth everyday.\n\nIt taints reality with ugliness.\n\nSo their witchcraft won't work well.\n\nSpeaking of which, Cholita was doing a spell last night when I got home.\n\nPulling cobwebs from the air.\n\nBut there's no way to find out what she was up to.\n\nCould even have just been something real she was doing, like pulling hairs off her food.\n\nBy the way, here's something worth considering.\n\nHow does physical movement \"taint\" our awareness?\n\nDo the magical passes taint it?\n\nBut in a good direction perhaps.\n\nI think there was a lecture or book note about this, flowing through the subreddit in the last week.\n\nThat Carlos expected the Tensegrity on its own, to transform people.\n\nActually it might eventually do that.\n\nBut things weren't going so well for the first 20 years after he died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Merry Go Round Broke Down", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"t57fd6eonvqa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t57fd6eonvqa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad09593311f9cd030c7b162f187ce3d9bf27118"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t57fd6eonvqa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fbaa4e35a4ea3901565c6f45cd154bcf293c01d"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t57fd6eonvqa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c12ac89d08d03a310ca70b34413991ae731d57d"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t57fd6eonvqa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f823cd01b155c377e7950265f2297fc5a9539b"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t57fd6eonvqa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c57ac20068ef0f23fb7dae2544aa32a0f705712"}], "s": {"y": 563, "x": 1000, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t57fd6eonvqa1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93b0b3e883d58b2157362e92e21b9123fcab05b"}, "id": "t57fd6eonvqa1"}}, "name": "t3_126mspa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/JB7KhbK5aPZkUhsPPJf2cQHXfuo-vy1y6__WVSU9fmY.jpg", "edited": 1680182746.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1680182530.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t57fd6eonvqa1.png?width=1000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d93b0b3e883d58b2157362e92e21b9123fcab05b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t57fd6eonvqa1.png?width=1000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d93b0b3e883d58b2157362e92e21b9123fcab05b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you speak more on how witches helping others &amp;quot;taints&amp;quot; their results?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reply:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really not hard to understand, but it&amp;#39;s just so different than what we know that people can&amp;#39;t grasp it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll animate it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the meantime, when you get far out there on the J curve and can &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot; in the air, you gaze around looking for anything that stands out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, please don&amp;#39;t think this applies only to a magical situation.

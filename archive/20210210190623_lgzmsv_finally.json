I'm afraid we may need those. We haven't seen it yet, but there will be attention seeking copycats using what's in here, to swindle money from people.  And claiming they came first. Or they learned over here.  And they'll modify and redefine things, to make it easier to pretend.\n\nIt'll become a big mess, the way it is now in the general community. Just self-absorbed people, clawing each other for attention.\n\nI'd say the rings are egotistical, except Carol had one to signal Taisha who she was, and KungFu masters in Hong Kong, from when the masters from all over china fled there, used them.\n\nI've seen one.  In that case, the master only created 5 rings.  If you want to see it, search for \"Dr. Fung\" in Canada.\n\nSuperb Tai Chi and Shaolin.  Kicked me through a door one time.  Tossed me out on my ass, when I suggested acupuncture comes from Ayurveda in front of his young girlfriend.\n\nHere's the standard:  Bring out the double,  rearrange furniture in the next room, then verify it happened when you return to the Tonal body.\n\nNot to say bringing out the double is the end game. It's actually just beginners status as a sorcerer.\n\nBut good enough to teach.  Warrants a symbol like a ring.\n\nYou see here in this picture, one way to do it.\n\nAnd don't ignore the pictures. Each is a key step.\n\nBut there are many ways to bring it out.  It's simply \"Silent Knowledge\" that makes it visible.  Meaning, you have to be at the end of the J curve, where the air is filled with tiny dreams and creatures.\n\nI suspect, \"Sock Puppet Theater\" is the best IOB game to accomplish the needed movement.\n\nNow, we know it can come out from 4 gates dreaming.\n\nAnd here, from waking dreaming.\n\nAnd I did it using recapitulation, although that's not a good situation to make it obvious what happened, because you are not in heightened awareness proper, so you feel \"blanked out\" when it happens.\n\nIn the darkroom there's no blank out.  You switch, but you are perfectly awake.\n\nIn lucid dreaming, you are \"drunken\".\n\nSo in my opinion, this is the easiest way to bring it out, and notice it.\n\nUndoubtedly it can be brought out through Tensegrity.\n\nWhich brings me to a complaint. I get private messaged that we should stick to Tensegrity.\n\nSo ok!  Stop being lazy, and figure out how to bring out the double with tensegrity!\n\nOops.  No one wants to do any work. The reason they say to stick to tensegrity, is because it hurts their pretending to see this subreddit.  They want to claim to be \"proper\", and do their daily exercises.\n\nIt's the same exploding head thing we see here with new people who have changed the meaning of things, to declare victory.\n\nThe key point in this diagram, to me, is not how you do this. How you bring out the double.\n\nWe all know how to do this!  It's obvious from the instructions Carlos left us.\n\nMove to the end of the J curve. Carlos told us that.  The double becomes visible, at that point. He called it, \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nSeeing whitish light on the walls is mandatory.\n\nWell, not mandatory.  The double can come out just because you fell into a river.  As don Juan did.\n\nBut for this path, look for the whitish light, and then see if your finger can trace one of the lines.\n\nIf it can, you are 90% in the dreaming double. Only the double has full location information on the lines.  The tonal is just borrowing his sight, but not the triangulation information.\n\nIf your hand can trace one, try to push it a bit, to see if you can deviate it's path.\n\nIf you can, you are ready!\n\nBeing ready doesn't mean you'll succeed that night.  As Juan pointed out in public chat, there's a quote form the books saying even the higher ups in the lineage had to battle the phony idea of self.\n\nThe \"self\" is either a cousin of, or even actually is, Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nSome aren't happy with that idea, but it's just because in the books, everyone got the Nagual's blow. So they never saw what the fight was like, forging it alone along that J curve.  They bypassed Mr. Doubletake, and starved him to death.\n\nBut still, they had traces of \"the self\".\n\nIf you have too much of that, you probably can't switch bodies.\n\nIf your head explodes in anger in this subreddit, forget it. You're \"self-absorbed\".\n\nYou can't do any magic. It's that simple.  Anything you claim to be doing, is 90% mental masturbation.\n\nBut if you can trace the lines and then make one move, try sitting up and gazing ahead.  The view should be changed.  It won't be the same as you normally see.\n\nIn my case I started to see a statue, and wanted to make it more solid.\n\nFancy got very excited, and Mystery too.  First Mystery tried to get my attention, by making a \"scary face\" or two. But he's not very good at scary, and you can see what he came up with.  Sort of.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I pretended it was very scary.\n\nMystery is almost like an \"old man\".  From a long forgotten age.  Not quite up to date.\n\nFancy took over.  It was absolutely amazing. I had a fully visible, seemingly solid angel, flying around me in circles with her long flowing robe rubbing against my skin.  For a long time, perhaps as much as 30 seconds. That's a lot for that sort of perfectly real, highly physical interaction. And the animation rate was probably very high, nearly full speed.\n\nBut I was so amazed, I forgot to look for that sort of detail.\n\nFinally she ran out of energy, and settled into my arms.\n\nWith her face just 3 inches from mine. I was able to look at her face, and then down her body to see that she was resting on both of my arms.\n\nI got the idea (perhaps from Fancy), to try that statue thing again. Then it occurred to me, that's why the old seers could make their own villages. By playing in the second attention, they discovered the obvious.\n\nIf you want the most intense practice, surround yourself with a virtual world. Start in your own dark space, but switch it to something that doesn't actually exist, yet is perfectly real looking.  And stable.\n\nI tried and tried, but instead of a room filled with crystalline dreaming fog, the normal situation at that distant position of the assemblage point, I had absolute blackness. Like a canvass I could add objects to.  I got the statue to form a bit, but to the right there was some weirdness.\n\nI call it \"the honeypot\".  It's like \"bliss\", but it's some how sickly sweet, like leaving food too long in the crockpot.  It's probably \"intent bliss\", but in some kind of beginning form.\n\nAnd some malformed IOB tried to muscle in on the view.\n\nI got mentally tired.  I was in full on heightened awareness, so I knew I could not fall asleep. I decided to rest a bit on my side, watching dreams to retain heightened awareness.\n\nIn so doing, I accidentally copied Taisha's new book.\n\nTaisha would move her assemblage point, and then climb up into the treehouse to commune with the tree spirits, which could keep her assemblage point at that useful position.\n\nAnd she was told to lay on her side, and visualize doing kungfu on the floor.\n\nThat brought her double out.\n\nI didn't need shadow beings, I'm up to my ears in normal IOBs.  And besides, I was obsessed with \"the abstract\".\n\nDreams formed, and I used my gaze to \"extract\" the abstract from them.\n\nThe abstract is hypnotic. While gazing into it, I heard a loud voice. It was absolutely real.  A man.\n\nI should have been frightened, and gone for my Zatoichi sword.  A Yakuza design because it looks like a cane.\n\nBut I wasn't.\n\n\"Hey Daniel!  Over here!\" it said.\n\nI jumped up from the bed, slightly surprised I wasn't at all groggy.  If you jump up after resting like that, it usually takes a second or two for the muscles to warm up again. At my age, as much as 15 seconds.\n\nNot only was I instantly mobile, but I felt like I was 14 years old again.\n\nI put my head to the door, to listen.\n\n\"I'm out there!\", the voice said. It actually used, \"there\", instead of \"here\".  As if it were actually in my reference position, on the other side of the door.\n\nIn my mind I got the idea, \"That's your brother.\"\n\nI have no idea why.  That makes about as much sense as it being Batman. Pity.  The Dark Crusader might have been more fun.\n\nI opened the door, and saw him.  It was no dream. This was my real hallway.  Even Cholita's phantom copy of the house is not that realistic. There's always little deviances from reality and things change if you stare too hard.\n\nThe only problem here was, the man was laying on his side, too far up in the air to be on the floor. \n\nI thought I saw a bench under him, which I don't have.\n\nI couldn't see his face, and moved forward to look.\n\nHe vanished.\n\nI stepped back, and he was there again.  But barely.\n\nI got a chill. It was cold!  I have a heater in my room, but Cholita is an enemy of the furnace, and won't let me turn it on to heat the house.\n\nThe man was gone, so I walked down the hallway. I knew something was weird, but it was absolutely my house, and I was still me. I jumped up a bit to see how it felt when I landed.  A good test for dreaming.\n\nI was not dreaming.  The wooden floor even made a little thump.\n\nI got chills up my spine, as I realized, Cholita was around. I never go into the house at night.\n\nIt belongs entirely to Cholita.\n\nBut I had to find out what was going on.  I felt like electricity, in the form of the chill of fear, filled the air.\n\nIt felt great! Like the drop into the darkness, at the start of the Pirate ride at Disneyland.\n\nI went into \"the blue room\", which Cholita has rejected so far. In the real world that is.  You can see how empty it is in that picture.\n\nBut she's built it up into a community game room with plush white carpet in her phantom copy of the house. Pillows on the floor all around. And it's a good 30 feet in all directions.\n\nBut it was just the ordinary blue room.  Other than a trapdoor in the floor, there's nothing special about it.\n\nI tried throwing an imaginary ball as fast as I could at the wall, something that you can do in the darkroom to get \"things\" to happen. I didn't have any puffs of color, so I pretended I did.\n\nI felt waves in the air, but they weren't dreamlike. And my arm hurt a bit.\n\nExcept, I just ignored it and it went away. And the cold too. I had been worried it was too cold, but then I just \"ignored it\", like wrestling an ally, and then it backs off.\n\nApparently the double can feel anything you normally would feel, but it's not limited by it.\n\nThe sense that Cholita would find me got stronger, and I ran back to my room.\n\nBut when I touched the doorknob, I was already back on the bed.\n\nI sat up and it finally occurred to me. I had switched to the dreaming double.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Finally...", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "link_ids": ["t3_ifu1bv", "t3_if5koq", "t3_ienqgj", "t3_ie01zd", "t3_idn0fa", "t3_idh7ju", "t3_iczlw5", "t3_icv2ot", "t3_irms6p", "t3_irglig", "t3_iqzit7", "t3_iq7jdg", "t3_iof5ib", "t3_invu3w", "t3_imlozg", "t3_ilzfhg", "t3_ildkri", "t3_ijgd33", "t3_iixdqk", "t3_ihms98", "t3_ih21eh", "t3_ih44uo", "t3_igh7ta", "t3_igday4", "t3_jcxlwj", "t3_hp41du", "t3_kdsew2", "t3_kz7y8a", "t3_kz75ql", "t3_kw4lpr", "t3_kvqj52", "t3_knpzzc", "t3_km2pzf", "t3_kj29l8", "t3_kd0b1h", "t3_k641wo", "t3_k4jrfq", "t3_k2paj7", "t3_k2dn7a", "t3_k1fwwj", "t3_jqlctf", "t3_jq09jk", "t3_jp4g2x", "t3_jng0bx", "t3_jmu5w3", "t3_jmsrw3", "t3_jm1fxl", "t3_jkklgr", "t3_jikxdd", "t3_jhb6f9", "t3_jh8142", "t3_jglh8m", "t3_jgb5mx", "t3_jg53re", "t3_jfoaai", "t3_jf4c1u", "t3_je4gyw", "t3_jdlcth", "t3_jby6ff", "t3_jadwdo", "t3_j9fkih", "t3_j96xwg", "t3_j8rmcm", "t3_j7c8fa", "t3_j65s10", "t3_j61w6p", "t3_j43yai", "t3_j40bem", "t3_j3eykq", "t3_j2jxyx", "t3_j261xv", "t3_j1vngl", "t3_j0g2nl", "t3_izm9cx", "t3_iyhkny", "t3_ix9ipe", "t3_ix5a4g", "t3_iw29ja", "t3_iverkv", "t3_iu3yxd", "t3_isv81g", "t3_isnn0y", "t3_ic1ppo", "t3_i9fbj8", "t3_i8kcue", "t3_i795h6", "t3_i5o2m4", "t3_i4tqjj", "t3_i3o4mq", "t3_i2ha3h", "t3_i1ch4u", "t3_i0s7jm", "t3_hzfk4m", "t3_hx8xej", "t3_iyz5md", "t3_ljjdbn", "t3_lfo0wa", "t3_lgzmsv"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 1", "created_at_utc": 1598295005.319, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1620558726.961, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"933rjobxpog61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/933rjobxpog61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09376203370f911043fb714db766b7820dbed517"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/933rjobxpog61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93e1570f5f31c2b3224412f359faaa1b5b17e534"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/933rjobxpog61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53894e459afc636d4e8e23969827eec0000be002"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/933rjobxpog61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=741efef8445d5c19bea0ab2186ae9f43dd531d9f"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/933rjobxpog61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f093bf90b521c4bbb34f4ae0f1bde53662c57de"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/933rjobxpog61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18865612203c92dc884fa2e698fb2887c01fbde5"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/933rjobxpog61.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a800e04157f0383fa6e1e568bf481882e13f42bd"}, "id": "933rjobxpog61"}}, "name": "t3_lgzmsv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YrZFL2dfneqArZV8mHCHqb3Ijyfs0E-PM2RvSPsx3yU.jpg", "edited": 1612981844.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1612980383.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/933rjobxpog61.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a800e04157f0383fa6e1e568bf481882e13f42bd\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the Worthy Goal for this Subreddit!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, those rings.

I had a fully visible, seemingly solid angel, flying around me in circles with her long flowing robe rubbing against my skin.  For a long time, perhaps as much as 30 seconds. That&amp;#39;s a lot for that sort of perfectly real, highly physical interaction. And the animation rate was probably very high, nearly full speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was so amazed, I forgot to look for that sort of detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally she ran out of energy, and settled into my arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With her face just 3 inches from mine. I was able to look at her face, and then down her body to see that she was resting on both of my arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the idea (perhaps from Fancy), to try that statue thing again. Then it occurred to me, that&amp;#39;s why the old seers could make their own villages. By playing in the second attention, they discovered the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want the most intense practice, surround yourself with a virtual world. Start in your own dark space, but switch it to something that doesn&amp;#39;t actually exist, yet is perfectly real looking.  And stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried and tried, but instead of a room filled with crystalline dreaming fog, the normal situation at that distant position of the assemblage point, I had absolute blackness. Like a canvass I could add objects to.  I got the statue to form a bit, but to the right there was some weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I call it &amp;quot;the honeypot&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;bliss&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s some how sickly sweet, like leaving food too long in the crockpot.  It&amp;#39;s probably &amp;quot;intent bliss&amp;quot;, but in some kind of beginning form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some malformed IOB tried to muscle in on the view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got mentally tired.  I was in full on heightened awareness, so I knew I could not fall asleep. I decided to rest a bit on my side, watching dreams to retain heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In so doing, I accidentally copied Taisha&amp;#39;s new book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha would move her assemblage point, and then climb up into the treehouse to commune with the tree spirits, which could keep her assemblage point at that useful position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she was told to lay on her side, and visualize doing kungfu on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That brought her double out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t need shadow beings, I&amp;#39;m up to my ears in normal IOBs.  And besides, I was obsessed with &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreams formed, and I used my gaze to &amp;quot;extract&amp;quot; the abstract from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract is hypnotic. While gazing into it, I heard a loud voice. It was absolutely real.  A man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should have been frightened, and gone for my Zatoichi sword.  A Yakuza design because it looks like a cane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I wasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Daniel!  Over here!&amp;quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I jumped up from the bed, slightly surprised I wasn&amp;#39;t at all groggy.  If you jump up after resting like that, it usually takes a second or two for the muscles to warm up again. At my age, as much as 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only was I instantly mobile, but I felt like I was 14 years old again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put my head to the door, to listen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m out there!&amp;quot;, the voice said. It actually used, &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;, instead of &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;.  As if it were actually in my reference position, on the other side of the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my mind I got the idea, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s your brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why.  That makes about as much sense as it being Batman. Pity.  The Dark Crusader might have been more fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door, and saw him.  It was no dream. This was my real hallway.  Even Cholita&amp;#39;s phantom copy of the house is not that realistic. There&amp;#39;s always little deviances from reality and things change if you stare too hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only problem here was, the man was laying on his side, too far up in the air to be on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I saw a bench under him, which I don&amp;#39;t have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t see his face, and moved forward to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped back, and he was there again.  But barely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a chill. It was cold!  I have a heater in my room, but Cholita is an enemy of the furnace, and won&amp;#39;t let me turn it on to heat the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man was gone, so I walked down the hallway. I knew something was weird, but it was absolutely my house, and I was still me. I jumped up a bit to see how it felt when I landed.  A good test for dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was not dreaming.  The wooden floor even made a little thump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got chills up my spine, as I realized, Cholita was around. I never go into the house at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It belongs entirely to Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had to find out what was going on.  I felt like electricity, in the form of the chill of fear, filled the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It felt great! Like the drop into the darkness, at the start of the Pirate ride at Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went into &amp;quot;the blue room&amp;quot;, which Cholita has rejected so far. In the real world that is.  You can see how empty it is in that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she&amp;#39;s built it up into a community game room with plush white carpet in her phantom copy of the house. Pillows on the floor all around. And it&amp;#39;s a good 30 feet in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was just the ordinary blue room.  Other than a trapdoor in the floor, there&amp;#39;s nothing special about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried throwing an imaginary ball as fast as I could at the wall, something that you can do in the darkroom to get &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; to happen. I didn&amp;#39;t have any puffs of color, so I pretended I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt waves in the air, but they weren&amp;#39;t dreamlike. And my arm hurt a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, I just ignored it and it went away. And the cold too. I had been worried it was too cold, but then I just &amp;quot;ignored it&amp;quot;, like wrestling an ally, and then it backs off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently the double can feel anything you normally would feel, but it&amp;#39;s not limited by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sense that Cholita would find me got stronger, and I ran back to my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when I touched the doorknob, I was already back on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up and it finally occurred to me. I had switched to the dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "lgzmsv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lgzmsv/finally/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/lgzmsv/finally/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1612980383.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gmzox8s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gmzmuxc", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I don't want to find out.\n\nYou've never been beaten up by Cholita.\n\nFirst thing she does, is knock your glasses off so you worry about them breaking when they fly to the ground.

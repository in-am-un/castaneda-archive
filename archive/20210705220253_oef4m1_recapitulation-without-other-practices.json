That would be so good! I'll go over the whole thing.\n\nI had the benefit of hearing Carlos and all of  the witches speak on the subject, although usually Taisha got stuck with the fine details.\n\nTry to find that video where Miles sweeps his head, but don't get confused by him leaning over. You sit up straight in the most comfortable chair you can get, because you might end up driving it through the wall, and out into the second attention.\n\nI suggest an arm chair that can lean back, although some people with poor living situations simply go crumple up in the closet.\n\nThe head turns left, then back to the right, then back to the left again. Don't strain the neck, there's no benefit. In fact, eventually it's 100% energetic, meaning the head isn't even important anymore. But that happens once you can \"see energy\".\n\nAs the head turns left, it inhales all the \"emanations\" you got stuck in other people and situations in the past. Keep in mind, NONE of this is theory.  You don't have to believe any of it. If it was all just pretend, I'd be out of here in seconds.\n\nThere's no point if it's not true! So, you WILL see the emanations.  Eventually.  You have to completely silence the mind to do that, or get lucky as a witch.\n\nDarned witches...I had Cholita playing games with me using her double last night.  Taunting me I suppose.  Or it could have been an apology.\n\nSo the head turns left to \"retrieve\" the energy you left in a situation. When it gets to the left as far as is comfortable, it turns back right, exhaling all the bad stuff you picked up from others.\n\nI shouldn't say, \"bad stuff\", because some beginners will jump on that and start picking and choosing. Bad stuff is anything that wasn't you.  Anything from someone else or some other place. Especially stuff that left emotions or a bad taste in your memory. Those people embed their emanations inside you!  Not a lot of them, but enough to be trouble.\n\nWe  have TRILLIONS of emanations.  Maybe even more. So don't think of them as a limited resource. We really don't need lost ones back, or to get rid of ones put into us. We need our energy back, and those glowing emanations, stuck in something else, dissipate a little energy. So we want ours back, and any that weren't ours, out. As a result, we can be silent and empty, but not fall asleep.\n\nWe want to learn to be amazingly alert, but completely empty. In that state, we can perceive reality. Which is infinite.\n\nYou of course need to make a list. Don't sweat the list.  People use that as an excuse.\n\nIf the list takes you a week, during which you don't recap, forget about it.  You're the \"excuse\" type, and won't be able to finish. All talk, no doing.\n\n(I've seen that too many times.)\n\nYou could go \"listless\" at first, until you see if you can activate the second attention. Start by picking a memory from the past. Do the inhale and exhale sweeping, while you remember the tiniest detail of the memory that you care capable of. If your memory isn't that good, no problem.  Try to remember as best you can.\n\nNow, I should have mentioned, keep a notepad and pencil right there. If while recapitulating that memory you remember something else you want to do, put it on the list. If you had made a traditional list, I'd say it would be around 30 pages, to cover your whole life at first.\n\nAnd as you pick the top item on that 30 page list, you remember things you hadn't before, and have to add them to the end of that list. The 30 page list will expand to 100 pages soon enough, but fortunately as you go you toss out pages that you finished. So you'll stay steady at some number of pages for a while.\n\nIf you went \"listless\", it was just to learn if you want to do it or not.  At some point, start making the list.\n\nHow complete? I made a list of everything I could remember. Then I visited every single place I ever lived, and walked around in all the places I went when I lived there.  If I saw anything at all that I didn't have on my original list, I added it.\n\nThen I went to every school, and every mall I had ever visited, and did the same. I even walked the random streets in those places, looking at the dirt on the side of the road for more things.\n\nLike, a red wire on the dirt.  As a kid, I could never get enough wire or screws so I was able to recall searching for \"parts\" as a child, along the roads.\n\nWhen you finish recapitulating the results of that, visit the grocery store you were in most as a child. If it's gone, find a similar one. Look at ever single items on the shelves, and follow it back all the way to childhood, to find more memories. \"Cream of Wheat\" cereal?  Did you have that for breakfast as a child? Did someone spill some, and there was a fight? Did you hurl some cream of wheat, because you had the flu?\n\nYou have to find everything. You need 3 hours a day if you want to do well, 6 hours a day if you want to be amazing and travel to other worlds while you do it. 3  hours though is the minimum, to get the assemblage point to shift enough to make your recapitulation more magical.\n\nWhen you finish with those, get a small dictionary, start at the As, and remember anything you can. Aardvark?  Did you see any?  Was there one in a cartoon?  Television commercials? Did you learn to spell it in the 2nd grade?  Did your friends smile about that word because it's \"fun\"?\n\nNow, before you keel over at the thought of all that work, keep this in mind. There's no goal with recapitulation. It's the process that matters. It moves the assemblage point, and brings out the second attention.  It also brings out the double, summons IOBs, and gives you portal access to other worlds. It increases lucid dreaming, as long as you try to be silent before sleeping.\n\nIt's like darkroom. There's no goal to darkroom, other than exploration of real magic. Same for recap. \n\nSome tips:  You NEVER get rid of the memory. It's a mistake to think you can even noticeably change how you feel about the past. Remembering it is the main goal .If you remember everything, you will see a spider web in front of you when you close your eyes. An impossible to describe \"abstract\" structure will be completely visible, when you close your eyes. On the web will be past events, as tiny little dreams, \"stuck\" on the web. Using those you can travel. \n\nNow the advanced stuff: If you could recapitulate with absolutely no internal dialogue, you would find magic very fast. Because the assemblage point would move rapidly down the J curve. But you can't. So strike a balance.  Don't get involved in self-reflection. Don't stop and start fantasizing or talking to yourself about some past grievance .\n\nTry to stick to remembering details, and keep the internal dialogue to zero if possible.  \n\nAs you sweep the head, look for the following: Depth that shouldn't be there. Light. A sense of awareness in front of you. Blackness that takes on texture. \n\nThose are the second attention coming out. Try to sweep the head along that \"surface\" or scene, \"fanning\" it with your breath. If you see a yellowish light while the head turns, let the breath blow on it, like you were blowing on a little red glow on a charcoal, trying to get it to brighten and catch fire. \n\nIf your head stops all by itself during recap, because you \"blanked out\", that's an extremely good sign. Just resume where you believe it stopped. If you can't make it to the end of that breath 4 times in a row, you're going to be very good at recap! \n\nWhen the head stops turning and you blanked out, take a look around before you restart.  Just a second or two, to see what's up. The IOBs present entry ways to their realm, for you to walk off into. \n\nDon't.  But do gaze in there. If your hands or arms move on their own, in response to those \"tunnels\", you have the double offering to go in for you. \n\nDon't.  It's recap.  Stick with the recap. \n\nFalse memories are another topic. If you have any, let me know. Those are inorganic beings playing with you. It's the only way they have to interact, when you are recapitulating. \n\nAlthough they can certainly pull you into a phantom dream of your recap environment. With your eyes closed (you keep them closed during recap), you'll \"see the room\". \n\nBut not if you are looking for it. You only see it when you don't know any better. Once you know better, it goes away.\n\nThe horribleness of the book deal mind applies to recapitulation also.", "edited": 1626020534.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h4tirru", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!

Keep in mind, NONE of this is theory.  You don&amp;#39;t have to believe any of it. If it was all just pretend, I&amp;#39;d be out of here in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no point if it&amp;#39;s not true! So, you WILL see the emanations.  Eventually.  You have to completely silence the mind to do that, or get lucky as a witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darned witches...I had Cholita playing games with me using her double last night.  Taunting me I suppose.  Or it could have been an apology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the head turns left to &amp;quot;retrieve&amp;quot; the energy you left in a situation. When it gets to the left as far as is comfortable, it turns back right, exhaling all the bad stuff you picked up from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouldn&amp;#39;t say, &amp;quot;bad stuff&amp;quot;, because some beginners will jump on that and start picking and choosing. Bad stuff is anything that wasn&amp;#39;t you.  Anything from someone else or some other place. Especially stuff that left emotions or a bad taste in your memory. Those people embed their emanations inside you!  Not a lot of them, but enough to be trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We  have TRILLIONS of emanations.  Maybe even more. So don&amp;#39;t think of them as a limited resource. We really don&amp;#39;t need lost ones back, or to get rid of ones put into us. We need our energy back, and those glowing emanations, stuck in something else, dissipate a little energy. So we want ours back, and any that weren&amp;#39;t ours, out. As a result, we can be silent and empty, but not fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to learn to be amazingly alert, but completely empty. In that state, we can perceive reality. Which is infinite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You of course need to make a list. Don&amp;#39;t sweat the list.  People use that as an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the list takes you a week, during which you don&amp;#39;t recap, forget about it.  You&amp;#39;re the &amp;quot;excuse&amp;quot; type, and won&amp;#39;t be able to finish. All talk, no doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;ve seen that too many times.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could go &amp;quot;listless&amp;quot; at first, until you see if you can activate the second attention. Start by picking a memory from the past. Do the inhale and exhale sweeping, while you remember the tiniest detail of the memory that you care capable of. If your memory isn&amp;#39;t that good, no problem.  Try to remember as best you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I should have mentioned, keep a notepad and pencil right there. If while recapitulating that memory you remember something else you want to do, put it on the list. If you had made a traditional list, I&amp;#39;d say it would be around 30 pages, to cover your whole life at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as you pick the top item on that 30 page list, you remember things you hadn&amp;#39;t before, and have to add them to the end of that list. The 30 page list will expand to 100 pages soon enough, but fortunately as you go you toss out pages that you finished. So you&amp;#39;ll stay steady at some number of pages for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you went &amp;quot;listless&amp;quot;, it was just to learn if you want to do it or not.  At some point, start making the list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How complete? I made a list of everything I could remember. Then I visited every single place I ever lived, and walked around in all the places I went when I lived there.  If I saw anything at all that I didn&amp;#39;t have on my original list, I added it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I went to every school, and every mall I had ever visited, and did the same. I even walked the random streets in those places, looking at the dirt on the side of the road for more things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, a red wire on the dirt.  As a kid, I could never get enough wire or screws so I was able to recall searching for &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot; as a child, along the roads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you finish recapitulating the results of that, visit the grocery store you were in most as a child. If it&amp;#39;s gone, find a similar one. Look at ever single items on the shelves, and follow it back all the way to childhood, to find more memories. &amp;quot;Cream of Wheat&amp;quot; cereal?  Did you have that for breakfast as a child? Did someone spill some, and there was a fight? Did you hurl some cream of wheat, because you had the flu?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to find everything. You need 3 hours a day if you want to do well, 6 hours a day if you want to be amazing and travel to other worlds while you do it. 3  hours though is the minimum, to get the assemblage point to shift enough to make your recapitulation more magical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you finish with those, get a small dictionary, start at the As, and remember anything you can. Aardvark?  Did you see any?  Was there one in a cartoon?  Television commercials? Did you learn to spell it in the 2nd grade?  Did your friends smile about that word because it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, before you keel over at the thought of all that work, keep this in mind. There&amp;#39;s no goal with recapitulation. It&amp;#39;s the process that matters. It moves the assemblage point, and brings out the second attention.  It also brings out the double, summons IOBs, and gives you portal access to other worlds. It increases lucid dreaming, as long as you try to be silent before sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like darkroom. There&amp;#39;s no goal to darkroom, other than exploration of real magic. Same for recap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some tips:  You NEVER get rid of the memory. It&amp;#39;s a mistake to think you can even noticeably change how you feel about the past. Remembering it is the main goal .If you remember everything, you will see a spider web in front of you when you close your eyes. An impossible to describe &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot; structure will be completely visible, when you close your eyes. On the web will be past events, as tiny little dreams, &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; on the web. Using those you can travel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the advanced stuff: If you could recapitulate with absolutely no internal dialogue, you would find magic very fast. Because the assemblage point would move rapidly down the J curve. But you can&amp;#39;t. So strike a balance.  Don&amp;#39;t get involved in self-reflection. Don&amp;#39;t stop and start fantasizing or talking to yourself about some past grievance .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to stick to remembering details, and keep the internal dialogue to zero if possible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you sweep the head, look for the following: Depth that shouldn&amp;#39;t be there. Light. A sense of awareness in front of you. Blackness that takes on texture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the second attention coming out. Try to sweep the head along that &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; or scene, &amp;quot;fanning&amp;quot; it with your breath. If you see a yellowish light while the head turns, let the breath blow on it, like you were blowing on a little red glow on a charcoal, trying to get it to brighten and catch fire. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your head stops all by itself during recap, because you &amp;quot;blanked out&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s an extremely good sign. Just resume where you believe it stopped. If you can&amp;#39;t make it to the end of that breath 4 times in a row, you&amp;#39;re going to be very good at recap! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the head stops turning and you blanked out, take a look around before you restart.  Just a second or two, to see what&amp;#39;s up. The IOBs present entry ways to their realm, for you to walk off into. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t.  But do gaze in there. If your hands or arms move on their own, in response to those &amp;quot;tunnels&amp;quot;, you have the double offering to go in for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t.  It&amp;#39;s recap.  Stick with the recap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;False memories are another topic. If you have any, let me know. Those are inorganic beings playing with you. It&amp;#39;s the only way they have to interact, when you are recapitulating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although they can certainly pull you into a phantom dream of your recap environment. With your eyes closed (you keep them closed during recap), you&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;see the room&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not if you are looking for it. You only see it when you don&amp;#39;t know any better. Once you know better, it goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The horribleness of the book deal mind applies to recapitulation also.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_oef4m1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oef4m1/recapitulation_without_other_practices/h4tirru/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1626019505.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1626019505.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h4rv9a2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "mushroomwitchpdx", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1625975381.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h45wv8e", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_aij0y4os", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I might be able to rise to the challenge.

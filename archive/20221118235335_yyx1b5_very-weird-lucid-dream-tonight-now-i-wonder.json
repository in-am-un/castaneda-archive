From here I grab a coke on a stranger's table and manage to drink it because somwhere, I already know I am dreaming so I can grab this coke, it is mine. Then I sit and realise I'm not alone in the table, someone is here with me. I tell them I am dreaming and I thought about the emissary of dreams and clearly realise I am dreaming even more, I even found my hands at this moment (which happened only once before, the same night I read the passage in Carlos book). So I decide to talk with the stranger at my table, at this point I am really stabilized in the dream, I don't know if he is the emissary or even what it is supposed to look like but I ask him anyway : \"Can you teach me something ?\". At this moment I had the desire to try and make an energetic ball with my hand see what kind of things it could do but the answer came, something along the lines of : \"It is dangerous to modify dreams\" so I got frustrated then leave the table forgeting about making an energetic ball. But here comes the crazy part, as I leave the table, I came accross that long white corridor. In the end of it lies a sleeping body. As I approach, I realise this is me but asleep. So I managed to wake him up, he wakes up in chock, he had this serious face and looked at me in astonishment.

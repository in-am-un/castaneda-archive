It would be considered a single movement, in the long forms.\n\nThe long forms started to come along after he\u2019d taught at least 100 short movements. He decided the long forms might help us reduce the internal dialogue.\n\nHe liked to watch this magical pass very closely.\n\nIt was kind of odd. I could never figure out what he was gazing at when he stood next to me, so I adjusted all aspects of it, hoping he'd say, \"Yes!  That's it!!!\"\n\nHe only grinned. I understand why now, and you will too if you learn to be silent.\n\nThere are 2 aspects to it that are not obvious.\n\nThe obvious thing is, you are scooping energy towards the center, in order to redeploy it.\n\nThe hands will naturally scoop it towards the second attention\u2019s assemblage point, if the hands are relaxed at your sides and the elbow is not too bent.\n\nThe circling of the hand is generated from the elbow, although the shoulders have to move a bit too. But mostly the hand bends at the wrist as needed, and the fingers curl a bit to simulate scooping up an actual substance.\n\nCarlos put a little \u201cflick\u201d into his fingers at the end, just to emphasize making the ball go right to the middle, after it\u2019s been scooped up and concentrated.\n\nI supposed you could say, the scoop forms the ball, but the flick moves it in place.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to flick at all once you can see what\u2019s happening. At that point, you\u2019ll realize that Tensegrity is not dogma.\n\nIt\u2019s not like KungFu or Karate, where there\u2019s only one correct way to move, and no one\u2019s going to explain exactly why that\u2019s so.\n\nWith Tensegrity, you\u2019re actually moving visible energy around.\n\nBesides the subtle flick at the end, there\u2019s also a rocking movement which would tend to sweep the floor if you had a broom stuck to your navel.\n\nThat requires a tiny rotation of the torso at the hips, plus rocking very slightly at the hips so that the left hip is further left, when the right hand flicks. Then the reverse.  A horizontal movement, but no more than 1 inch is needed.\n\nPlease don't overdo the sweeping!\n\nCarlos didn't even mention it.  I only realized that's what was going on, because of the complicated but extremely subtle, hip rocking and rotation.\n\nAnd as far as sweeping goes, it really just means, try to feel the floor with a tentacle coming from your stomach.\n\nZuleica\u2019s technique involves pulling colors you can see in darkness, closer to your body.\n\nJosefina simply swished into the first color she found, but in our cases we probably have to suck them in, like Unbending Intent, Long form.\n\n[https://np.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://np.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\nIt uses scooping to redeploy energy.  Notice how the head turns with the hand.\n\nSame with Zuleica's pass.  Notice in my \"mannequins\", the head turns with the hand that's doing the scooping.\n\nAt first, the colors are non-directional, so you need to turn the head.\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gy1jwu/directionality\\_vs\\_nondirectionality/](https://np.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gy1jwu/directionality_vs_nondirectionality/)\n\nBut eventually you do not, as I proved last night just so that I wouldn't mislead anyone.\n\nI tried this technique out, to make sure the ball in the middle was this well formed, and also to get a better idea about that \"streakiness\" I added.  I'm trying to show, that you can gaze at that ball in the middle as a surface.\n\nAny surface can be used to see energy at large.  So not only could you do this movement and see that ball in the middle, but believe it or not, you could leap into it and disappear into another world.\n\nThat's what Josefina did.\n\nShe found her color all right.\n\nThen being absolutely crazy, like Cholita, she gazed deeper into it and found a world she could enter.  And it didn't occur to her, it's impossible to leap into there. What would happen to your physical body?\n\nJosefina didn't care.\n\nTake my word for it!  We've haven't even begun to explore Tensegrity.  That's the tragedy of it all.\n\nWe're currently perpetuating Tensegrity, absent any real knowledge of what it's for.\n\nLike a mindless Chi Gung exercise, when in fact it's a damned miracle!\n\nI've actually been told to go away, when I posted inspirational advise on some Russian Tensegrity pages.\n\nThey had a comment section.\n\nBut I wasn't welcome.\n\n\"Go away\", they say!\n\n\"We like our pretending.\"\n\n\"We don't need Carlos' original students giving us any advice. We're impeccable!!!\"\n\nTensegrity has been franchised.\n\nBurger King franchisees don't care about hamburger politics.\n\nOnly the bottom line.\n\nEventually you can look straight ahead while doing Zuleica's pass, and the colors remain in the hand that's controlling them, without the movement of your eyes to help.\n\nKeeping the head looking forward and slightly down encourages the luminous body to become visible.  Maybe 4 inches to the right of perfectly in center, and looking down at 60 degrees.\n\nIt will be a different color than the scooped colors.   I have a report of yellowish today from someone.\n\nYes, I believe that's correct, but you could also say grayish, or amber.\n\nAnd it will have vague lines of dark and light hidden in it.  Those are the fibers and tentacles of your second attention's energy body.\n\nDetecting those produces a feeling of silent creepiness.\n\nBut not fright. Just, creepy.\n\nForbidden. Hidden.  Not allowed.\n\nIf you can see those, Mr. DoubleTake is sitting in the corner sucking his thumb.  He's a baby again and has no idea what's ok to perceive.\n\nAnd those can be seen in full sunlight!\n\nCholita's done that for me a few times.\n\nBefore she realized what I was doing and blocked me, I could even follow her around Whole Foods by the trail of fibers she left.  Shopping made her more energetic, and I could visually see it.\n\nIt's shocking to see it outside a darkened room!\n\nIn the account in the books, after Carlos finds colors using Zuleica's technique from Eagle's Gift, presumably sitting on the floor naked in perfect darkness,  Zuleica has him wiggle his fingers in there to stimulate *seeing* the fibers and tentacles, and to give him a chance to \u201cfeel\u201d the second attention.\n\nThe point is 1.5 feet out from the center of your belly button and your groin, and 4 inches to the right.\n\nJuan Tuma has it a bit further away.\n\nBut don't worry!  You can both see where it is, in silence, and also feel it.\n\nFeeling it is bizarre.  Last night, I felt as if I were tickling my leg. Literally.\n\nCarlos had the same reaction, and stopped wiggling.\n\nSo Zuleica threatened to bop him on the head.\n\nYou\u2019ll also feel something as thick as water, although I hope you\u2019ll be satisfied if it\u2019s more like a dusty cobweb than a faucet stream of water.\n\nAnd remember.  Carlos probably wiggled his fingers at least 240 hours before he reached the result.\n\nMaybe even 800 hours.\n\nSo don't fret if you do Zuleica's pass a few days,  an hour at a time, and can't see the colors.\n\nDon't be spoiled babies!\n\nBe impeccable Toltec warriors gone rogue for lack of a lineage.\n\nIn other words, don't cry over a few hours of work.\n\nI skipped sleeping last night so I could practice for 8 hours.\n\nIf you don't get amazing results, it's your lack of internal silence.\n\nJust force it!!!\n\nThen later, you try to sweep the floor with a tentacle you can\u2019t yet see.\n\nCarlos eventually succeeded in sweeping the floor, but if you do this technique I\u2019d expect that touching the floor with your tentacle will happen later on, when you aren\u2019t actually doing the technique.\n\nIf you make it work while doing it, bravo!\n\nBut why aren't we doing the finger wiggle thing in this rendition of Zuleica's pass?\n\nWhy the scooping instead?\n\nYou'd have to ask Carlos, but I have a theory.\n\nIt's because, we aren't in heightened awareness.\n\nCarlos was.\n\nEveryone forgets this part of the books. They try to copy, not realizing  you have to be in heightened awareness to get the cool stuff to happen.\n\nScooping the colors allows the assemblage point to move.  I don't know why, but the colors can be visible almost at our normal position of the assemblage point.\n\nThey leak that \"far up\" into your consciousness.\n\nWhich makes them a good tool.\n\nLike that crystal fox in \"Last Jedi\", who led them through the cave.\n\nFind the colors in silence, and they'll lead you further into the cave to a good destination.\n\nIt can take 2 hours of this movement, in silence, to get the assemblage point to move all the way to heightened awareness.\n\nSo Carlos gave us a movement that had a little light show we could watch, while also pulling the colors closer, and in fact directly into the second attention's assemblage point, though maybe off by a few inches.\n\nAnd it has the floor sweeping.\n\nThe level of silence needed for feeling the floor while doing this technique escapes my abilities at this point.\n\nBut when sitting up on pillows in darkness, I can manage that level of silence.\n\nOddly, it feels like you actually touched the floor.\n\nI mean, really touched it.\n\nBut since you have nothing to touch it with, seeing as how you\u2019re on the bed and can\u2019t reach it, it\u2019ll feel like your dreaming body bent over and stuck it\u2019s hand through the bed, palm face down on the actual floor.\n\nOr it will feel like your leg stretched out and rested the bottom of your foot on the floor, despite being too far away.\n\nI mean, it\u2019ll feel exactly like that!  Like your real hand, or real foot!\n\nHow is that possible?  I have no idea.  Maybe, it's unknown touching input, so the brain picks something to explain it.  Hand or foot.\n\nYou\u2019ll even have to stop and take a look, to verify that\u2019s just not possible.\n\nAs for folding in half the way Carlos did, I suspect you ought to forget about that.  If you feel bad about that, do stretches to put your head on your ankles.\n\nBut something else equally cool will happen.\n\nIn my case, I leaped while fully awake, eyes open,  through a portal that appeared on the wall, giving me access to a cyclic being world.\n\nI can\u2019t account for how I passed through the wall, or how I got home. But I was fully lucid for hours in there.\n\nDreaming doesn\u2019t behave like that.  It was something else.\n\nI converted my waking body directly to my dreaming body.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me what happened to the physical one. It was sleeping on the bed when I got back.\n\nThat's part of the finish of Zuleica's series of instructions.  Convert tonal to nagual body.\n\nOn another occasion I was fully in a dream world, lucid because I\u2019d been practicing silence. I walked from my dream bedroom into the shower, and my body switched over from dream to real.\n\nThere was no visible transition.  I never woke up!\n\nI'm sitting here right now, having missed waking up from a dream a while back.\n\nIt's a break in the linearity of time.\n\nIt can come from this technique.  You don't have to leap off a cliff!\n\nIf you read the account in Eagle\u2019s Gift, the transition between energy bodies is done by a glance.\n\nCarlos switched back and forth by focusing his attention on the energy body's assemblage point.\n\nI suggest, things are more gradual for us.\n\nSuper cool stuff happens, and it\u2019s not in the books.\n\nBut it\u2019s \u201csimilar\u201d.\n\nSo it won't please the inventory experts, who are always looking for an excuse to get out of work.\n\nIt's why both Carlos and Carol told us to quit obsessing over the books, and expecting exactly that same thing to happen.\n\nWhatever does happen when you practice hard, will accomplish the same thing in the long run.\n\nZuleica\u2019s pass was not given a name by Carlos. I recognized the similarity, and made up that name just so it can be referred to more easily.\n\nAs far as I know, it\u2019s not taught at workshops.\n\nBut it ought to be.\n\nThis technique, like Zuleica\u2019s harp playing, will inevitably lead to seeing the fibers and tentacles around the waist.\n\nAnd I supposed, you could use it to escape a bad situation by jumping into the ball  of light you form.\n\nBut you must learn to be silent.\n\nThat\u2019s why up until now, Tensegrity has been impotent.\n\nYou could see those colors sitting in a chair, with your eyes closed.\n\nBut that won\u2019t convince anyone that magic is real.\n\nMake it real! Learn to get silent.\n\nEdited five times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Zuleica's Magical Pass", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 58, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"o2vl90kfw1m81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 45, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o2vl90kfw1m81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9887ebb2470bb5986ca5e13cbc6be980d324002b"}, {"y": 90, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o2vl90kfw1m81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf38e3c6f997d08c535da7dd149cf48c9e9c3d81"}, {"y": 133, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o2vl90kfw1m81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2831824bdf87ecb80d32f8c9001c48193d12e609"}, {"y": 266, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o2vl90kfw1m81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f81a84021055efb3346d0b7e7377eeae3ce41c5"}, {"y": 400, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o2vl90kfw1m81.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd7d905db4aa7ca1a373786e862ac3570df6287a"}, {"y": 450, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o2vl90kfw1m81.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2b41460af01a248605c71fc2a8246ac696fe422"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/o2vl90kfw1m81.png?width=2592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ea49d1e8ffb6b2398bd0d0a063520012b8adc03"}, "id": "o2vl90kfw1m81"}}, "name": "t3_hh3u5l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8zjJQXCsniG-PJ1UGZhahLhwBRi7KQD-VbodFvFXtkU.jpg", "edited": 1646697793.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1593299878.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o2vl90kfw1m81.png?width=2592&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7ea49d1e8ffb6b2398bd0d0a063520012b8adc03\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the earliest private classes I can remember, Carlos was teaching this technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that time, he tended to show us very short movements such as this one.

Shopping made her more energetic, and I could visually see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s shocking to see it outside a darkened room!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the account in the books, after Carlos finds colors using Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique from Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift, presumably sitting on the floor naked in perfect darkness,  Zuleica has him wiggle his fingers in there to stimulate &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; the fibers and tentacles, and to give him a chance to \u201cfeel\u201d the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is 1.5 feet out from the center of your belly button and your groin, and 4 inches to the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan Tuma has it a bit further away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t worry!  You can both see where it is, in silence, and also feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling it is bizarre.  Last night, I felt as if I were tickling my leg. Literally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had the same reaction, and stopped wiggling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Zuleica threatened to bop him on the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll also feel something as thick as water, although I hope you\u2019ll be satisfied if it\u2019s more like a dusty cobweb than a faucet stream of water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And remember.  Carlos probably wiggled his fingers at least 240 hours before he reached the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe even 800 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t fret if you do Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass a few days,  an hour at a time, and can&amp;#39;t see the colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be spoiled babies!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be impeccable Toltec warriors gone rogue for lack of a lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, don&amp;#39;t cry over a few hours of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I skipped sleeping last night so I could practice for 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t get amazing results, it&amp;#39;s your lack of internal silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just force it!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then later, you try to sweep the floor with a tentacle you can\u2019t yet see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos eventually succeeded in sweeping the floor, but if you do this technique I\u2019d expect that touching the floor with your tentacle will happen later on, when you aren\u2019t actually doing the technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you make it work while doing it, bravo!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why aren&amp;#39;t we doing the finger wiggle thing in this rendition of Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why the scooping instead?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d have to ask Carlos, but I have a theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s because, we aren&amp;#39;t in heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone forgets this part of the books. They try to copy, not realizing  you have to be in heightened awareness to get the cool stuff to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scooping the colors allows the assemblage point to move.  I don&amp;#39;t know why, but the colors can be visible almost at our normal position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They leak that &amp;quot;far up&amp;quot; into your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes them a good tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like that crystal fox in &amp;quot;Last Jedi&amp;quot;, who led them through the cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find the colors in silence, and they&amp;#39;ll lead you further into the cave to a good destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can take 2 hours of this movement, in silence, to get the assemblage point to move all the way to heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos gave us a movement that had a little light show we could watch, while also pulling the colors closer, and in fact directly into the second attention&amp;#39;s assemblage point, though maybe off by a few inches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it has the floor sweeping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The level of silence needed for feeling the floor while doing this technique escapes my abilities at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when sitting up on pillows in darkness, I can manage that level of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, it feels like you actually touched the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, really touched it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since you have nothing to touch it with, seeing as how you\u2019re on the bed and can\u2019t reach it, it\u2019ll feel like your dreaming body bent over and stuck it\u2019s hand through the bed, palm face down on the actual floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it will feel like your leg stretched out and rested the bottom of your foot on the floor, despite being too far away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, it\u2019ll feel exactly like that!  Like your real hand, or real foot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is that possible?  I have no idea.  Maybe, it&amp;#39;s unknown touching input, so the brain picks something to explain it.  Hand or foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll even have to stop and take a look, to verify that\u2019s just not possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for folding in half the way Carlos did, I suspect you ought to forget about that.  If you feel bad about that, do stretches to put your head on your ankles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something else equally cool will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, I leaped while fully awake, eyes open,  through a portal that appeared on the wall, giving me access to a cyclic being world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t account for how I passed through the wall, or how I got home. But I was fully lucid for hours in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreaming doesn\u2019t behave like that.  It was something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I converted my waking body directly to my dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t ask me what happened to the physical one. It was sleeping on the bed when I got back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s part of the finish of Zuleica&amp;#39;s series of instructions.  Convert tonal to nagual body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On another occasion I was fully in a dream world, lucid because I\u2019d been practicing silence. I walked from my dream bedroom into the shower, and my body switched over from dream to real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no visible transition.  I never woke up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting here right now, having missed waking up from a dream a while back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a break in the linearity of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can come from this technique.  You don&amp;#39;t have to leap off a cliff!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read the account in Eagle\u2019s Gift, the transition between energy bodies is done by a glance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos switched back and forth by focusing his attention on the energy body&amp;#39;s assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest, things are more gradual for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Super cool stuff happens, and it\u2019s not in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s \u201csimilar\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it won&amp;#39;t please the inventory experts, who are always looking for an excuse to get out of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why both Carlos and Carol told us to quit obsessing over the books, and expecting exactly that same thing to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever does happen when you practice hard, will accomplish the same thing in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica\u2019s pass was not given a name by Carlos. I recognized the similarity, and made up that name just so it can be referred to more easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, it\u2019s not taught at workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This technique, like Zuleica\u2019s harp playing, will inevitably lead to seeing the fibers and tentacles around the waist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I supposed, you could use it to escape a bad situation by jumping into the ball  of light you form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you must learn to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why up until now, Tensegrity has been impotent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could see those colors sitting in a chair, with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that won\u2019t convince anyone that magic is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make it real!

Even Carlos described that.\n\nBut if you see any other color, you'll be just as jazzed!  The only time people worry is when they haven't yet moved their assemblage points far enough to see any colors at all, which simply means, they aren't silent for long enough yet.\n\nAnd you can see that yourself, there's no guessing.  If a word went through your mind, you've reset yourself for at least 2 minutes.\n\nTaisha used to say 1.5 minutes to 2 hours.  Or maybe 1 minute.\n\nThat's about how far it has moved. Not about how long you need to be silent, in order to get fun things to happen.\n\n2 minutes is enough to get it started unless you're badly in need of power plants to loosen it up.\n\nCarlos imported Cholita from the peyote hills in Mexico, so he wasn't adverse to it.\n\nOnce it's loose, the puffs become slightly visible.  They probably don't move around much, and you won't be able to figure out how on earth you could \"scoop\" them, but just seeing any at all means it moved.\n\nWhich is all you need. Keep silent and your assemblage point will be pulled in that direction of the colors.\n\nWhich direction?  To seeing energy on the horizon, as Carlos described in Silent Knowledge publication, calling us, \"Readers of Infinity\".\n\nIt's worth a read, because once you can view energy on a horizon, you'll be sealed as a sorcerer.  No doubts left.  Good thing Carlos wrote that down at the end.\n\nSo you're watching the puffs now.  As the assemblage point moves further, things change a bit.\n\nWe don't have a list of what happens from Carlos, and probably because, once you can intercept *intent*,  you realize that telling people what will happen, makes that happen.\n\nBetter to leave them alone and see what things they can discover on their own.\n\nUnfortunately, the Castaneda community is so impotent, they even make up excuses for not being able to do magic so you won't bug them into putting in real effort and giving up their impeccable warrior ego trip.\n\nThe #1 excuse is:  \"Real magic?  I'm not a filthy old sorcerer type. Shame on you!\"\n\nIt's so bad, we get one of those blowing through this subreddit every 2 weeks, and it takes at least a week to shame them into leaving, or get them to realize they screwed up and need to actually practice.\n\nSo, things being that bad, here's what happens as the assemblage point moves deeper along that J curve:\n\n1). Static lights of any kind. Very disappointing. You end the session in doubt. However, you have a better idea of how long you can go without a word, and it's likely in the range of 10 seconds if you are talented.  Unfortunately, you need 120 seconds.\n\n2). A splotch of light becomes so bright, you get excited. Then start thinking, and session is ruined for the day.\n\n3). The splotch stays there, and you can manage not to get so excited  you start signing autographs.  You get deeper silence as a result of watching it, and you have tingly jolts a few times.  Ears possibly buzz.  Some practitioners get spastic.  I have no idea why, but it's not uncommon.  Don't worry, you'll stop spazzing out when you realize it's all harmless.\n\nBy the way, if you can **actually** sign an autograph while looking at the purple, go ahead!  That means you have a visitor.  Visitors are common while doing this sort of activity. Never overlook an uninvited guest!  At first, these are barely perceivable and if you do see them, you'll forget. They often seem like very fast dreams, and can be accompanied by your head falling forward a bit.\n\n4). The splotch of color moves in the air.  Be sure to come tell me from which direction to which direction! I mean, upper right to lower left? Or something else?\n\n5). You manage to put your hand up there near a puff of color, and pretend to be scooping it down by moving your head. You put it on your torso, and can see it there if you don't move your head.\n\n6). Multiple splotches become available.  Note: Some skip directly to step 7, after just a session or two.  Reason: power plants.   Too much partying.  Shame on you!  Call me next time if there are women involved.\n\n7). Black starts to swirl with them, making the edges intense.  At this point, be on the lookout for visitors.  Usually they're shy at first, and a little head is all you might see.  Or a big threatening head if you're lucky.  The scarier the better!  That means the little guy is desperate for attention.  These days, my Fairy entity hardly cares.  I might even see her yawn on occasion, if she thinks I'm doing the same old thing over and over again.\n\n8). You can scoop the puffs of color, hold them in your hand and play with them.  It's still not \"real\", but you stop worrying about moving the head in sync with it, and even forget to do that a few times, without disrupting the view.  That means, your double has come nearer and is helping you perceive it. Speaking of the double, it's not just IOBs that can visit. The double can also. And the Nagual.  And some weird rodents who only sit around with big cartoonish eyes. Oh, and then there's also the ascended whatevers they were. It can get crowed in a dark bedroom!\n\n9). Now you can do Zuleica's movement.  You've learned to move your assemblage point far enough to make Tensegrity visible.  Doing it, in silence, produces a faster movement of the assemblage point as long as you only watch it, and don't start to think of what to do with it.  Your thinking is disruptive even if it's pleasant anticipation of magic.\n\n10). The purple colors do indeed collect in the middle, and you can see each hand actually concentrating some purple light.  Or red, green, yellow.  Just wanted to repeat that.  We don't yet know which colors people will see.   And if you can make the colors collect in the middle, I suspect  you'll start to see variations in the colors of the puffs.  Some pinker, some bluer.\n\n11). You notice some weird lines in there.  Like wiggly things, but they wiggle all at once, jumping from being bent one way, to being bent the opposite. Although you can clearly *see* them, you don't believe it.  That's Mr. DoubleTake.  He's gotten used to the puffs of color and can't do anything about it, but he'll be damned if he's going to let you see the actual emanations! He'll make you blink and give you a tummy ache, if you persist too far.\n\n12). You notice that little flick on the end of the movement produces lights!  You didn't notice that before.  Carlos added that little touch standing right near me in class, so I could see clearly. It was a little \"flick\" with the fingers, right as the ball is being pushed to the middle.\n\nIf you can *see* the flick,  you've reached the very bottom of the J curve!  What does it do?  I'll let you figure that you. If you got this far, no need to interfere.\n\n13). You notice that you're perceiving energy on the walls of your room, and stop doing tensegrity so you can explore that. Even if it's only vague lines, or an overall glow, that's what we're after.  As Spock would say, \"***pure energy..***.\"\n\nAt this point your breathing has changed, making it obvious you wasted your time when doing Chinese deep breaths or listening to hyperventilating yogis talk about Kundalini stimulation through breathing.\n\nThe breath is a result, not the cause!  Get away from that guy if he's selling that placebo.\n\nDon't play sorcerer. Be one.\n\nThat said, yes of course.  The breathing is useful.  I'm just trying to piss you off enough, so you don't relish all the side stuff you've added on.\n\nI really hate to hear \"Dantian\" in here.\n\nIt means, someone too lazy to make the sorcery work has run all over town looking for Chinese hookers to go to bed with.  And he's become openly defensive because he always finds he's impotent, after hanging out with the hooker on a daily basis.\n\nHe's like a Jesus freak being corrected on his misunderstanding of reality, if you try to get him to put in some real effort where it counts.\n\nThat of course is all of us, until we get there. We've all gone whoring at one time or another.\n\nYou can go ahead and wear the red clown nose, or not change your  underwear in order to save up \"Shakti\" energy, but I hope you won't get so excited anymore while doing it.\n\nSo that hopefully, you come do Zuleica's pass in silence and darkness and learn to do real magic.\n\nThe flick.

You notice that you&amp;#39;re perceiving energy on the walls of your room, and stop doing tensegrity so you can explore that. Even if it&amp;#39;s only vague lines, or an overall glow, that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re after.  As Spock would say, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pure energy..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point your breathing has changed, making it obvious you wasted your time when doing Chinese deep breaths or listening to hyperventilating yogis talk about Kundalini stimulation through breathing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The breath is a result, not the cause!  Get away from that guy if he&amp;#39;s selling that placebo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t play sorcerer. Be one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, yes of course.  The breathing is useful.  I&amp;#39;m just trying to piss you off enough, so you don&amp;#39;t relish all the side stuff you&amp;#39;ve added on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really hate to hear &amp;quot;Dantian&amp;quot; in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means, someone too lazy to make the sorcery work has run all over town looking for Chinese hookers to go to bed with.  And he&amp;#39;s become openly defensive because he always finds he&amp;#39;s impotent, after hanging out with the hooker on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s like a Jesus freak being corrected on his misunderstanding of reality, if you try to get him to put in some real effort where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That of course is all of us, until we get there. We&amp;#39;ve all gone whoring at one time or another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can go ahead and wear the red clown nose, or not change your  underwear in order to save up &amp;quot;Shakti&amp;quot; energy, but I hope you won&amp;#39;t get so excited anymore while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that hopefully, you come do Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass in silence and darkness and learn to do real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flick.

I do it all the time when I need a boost of energy.\n\nI mean, when the colors are pathetic.\n\nThat's probably the best goal for people in here.\n\nLearn to see energy on the horizon.\n\nIf you play with colors, it'll sneak up on you.\n\nWhen you can \"see the room in the dark\", that's seeing energy!\n\nIf you focus entirely on that, and ignore the colors for a spell, you can stand in the middle of the room and gaze at the energy on the walls in the 4 cardinal directions.\n\nThen scan the room with the palm of your right hand, outstretched, gazing just to the left of it.\n\nThe palm is sticking out the same way someone might do while saying, \"Get out of my face!\", with the palm right up near the other person's nose.\n\nYou do that to the wall.  Shoulder height so it's comfortable, because you might have  your arm out there a while. Hours even, it can get so entertaining.\n\nIf you want to get past looking at the clock while practicing, there's nothing more entertaining than \"seeing energy\" for as long as you like.\n\nIt also teaches an important lesson about \"seeing\", a lesson beginners never understand.\n\nIt's darned hard seeing!!!@#~\n\nDon't ask someone who can *see*, to tell you about specific things.\n\nSuch as, is Miles a double being?\n\nGive me a break!  Silvio Manuel and don Juan together had to put Carlos into a bucket of ice water, naked, and stare at him in the dark for 3 hours, just to try to figure out what was up with him.\n\nTrust me when I say, the fun stuff you can describe is only a tiny fraction of all the stuff you see, which can't be described.\n\nAnd which keeps changing so much, you can't make any use of it.\n\nBut if you stumble around messing things up, once in a while something truly magical comes about.\n\nThat's more like what *seeing* is. Hit or miss.  \n\nThe palm is a good \"focus\" for seeing energy on the horizon, because if you look at the entire room of light with peripheral vision, you'll assemble a single world and the fun will be over.\n\nAlso, as you pass something (you look to the left of the palm, and turn in that counterclockwise direction), you block it out with your palm and arm.  You already looked there, you want your focus to be on the next \"spot\" you didn't examine.\n\nI'll venture a guess: If you surround yourself with seeing energy, you change worlds.  Something is going to catch your eye, you'll recognize a detail somewhere, and it'll infect the rest of the room, like colored die being added to a pool.\n\nBut one world is so boring!  \n\nAnd they take so long to form (assemble).  Fastest those can change is more than 10 seconds!\n\nInstead, you can detect \"partial worlds\" stuck on the wall.\n\nI suppose, when you are seeing energy in general, and it hasn't formed into anything specific yet, the entire room can exist in an overlapping fashion with all 7 of the realms we have in our luminous shell.\n\nYou think you're gazing at the same thing all over, but in fact, each spot is somewhere different. You're just seeing the energy of that place, so you don't recognize anything yet.\n\nThus the left wall might be in some copy of this world, but the right wall is an inorganic being's realm.\n\nAs you sweep your palm at the wall, you'll add your emanations to the vague lines there, lighten them up, and a piece of that world will pop out at you.\n\nIt's like disturbing a little nest of insects with your finger, and they all scurry out.\n\nSometimes the disturbance is small. You just uncover a \"blue baseball\" of light.  Or a few red dots fly away as if they were angry.\n\nBut every 15 minutes or so, you'll get something huge. If you're absolutely silent that is.\n\nTwo nights ago I smoothed my hand over one of those inorganic being's slices in the cheese, and out popped shadow men.  It was on the west wall.\n\nBefore they popped out it was just vertical lines, rather evenly space on the wall. Of course, you can only describe them that way, but they're much more \"active\" than if it was just a line of light.\n\nThen last night I opened a crack on the south wall, and inside it was hell!\n\nOr at least, it looked like hell.  Bright orange, red, and yellow fire everywhere, but without any actual sensation of heat.\n\nThat one didn't smoothly \"assemble\" a little at a time. The bedroom wall literally ripped open a gap around 4 inches thick, and 5 feet high.  The bent pieces of plaster from the wall were apparent on the edges.\n\nIt was like a Hellraiser movie!\n\nIf some of you are afraid of IOBs, how are you going to deal with hell ripping a doorway into your bedroom?\n\nWith that kind of thing possible, it's no wonder the Jewish mystics came up with demons in the pit, and hell as a place of burning.  \n\nAnd the glowing whiteness of heaven, with no place in shadow.\n\nI'm just not sure I like what they did with their visions.\n\nOur timeline has been tinkered with by Jewish sorcerers! \n\nSure, they used to cut people's heads off back then, for no apparent reason.\n\nThat society needed a little, \"love thy neighbor\", and what better way to enforce it, then with damnation if you disobey.\n\nBut they still do that in the middle east!  Cut off heads for no reason.\n\nAnd now we're saddled with Carlos' #1 annoyance enemy, the catholic church.\n\nI suspect the Jewish mystics discovered that technique using prayer.  That kind of obsessive rocking back and forth prayer they do in the middle east, trying to induce a trance.\n\nProblem with that technique is, it leads to a very poor understanding of what you are doing.\n\nAnd an easy to manipulate understanding.  Given a little magic, a Guru can make up anything he likes, and students will believe it.\n\nJewish mystics are also secretive ego monsters.  Typically they have high IQs, and better education because of being in a Jewish family that prizes education, and it's gone to their head.\n\nMix that with religious \"properness\", and they just don't share.\n\nA little like the Castaneda community they are, although hopefully less impotent.\n\nEdited four times", "edited": 1595869217.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fzewrk6", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be done on any horizon.

We hadn't even figured out a name for it.\n\nBut the idea was the same.\n\nPretending to be practicing sorcery by lying about ordinary dreams, had become a favorite past time of Castaneda fan men.\n\nThey seem to have universally decided, all you have to do is memorize \"facts\" from the books so that you sound like you know your business, and then lie about your dreams.\n\nI honestly can't figure out why they came to the conclusion \"lucid dreaming\" was the same as \"The Art of Dreaming\".\n\nIt's not even similar.\n\nIn fact, the Lucid Dreaming subreddit erases anything I post there.   Nearly instantly.\n\nIt's likely moderated by Castaneda haters.\n\nWhich is ok.  Because in fact, lucid dreaming has NOTHING at all to do with 4 gates dreaming.\n\nIn 4 gates dreaming you bring some tonal awareness into your dreams, then generate an \"energy\" that the inorganic beings seek, and you lure them to bring you to their world, where you learn from them over and over, perhaps hundreds of times, before you even think of the 3rd gate.\n\nBy then, you can go directly into dreaming while awake.  That's what the \"twin positions\" are for.\n\nYou lay in position, go directly into dreaming using perfect silence, and THEN you go to sleep.\n\nInside the dream, in the same position.\n\nThat's the whole point.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach the 3rd gate if you can't be absolutely silent.\n\nAnd once you can do that, why waste your time with sleeping dreaming?\n\nYou can cross the 4th gate, while awake.\n\nInstead of hijacking your dreamer, and then trying over and over to get it to wake up in your real room, you simply put out some candy and treats your double can't resist, and you lure him to come to you.\n\nLike a stray cat.\n\nYou open a can of tuna, pour a fresh bowl of cream, and set them on your darkroom floor.\n\nWhy chase cats, when you know what they love most?\n\nBut where do you get \"Double Tuna?\"\n\nIs that a joke?\n\nNope.  In the deep red zone, you could materialize a can.\n\nAnd I guarantee your double would show up to see what the heck was going on.\n\nIn fact, you might struggle to make it using the intense purple puffs of the deep red zone, and your double might come visit just because he gets tired of your awkward efforts to make a simple can of tuna.\n\nThey do that!  No joking here.\n\nBut in fact, they also like Tensegrity.\n\nWhich is why Carlos gave it to us.\n\nAnd if you use Tensegrity to get all the way to the deep purple zone, your darkroom will be like grand central station for the double's travels.\n\nAll you have to do is find an available bench, and wait for him in silence.\n\nIt can lead to confusing things.\n\nEspecially if you have a witch like Cholita around.\n\nIt took me a while to realize, I wasn't leaving the darkroom in my double to go check up on Cholita.\n\nMy double was already over there, when it finally decided to come visit me.\n\nBut it could be done either way.\n\nIt's just a lot harder to \"shrink the tonal\", then it is to have a can of \"Double Tuna\" laying around.\n\nI hope my double isn't angry about that analogy...\n\nI must have cats on my mind lately, since it's possible we now have one at our home.\n\nWho isn't real.\n\nThe lucid dreaming subreddit has all sorts of tests you can use, to check if you're in a dream.\n\nMaybe they can come up with a test to detect dream cats,  hanging out in the real world?\n\nBut I'd get permanently banned for pressing that issue over there.\n\nIt's one of the few places I haven't been banned from yet.\n\nDidn't take the Dzogchen folks long to decide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded":

An outside intelligence.\n\nRemember, this isn't as odd as it sounds.\n\nTo alter reality during darkroom, you use intent to reskim the emanations we normally use to perceive reality.\n\nWe cheat and gaze at \"stuff\" to help summon the intent, to perceive that \"stuff\" better.  The stuff we choose, is the stuff the Tensegrity tends to make visible.\n\nBut inside dreaming, it's easy to think it's your \"greatness\" that allows you to find your hands.\n\nBut it's not.\n\nIt's the same as darkroom.\n\nNormal dreaming is not lucid.\n\nThe emanations have to be skimmed slightly differently, in order to find your hands.\n\nSo it's *intent* that causes it.

Maybe she's intending I should go on a long voyage at sea, and leave her to take care of the house.  Forever.\n\nBut you might be convinced a certain vitamin helps you find your hands. There was a lot of that going on in dreaming discussion groups.\n\nWhich herb might help you find your hands more often.\n\nMa Huang (Mormon tea) works, but not more than 3 times.  And usually only once.\n\nMost of the \"dreaming supplements\" do not work at all.\n\nYet if you took them daily with that belief, they could contribute to finding your hands a few times.\n\nEven so, NOTHING helps more than forcing silence while you try to go to sleep.\n\nExpecting that eventually you'll find a way to go directly into dreaming and remember to find our hands.  So as you are silent, you gaze for visible dream elements and hypnogogic images, so you can \"exploit\" those to enter dreaming.\n\nYou're \"intending\" each night for 2 hours, to become lucid in a dream.  And especially, to waste no time and go directly in as you fall asleep.\n\nWhere you'll still find you forget what you were trying to do, and proceed in an ordinary dream. Not remembering to actually look at your hands.\n\nAsk the women.  Going in isn't as hard as remembering why you did it.\n\nIt's a huge struggle to learn 4 gates dreaming, but if you allow 2 extra hours to sleep each day eventually you can be assured you will find your hands and look at them as many as 6 times EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nIt's still not enough to pass the 4 gates of dreaming.\n\nIn fact, it's unlikely you'll get much further than locating a scout and traveling to their world.  Which so far, I've never heard of anyone doing but me.\n\nI don't take any pride in that. It's a horrible thing.\n\nBut I never heard of anyone who allowed 2 extra hours a day of forcing silence before sleep, for at least 6 months.\n\nAnd if you managed to find a scout without that much effort to learn to be silent, it's not likely they'll teach you as the dreaming emissary.\n\nYou simply wouldn't be able to \"follow\" them to where they're able to do that.\n\nAnd being taught by the emissary over and over and over is  the goal of the second gate.\n\nTo gain a magical teacher.\n\nSo don't fall for the confusion and hype of misrepresenting your sleeping dreams as \"Art of Dreaming\" techniques.\n\nWithout silence there's no path to the 3rd gate.\n\nThat REQUIRES you can get silent enough to do the kind of waking dreaming we do in darkroom.\n\nSo if you can do waking dreaming, why would you focus on sleeping dreaming anymore?\n\nJust let that sleeping dreaming part happen naturally over time, as you move your assemblage point further and further with ultra reliable waking dreaming.\n\nMy latest theory is that Carlos wrote \"Art of Dreaming\" to STOP people who were trying to use lucid dreaming as a path.\n\nNot to encourage it!\n\nHe gave clear instructions and described what happens at each gate, hoping bad men would notice that and stop all the bullying and false claims of success.\n\nBut they didn't. They just added more inventory items to their sales pitch.\n\nThey ignored ALL of the instructions, even the part about finding your hands.\n\nFound their hands extremely rarely, as is expected, and then decided to just lie instead.  So they could claim any dream they remembered, was progress.\n\nWe get those in here. Going on about a dream they claim is sorcery, but if you got them to tell the truth they didn't find their hands at all.\n\nSo they had ZERO tonal awareness in there.  You're supposed to bring your reason into your double, and get him to come out into the real world.\n\nNaturally there's no \"choice\" here.\n\nIf you get lucid in a dream, then GO FOR IT.\n\nBut you won't.\n\nAt least, not often enough to care about.\n\nAnd if you manage to do it every single night and even hold dreams for HOURS, it will won't be enough to get you anywhere.\n\nJust depressed for the most part.\n\nBecause you need that silence too.\n\nThe men can't save any time caring about sleeping dreaming.  It's only interesting to them because they're too lazy to do actual work.\n\nBut the women can.\n\nTheir assemblage points aren't as locked up at the blue line as those of the men.\n\nSo they can \"sneak\" in to sleeping dreaming, directly from awake.\n\nBut until they get that double out into the REAL copy of reality, there won't be much practical use for their dreaming skills.\n\nThere's something missing there.\n\nMaybe one of the women will figure it out.\n\nWe use inorganic beings as a fast way to move the assemblage point.\n\nJust by viewing them, it's a lot easier to move the assemblage point.\n\nEven if your silence is not all that perfect.  It's the same trick the men of knowledge used.\n\nSo for a woman who is in dream, to find her way to the REAL copy of reality so she can share dreaming with others, what can they use to \"find\" the real reality?\n\nIt doesn't seem to be enough to have a specific person in mind.\n\nHow do you know which copy of the person you're with?\n\nOr if it's not just phantom?\n\nMight be some \"contraption\" that could help with this.\n\nCholita for example, hangs leaves under the big umbrella in her garden.\n\nI've never seen her doing it, but perhaps she gazes at it while sitting in the shade.\n\nIt might be possible to use a leaf to find the \"real copy\" of reality. Based on the shape you see in the dream.\n\nBut I sure don't know what the instructions would be.", "edited": 1686599057.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jnx6fh1", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way you find your hands in sleeping dreams, is to &amp;quot;intend&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not you, who realizes you&amp;#39;re in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s intent.

You&amp;#39;re supposed to bring your reason into your double, and get him to come out into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get lucid in a dream, then GO FOR IT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not often enough to care about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you manage to do it every single night and even hold dreams for HOURS, it will won&amp;#39;t be enough to get you anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just depressed for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you need that silence too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men can&amp;#39;t save any time caring about sleeping dreaming.  It&amp;#39;s only interesting to them because they&amp;#39;re too lazy to do actual work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the women can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their assemblage points aren&amp;#39;t as locked up at the blue line as those of the men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can &amp;quot;sneak&amp;quot; in to sleeping dreaming, directly from awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But until they get that double out into the REAL copy of reality, there won&amp;#39;t be much practical use for their dreaming skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s something missing there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe one of the women will figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We use inorganic beings as a fast way to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just by viewing them, it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if your silence is not all that perfect.  It&amp;#39;s the same trick the men of knowledge used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for a woman who is in dream, to find her way to the REAL copy of reality so she can share dreaming with others, what can they use to &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; the real reality?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be enough to have a specific person in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you know which copy of the person you&amp;#39;re with?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if it&amp;#39;s not just phantom?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might be some &amp;quot;contraption&amp;quot; that could help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita for example, hangs leaves under the big umbrella in her garden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen her doing it, but perhaps she gazes at it while sitting in the shade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might be possible to use a leaf to find the &amp;quot;real copy&amp;quot; of reality. Based on the shape you see in the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I sure don&amp;#39;t know what the instructions would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_146ari6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/146ari6/the_4th_gate_of_darkroom/jnx6fh1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1686598727.0, "media_metadata": {"v3tv10av1n5b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 125, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v3tv10av1n5b1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4289fc023ae351c59e52de1dbbfee09e7190ed02"}, {"y": 250, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v3tv10av1n5b1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c41be14f688d100157e9eb937fa2ffa3948f21cf"}, {"y": 371, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v3tv10av1n5b1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fced8fed0b69bb1e1120cd0f252e71a665d383e8"}, {"y": 743, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v3tv10av1n5b1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=107ae3fbd495c3ba4e3453cb22cc2dad0900dede"}, {"y": 1114, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v3tv10av1n5b1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dae3156250bad86802c1db28caa0192606c53f24"}, {"y": 1254, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v3tv10av1n5b1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db6534f60532c7fc0004b5329350ebb40920747"}], "s": {"y": 1382, "x": 1190, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v3tv10av1n5b1.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c2ba7db10313064373fe075c7ace81b107d0dc"}, "id": "v3tv10av1n5b1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jnwqv9l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "InnerArt3537", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1686590695.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_146ari6", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_amsj2klf", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "You mentioned some tests to check if your in a dream.

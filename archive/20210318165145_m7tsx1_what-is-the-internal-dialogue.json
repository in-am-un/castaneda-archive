Especially do some \"lazy tensegrity\", like mashing energy, and try to see the energy get mashed.  Or crawl around on the floor, looking for your \"spot\".  Search the entire room for differences in the colors.\n\nOtherwise, if you're just sitting up  you'll get tired and lay down, or blank out.  In both cases, if you aren't very advanced, you'll fall asleep.\n\nIt'll probably be closer to lucid dreaming, which is great, but it doesn't help you move the assemblage point further.  And our main goal is silent knowledge, all the time. That's the same as cleaning the connecting link to intent.\n\nIf you can't walk around, at least stretch your legs out.\n\nIf you are scooping or playing with colors, even if you can only do that sitting,  then moving around is best.  Wave the arms, wiggle the fingers at the right spot and try to see sparks or lines of light, and generally observe and interact with  the colors as much as possible. There is a difference between scooping, and finger wiggling. Finger wiggling is like picking fleas out of another chimpanzees head, except with pieces and flecks of visible colors.  Scooping is an overall view.    Try a little of both, but remember that \"light fleas\" are more of a horizontal shift.  Scooping larger stuff is vertical.\n\nBut why \"play with the colors\", if we're following that incident with Zuleica and Carlos, in Eagle's Gift?  Where he does nothing but wiggle all night long, under threat of being struck by Zuleica.\n\nI hope you all can answer that yourself.\n\nIt's because, in that incident Carlos had been pushed into heightened awareness by don Juan, for days it seems. Certainly all night with Zuleica.\n\nWe're not.  So we do what Zuleica had Carlos do, toss in a bit of what Josefina and La Gorda were doing (just looking for anything at all), and MOST important of all, we follow the advice of Carlos.  Compress the puffs with the hands.  Pull them towards you and deposit them on the torso.\n\nNow, if you move the assemblage point so far that you enter the realm of the dreaming fog, as evidenced by \"things\" and tiny dream scenes materializing in the air, you can stop moving.\n\nSit up and gaze at it, without obsessing over any one thing, unless you want the assemblage point to move sideways instead of completing the J curve.\n\nWhich can be fun!  It brings out the double, to enter into the little dreams you see floating around.  And the horizontal movement if you \"interact\" with the dream scenes, is very motivational. So while it may be an evil horizontal shift, like the old sorcerers, we all need some tales of power, to motivate us.\n\nBut finally, you won't give a damn about any of the magic.  That means, you're getting very close to silent knowledge, stopping the world, bringing out the double, directly perceiving intent (gremlins for me), or \"the abstract\".\n\nIn \"not give a damn state\" (Buddhist equanimity), it's ok to sit still, to find out what happens next.\n\nIn that state, movement of the body produces a fireworks show every time, so it's very powerful. Your little finger can produce as much of a \"puff disturbance\" as your entire arm. Just by moving up 1/4th inch.  \n\nAnd, any movement, no matter how tiny, can move you back to \"caring\".\n\nThe \"book deal little finger\"?  \n\nSo you sit motionless forcing even better silence. That's the key!  More and more silence, or you will move backwards over the following months, when you get used to cool stuff and become complacent.\n\nMediocre darkroom gazing: You don't emphasize silence.\n\nGreat darkroom gazing: You absolutely won't allow any words in your mind, and realize that this has to be sustained for hours, not for seconds. And every single time you fail, or your attention focuses on the wrong thing, you try to figure out why, and apply more force to your silence.\n\nIf you are zoning out, that's a good sign. Your silence is pretty decent. Or if you are fully silent, and starting to topple over to the side, and don't want to do anything about it because it'll alter your silence, then slap your face.  For both conditions, because both will end your practice.\n\nIt's just a single movement, and it's over quick. And you only do it, when you're going to be \"gone\" soon. Which will cause you to stop practicing if you don't snap out of it.\n\nAnd there, if you ask me, is the goal for someone new at it.\n\nTo be in that \"don't care\" state, with the assemblage point so close to silent knowledge, anything at all can happen.\n\nAlways try to go for stopping the world when you get there, but bouncing off of that effect, into a cyclic being world, or into a re-run, can also happen.  And are just as much fun.\n\nIf we get more people there, we can discover other possibilities.\n\nFor example, that thing Carlos experienced with sound made by the allies, while he was in a forest. Where sound seemed to be forming structures.\n\nWe could do that too,  at that distant position of the assemblage point where magic surrounds you.\n\nBut it's not something you can \"dabble\" with.\n\nIt invokes *intent*, which can be deviated from what you were doing, for days.\n\nIt's not advisable to jump around in the dark room.  \"Navigate\" until you reach the point where you need to change course, either because you saw what you wanted, or it's not progressing to anything else.\n\nI'll add that I lost my puffs for a few days, and only could find flat color.  And yet, I was accomplishing amazing things, with finger wiggling. Bringing out the double kind of stuff.\n\nFancy showed up, and I realized, all the puffery is associated with the dreaming double being too dispersed. That's why we do tensegrity, to bring it into the middle, where we can redeploy it as the double.\n\nIt's a case of, \"You can't have your cake and eat it too.\"\n\nI found that rather disturbing, so I dropped finger wiggling.\n\nAnd found a balance in the middle. It is possible to retain both, but you sort of have to \"borrow\" the double, to help form the puffs.\n\nFancy still claims, that's him. The puffs.  \n\n\nBut she's greedy for puffs for herself.", "edited": 1616165983.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_grhgmie", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#1 Most important in my opinion:    If you can walk around, please walk around!

Biology is similarly analog, even with  &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s all coded in DNA&amp;quot; quantization attempts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_m7tsx1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/m7tsx1/what_is_the_internal_dialogue/gth7rab/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1617645395.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "greu4y7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1616103769.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_m7tsx1", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Because we're insane from constant torture at the hands of our fellow man, while we're first learning about the world as infants?\n\nThat's my take on it, but it's not a very pleasant one.\n\nThe moms in here won't like that.

Entrenched in their habits, and on course to oblivion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reasonable person who still has somewhat of an open mind, recognizes the truth in what he wrote about the Fliers and how much it makes sense, as well as all the parallels in human literature and myth for basically thousands of years..and thus informed can never be 100% certain either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An individual who doubts even their own doubts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This person has a chance to escape both paranoia and nihilism. To squeeze between the two over-reactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/m7tsx1/what_is_the_internal_dialogue/gs27rem/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1616601300.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_m7tsx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "grkr4eh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "apprentice2000", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1616234488.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_m7tsx1", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6f5a0kl9", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Thank you all for your answers!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_grkr4eh", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your answers!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/m7tsx1/what_is_the_internal_dialogue/grkr4eh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1616234488.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_m7tsx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ijzqdot", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660310898.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_m7tsx1", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "New post, top of Reddit on August 12, 2022\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/wmimbm/til_that_only_3050_of_people_have_an_inner/", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ijzqdot", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New post, top of Reddit on August 12, 2022&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/wmimbm/til_that_only_3050_of_people_have_an_inner/\"&gt;https://reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/wmimbm/til_that_only_3050_of_people_have_an_inner/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/m7tsx1/what_is_the_internal_dialogue/ijzqdot/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660310898.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_m7tsx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

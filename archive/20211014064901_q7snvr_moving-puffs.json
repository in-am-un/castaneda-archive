They were bakers, mask makers, dancers, and healers.  The healers used power plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect they were like we have now, with all the bad men trying to steal money by pretending to have sorcery.  Look around!  There must be 200 men and women making money pretending to have sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they don&amp;#39;t have anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least the &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; had of rituals that work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ritual sorcerers they were.   But rituals mean, no strong link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no reason to be afraid of your inorganic being!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you were remembering don Juan&amp;#39;s warning about not looking at the double?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s true, but you don&amp;#39;t have to worry. The double is very intelligent, and will not allow it to happen.  At least, not by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we are not &amp;quot;attacked&amp;quot; by inorganic beings, the way seers to do teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to use our own power, step by step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, we have more strength to protect ourselves from the allies.  And to make friends with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My inorganic being &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; is not tame. She&amp;#39;s never belonged to any lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she tries to trap me once each month.  Each time, a new trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, once you build your energy body and stand up in it, in the darkroom, the Allies cannot kidnap you.  Carlos taught that to us in his books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zuleica&amp;#39;s Pass&amp;quot; is used to learn that.

I think it uses up too much energy for them to visit, and then not get anything in return.  So they give up.  That's a normal situation for them perhaps, since most people have ignored them since they pretended to be monsters hiding under the bed during their childhood,  and their parents insisted such things can't exist.\n\nI find it rather odd that demons exist when you want to make up a new religion, so you can go around taking donations.\n\n\"Avoid spending eternity with beings like this hideous demon!  Give me your money and I'll tell you the horrible tale of suffering you might not escape unless you heed my words and join my church!\"\n\nThat really works on old people.\n\nBut when there's no motive to make up such things, as there isn't in children, demons don't exist.\n\nMighty convenient!  Any yet, if you point out Lucifer doesn't actually exist, you're the crazy one...\n\nI'd probably be better off with just 1 or 2 inorganic being friends.\n\nBut I went and got 3, for the good of all, to see if that was the limit.  If you read all accounts in the books, I don't believe you'll find anyone with more than 3.\n\nAnd the old seers at the rock each had 3.  You'd expect that if they were going to bury themselves and attack passers by hundreds of  years later, they'd bring as many as they could to help.\n\nVicente had 3 also, but the rest of don Juan's party seemed to have 2.\n\nHow you do you give them energy?  First, summon them.  As you'll see in these passages from the books, it takes them a while to get here from their world, the same way it takes us a while to fully visit their world, in clarity.\n\nSummon them, flatter them, than play a game with them.\n\nIt's the same as a holiday dinner with the relatives.\n\nYou can do this!\n\nHow to summon them will probably make itself known, for each one.  Typically perhaps, you summon them the way you found them.\n\nBut if they help you design a tensegrity long form, that likely becomes their summoning ritual.\n\nThe long form is sort of the same as the \"Dance to your Death\" in the early books, a disturbing \"Man of Knowledge\" point of view.\n\nI prefer to think of it as a \"Tensegrity Long Form Storage Container\"  for cool experiences.\n\nAs it evolves, you add things to it.\n\nAnd the inorganic beings add their own ways to get energy from the long form, so it's good compensation for the teaching help they'll give you, when they show up.\n\nAnother thing  you'll read in the passages I'm about to quote from the books, is that  humans know what they know about dreaming, only because of the IOBs.\n\nI thought as much.  In my opinion, the lineages are all owned  by inorganic  beings.  In our own case, we have Little Smoke and Devil's weed traveling around, trying to help save this lineage.\n\nI doubt you could say the same about the old seers, since they didn't have lineages.  Likely they ran their own show and used the IOBs like slaves.\n\nBut they still learned all they know about dreaming, and thus about the majority of sorcery, from the inorganic beings.\n\nThis picture is something I saw after I started giving the IOBs more energy.  It worked too!   They started showing up more and more, and I kept finding myself inside one of  their caves in the middle of darkroom practice.\n\nFancy even opened up some kind of fountain in the wall, and let dark energy flow from it, like a heavy gas.  I'd like to say liquid, but it was closer to a heavy gas.\n\nShe does live on a frozen methane world.  I suppose you might look at my pic and point out, frozen methane isn't brown like those cave walls.\n\nWell...  one part of her cave transitions from whitish to brown. I have noticed, the frozen gas ice in there tends to evaporate off over millions of year.\n\nMaybe that part of the cave is \"breezy\".\n\nAnd besides, I have 3 IOBs.  Sometimes it's hard to figure out who's doing what.\n\nThe dark energy gas brought to me by Fancy to reward me for summoning her more, flowed over me and charged me up, allowing me to do sorcery things that are now impossible to recall.\n\nThat's the problem with going that far, where you can daily visit their world.\n\nYou become unable to remember everything you did in the night.  Sometimes, you can't even recall something 30 seconds, and so after seeing it you become desperate to figure out a way to remember it.\n\nIn the case of this picture, I actually stopped and turned on the lights.  I had no idea what it was, but it was such a shocking sight I didn't want to forget it.\n\nNow possibly I know what it was. I was researching the double using the word, \"swim\" and came across this.  I couldn't resist reading most of it, since the IOBs are pretty fun to play with.  But I didn't read it all, knowing Carlos frowned on that in my case.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from the books\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter an interruption that lasted over half a year, I became more and more mystified by what had happened. I had no idea that my feelings alone were going to stop my practices. I wondered then if the desire would be sufficient to reinstate it. It was! Once I had formulated the thought of reentering dreaming, my practices continued as if they had never been interrupted. The scout picked up where we had left off and took me directly to the vision I'd had during my last session.\n\n\"This is the shadows' world,\" the emissary's voice said as soon as I was there. \"But, even though we are shadows, we shed light. Not only are we mobile but we are the light in the tunnels. We are another kind of inorganic being that exists here. There are three kinds: one is like an immobile tunnel, the other is like a mobile shadow. We are the mobile shadows. The tunnels give us their energy, and we do their bidding.\"\n\nThe emissary stopped talking. I felt it was daring me to ask about the third kind of inorganic being. I also felt that if I did not ask, the emissary would not tell me.\n\n\"What's the third kind of inorganic being?\" I said.\n\nThe emissary coughed and chuckled. To me, it sounded like it relished being asked.\n\n\"Oh, that's our most mysterious feature,\" it said. \"The third kind is revealed to our visitors only when they choose to stay with us.\"\n\n\"Why is that so?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because it takes a great deal of energy to see them,\" the emissary answered. \"And we would have to provide that energy.\"\n\nI knew that the emissary was telling me the truth. I also knew that a horrendous danger was lurking. Yet I was driven by a curiosity without limits. I wanted to see that third kind.\n\nThe emissary seemed to be aware of my mood.\n\n\"Would you like to see them?\" it asked casually.\n\n\"Most certainly,\" I said.\n\n\"All you have to do is to say out loud that you want to stay with us,\" the emissary said with a nonchalant intonation.\n\n\"But if I say that, I have to stay, right?\" I asked.\n\n\"Naturally,\" the emissary said in a tone of ultimate conviction. \"Everything you say out loud in this world is for keeps.\"\n\nI could not help thinking that, if the emissary had wanted to trick me into staying, all it had to do was lie to me. I would not have known the difference.\n\n\"I cannot lie to you, because a lie doesn't exist,\" the emissary said, intruding into my thoughts. \"I can tell you only about what exists. In my world, only intent exists; a lie has no intent behind it; therefore, it has no existence.\"\n\nI wanted to argue that there is intent even behind lies, but before I could voice my argument, the emissary said that behind lies there is intention but that that intention is not intent.\n\nI could not keep my dreaming attention focused on the argument the emissary was posing. It went to the shadow beings. Suddenly, I noticed that they had the appearance of a herd of strange, childlike animals. The emissary's voice warned me to hold my emotions in check, for sudden bursts of feelings had the capacity to make them disperse, like a flock of birds.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Come down to our side and try to push or pull us,\" the emissary's voice urged me. \"The quicker you learn to do that, the quicker you'll be able to move things around in your world by merely looking at them.\"\n\nMy merchant's mind went berserk with anticipation. I was instantly among them, desperately trying to push them or pull them. After a while, I thoroughly exhausted my energy. I then had the impression that I had been trying to do something equivalent to lifting a house with the strength of my teeth.\n\nAnother impression I had was that the more I exerted myself, the greater the number of shadows. It was as if they were coming from every corner to watch me, or to feed on me. The moment I had that thought, the shadows again scurried away.\n\n\"We are not feeding on you,\" the emissary said. \"We all come to feel your energy, very much like what you do with sunlight on a cold day.\"\n\nThe emissary urged me to open up to them by canceling out my suspicious thoughts. I heard the voice, and as I listened to what it was saying, I realized that I was hearing, feeling, and thinking exactly as I do in my daily world. I slowly turned to see around me. Taking the clarity of my perception as a gauge, I concluded that I was in a real world.\n\nThe emissary's voice sounded in my ears. It said that for me the only difference between perceiving my world and perceiving theirs was that perceiving their world started and ended in the blink of an eye; perceiving mine did not, because my awareness- together with the awareness of an immense number of beings like me who held my world in place with their intent- was fixed on my world. The emissary added that perceiving my world started and ended the same way for the inorganic beings, in the blink of an eye, but perceiving their world did not, because there were immense numbers of them holding it in place with their intent.\n\nAt that instant the scene started to dissolve. I was like a diver, and waking up from that world was like swimming up to reach the surface.\n\nIn the following session, the emissary began its dialogue with me by restating that a totally coordinated and coactive relationship existed between mobile shadows and stationary tunnels. It finished its statement saying, \"We can't exist without each other.\"\n\n\"I understand what you mean,\" I said.\n\nThere was a touch of scorn in the emissary's voice when it retorted that I could not possibly understand what it means to be related in that fashion, which was infinitely more than being dependent. I intended to ask the emissary to explain what it meant by that, but the next instant I was inside of what I can only describe as the very tissue of the tunnel. I saw some grotesquely merged, glandlike protuberances that emitted an opaque light. The thought crossed my mind that those were the same protuberances that had given me the impression of being like Braille. Considering that they were energy blobs three to four feet in diameter, I began to wonder about the actual size of those tunnels.\n\n\"Size here is not like size in your world,\" the emissary said. \"The energy of this world is a different kind of energy; its features don't coincide with the features of the energy of your world, yet this world is as real as your own.\"\n\nThe emissary went on to say that it had told me everything about the shadow beings when it described and explained the protuberances on the tunnels' walls. I retorted that I had heard the explanations but I had not paid attention to them because I believed that they did not pertain directly to dreaming.\n\n\"Everything here, in this realm, pertains directly to dreaming,\" the emissary stated.\n\nI wanted to think about the reason for my misjudgment, but my mind became blank. My dreaming attention was waning. I was having trouble focusing it on the world around me. I braced myself for waking up. The emissary started to speak again, and the sound of its voice propped me up. My dreaming attention perked up considerably.\n\n\"Dreaming is the vehicle that brings dreamers to this world,\" the emissary said, \"and everything sorcerers know about dreaming was taught to them by us. Our world is connected to yours by a door called dreams. We know how to go through that door, but men don't. They have to learn it.\"\n\nThe emissary's voice went on explaining what it had already explained to me before.\n\n\"The protuberances on the tunnels' walls are shadow beings,\" it said. \"I am one of them. We move inside the tunnels, on their walls, charging ourselves with the energy of the tunnels, which is our energy.\"\n\nAn idle thought crossed my mind: I was really incapable of conceiving a symbiotic relationship such as the one I was witnessing.\n\n\"If you would stay among us, you would certainly learn to feel what it is like to be connected as we are connected,\" the emissary said.\n\nThe emissary seemed to be waiting for my reply. I had the feeling that what it really wanted was for me to say that I had decided to stay.\n\n\"How many shadow beings are in each tunnel?\" I asked to change the mood and immediately regretted it because the emissary began to give me a detailed account of the numbers and functions of the shadow beings in each tunnel. It said that each tunnel had a specific number of dependent entities, which performed specific functions having to do with the needs and expectations of the supporting tunnels.\n\nI did not want the emissary to go into more detail. I reasoned that the less I knew about the tunnel and shadow beings the better off I was. The instant I formulated that thought, the emissary stopped, and my energy body jerked as if it had been pulled by a cable. The next moment, I was fully awake, in my bed.\n\nFrom then on, I had no more fears that could have interrupted my practices. Another idea had begun to rule me: the idea that I had found unparalleled excitation. I could hardly wait every day to start dreaming and have the scout take me to the shadows' world. The added attraction was that my visions of the shadows' world became even more true to life than before. Judged by the subjective standards of orderly thoughts, orderly visual and auditory sensory input, orderly responses on my part, my experiences, for as long as they lasted, were as real as any situation in our daily world. Never had I had perceptual experiences in which the only difference between my visions and my everyday world was the speed with which my visions ended. One instant I was in a strange, real world, and the next instant I was in my bed.\n\nI craved don Juan's commentaries and explanations, but I was still marooned in Los Angeles. The more I considered my situation, the greater my anxiety: I even began to sense that something in the inorganic beings' realm was brewing at tremendous speed.\n\nAs my anxiety grew, my body entered into a state of profound fright, although my mind was ecstatic in the contemplation of the shadows' world. To make things worse, the dreaming emissary's voice lapsed into my daily consciousness. One day while I was attending a class at the university, I heard the voice say, over and over, that any attempt on my part to end my dreaming practices would be deleterious to my total aims. It argued that warriors do not shy away from a challenge and that I had no valid rationale for discontinuing my practices. I agreed with the emissary. I had no intention of stopping anything, and the voice was merely reaffirming what I felt.\n\nNot only did the emissary change but a new scout appeared on the scene. On one occasion, before I had begun to examine the items of my dream, a scout had literally jumped in front of me and aggressively captured my dreaming attention. The notable feature of this scout was that it did not need to go through any energetic metamorphosis. It was a blob of energy from the start. In the blink of an eye, the scout transported me, without my having to voice my intent to go with it, to another part of the inorganic beings' realm: the world of the saber-toothed tigers.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Strange Protuberances in the IOB realm", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2h7pmd512y681": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2h7pmd512y681.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787ccbcbb970df216a53360316eb72ae220b0d33"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2h7pmd512y681.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efab83ede53b06afa97257d7668520c0de834332"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2h7pmd512y681.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1c97c8cf7fd6d5ec45e73d21b57ea4ff6b4c83"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2h7pmd512y681.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f473b4bcb43b5ed7799458012d54b55904760a26"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2h7pmd512y681.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e98d816d51e81ddea318dc606ea58a08da66a0"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2h7pmd512y681.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f3bf50a4ca4029585d402a41744e2b8f67969cb"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2h7pmd512y681.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278db1b2b83c3d6ba77cc8ac00740ffe5c02021c"}, "id": "2h7pmd512y681"}}, "name": "t3_rlia5i", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zQ8d-2vMUdqMMN8EEkYzvkiWUW7EUQpFEGXtDnt4090.jpg", "edited": 1640113528.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1640104086.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2h7pmd512y681.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=278db1b2b83c3d6ba77cc8ac00740ffe5c02021c\"&gt;What I do for fun, with Cholita gone.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been giving more energy to my inorganic beings lately, because if I neglect one it stops coming around.

To me, it sounded like it relished being asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, that&amp;#39;s our most mysterious feature,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;The third kind is revealed to our visitors only when they choose to stay with us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why is that so?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because it takes a great deal of energy to see them,&amp;quot; the emissary answered. &amp;quot;And we would have to provide that energy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew that the emissary was telling me the truth. I also knew that a horrendous danger was lurking. Yet I was driven by a curiosity without limits. I wanted to see that third kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary seemed to be aware of my mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Would you like to see them?&amp;quot; it asked casually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Most certainly,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All you have to do is to say out loud that you want to stay with us,&amp;quot; the emissary said with a nonchalant intonation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But if I say that, I have to stay, right?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Naturally,&amp;quot; the emissary said in a tone of ultimate conviction. &amp;quot;Everything you say out loud in this world is for keeps.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could not help thinking that, if the emissary had wanted to trick me into staying, all it had to do was lie to me. I would not have known the difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I cannot lie to you, because a lie doesn&amp;#39;t exist,&amp;quot; the emissary said, intruding into my thoughts. &amp;quot;I can tell you only about what exists. In my world, only intent exists; a lie has no intent behind it; therefore, it has no existence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to argue that there is intent even behind lies, but before I could voice my argument, the emissary said that behind lies there is intention but that that intention is not intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could not keep my dreaming attention focused on the argument the emissary was posing. It went to the shadow beings. Suddenly, I noticed that they had the appearance of a herd of strange, childlike animals. The emissary&amp;#39;s voice warned me to hold my emotions in check, for sudden bursts of feelings had the capacity to make them disperse, like a flock of birds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want me to do?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come down to our side and try to push or pull us,&amp;quot; the emissary&amp;#39;s voice urged me. &amp;quot;The quicker you learn to do that, the quicker you&amp;#39;ll be able to move things around in your world by merely looking at them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My merchant&amp;#39;s mind went berserk with anticipation. I was instantly among them, desperately trying to push them or pull them. After a while, I thoroughly exhausted my energy. I then had the impression that I had been trying to do something equivalent to lifting a house with the strength of my teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another impression I had was that the more I exerted myself, the greater the number of shadows. It was as if they were coming from every corner to watch me, or to feed on me. The moment I had that thought, the shadows again scurried away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are not feeding on you,&amp;quot; the emissary said. &amp;quot;We all come to feel your energy, very much like what you do with sunlight on a cold day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary urged me to open up to them by canceling out my suspicious thoughts. I heard the voice, and as I listened to what it was saying, I realized that I was hearing, feeling, and thinking exactly as I do in my daily world. I slowly turned to see around me. Taking the clarity of my perception as a gauge, I concluded that I was in a real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary&amp;#39;s voice sounded in my ears. It said that for me the only difference between perceiving my world and perceiving theirs was that perceiving their world started and ended in the blink of an eye; perceiving mine did not, because my awareness- together with the awareness of an immense number of beings like me who held my world in place with their intent- was fixed on my world. The emissary added that perceiving my world started and ended the same way for the inorganic beings, in the blink of an eye, but perceiving their world did not, because there were immense numbers of them holding it in place with their intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that instant the scene started to dissolve. I was like a diver, and waking up from that world was like swimming up to reach the surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the following session, the emissary began its dialogue with me by restating that a totally coordinated and coactive relationship existed between mobile shadows and stationary tunnels. It finished its statement saying, &amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t exist without each other.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I understand what you mean,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a touch of scorn in the emissary&amp;#39;s voice when it retorted that I could not possibly understand what it means to be related in that fashion, which was infinitely more than being dependent. I intended to ask the emissary to explain what it meant by that, but the next instant I was inside of what I can only describe as the very tissue of the tunnel. I saw some grotesquely merged, glandlike protuberances that emitted an opaque light. The thought crossed my mind that those were the same protuberances that had given me the impression of being like Braille. Considering that they were energy blobs three to four feet in diameter, I began to wonder about the actual size of those tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Size here is not like size in your world,&amp;quot; the emissary said. &amp;quot;The energy of this world is a different kind of energy; its features don&amp;#39;t coincide with the features of the energy of your world, yet this world is as real as your own.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary went on to say that it had told me everything about the shadow beings when it described and explained the protuberances on the tunnels&amp;#39; walls. I retorted that I had heard the explanations but I had not paid attention to them because I believed that they did not pertain directly to dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything here, in this realm, pertains directly to dreaming,&amp;quot; the emissary stated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to think about the reason for my misjudgment, but my mind became blank. My dreaming attention was waning. I was having trouble focusing it on the world around me. I braced myself for waking up. The emissary started to speak again, and the sound of its voice propped me up. My dreaming attention perked up considerably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dreaming is the vehicle that brings dreamers to this world,&amp;quot; the emissary said, &amp;quot;and everything sorcerers know about dreaming was taught to them by us. Our world is connected to yours by a door called dreams. We know how to go through that door, but men don&amp;#39;t. They have to learn it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary&amp;#39;s voice went on explaining what it had already explained to me before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The protuberances on the tunnels&amp;#39; walls are shadow beings,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;I am one of them. We move inside the tunnels, on their walls, charging ourselves with the energy of the tunnels, which is our energy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An idle thought crossed my mind: I was really incapable of conceiving a symbiotic relationship such as the one I was witnessing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you would stay among us, you would certainly learn to feel what it is like to be connected as we are connected,&amp;quot; the emissary said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emissary seemed to be waiting for my reply. I had the feeling that what it really wanted was for me to say that I had decided to stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How many shadow beings are in each tunnel?&amp;quot; I asked to change the mood and immediately regretted it because the emissary began to give me a detailed account of the numbers and functions of the shadow beings in each tunnel. It said that each tunnel had a specific number of dependent entities, which performed specific functions having to do with the needs and expectations of the supporting tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not want the emissary to go into more detail. I reasoned that the less I knew about the tunnel and shadow beings the better off I was. The instant I formulated that thought, the emissary stopped, and my energy body jerked as if it had been pulled by a cable. The next moment, I was fully awake, in my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From then on, I had no more fears that could have interrupted my practices. Another idea had begun to rule me: the idea that I had found unparalleled excitation. I could hardly wait every day to start dreaming and have the scout take me to the shadows&amp;#39; world. The added attraction was that my visions of the shadows&amp;#39; world became even more true to life than before. Judged by the subjective standards of orderly thoughts, orderly visual and auditory sensory input, orderly responses on my part, my experiences, for as long as they lasted, were as real as any situation in our daily world. Never had I had perceptual experiences in which the only difference between my visions and my everyday world was the speed with which my visions ended. One instant I was in a strange, real world, and the next instant I was in my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I craved don Juan&amp;#39;s commentaries and explanations, but I was still marooned in Los Angeles. The more I considered my situation, the greater my anxiety: I even began to sense that something in the inorganic beings&amp;#39; realm was brewing at tremendous speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As my anxiety grew, my body entered into a state of profound fright, although my mind was ecstatic in the contemplation of the shadows&amp;#39; world. To make things worse, the dreaming emissary&amp;#39;s voice lapsed into my daily consciousness. One day while I was attending a class at the university, I heard the voice say, over and over, that any attempt on my part to end my dreaming practices would be deleterious to my total aims. It argued that warriors do not shy away from a challenge and that I had no valid rationale for discontinuing my practices. I agreed with the emissary. I had no intention of stopping anything, and the voice was merely reaffirming what I felt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only did the emissary change but a new scout appeared on the scene. On one occasion, before I had begun to examine the items of my dream, a scout had literally jumped in front of me and aggressively captured my dreaming attention. The notable feature of this scout was that it did not need to go through any energetic metamorphosis. It was a blob of energy from the start. In the blink of an eye, the scout transported me, without my having to voice my intent to go with it, to another part of the inorganic beings&amp;#39; realm: the world of the saber-toothed tigers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "25c96bb2-6006-11ea-a318-0e7b3e95c21d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "rlia5i", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 33, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rlia5i/strange_protuberances_in_the_iob_realm/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rlia5i/strange_protuberances_in_the_iob_realm/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1640104086.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hpgzhnb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "shortroundsuicide", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hpgybwz", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_d1s73", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;i guess truly silent mind does not have any memory, because its always here and now\n\nAhh!

Just angry men, trying to figure out how to create their own &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; so they can get some of the loot for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that trick doesn&amp;#39;t work on me, because I&amp;#39;ve seen it over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask them to pick the best from their list of places because I&amp;#39;m too busy to search it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when they start to admit, maybe they don&amp;#39;t have any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they point you to  a youtube video of an Indonesian guy lighting stuff on fire with his hands, in such a manner you can&amp;#39;t see what&amp;#39;s really going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still not what I asked for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what?????  How is an Indonesian guy going to help anyone learn magic, when he only promotes his own weird &amp;quot;powers&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We still have someone who did just that lingering in this group, constantly trying to figure out how to promote themselves, without getting kicked out for fake magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a good analogy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are endless companies selling maps to gold mines, in a certain city near some mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise anyone at all, if every single store was a con.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for some odd reason, when you point out the obvious about religions and magical systems, you get criticized for stating easily verifiable common sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blame Jesus and Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you unravel the deception revolving around magic, you start to unravel their religions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people need those so badly, they&amp;#39;ll kill themselves without believing in those.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_rlia5i", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rlia5i/strange_protuberances_in_the_iob_realm/hpggl7z/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640112655.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1640112655.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hpgtvrk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "shortroundsuicide", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hpged4d", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_d1s73", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Thanks for your response!

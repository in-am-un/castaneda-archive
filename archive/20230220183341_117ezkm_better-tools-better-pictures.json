I posted about such things before.\n\nBut when done with good animation software, it's a lot closer to the real experience.\n\nSo more motivating.\n\nNow, we've got a few more subreddit members seeing things this extreme.\n\nAnd they can tell you the same thing I'm telling you.   In case you worry, \"is this real?\"\n\nBut first, shame on you!  You have to be proven there's a reward,  or you won't make a serious effort?\n\nYou have to be **very** serious to learn sorcery.  You can't be a \"casual\" sorcerer.  And that's not just some \"judgemental\" assessment. It's not about whether you're a \"good person\" who does his chores, as opposed to a lazy guy who lets everything slide.\n\nIt's just how reality works!  You're trapped in a  hellish existence.  It pulls on  you.   Calls out to you!\n\nTo escape it, you MUST reject it, and struggle with all your might to get out.\n\nThen,  \"the spirit\" will notice.\n\nSo I suppose you have to learn to be a gambler, if you want to learn sorcery.  But typically if you really put it all on the line, you'll see results in days.  At the worst, weeks.\n\nSo, about this picture and how that man is staring magic right in the face.  IMPOSSIBLE stuff.\n\nThat is indeed what happens.\n\nI did all that last night.  My IOB tunnel looked different, but I can't draw what I saw last night because it was closer to being \"inside\" their world, than merely at the entrance. And the tunnel you see in that picture is a common sight.   Described by at least 4 others.\n\nSo most of the time, stuff is only 25% solid looking.  I want you to know about it, so you don't feel bad when that happens to you.\n\nIt's \"transparent\", like the Ally on the right in the picture.\n\nOr even dimmer.\n\nBut who cares?  If a scary and amazing spirit shows up it's kind of expected, even in the movies, that you can partly see through them.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they can't become fully solid looking. Or that you can't take them by the hand, suggest they lay down on the bed a while, and get them to comply.\n\nYou just don't want to do things like that. It'll get VERY creepy if you pursue that.\n\nI'll give you permission for one,  for the sake of \"science\".\n\nBut not again.  You might end up marrying one, and the last we'll see of you is the wedding party disappearing down that tunnel...\n\nThat was a joke.  I hope.\n\nBut the \"realness\" level is a function of two things.\n\nHow much dreaming energy you have.  In order to save that up, you need to be \"impeccable\".\n\nDitch the stupid \"warrior\", and just do what you know is the right thing to do.  From experience with sorcery.\n\nIt is NOT impeccable to go around making a Castaneda Inventory Expert pest of yourself.\n\n\"Impeccable\",  as far as saving dreaming attention,  requires you that understand what dreaming energy is, from experience.\n\nFrom your \"good days\", and \"bad days\" practicing darkroom.\n\nYou LEARN what sort of conditions are helpful to \"saving energy\".\n\nAnd at some point, that energy is actually visible!\n\nBut you have to get to the point that you can do everything in this picture, at least once, before you have a chance to actually see how far up your energy has risen. It rises up from the toes, to coat the outside of our egg-like shell. With sparkling \"powdered sugar\".\n\nLike on a donut that's very fresh.\n\nMost of us are licked down to the toes, by the fliers.\n\nAs if a little kid broke into the box of donuts, and licked all the powdered sugar from them.\n\nThat's us.  Yucky donuts.\n\nWhen it finally rises up to the knees, anything in this picture is possible.\n\nBut still very hard to do a second time.\n\nWhen it rises to your waist, you can repeat things.  But it takes effort.  Single mindedness.\n\nI have no idea what happens when it rises above your head.\n\nWe can only imagine...\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Better Tools, Better Pictures!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"i01s0a8rodja1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=defffd925490e4c11e542662d9f4d5a3b88bac7d"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f20f9a2e445c7bb6979995f92ed96a6d8aa5ef7"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e508f4894f5a726e9c184b11ae11e85fbeab57b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b79d29dc627e030179e40d7798ba1bec6ec3695"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b97c23c40a015475bd4a89c987050fc21cb0a683"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbee6a0e0b5acbc87bfc80b9158ab589ed585926"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a55e97789e5efd4a5ae504a2ddce3ada6e3ce92"}, "id": "i01s0a8rodja1"}}, "name": "t3_117ezkm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/UF0oHvU1OckUBfAeA6txPz0UCPTcoOtY5d9HPm4Al0w.jpg", "edited": 1676916176.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1676914421.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6a55e97789e5efd4a5ae504a2ddce3ada6e3ce92\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/i01s0a8rodja1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6a55e97789e5efd4a5ae504a2ddce3ada6e3ce92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing new in this pic.

Today i couldnt sleep well had lot of thouts about work so i waked up in the midle of the night. Did some recap to stop my thoughts and then try to fall asleep again. ( i sleep on the floor these days. )\n\n At some moment i had a thoght to go and see a movie becouse i thought i would be able to sleep again. Somewher between these thougts i started to see a dream that i was in my room but it was bigger and there where some people drawing and there was a olde friend of mine whom i steped over and he fell. I felt sad and had a intense feeling of wanting to cry so i followed it to see where it will lead me. I found myself in my room again but it was very close to what it looks like in real life. I thought i was awake and had a strange feeling that something is close to me, my whole back tingled and i stood up imidiatly from the floor that i was sleeping. I realized that i was very light and floating a bit.  I was alone and it was dark but slightly illuminated in the areas that i was looking at. I was a afraid that something might get me in the dark but wanted to explore, so i did. I sturted jumping around and watch the room. I had frear, excitment and an feeling that was pushinh me to ask for help from someone. At the whole time there was buzzing and my whole body was vibrating. Most of the vibrations came from a box in the room that was vibrating intensly. I went and tried to touch it but imy hand pased almost through it and just felt it vibrating. Then i went to the entrance of the house. It has like a thriller with some lights closing on their own and then oppening again. Then i went to the living room and there i heard my girlfriend wispering something that i didnt understand or it didnt make sense. Most certainly i didnt expect to hear her voice. I was like WTF is happening and then found myself in my bed again. My eyes where still open the whole time like i never closed them.  took me 5-7 seconds to fully come back and reallize what happened. \n\nSorry its long but wanted to share.\nWhy i had this weird fear?

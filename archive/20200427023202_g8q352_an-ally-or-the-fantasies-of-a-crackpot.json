I was unappreciative.\n\nBut I'm not anymore, and would like to pay Carlos back.\n\nYet, I\u2019m not welcome in the Eastern Bloc.\n\nListen guys.  It won't work!\n\nDon't you get it???\n\nNot you guys in here. I think you are starting to get it.\n\nI mean, the eastern bloc as a whole.\n\nI'm pleading with them, to CUT IT OUT!\n\nPractice, practice, practice.\n\nDon't \"visit\", and \"Share\", and generally fuss around and compete with others.\n\nYou'll NEVER get there if you have that mindset.\n\nJust like the hundreds who came before you, but actually had Carlos helping them.\n\nThey're GONE!\n\nWe can't afford to lose you guys. It\u2019s the last stand.\n\n(Well, maybe I have another one elsewhere\u2026)\n\nLet me try to shine some light on why it isn\u2019t going to work out for you guys, unless something changes.\n\nFirst, a story:\n\nDisneyland used to be very cheap.  $2 to get in, then each ride cost money.\n\nThe big prize were the \"E Ticket Rides\". Those cost a few $ each.\n\nBut entry was only $2.\n\nMy family used to go there often.\n\nAs we entered, I always became obsessed with the \"Magic Shop\".\n\nDisneyland starts with little shops, so that if you only wanted to pay the $2 to enter, you could have lunch and enjoy some shopping. Then go home.\n\nThe rides are far away.\n\nOld people can't really visit the actual rides, unless they\u2019re ready for a mini-marathon.\n\nThey had the usual gadgets to fool your friends in my favorite magic shop.\n\nCard games, guillotines, plastic poop.\n\nYou buy the magic \u201cpackage\u201d, and it has instructions and all you need.\n\nYou can collect those.\n\nBuild yourself an \u201cinventory\u201d of magic.\n\nMy family knew, they had to put up with it. I always had to go there on the way in.\n\nBut it only delayed getting to the wonderful rides, like Pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted Castle.\n\nBack then there were few people in line, so the number of rides you got to visit depended only on how focused you remained on seeing as many as possible.\n\nBut I was obsessed with gathering knowledge of \"magic\", so I could show off for my friends.\n\nI could picture myself in a sort of childhood \"book deal\", getting praise and attention.\n\nOf course, for nothing.\n\nIt's always for nothing, even when you're grown.\n\nYou can't book deal your way into sorcery.\n\nI should have skipped that magic shop, and headed for the exciting rides.\n\nThat's what's happened in the Eastern Bloc.\n\nThey're obsessed with the Magic Shop.\n\nIt's run by Cleargreen.\n\nMagic for sale!\n\nAnd besides, the magic shop is easier to visit.\n\nIt's a long walk to those rides.  Those actually take some effort.\n\nHow does this relate to my experiences last night?\n\nI had no idea I'd done all that last night, until I wrote it down.\n\nLikely, I forgot even more things beginners might find fascinating, and even impossible to believe.\n\nAnd I didn't realize, I'd made another request to my inorganic being, and she'd come through spectacularly!\n\nI requested to be closer, so she maneuvered me 2 feet into her world.\n\nOn verbal request!\n\nHad to do 1 world change first, through the forest.\n\nBut she was able.\n\nWhy didn't I notice that?\n\nIt's because of what Carlos explained.\n\nAt the start of one of his later books, when he began to recall the hidden teachings don Juan had given him, while he was in heightened awareness, he explained that he had to add \"the texture of daily life\".\n\nHe had to sort of selectively create a story-line.\n\nOtherwise, it would be too non-linear for us.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t apologizing for making up stuff.\n\nHe was teaching us.  Warning us.\n\nOr giving us a sign post. When you get to non-linear goings on, you're on the right track.\n\nMine are still quite linear, thank you.\n\nBut same thing applies.\n\nLast night, I was in full on heightened awareness.\n\nI could tell because, my breathing changed to deep and automatic, I felt a wonderful sigh followed by intense bliss, and I had all the confidence you could ever want.\n\nNothing mattered, everything was possible.\n\nThat\u2019s heightened awareness.\n\nBut, the things that happen there, do not fit in with the daily world.\n\nThey aren\u2019t possible!\n\nThey\u2019re delusional.\n\nYou can\u2019t impress your friends using them. They\u2019re insane.\n\nThey don\u2019t fit in with a \u201cbook deal mind\u201d.\n\nDisneyland on the other hand does.\n\nYou can share with your friends after going on the rides.\n\nYou can chuckle to them, \u201cYou know the drunk pirate with the pigs? His head was broken last night!\u201d\n\nAnd he'll give you the human interactions you so desperately crave by saying, \"Oh yea, I once saw the busty woman being chased around the well, with her skirt missing!!!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s share away, because Disneyland is a common experience in Southern California.\n\nOur internal dialogue can plan, and explain, and prepare to get attention from other people.\n\nAs it always wants.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201chappiness chaser\u201d.\n\nAnd it\u2019s super needy. Needing the approval of other people.\n\nThe second attention doesn\u2019t fit in with that.\n\nAnd so when something wonderful happens, you just don\u2019t feel it.\n\nYou can\u2019t share that. If you even tried, you\u2019d be punished.\n\nIt breaks the normal flow of time, as fantasized in the mind.\n\nIf I tried to \"share\" with my friends and family, I'd get:\n\n\"So you complained to a fairy, and to make up for your unhappiness she took you across an alien forest, to enter into her world, where there's some possibility they're trying to kidnap you?  And you saw a ship captain that Castaneda mentioned to you, but you can't recall when???\"\n\nNope. Can't share that.\n\nAnd you know it.  The internal dialogue realizes that, even if you don't consciously think about it.\n\nWhile you are experiencing it, you just don\u2019t have the normal reaction.\n\nYou're on your own. It is what it is. You don't do it, to pimp for someone else's amusement.\n\nA lot of our reactions to things are based on running off to tell someone, to use it to get attention.\n\nYou can\u2019t do that in the second attention.\n\nYou have to give that up, or you\u2019re stuck here!\n\nAll of your desires to share with others, keep you stuck HERE.\n\nAnd please. Don't drag me into that kind of thinking.\n\nI\u2019m only saying this, for the same reason Carlos mentioned it.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice it yourself, and have confidence you went the right direction.\n\nIt won\u2019t do you any good to add that to your inventory, but it can serve as a signpost.\n\nEdited", "edited": 1588010400.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_forcauj", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me add an explanation, because it&amp;#39;s a good chance to let the Easter Bloc folks know why I&amp;#39;ve been picking on them so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow, Cleargreen has set Russia and surrounding areas up as multi-level marketing &amp;quot;friendship&amp;quot; group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People share together, grow together, and try to reach their sorcery goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They try to earn money off each other, and for amusement they&amp;#39;re secretive and mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been booted off some of their social media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An actual student of Carlos, from long ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dare I add, a favorite student?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one who can actually make his techniques work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always could, and Carlos knew that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that I got it back then.

Warning us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or giving us a sign post. When you get to non-linear goings on, you&amp;#39;re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mine are still quite linear, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But same thing applies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I was in full on heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could tell because, my breathing changed to deep and automatic, I felt a wonderful sigh followed by intense bliss, and I had all the confidence you could ever want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing mattered, everything was possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, the things that happen there, do not fit in with the daily world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren\u2019t possible!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019re delusional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t impress your friends using them. They\u2019re insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don\u2019t fit in with a \u201cbook deal mind\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disneyland on the other hand does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can share with your friends after going on the rides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can chuckle to them, \u201cYou know the drunk pirate with the pigs? His head was broken last night!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;ll give you the human interactions you so desperately crave by saying, &amp;quot;Oh yea, I once saw the busty woman being chased around the well, with her skirt missing!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s share away, because Disneyland is a common experience in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our internal dialogue can plan, and explain, and prepare to get attention from other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it always wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a \u201chappiness chaser\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it\u2019s super needy. Needing the approval of other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second attention doesn\u2019t fit in with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so when something wonderful happens, you just don\u2019t feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t share that. If you even tried, you\u2019d be punished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It breaks the normal flow of time, as fantasized in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I tried to &amp;quot;share&amp;quot; with my friends and family, I&amp;#39;d get:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So you complained to a fairy, and to make up for your unhappiness she took you across an alien forest, to enter into her world, where there&amp;#39;s some possibility they&amp;#39;re trying to kidnap you?  And you saw a ship captain that Castaneda mentioned to you, but you can&amp;#39;t recall when???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope. Can&amp;#39;t share that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you know it.  The internal dialogue realizes that, even if you don&amp;#39;t consciously think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While you are experiencing it, you just don\u2019t have the normal reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re on your own. It is what it is. You don&amp;#39;t do it, to pimp for someone else&amp;#39;s amusement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of our reactions to things are based on running off to tell someone, to use it to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t do that in the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to give that up, or you\u2019re stuck here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of your desires to share with others, keep you stuck HERE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And please. Don&amp;#39;t drag me into that kind of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m only saying this, for the same reason Carlos mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll notice it yourself, and have confidence you went the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won\u2019t do you any good to add that to your inventory, but it can serve as a signpost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_g8q352", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g8q352/an_ally_or_the_fantasies_of_a_crackpot/forcauj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1588009804.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "foquzde", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1588001298.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_g8q352", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "You found a not-doing, and because you meditate your assemblage point is loose.\n\nI'll ramble on a bit, but your answer is in here.  I do a remarkable amount of things each night, and most is lost if I don't write it anywhere.\n\nThe not-doing moved your assemblage point, energy was released, and possibly an inorganic being noticed it.\n\nThey do that all the time!  Mostly they only get to take over characters in dreams, because people are blind to them during the day.\n\nBut if your assemblage point shifts, and especially if some energy is released, they can manage to make an appearance.\n\nEspecially in darkness,  in a  creepy forest, where there's less to pull you back to \"reality\", and more reason to feel fright.\n\nAs for wrestling with it, if your dog is in there I'd wait until whatever it was came and pushed on you.\n\nYou don't want to frighten your dog!\n\nThe whole \"wrestle an ally\" thing is from the early books, and was in the spirit of shamanism, not the actual truth about the situation.\n\nYou \"wrestle\" an ally just by changing from fright to affection.\n\nThe idea that it's concrete, and the ally is like a tornado which spins you around, was just Don Juan trying to teach Carlos 2 different views of the world, so he could sneak through the middle.\n\nBut really, most inorganic beings are like creepy puppy dogs.\n\nIt isn't hard to get along with them.  They just want to play.\n\nThe only time you have to worry about them, is if it's a pack of creepy puppy dogs.\n\nThose can be dangerous. They can move substantial amounts of physical matter.\n\nOne cannot (I hope).\n\nYou can even bully them, to get them to do what you want.\n\nThey never seem to take offense at direct orders.\n\nThis doesn't go for Carlos' allies, who are terrifying and have their own agenda.\n\nBut out in the woods, there's undoubtedly scores of low energy ones.  And no need to wrestle them.\n\nThe truth is, inorganic beings like to press up against us.  If you're afraid, they'll feed on that.\n\nBut if you love them, they'll feed on that too.\n\nSo the typical way you might end up wrestling them is, they keep approaching, you're super frightened, and eventually they're right on top of you, seemingly pushing you back against something that will trap you for sure.\n\nYou try to push back against their push, but it's impossible.  They have infinite strength, even though they move very very slowly.\n\nIt's when you don't give up that everything changes, and you can wrestle them to the ground if you like.\n\nOnce they stop pushing, they're feeding off a different energy (your excitement at having won perhaps), and you can simply insist they take a pleasing form.\n\nI turned mine into Tinkerbell, the Cheshire Cat, and the pumpkin from the headless horseman.\n\nCholita turned her into a corpse, and a mysterious woman in a hoody wearing round dark welding glasses.\n\nThey don't really want to be scary.\n\nAt least, not \"want\" in the sense we understand.\n\nTheir scariness is probably mostly energy released by them pulling your assemblage point where it's never been before.\n\nWe confuse that energy with fright, because fright is usually what moves our assemblage point.\n\nThus we got used to that feeling meaning, \"fright\".\n\nBut it's just energy.  And the creepier the better in my opinion.\n\nLast night my low energy inorganic being was floating around in a purple mist.\n\nI was trying to scoop up enough purple mist to form some taffy on my hands.\n\nThere's nothing like a glob of sticky purple taffy on your hands, to move your assemblage point.\n\nI noticed, the colors in the room were now 100% directional!\n\nNone turned when I turned my head. They hung out in the air, whereever they were.\n\nI spun around in joy!\n\nThat's an issue in the beginning.  The colors move when you turn your head, which makes them seem like a side effect of how the eye works.\n\nI got greedy and kept scooping frantically,  trying to gather at least a baseball size of directional purple goo, when my inorganic being popped out again.\n\nShe wasn't helping much!  She used to show me where to scoop.\n\nNow she seemed more interested in watching.\n\nI decided to chastise her.\n\nThe last time I did that she taught me to read crystal balls.\n\nI pleaded with her, actually speaking.\n\nIn full on heightened awareness you don't have to worry as much about being silent.\n\nI told her I love her, and why can't we just work together all the time?\n\nThen I told her, I don't care that she's not actually a tiny fairy.\n\nI just like her for her coolness.  And we need to be closer.\n\nShe disappeared.\n\nI waited around a minute.  Usually there's a delay between a request, and some kind of answer.\n\nAt least, in waking dreaming there's a delay.\n\nI gave up after a while.\n\nI became curious about the walls of my room.\n\nThey were covered in the fine white lines associated with \"the wall\".\n\nI've been trying to form \"the wall\" on my hand, so I could read from the Akashic record, the way Carlos did.\n\nI decided to \"cheat\". I held my hand up, palm towards my face, so that it was superimposed over the wall that was covered in white lines.\n\nI failed to notice the obvious.  How come I could see the wall and my hand???\n\nBut I was more obsessed with copying Carlos.\n\nI did get a few lines on my hand, but then I noticed, my bedroom was now located in a forest.\n\nIf \"the wall\" surrounds you in a dark room, you're about to assemble another world, like it or not.\n\nI could clearly see the \"trees\" of the forest on all of the walls.\n\nOr maybe it was thick bamboo.\n\nIt was definitely an alien forest.\n\nI've been there before.\n\nI walked closer to the corner to see more details.  The corner is the largest clear area, since my bed is in the middle and tends to go with me when I assemble another world.\n\nThe closer I got to the corner, the less of the forest was visible, until I was standing right in the V formed by the corner.\n\nI got interested in why I could now see in the dark. I could clearly see the edges of the corner and the floor boards.\n\nI tried out switching my eyes to seeing energy only, something my inorganic being taught me a week or two ago.\n\nThe floor lit up as bright as if I'd turned on the lights.\n\nBut why could I see in the dark?  I wanted to know how to repeat that.\n\nI remembered a time when Carlos was hanging out with Jacobo, and all kinds of strange topics kept coming up in private class.\n\nI realized, it's possible Jacobo or his wife were even present!\n\nBut with my face blindness I couldn't detect new people very well.  And I certainly didn't remember Jacobo's heavy beard.\n\nAround that time, of Jacobo, Carlos was once talking about a girl who could read newspapers with her feet.\n\nHe was pretty much explaining that we have sensory information from multiple sources, and there's no reason one source can't be used for something we don't normally associate with it.\n\nSkin for sight?  Why not?\n\nIt was clear, as he talked, that one of the women from the inner circle was enjoying the topic.\n\nWhich sort of meant, you couldn't be sure Carlos wanted us to take that as something important.\n\nBut it did remind me of the blind boy who uses sonar to see.\n\nSomeone posted a link to a video on that topic, in here.\n\nHe actually makes sounds with his mouth or fingers (can't recall), and receives the echos and can walk around just fine.\n\nI was wondering if maybe what I was seeing might be sonar information, derived from the skin.\n\nI turned around to look at the rest of the room, and realized I wasn't in my room again.\n\nThe inorganic being had put me at the entrance to her world, in response to my request.\n\nOr better put, I was now inside her world, a few steps.\n\nI've never been that far in before.\n\nI saw several inorganic beings protruding from a dirt wall, but each one had the appearance of some odd character.\n\nI was still unable to see them in their true form.  I only saw the typical projections they can produce, which are reflections of our own minds.\n\nI saw a ship captain from the 1800s.\n\nA very strange idea occurred to me, something about a name associated with him.\n\nA name Carlos once told me.\n\nBut that was impossible.\n\nAnd it's all gone from my memory now.\n\nI saw an accountant.\n\nAnd a woman in a strange hat.\n\nI turned around and ignored them.  I wasn't going in there any further.\n\nI'm more interested in my latest experiments, and the inorganic beings will take you to their world often if you are able to perceive it.\n\nIt sounds super cool, but in fact it's no big deal.\n\nEveryone plays with the inorganics almost daily, even if it's only while asleep.\n\nI should mention:\n\nThat was an off night. \n\nNot much happened.\n\nEdited three times", "edited": 1588004613.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_foquzde", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You found a not-doing, and because you meditate your assemblage point is loose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll ramble on a bit, but your answer is in here.

I could clearly see the edges of the corner and the floor boards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried out switching my eyes to seeing energy only, something my inorganic being taught me a week or two ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The floor lit up as bright as if I&amp;#39;d turned on the lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why could I see in the dark?  I wanted to know how to repeat that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered a time when Carlos was hanging out with Jacobo, and all kinds of strange topics kept coming up in private class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, it&amp;#39;s possible Jacobo or his wife were even present!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with my face blindness I couldn&amp;#39;t detect new people very well.  And I certainly didn&amp;#39;t remember Jacobo&amp;#39;s heavy beard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around that time, of Jacobo, Carlos was once talking about a girl who could read newspapers with her feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was pretty much explaining that we have sensory information from multiple sources, and there&amp;#39;s no reason one source can&amp;#39;t be used for something we don&amp;#39;t normally associate with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skin for sight?  Why not?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was clear, as he talked, that one of the women from the inner circle was enjoying the topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which sort of meant, you couldn&amp;#39;t be sure Carlos wanted us to take that as something important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it did remind me of the blind boy who uses sonar to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone posted a link to a video on that topic, in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He actually makes sounds with his mouth or fingers (can&amp;#39;t recall), and receives the echos and can walk around just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if maybe what I was seeing might be sonar information, derived from the skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around to look at the rest of the room, and realized I wasn&amp;#39;t in my room again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic being had put me at the entrance to her world, in response to my request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or better put, I was now inside her world, a few steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been that far in before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw several inorganic beings protruding from a dirt wall, but each one had the appearance of some odd character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was still unable to see them in their true form.  I only saw the typical projections they can produce, which are reflections of our own minds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a ship captain from the 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very strange idea occurred to me, something about a name associated with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A name Carlos once told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s all gone from my memory now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw an accountant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a woman in a strange hat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around and ignored them.  I wasn&amp;#39;t going in there any further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m more interested in my latest experiments, and the inorganic beings will take you to their world often if you are able to perceive it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds super cool, but in fact it&amp;#39;s no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone plays with the inorganics almost daily, even if it&amp;#39;s only while asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should mention:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was an off night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not much happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g8q352/an_ally_or_the_fantasies_of_a_crackpot/foquzde/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1588001298.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_g8q352", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "foqfgcb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1587992295.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_g8q352", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;The shape of my dog shifted further into an unnamable presence - no longer a woman. **I snapped out of it**\n\nu/danl999 calls is \"Mr. double Take.\" \n\nWhile an ally/inorganic can take over something you're perceiving for a more prolonged period of time from the second attention, your briefer view is more of a gazing experience....a not-doing.

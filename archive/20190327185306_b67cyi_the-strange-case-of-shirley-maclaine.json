It\u2019s not obvious to new readers this day, but Carlos lent credibility to the Hippie Culture\u2019s tendency to party too much.  Along with Timothy Leary and Owsley Stanley, they provided the rationale and means for psychedelic trips into what at that time and in that culture, were unexplored territories.  Carlos also converted mycologists overnight,  from frumpy nerd to most popular man in the sciences department.\n\nAs a result, Carlos constantly came into contact with famous individuals. Oliver Stone named his production company, \u201cIxtlan Productions\u201d.   Bruce Wagner was a member of his group, and produced a mini-series somewhat themed around Carlos\u2019s view of reality.  I\u2019m sure there\u2019re many more, but Carlos was a storyteller.  It\u2019s very difficult to remember specific cases on demand.  Just like we all can\u2019t remember specific places in his books where people searched for colors in the darkness.\n\nHe told a fairly credible story of making a home movie with Bruce Lee.  He had entry to \u201cgreat spiritual leaders\u201d, and told the story of how he met a famous Guru, who came down a majestic staircase to greet him, slipped and fell, and died on the spot.\n\nHe told the story of being at a party with L Ron Hubbard, who confided in him that one of the most profitable things you could do, is to start your own religion.  Carlos smiled a bit when he told that story, clearly aware of the irony in telling us that.\n\nYou kind of have to wonder about his stories though. They were obviously created for the purpose of teaching, and in that vein, it was slightly possible he elaborated a bit too far, perhaps even slightly past the obvious details of the situation.\n\nI have to put that warning in for Shirley\u2019s sake, since she\u2019s still around.  I have no idea if this story is true.\n\nMost of Carlos\u2019 comments on contemporary events, or various religions, likely had their source in one particular member of his group.  Which one varied with the story.  One time, Carlos was explaining the flaw in the reasoning of Buddhism.  After he finished, one of the women who was closer to the inner group than I, whispered in my ear that he did that because of so-and-so.   As I recall, so-and-so was still obsessed with Buddhism, thinking he\u2019d be better off as a part-time monk.\n\nAnother time, he went into a several days rant about Catholicism, including mention of a book called, \u201cThe Sex Lives of the Popes\u201d.  He faced Ellis proudly a few times during this lecture, and she smiled widely.   He talked about the corpses lined up in tunnels below the Vatican, consisting of the aborted fetuses of the nuns. He relished in emphasizing the P in Pope.\n\nHe talked about \u201cBishops\u201d, as if they were a force of corruption and evil.    I hate to use the word, \u201crant\u201d, because it was all very funny, and obviously had a good purpose.  But I did notice, the anti-Catholic stories were a bit longer than the stories about any other religion.  And I never did find out who was the guilty Catholic among the group.  Maybe it was partly Carlos himself.\n\nCarlos\u2019 lectures could get pretty raunchy.  He could say something with a serious face, that you\u2019d never want your mother to hear.  It would just flow out, as if he\u2019d switched modes, and was savoring the words he selected. This often included curling his fingers near his mouth, to encourage the audience to \u201cfeel\u201d the words.\n\nThere was always a point to it, but he might have wanted to water it down a bit in polite company.  After spending a few years around him, my tendency to swear was increased by at least 200%.\n\nThere was a time in classes where people were experiencing sleep paralysis and it came up as a topic.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t experienced this, you will.   It\u2019s horrible.  You wake up to find yourself completely paralyzed.  Actually, you haven\u2019t woken at all.  You\u2019re merely conscious while asleep.  And because of that, it\u2019s an inevitable thing people who practice recapitulation, dreaming and silence will experience.   You\u2019re seeking to be conscious while asleep.  You got it.  And the body is paralyzed, so that you won\u2019t thrash about during dreams, and hurt yourself.\n\nIt feels like your entire body is vibrating with something that isn\u2019t quite pain, and yet is terribly unpleasant.   It\u2019s like a gigantic version of having a limb fall asleep.\n\nYou realize you just need to wake up, but you can\u2019t move.  If you can\u2019t move, you can\u2019t disturb your body, which is the only fast way to get out of this mess.\n\nSometimes you\u2019re lying in bed.  In that case, you can roll.  The ability to roll on your side is more basic than the ability to move your arms, and sleep paralysis doesn\u2019t completely stop that.  Roll as much as you can both ways, until you\u2019re jarred enough to wake.\n\nBut sometimes, you were practicing a sorcery technique while sitting in a comfy armchair.  You can end up slouching into an uncomfortable position, because you fell asleep.   When you realize it\u2019s uncomfortable, you \u201cwake up\u201d.   But not from sleep.  Only from unconsciousness.\n\nYou end up paralyzed.  Because you\u2019re in an armchair, you can\u2019t roll.  You can\u2019t lift up, you pretty much can\u2019t do anything but wait.\n\nEven worse, you\u2019re now smack dab in the second attention.  Along with the horrible vibrating feeling in your muscles, you can start to sense an inorganic being in the room.\n\nThey love sleep paralysis.  A captive audience!\n\nBut you won\u2019t realize it\u2019s that.  Many end up with highly Catholic images of a force of supreme Evil,  floating above them.  It seems to be coming towards you very slowly, giving you time to escape. But you can\u2019t move.  It\u2019s classic inorganic being behavior.\n\nIt especially seems to like women.  They report being raped by the supremely evil force.\n\nHere\u2019s where the story gets sketchy.  Shirley MacLaine was a superstar, probably from the movie she made with Clint Eastwood, where she played a prostitute pretending to be a nun.  If you haven\u2019t seen it, all I can say is, bathtub scene\u2026\n\nBut Shirley had to worry about aging, as all super stars do. Fortunately, she branched off into spiritual realms. She made the movie, \u201cOut on a Limb\u201d.  The hype of the time said it was based on her true life experiences.  I vaguely recall that aliens were contacting her, or something like that.\n\nIt was trendy at the time.  Back then there weren\u2019t any smart phones, and people had less to do.  Witchcraft book stores were common, and there was even one right under the main place Carlos held his classes.\n\nAny witchcraft bookstore at the time had an entire shelf dedicated to Alien contact.   It was commonly located next to the shelf of Carlos\u2019 books.\n\nAlien contact was often used as the explanation for sleep paralysis.  People would wake up, paralyzed by a beam of light sent by an alien spaceship, and then dark forces would converge on them, and start to \u201cprobe\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s the atheist\u2019s version of the Catholic concept of a \u201cbeing of Supreme Evil\u201d.   But more likely, it\u2019s an inorganic being.  They merely want to interact with us.  The same as we merely want to interact with them. We both get a kick out of it.\n\nBut they\u2019re clueless as to how to interact. They interact in the way that gives the most emotion.  If you\u2019re afraid of them, they\u2019re monstrous. If you love them, they\u2019ll climb into a bathtub with you.\n\nThey really have no class.  Literally.\n\nHow this ties in to Shirley, is a little fuzzy to me.  I only heard Carlos speak twice about her. And when Carlos did that, I got the impression he was feeling the same thing I was.\n\nThat wonderful bathtub scene\u2026  Who could harbor ill will towards her?\n\nBut there was also supposedly some conflict between them.\n\nAll I can guess is, her alien contact movie was based on an actual experience. Maybe Shirley did experience \u201calien\u201d contact. And I can only guess that, she got probed.  It wasn\u2019t an uncommon complaint among women.  Inorganic begins prey on our fears.  Our moms don\u2019t explain sleep paralysis to us.  If you practice any form of meditation, you\u2019re vulnerable to it.  Men tend to come up with the prince of darkness, and from my experiences, women often come up with an evil lover.\n\nInorganic beings will assume any form that pleases you. Or worse, any form that displeases you.  They don\u2019t care which, although you can encourage them to play nicely.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Shirley was supposed to have accused Carlos of.   She\u2019d undoubtedly read his books.  She was paralyzed, body asleep, and an evil force was coming for her.   Maybe it morphed into a person.\n\nCarlos claimed, she accused him of \u2026   I don\u2019t know if he actually used the words.  I can\u2019t recall.  He\u2019d often say something a little too matter of factly, and later all I could recall was the gist of it.\n\nThe gist of it was, Carlos appeared and probed her on her own bed. I believe he even relished the \"a\" sound when he used the actual word he probably used, which I can't remember.\n\nHe was obviously telling this story in class for a reason.  There\u2019re two possibilities I can think of.  Maybe he really was accused, in a semi-public manner.  And he responded in a semi-public manner.  The internet was sketchy back then, so googling that topic might not produce any results.\n\nOr maybe one of the female students in class had that experience, and he brought up that story to give us insight into sleep paralysis, and to alter the images we came up with to explain it.\n\nSleep paralysis passes. I haven\u2019t experience it in 15 years.  If you get into this mode, don\u2019t panic. And don\u2019t imagine anything other than, you\u2019re in the second attention. It can get weird in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: For more details\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The strange case of Shirley MacLaine", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_b67cyi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1553716505.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1553709186.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos was a superstar.

As don Juan said of the old sorcerers, \"But they still had to die\".  There's one incidence where some buried themselves under a large rock, to act as a lure for passersby.  I'm pretty sure they were dead under there, and had merely converted themselves into inorganic beings.  Thus they had no need for an organic body.\n\nIt\u2019s only my current thinking on the topic, without any proof.   With former classmates reluctant to speak out, or having moved on to some other thing, and with Cleargreen being their own \u201cinsular\u201d faction (Carlos liked that word), I guess we won\u2019t have another opinion on it until you guys get good at sorcery.  \n\nCertainly, Carlos was vulnerable to illness.  He told a story of how he\u2019d fallen off a roof one time, and was able to \u201cjump grooves\u201d to heal himself.   But with his cancer, he said he wasn\u2019t having any luck. \n\nThere was some thinking on that topic, at the time, that said he was trying to gain enough energetic mass in his followers, to make it possible to heal himself.  To that end perhaps, he tried to gather 200 women.  \n\nWomen have the puzzling ability to boost the energy of men, without actually losing anything themselves.   But the opposite is also true. If you run into a female petty tyrant who oppresses with sadness, you\u2019re in for big trouble.  Possibly for that reason,  gathering women isn\u2019t a viable path for learning sorcery.\n\nUnfortunately, collecting young women didn\u2019t pan out for Carlos too.  I wasn\u2019t told why.   In the only class I got to see, there were 50 women, and all of them looked puzzled to be there.  They kept moving their heads back and forth, looking at the three or so men who were also invited, like they expected something magical to happen. Or maybe they wanted to know who they had to kill to get into the group.\n\nA few months earlier (even a year or two?), he\u2019d found a double man.  Tony Lama he called him.  The buzz was, he could be the new Nagual.\n\nA sinister aspect of private classes was that some of the men wanted to be \u201cthe new nagual\u201d.   The women even got in on the nonsense, speculating about who it might be, and hanging out with them more.  I guess they wanted to be in on the ground floor, if there was to be a new lineage.  Maybe they could get a book deal too.\n\nI hope none of you are thinking like that.  It\u2019ll only slow you down.  Plus, it\u2019s kind of pathetic.  What are you going to do?  Run home and shout, \u201cSee Mommy! I\u2019m the new Nagual!!!\u201d\n\nShe won\u2019t be impressed.\n\nTony Lama seemed to me, to be after the equivalent of that, in the Tibetan Buddhist movement.  He wanted to get close to the \u201cDali Lama\u201d.  He was already working on it, in the Mexican Tibetan Buddhist movement, as I only faintly recall.  It\u2019s probably why Carlos teased him with that nickname.\n\nWithout a new nagual man, Carlos was out of luck for continuing that lineage in the old-fashioned way. He visibly gave up on that, when Tony didn\u2019t come back.\n\nTowards the end, Carlos showed up to classes with unkempt hair, and even had to sit down and lean against the wall, while we performed our Tensegrity.  Somehow word got out in the class that he was in a lot of pain, but without any official announcement of that fact.\n\n A few months earlier, he\u2019d even do a little jig during a lecture, to show how flexible Tensegrity made your knees.  I remember marveling at his apparent vigor and youth, while he was explaining the majesty of 1930s Tango dancing, something a nagual in his lineage had been in to.  In my mind I compared him to other men I knew around his age, and he came up very well in the comparison.\n\nBut his health went downhill over the last few months of classes. He brought his female doctor to class and formally introduced her as such, although she\u2019d been around for as long as I was paying attention. \n\nOne time shortly before he died, I went to Dance Home for a class.  I seem to have arrived early, because there was no one else there. That was really odd though, because Carlos showed up right after I got there. He usually waited until everyone was already there, and his arrival signaled shutting the doors.  It was well known, if the doors were shut, you might be out of luck.\n\nThe Chacmools had driven him. They escorted him to the door, he went in and sat down at the bottom of the staircase leading up into the Dance Hall.  I went in with him, thinking we\u2019d just go up the stairs.  But he said something to the Chacmools, and they closed the door and left.   One gave me a worried look for an instant, but decided he was safe with me in there.  I sat down also. I couldn\u2019t exactly go up, with him sitting down at the bottom.\n\nTurns out, he had something to say to me.  I don\u2019t know if it was me in particular, or it was for anyone who happened to be there when he arrived early.\n\nI can\u2019t remember his exact words.  They weren\u2019t sad.  They weren\u2019t urgent.  They were merely, matter of fact.  He said he was dying, and no one believed him.  \n\nA few seconds went by, and he shook his head yes, while he looked into my eyes, to indicate, it was indeed the absolute truth.  \n\nHe gave me a blank check. \n\nHe\u2019d spoken about those in class a few times, giving examples.  But with the checkwriter gone, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any point in trying to explain that.\n\nDouble beings?  I have yet to see the luminous shell in full, which humans are supposed to be, and by which you can identify double beings.\n\nBut I have seen the inside of the shell.  It has odd structures stuck to it, perhaps like is described in one of the books, where you can tell what type of warrior someone is by the shapes on the shell.\n\nA double being is easy to detect however.  First, you have to be able to perceive the second attention.  Not anytime you like.  You don\u2019t have to be that skilled. But you have to have some understanding of it, so that you could close your eyes, and activate it when you like, even if it took several hours of silence.\n\nThen, you only need to be standing next to a double being, under the right circumstances.  I don\u2019t know what the right circumstances are. Maybe, just close enough with nothing else to distract you.\n\nBut you\u2019ll know them when it happens.  Reality bends drastically. Without any effort.\n\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re so valuable to sorcery groups.  They don\u2019t even have to have a clue they can do that.\n\nThey come in men and women. The men, like Tony Lama, have likely already tied themselves to some endeavor, because people notice their power and just think they\u2019re \u201ccan do\u201d type people.  They\u2019re always occupied.\n\nI\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t go as well for the women.  Imagine a young woman, with extraordinary energy, but no clue what to do with it.   Will the Tibetan movement notice her, and promote her to Lama?\n\nNope.  More likely, they get into stupendous trouble.  If you find one, she\u2019s likely in need of a little rescuing.\n\nIt\u2019s probably for that reason, that the nagual woman is supposed to be found first. Find her, and the man will join up too.\n\nI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with astral projection, although a double will surely be better at that, if they try.\n\n***\nI've added this, just to get everything out there. If it isn't already.  First, Carlos techniques work as he said, so we don't know what the heck was really going on.\n\nWhen Carlos died, someone wanted to verify the body.  I believe it was the same person who spied on classes, trying to make a video tape of them.  He was on a mission to beat Carlos in some incomprehensible manner.\n\nHe claims to have gone to the funeral home and viewed Carlos' body.  Maybe it was to make sure there couldn't be any rumors that it had simply vanished into a puff of light.\n\nBefore that, there was supposedly an idea in the inner group, to take Carlos to Mexico, to die there. But he was already too sick. I say supposedly, because I don't recall who told me.  \n\nAnother idea was to take him out to the ocean on a boat, and let him die there.  \n\nSo anyone expecting immortality out of this, should consider becoming a Christian or Buddhist. I favor Christianity, it seems more realistic.  You suffer endlessly, then you die.  \n\nThe Buddhists on the other hand seem to make promises they can't keep, but you continue giving them donations because it takes a lifetime to figure that out.  And even then, they have a lame excuse of how it takes multiple lifetimes (of donations) to reach enlightenment.\n\nBut the good news is, you can be either of those and still practice Carlos' techniques to see if they work.  I guarantee you, if they don't, you aren't working hard enough. \n\nIf on the other hand you work hard, you will soon be experiencing things Buddhists won't believe, even with an honest account.\n\nChristians however won't be impressed.  But there's nothing specifically prohibiting it as long as you stay away from the drugs (SORCERY = PHARMAKEIA).\n\nHow long does it take to become a good enough trumpet player, to play in a minor band in a Las Vegas side lounge?  A half hour a day?  No way.  Try at least 3 hours a day.  For at least many months.\n\nThat's all it takes to prove that Carlos' techniques work.  \n\n\nEdited: To add the boat controversy.", "edited": 1554065926.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ejrvx9v", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Carlos&amp;#39; death.

But he said something to the Chacmools, and they closed the door and left.   One gave me a worried look for an instant, but decided he was safe with me in there.  I sat down also. I couldn\u2019t exactly go up, with him sitting down at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, he had something to say to me.  I don\u2019t know if it was me in particular, or it was for anyone who happened to be there when he arrived early.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t remember his exact words.  They weren\u2019t sad.  They weren\u2019t urgent.  They were merely, matter of fact.  He said he was dying, and no one believed him.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few seconds went by, and he shook his head yes, while he looked into my eyes, to indicate, it was indeed the absolute truth.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me a blank check. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019d spoken about those in class a few times, giving examples.  But with the checkwriter gone, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any point in trying to explain that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Double beings?  I have yet to see the luminous shell in full, which humans are supposed to be, and by which you can identify double beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I have seen the inside of the shell.  It has odd structures stuck to it, perhaps like is described in one of the books, where you can tell what type of warrior someone is by the shapes on the shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A double being is easy to detect however.  First, you have to be able to perceive the second attention.  Not anytime you like.  You don\u2019t have to be that skilled. But you have to have some understanding of it, so that you could close your eyes, and activate it when you like, even if it took several hours of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, you only need to be standing next to a double being, under the right circumstances.  I don\u2019t know what the right circumstances are. Maybe, just close enough with nothing else to distract you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you\u2019ll know them when it happens.  Reality bends drastically. Without any effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why they\u2019re so valuable to sorcery groups.  They don\u2019t even have to have a clue they can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They come in men and women. The men, like Tony Lama, have likely already tied themselves to some endeavor, because people notice their power and just think they\u2019re \u201ccan do\u201d type people.  They\u2019re always occupied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t go as well for the women.  Imagine a young woman, with extraordinary energy, but no clue what to do with it.   Will the Tibetan movement notice her, and promote her to Lama?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.  More likely, they get into stupendous trouble.  If you find one, she\u2019s likely in need of a little rescuing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s probably for that reason, that the nagual woman is supposed to be found first. Find her, and the man will join up too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with astral projection, although a double will surely be better at that, if they try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve added this, just to get everything out there. If it isn&amp;#39;t already.  First, Carlos techniques work as he said, so we don&amp;#39;t know what the heck was really going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Carlos died, someone wanted to verify the body.  I believe it was the same person who spied on classes, trying to make a video tape of them.  He was on a mission to beat Carlos in some incomprehensible manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He claims to have gone to the funeral home and viewed Carlos&amp;#39; body.  Maybe it was to make sure there couldn&amp;#39;t be any rumors that it had simply vanished into a puff of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before that, there was supposedly an idea in the inner group, to take Carlos to Mexico, to die there. But he was already too sick. I say supposedly, because I don&amp;#39;t recall who told me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another idea was to take him out to the ocean on a boat, and let him die there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyone expecting immortality out of this, should consider becoming a Christian or Buddhist. I favor Christianity, it seems more realistic.  You suffer endlessly, then you die.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Buddhists on the other hand seem to make promises they can&amp;#39;t keep, but you continue giving them donations because it takes a lifetime to figure that out.  And even then, they have a lame excuse of how it takes multiple lifetimes (of donations) to reach enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the good news is, you can be either of those and still practice Carlos&amp;#39; techniques to see if they work.  I guarantee you, if they don&amp;#39;t, you aren&amp;#39;t working hard enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If on the other hand you work hard, you will soon be experiencing things Buddhists won&amp;#39;t believe, even with an honest account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Christians however won&amp;#39;t be impressed.  But there&amp;#39;s nothing specifically prohibiting it as long as you stay away from the drugs (SORCERY = PHARMAKEIA).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long does it take to become a good enough trumpet player, to play in a minor band in a Las Vegas side lounge?  A half hour a day?  No way.  Try at least 3 hours a day.  For at least many months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all it takes to prove that Carlos&amp;#39; techniques work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: To add the boat controversy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_b67cyi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/b67cyi/the_strange_case_of_shirley_maclaine/ejrvx9v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1553993132.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1553993132.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ejpwux6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SilenceisGolden29", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ejp25ro", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3b1g8h4y", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I figured, but then again Carlos prob made enough money from the books to fund whatever lifestyle he wanted.\n\nI figure it was a real reality shock for people.

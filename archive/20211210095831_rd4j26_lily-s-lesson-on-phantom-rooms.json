When you encounter a new one, you can either interact with it, or ignore it.\n\nThey're  used to being ignored by everyone, so that's not going to cause any trouble.  And if you pay attention to it only a little, and only for a while, they're also used to that.  Children do  that a lot, and some adults stumble on IOB s without understanding, producing the same result.  They're just afraid of a specific dark part of a forest near them, for no reason, and then later they aren't anymore.\n\nSo my recommendation is don't get more than 1 IOB, even though that becomes \"easy\".\n\nIf you end up with a pair, like Phoebus and Globus, that really only counts energetically, as 1.  So Fancy and Bob, my own IOBs, are really just one, in terms of how much of my energy  they consume.  I hadn't seen Bob for a long time, until last night, when Fancy brought him around, just because I'd been wondering about him earlier in the week.\n\nBut I do in fact now have 3 unique and very real inorganic beings.  And it uses a lot of energy to have that many.  I regret it.\n\nAnd they do have different personalities, but you have to look at their actions and the results to understand what their personality is like.  Expressions, talking to them, observing how they move around, doesn't help much.  They are what they do.  But what you see, is mostly from you, not them.\n\nFancy got passed by,  after teaching me amazing things in the red zone, when I reliably learned to move my assemblage point to the front, to the orange zone, and Lily was giving me what she told me she would give me when I first adopted her.\n\nLessons on how to exit the dark room.  I suppose into dreaming, but it doesn't feel like that.  The method by which you leave feels every bit as real as just opening the door and walking out.\n\nIn reality, there's some weird smooth transition to the double.  And presumably later on, back again. If you ever had 3 arms doing tensegrity in the dark room ,you know how the double can merge with the tonal, in a very harmonious (if not bizarre) way.\n\nBut you don't get to see that merging part.  It doesn't even seem as if you had to switch at all.\n\nIt's consistent with the books.  Don Juan and Genaro tried to \"fine polish\" this ability in Carlos at the cliff, where his double jumped off, while his tonal joked with them at the top of the cliff. He never managed to merge those 2 points of view in that account, but they were both clearly happening. Most readers assumed he was really jumping, and so a source of confusion in the community arose.\n\nAnd there's that story about dreaming yourself in another place and waking up, so that  your physical body has actually traveled there.  I believe Carlos traveled from Mexico to Arizona in that story.\n\nSo we don't understand a lot!\n\nIt turns out, Cholita's phantom copy of the house gave me all the lesson I needed on what Lily just now explained to me.   I got to see it with my own eyes with Cholita's help.\n\nBut I'll try to relate what Lily said about exits to phantom rooms, with a more simple \"structure\".\n\nBefore I forget, we DON'T want \"all of the answers\".\n\nA path is finished, dead really, when it turns back on itself.\n\nSo traditional religions are dead, because there's no more exploration of the unknown.\n\nIf you try to go there, within that system, your awareness gets diverted back to junk.  To false narratives.  \"The Great Buddha has said, do not go there, or it will damage your immortal soul!!!\"\n\nMeditators to that \"system\" actually get advice like that, on where to never, ever look.\n\nAnd false narratives do not correspond to an actual range of emanations. They exist in our internal dialogue, which is sort of like a phantom reality in which everything is known, so the Eagle takes no interest.\n\nThe Eagle doesn't care what \"the Great Buddha\" has said. He only cares that you explore the unknown, make it knowing, and give him the memories of what it was like.\n\nIf you don't interest the Eagle, you get no help from intent.\n\nSo for an example, let's say you pushed the limits of Buddhist meditation and came to a \"wall\".\n\nIf you tried to go past that barrier, into territory no one had ever explored, you would have the attention of *intent*.  It would be poised to help you on your path with *intent* gifts.\n\nBut if by the time you reach that barrier your mind is filled with false explanations, created by leaders who also didn't know what was beyond that barrier, when you got there the \"understanding\" you had would point you back to the center of that \"structure\".\n\nMaybe you discovered an IOB realm, but the most famous monks and scribes have taught you, those places are evil.\n\nYou really aren't going to do very well trying to travel in there, while worrying it will damage your soul.\n\nEven a tiny, completely insignificant thought in your mind, alters the way emanations are skimmed when you finally loosen the assemblage point.\n\nIt's most of why Buddhists see \"demons\", and actually believe those exist.  The Way Milarepa did.\n\nThey have fussy expectations filled with fear, fed to them by past pretend \"systems\".  Beliefs created to get money from na\u00efve city dwellers who are completely out of touch with reality.\n\nSo the monks have blocked that exit from your reality bubble with their \"warning\".\n\nPhantom realities are structures.  Anything you can perceive in the emanations, probably has to be in the form of a structure.  Even if that structure has never existed.  The flow of awareness needed to perceive it, needs multiple paths in which to flow.\n\nReligions are merely phantom realities that have been around a long time.  Created b y time and people, they exist as their own self-sustaining structure.\n\nThe Eagle created us as probes so it could harvest our memories.  In that way it explores the unknown.\n\nBut the eagle only wants to explore the REAL unknown.  And if what you are exploring is real, meaning it's the natural flow of awareness in the emanations, the Eagle takes an interest and helps you.\n\nWe're all born with our own phantom reality structure, and we add to it daily.\n\nIt's really the only way you can exist.   You always have to have that structure or you can't deal with emanations.\n\nSo a person's life is a phantom reality containing a real, explorable unknown.  Even though it exists inside the overall reality of billions of people.  Your own phantom bubble, inside society's bubble, is a valid space for exploring. So that the Eagle helps. The Chinese call that \"luck\".\n\nYou could say instead  that *intent* helps you.  If you observe the rules summoning intent, namely that it should be bold, funny, and designed to help you on your exploration, those are really the same as what I just described about being born into a phantom reality.  It's real exploration if it's your \"real life\".  It's not internal dialogue rehashing (yet).  You summon intent \"naturally\" in that case, but it's still following the rules to get help from intent.  You just don't have to contrive them, because that's natural behavior in your own bubble.\n\nSo to re-iterate, \"systems\", which includes religions, only get help from *intent* when the participants are still exploring the unknown.\n\nBut inevitably a structure like that will turn back on itself, and be so complete that there's no exit.\n\nWhich is what Lily actually promised me.  She promised she'd teach me to exit my darkroom.\n\nFancy, my 1st inorganic being (Minx and Fairy were only lent to me), promised to teach me \"Sliding Dreaming\". Which I misunderstood to be, how to slide your hand, body, or object to cause magic.\n\nBut really, it was horizontal shifting of the assemblage point.  She's a foreigner... Gets some words wrong.\n\nLikewise, I misunderstood Lily.  She was actually teaching me how phantom room bubbles expand.\n\nAnd Fairy originally tricked me into learning darkroom practices, when in fact I thought I was teaching her to let me throw her like a ball.\n\nA path of trickery?  Isn't that what the rule states?\n\nCholita's phantom house is a good example.  The first time I entered it was an absolutely perfect copy of our home, except if you had tried to go too far in the back yard you would have found chaos there.  As long as you remained in the area where Cholita had walked, you were in a stable place.  But past that it turned into random dreaming.\n\nTrying to read a book in dreaming causes a similar effect.  Most of the time, the writing will keep changing.\n\nDuring that first visit to Cholita's phantom house, I found Minx and a hole in the bathroom wall, obviously created with a sledge hammer.  They were literally expanding the house by breaking down walls and creating new exits.\n\nWhen I complained to Minx, who looked like a little boy Cholita had picked up, Cholita came to see and the situation in the bathroom settled down, as if the new additions Minx was making were stable with Cholita there.  I understand that to indicate, Cholita can expand her house just by traveling in a direction which has a visible exit.  Into the garage through a door for example, but once in the garage she can cause it to be a resort hotel courtyard, instead of what was there before. This is why crazy people make better dreamers. They have less rationality, and can \"feel\" opening the garage door and stepping into a hotel courtyard, even though a normal person would find that a problem.  When I entered there, I had to make an \"adjustment\" in the dream.  I actually saw it happen.  It needed a \"transition\", so my awareness manufactured an excuse (explanation).\n\nThe second time I visited Cholita's phantom house I found she'd added a couple of rooms.  But when I tried  to go into one, I found it ended halfway in the new room. When I crossed that point I was in chaotic dreaming.  And ultimately got lost.  Cholita found that addition boring, and returned back into the house.\n\nThe next time I entered the garage, I found her phantom hotel addition.  I visited there 3 times, finding Cholita and Minx in each,  until I traveled too far down a hotel hallway and found a wall had been broken open with a sledge hammer.\n\nWhen I entered there, I found myself in chaotic dreaming, but with the sensation I'd entered the IOB realm.  I understood/sensed that from 4 gates dreaming experiences.\n\nWhich I suppose means, 4 gates dreaming is actually part of this same lesson.  The one Lily just gave me about phantom rooms.  Carlos gave us a structure into which to explore how exits and walls are created in phantom realms, and even taught us to create emergency exits in dreams by going to sleep in them.\n\nHe gave us Lily's lesson.  It makes me wonder if he hadn't given us Fancy's lessons elsewhere, and the truth is that we all get certain lessons as a gift from intent along the path.  Meaning, it all repeats.\n\nWith Cholita gone, I can't find a way into her phantom house/ But I suppose what I learned so far was really all I needed.  And in fact, Cholita ended up expanding that reality in the very direction she likely now lives.  She gets parking tickets once in a while.  She traveled in the second attention, and found  a new place to live in the first attention.\n\nA strange mystery.\n\nTo simplify what Lily explained, imagine a more simple phantom room, the kind you will get to see during darkroom.\n\nIt's formed by the whitish light of seeing. You are in \"seeing energy\" mode.\n\nIn that mode, the whitish light is looking for any excuse to form into something\n\nWhen in the darkroom, we know the \"doing\" of rooms so it tends to form those.\n\nBut it will never be complete the first time it forms, so there are \"exits\" into chaotic dreaming. Typically it has only 3 walls.\n\nLily promised to teach me how to leave through the \"unfinished\" part, which could even include a door beyond which there was nothing.  Paths you can take into the unknown, from your starting point.\n\nWhen doing that you have the attention of *intent*, who will gift you based on how much effort you are putting into it. Possibly, every step you take in there is an \"intent gift\".\n\nThe eagle wants memories of emanation combinations he hasn't seen before.  So you get help on any path, which still has unknown to explore.\n\nBut when no more exits remain, that \"structure\" is finished.\n\nAnd there's no more intent gifts exploring it.\n\nWhen it's just you in the phantom reality, it pretty much never seals up.  So our dreaming worlds are chaotic as I said.\n\nBut once you put the energy of more than 1 into a phantom reality, it has the potential to finish and fold back in on itself. That path of exploration can become dead.\n\nYou can \"seal\" that bubble.  Which makes me wonder if the death defier didn't \"seal\" his village, when he placed a church in it.  A sort of perverse joke on his part.\n\nIt also makes me wonder how the IOBs \"sealed\" their world, making it possible to trap your double in it.\n\nThat is in fact another way to look at it.  While a phantom room is still \"alive\", it is changing.\n\nWhen it can no longer change, it's \"dead\".\n\nCarlos gave us quite a few lectures about how heaven is a \"dead world'.  Where nothing changes.\n\nI didn't understand at the time.\n\nAs far as what we're doing goes, we'd like to have all the answers.\n\nBut we don't.\n\nAnd here's the horrible thing.  We're not supposed to.\n\nSorcerers are very aware of the perils of knowing everything on a path.\n\nYou can complete the structure, and there's no more exists available.\n\nWhen bad players attack us to get attention, telling us about delusional \"techniques\" and videos they found, they're really trying to \"seal\" this subreddit with false narrative walls that cause people to turn back.  They don't want you to go \"further\" than they do.\n\nI suppose the unknown is not cozy enough, so they try to take some control over this subreddit by injecting delusional techniques from false systems.\n\nThat's a good thing to understand, because when someone innocently tells what we all know to be  false,  you ought to be harsh with them.  They are literally trying to \"seal us in\" and prevent magic.\n\n\"Magic\" is an aspect of Lily's explanation tonight, that I possibly lost because I insisted on writing this down. I stopped before she was done.  There's a price to pay for interrupting the dreaming emissary. They stop teaching that topic. We got warned about that.\n\n\"Magic\" attracts people to \"systems\".  It's the lure.  Then if the system is a big con, it takes a lifetime to find out you never get that magic. But by then, you get sealed in.\n\nThat's what's happened to all of the major religions. They have no viable unknown to explore and have sealed their bubble.\n\nI blame the false narratives myself.  Never underestimate the damage of a false story, inside a system.  Even if the system lures you with promises of magic, the false narratives are like chains, and will doom you.\n\nBut even just \"answering\" everything with sacred scrolls, and the writings of people you aren't supposed to question, completes that phantom room (which can be an entire religion), and it becomes dead to intent.\n\n\"The Buddha\" is a false narrative, which seals people into that religion. You never question him, can never reach  his level, and so if you decide to explore the only remaining exits you can find, you are turned back.\n\nWhen exploring the unknown it's possible to study that effect, and learn how to avoid it in weak structures.\n\nBut only experience can teach that.  There are some known rules:  Don't stare,  don't get too involved, move on quickly.  We don't want to know what everything looks like.  That's not a good thing to do.\n\nRecap sort of works on this principle, as does stalking.  If you can see that without more explanation, congratulate yourself.\n\nNeither is it a good thing to get all the answers.  Beginners always try to learn all he answers, not realizing that destroys the path.\n\nOur sorcery is half chaotic space, and that's the way it needs to remain so that intent provides maximum help for explorers (us).\n\nThus my activities in this subreddit could be viewed as bad by Carlos and the witches. So it's important to only endeavor to point out the exits, and not accidentally seal them.\n\nFor example, don Juan wouldn't tell Carlos the kinds of inorganic beings. Refused to do it. He didn't want to \"seal\" that exit for Carlos with what would turn into a false narrative in his mind.  No one ever really \"understands\" any explanation.  Most will be misunderstood.\n\nHopefully if we find enough people who can spare the time to keep pushing, we gain the mass to  share phantom realities and experiment on this topic.  See what tends to \"complete\" the structure, and what tends to leave it with viable exits.\n\nThose \"curiosa\" witches described in the women's books, seem like they're doing a good thing, and creating new exits we can all use.\n\nThat's also a likely alternative path, to the Olmec one.  The path of the Curiosa.  A friend to reality.\n\nPossibly, the 5 or 6 ways Lily taught me to exit my phantom darkroom were a summary of the basics of the process.  Or at least, enough ideas for directions to go.\n\nLily also showed me the path of sorcery, from an outside point of view.\n\nThe \"shape\" of that structure.\n\nIt was true that half was still in chaotic space, unformed, open to all possibilities, and so alive and constantly expanding into the emanations.\n\nWhich is precisely what the Eagle likes best.\n\nA few times, Carlos called other systems \"dead\" the same way he said that heaven was a dead world.\n\nFree exploration of the emanations, without our organic bodies (the 3rd attention), puts us in a situation where there are exits on all walls of the phantom structure we are exploring, which is likely the ultimate use of awareness.\n\nIf not a bit un-cozy.\n\nMaybe cozy is just having enough solid walls in your phantom room (your life), to feel that it's real space and not chaotic space like ordinary dreaming.  But with an exit or two still left to give you a sense of hope.\n\nEven if you never try that doorway.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Lily's Lesson On Phantom Rooms", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"lblmvmkvf5581": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lblmvmkvf5581.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2941a545346e76e3f578aa139080e3a6862093f0"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lblmvmkvf5581.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8227e3055e1a1362f1effab5be8149def8a5cc06"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lblmvmkvf5581.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfc052e188ab73e49d666c6baa853585ae628c30"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lblmvmkvf5581.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e575ad7b7575168b01f64e356fa1b6d3f7fd50ff"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lblmvmkvf5581.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5d3772ee7cbacd1a5b032b1aa217259a4950cab"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lblmvmkvf5581.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c1f31176b4fea1903813e2c57e55dafc1c1761"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lblmvmkvf5581.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51d7f9e210de620dc0e7aec9e28eb4c93fe8d0a9"}, "id": "lblmvmkvf5581"}}, "name": "t3_rd4j26", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ucODrmAmGvtjRXcpfEcfSHinlxWblmlzPAx7v4UvDxU.jpg", "edited": 1639331583.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1639126711.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lblmvmkvf5581.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51d7f9e210de620dc0e7aec9e28eb4c93fe8d0a9\"&gt;Carlos gave us more than a dozen lectures on \\&amp;quot;dead\\&amp;quot; systems of belief.

It would be poised to help you on your path with &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; gifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if by the time you reach that barrier your mind is filled with false explanations, created by leaders who also didn&amp;#39;t know what was beyond that barrier, when you got there the &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; you had would point you back to the center of that &amp;quot;structure&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you discovered an IOB realm, but the most famous monks and scribes have taught you, those places are evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really aren&amp;#39;t going to do very well trying to travel in there, while worrying it will damage your soul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even a tiny, completely insignificant thought in your mind, alters the way emanations are skimmed when you finally loosen the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s most of why Buddhists see &amp;quot;demons&amp;quot;, and actually believe those exist.  The Way Milarepa did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have fussy expectations filled with fear, fed to them by past pretend &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot;.  Beliefs created to get money from na\u00efve city dwellers who are completely out of touch with reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the monks have blocked that exit from your reality bubble with their &amp;quot;warning&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phantom realities are structures.  Anything you can perceive in the emanations, probably has to be in the form of a structure.  Even if that structure has never existed.  The flow of awareness needed to perceive it, needs multiple paths in which to flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Religions are merely phantom realities that have been around a long time.  Created b y time and people, they exist as their own self-sustaining structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Eagle created us as probes so it could harvest our memories.  In that way it explores the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the eagle only wants to explore the REAL unknown.  And if what you are exploring is real, meaning it&amp;#39;s the natural flow of awareness in the emanations, the Eagle takes an interest and helps you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re all born with our own phantom reality structure, and we add to it daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really the only way you can exist.   You always have to have that structure or you can&amp;#39;t deal with emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a person&amp;#39;s life is a phantom reality containing a real, explorable unknown.  Even though it exists inside the overall reality of billions of people.  Your own phantom bubble, inside society&amp;#39;s bubble, is a valid space for exploring. So that the Eagle helps. The Chinese call that &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could say instead  that &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; helps you.  If you observe the rules summoning intent, namely that it should be bold, funny, and designed to help you on your exploration, those are really the same as what I just described about being born into a phantom reality.  It&amp;#39;s real exploration if it&amp;#39;s your &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s not internal dialogue rehashing (yet).  You summon intent &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot; in that case, but it&amp;#39;s still following the rules to get help from intent.  You just don&amp;#39;t have to contrive them, because that&amp;#39;s natural behavior in your own bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to re-iterate, &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot;, which includes religions, only get help from &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; when the participants are still exploring the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But inevitably a structure like that will turn back on itself, and be so complete that there&amp;#39;s no exit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is what Lily actually promised me.  She promised she&amp;#39;d teach me to exit my darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy, my 1st inorganic being (Minx and Fairy were only lent to me), promised to teach me &amp;quot;Sliding Dreaming&amp;quot;. Which I misunderstood to be, how to slide your hand, body, or object to cause magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, it was horizontal shifting of the assemblage point.  She&amp;#39;s a foreigner... Gets some words wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I misunderstood Lily.  She was actually teaching me how phantom room bubbles expand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Fairy originally tricked me into learning darkroom practices, when in fact I thought I was teaching her to let me throw her like a ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A path of trickery?  Isn&amp;#39;t that what the rule states?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s phantom house is a good example.  The first time I entered it was an absolutely perfect copy of our home, except if you had tried to go too far in the back yard you would have found chaos there.  As long as you remained in the area where Cholita had walked, you were in a stable place.  But past that it turned into random dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to read a book in dreaming causes a similar effect.  Most of the time, the writing will keep changing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During that first visit to Cholita&amp;#39;s phantom house, I found Minx and a hole in the bathroom wall, obviously created with a sledge hammer.  They were literally expanding the house by breaking down walls and creating new exits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I complained to Minx, who looked like a little boy Cholita had picked up, Cholita came to see and the situation in the bathroom settled down, as if the new additions Minx was making were stable with Cholita there.  I understand that to indicate, Cholita can expand her house just by traveling in a direction which has a visible exit.  Into the garage through a door for example, but once in the garage she can cause it to be a resort hotel courtyard, instead of what was there before. This is why crazy people make better dreamers. They have less rationality, and can &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; opening the garage door and stepping into a hotel courtyard, even though a normal person would find that a problem.  When I entered there, I had to make an &amp;quot;adjustment&amp;quot; in the dream.  I actually saw it happen.  It needed a &amp;quot;transition&amp;quot;, so my awareness manufactured an excuse (explanation).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second time I visited Cholita&amp;#39;s phantom house I found she&amp;#39;d added a couple of rooms.  But when I tried  to go into one, I found it ended halfway in the new room. When I crossed that point I was in chaotic dreaming.  And ultimately got lost.  Cholita found that addition boring, and returned back into the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next time I entered the garage, I found her phantom hotel addition.  I visited there 3 times, finding Cholita and Minx in each,  until I traveled too far down a hotel hallway and found a wall had been broken open with a sledge hammer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I entered there, I found myself in chaotic dreaming, but with the sensation I&amp;#39;d entered the IOB realm.  I understood/sensed that from 4 gates dreaming experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I suppose means, 4 gates dreaming is actually part of this same lesson.  The one Lily just gave me about phantom rooms.  Carlos gave us a structure into which to explore how exits and walls are created in phantom realms, and even taught us to create emergency exits in dreams by going to sleep in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave us Lily&amp;#39;s lesson.  It makes me wonder if he hadn&amp;#39;t given us Fancy&amp;#39;s lessons elsewhere, and the truth is that we all get certain lessons as a gift from intent along the path.  Meaning, it all repeats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Cholita gone, I can&amp;#39;t find a way into her phantom house/ But I suppose what I learned so far was really all I needed.  And in fact, Cholita ended up expanding that reality in the very direction she likely now lives.  She gets parking tickets once in a while.  She traveled in the second attention, and found  a new place to live in the first attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A strange mystery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To simplify what Lily explained, imagine a more simple phantom room, the kind you will get to see during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s formed by the whitish light of seeing. You are in &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot; mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that mode, the whitish light is looking for any excuse to form into something&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in the darkroom, we know the &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; of rooms so it tends to form those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it will never be complete the first time it forms, so there are &amp;quot;exits&amp;quot; into chaotic dreaming. Typically it has only 3 walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily promised to teach me how to leave through the &amp;quot;unfinished&amp;quot; part, which could even include a door beyond which there was nothing.  Paths you can take into the unknown, from your starting point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When doing that you have the attention of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, who will gift you based on how much effort you are putting into it. Possibly, every step you take in there is an &amp;quot;intent gift&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The eagle wants memories of emanation combinations he hasn&amp;#39;t seen before.  So you get help on any path, which still has unknown to explore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when no more exits remain, that &amp;quot;structure&amp;quot; is finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s no more intent gifts exploring it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s just you in the phantom reality, it pretty much never seals up.  So our dreaming worlds are chaotic as I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you put the energy of more than 1 into a phantom reality, it has the potential to finish and fold back in on itself. That path of exploration can become dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can &amp;quot;seal&amp;quot; that bubble.  Which makes me wonder if the death defier didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;seal&amp;quot; his village, when he placed a church in it.  A sort of perverse joke on his part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also makes me wonder how the IOBs &amp;quot;sealed&amp;quot; their world, making it possible to trap your double in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is in fact another way to look at it.  While a phantom room is still &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot;, it is changing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it can no longer change, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave us quite a few lectures about how heaven is a &amp;quot;dead world&amp;#39;.  Where nothing changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t understand at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as what we&amp;#39;re doing goes, we&amp;#39;d like to have all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the horrible thing.  We&amp;#39;re not supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers are very aware of the perils of knowing everything on a path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can complete the structure, and there&amp;#39;s no more exists available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When bad players attack us to get attention, telling us about delusional &amp;quot;techniques&amp;quot; and videos they found, they&amp;#39;re really trying to &amp;quot;seal&amp;quot; this subreddit with false narrative walls that cause people to turn back.  They don&amp;#39;t want you to go &amp;quot;further&amp;quot; than they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the unknown is not cozy enough, so they try to take some control over this subreddit by injecting delusional techniques from false systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a good thing to understand, because when someone innocently tells what we all know to be  false,  you ought to be harsh with them.  They are literally trying to &amp;quot;seal us in&amp;quot; and prevent magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot; is an aspect of Lily&amp;#39;s explanation tonight, that I possibly lost because I insisted on writing this down. I stopped before she was done.  There&amp;#39;s a price to pay for interrupting the dreaming emissary. They stop teaching that topic. We got warned about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot; attracts people to &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s the lure.  Then if the system is a big con, it takes a lifetime to find out you never get that magic. But by then, you get sealed in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happened to all of the major religions. They have no viable unknown to explore and have sealed their bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blame the false narratives myself.  Never underestimate the damage of a false story, inside a system.  Even if the system lures you with promises of magic, the false narratives are like chains, and will doom you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even just &amp;quot;answering&amp;quot; everything with sacred scrolls, and the writings of people you aren&amp;#39;t supposed to question, completes that phantom room (which can be an entire religion), and it becomes dead to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Buddha&amp;quot; is a false narrative, which seals people into that religion. You never question him, can never reach  his level, and so if you decide to explore the only remaining exits you can find, you are turned back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When exploring the unknown it&amp;#39;s possible to study that effect, and learn how to avoid it in weak structures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only experience can teach that.  There are some known rules:  Don&amp;#39;t stare,  don&amp;#39;t get too involved, move on quickly.  We don&amp;#39;t want to know what everything looks like.  That&amp;#39;s not a good thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recap sort of works on this principle, as does stalking.  If you can see that without more explanation, congratulate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither is it a good thing to get all the answers.  Beginners always try to learn all he answers, not realizing that destroys the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our sorcery is half chaotic space, and that&amp;#39;s the way it needs to remain so that intent provides maximum help for explorers (us).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus my activities in this subreddit could be viewed as bad by Carlos and the witches. So it&amp;#39;s important to only endeavor to point out the exits, and not accidentally seal them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, don Juan wouldn&amp;#39;t tell Carlos the kinds of inorganic beings. Refused to do it. He didn&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;seal&amp;quot; that exit for Carlos with what would turn into a false narrative in his mind.  No one ever really &amp;quot;understands&amp;quot; any explanation.  Most will be misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully if we find enough people who can spare the time to keep pushing, we gain the mass to  share phantom realities and experiment on this topic.  See what tends to &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; the structure, and what tends to leave it with viable exits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those &amp;quot;curiosa&amp;quot; witches described in the women&amp;#39;s books, seem like they&amp;#39;re doing a good thing, and creating new exits we can all use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also a likely alternative path, to the Olmec one.  The path of the Curiosa.  A friend to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly, the 5 or 6 ways Lily taught me to exit my phantom darkroom were a summary of the basics of the process.  Or at least, enough ideas for directions to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily also showed me the path of sorcery, from an outside point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot; of that structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was true that half was still in chaotic space, unformed, open to all possibilities, and so alive and constantly expanding into the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is precisely what the Eagle likes best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few times, Carlos called other systems &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; the same way he said that heaven was a dead world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Free exploration of the emanations, without our organic bodies (the 3rd attention), puts us in a situation where there are exits on all walls of the phantom structure we are exploring, which is likely the ultimate use of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not a bit un-cozy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe cozy is just having enough solid walls in your phantom room (your life), to feel that it&amp;#39;s real space and not chaotic space like ordinary dreaming.  But with an exit or two still left to give you a sense of hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you never try that doorway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "rd4j26", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 15, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rd4j26/lilys_lesson_on_phantom_rooms/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rd4j26/lilys_lesson_on_phantom_rooms/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1639126711.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ho5hl5t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ho5gxzu", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "There are 21 occurrences of \"matrix\".

To be worth your cost, you&amp;#39;d have to save people the time of breaking the initial barrier to get into  the second attention, drug free, eyes open, and wide awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which if you think about it, is far beyond any Yogi, Buddhist, or Daoist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of them can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_rd4j26", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rd4j26/lilys_lesson_on_phantom_rooms/ho0kfh6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1639160023.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1639160023.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ho06nt4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hnzzcg8", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;There was a visitor today who said, she was \"convinced\" until I mentioned Shirley MacLaine's dream Carlos was raping her in the butt.\n\nThat comment thread:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rcl6ra/-/hnvy1vp\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rcl6ra/-/ho00srg", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ho06nt4", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There was a visitor today who said, she was &amp;quot;convinced&amp;quot; until I mentioned Shirley MacLaine&amp;#39;s dream Carlos was raping her in the butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That comment thread:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rcl6ra/-/hnvy1vp\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rcl6ra/-/hnvy1vp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rcl6ra/-/ho00srg\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rcl6ra/-/ho00srg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_rd4j26", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rd4j26/lilys_lesson_on_phantom_rooms/ho06nt4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1639154610.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1639154610.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hnzzcg8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1639151676.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hnyw2lf", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I have no info on any of that.\n\nAnd I've learned, you don't ask your IOB a question, unless you're willing to lose all the work  you've done with them so far, to send them down a path that's not very helpful because it's  your own or someone else's obsession with other humans.\n\nBut I did see an odd passage in the all in one pdf.

They just turn dull and then eventually waste away.\n\nThere's so many things like  that we don't know.\n\nDid you read the post?

Probably with \"love\" if it's really a female witch type.\n\nThe way Buddhism has done also, by setting barriers of worry and doubt, wherever their followers might accidentally try to travel.\n\nThat's the very thing Lily was explaining.  About how we trap ourselves by trying to understand everything, in a way that makes us comfortable.\n\nWe try to make sorcery \"cozy\".\n\nBut the fact is, reality traps us with that feeling.

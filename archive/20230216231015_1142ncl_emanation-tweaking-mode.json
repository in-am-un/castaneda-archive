So the Allies are \"real\" enough.\n\nIf you see a witch, it's her double.  Those can actually harm you if they strike.\n\nBeats me how, but remember Genaro dropping a 1 ton boulder on the shoulder of Carlos  just by gently placing his hand there.\n\nCholita  used to wake me up by poking me in her double.\n\nThen there's phantom rooms.\n\nAre those imaginary?\n\nSince you can share them with others, even whole sorcery lineages,  I don't see how you can call them imaginary.\n\nYou can supposedly even go live in those, for a few hundred years. The old seers did.\n\nThe problem really comes down to, does it behave 100% like we are used to at our level of reality?\n\nNo.\n\nBeyond that, you'll just have to learn about this yourself.  Until you start to be \"satisfied\" it's real enough to be worth learning about.\n\nThere is of course, the story of Carlos moving to Arizona to become fry cook \"Joe Cordoba\".\n\nAn expert on eggs.\n\nHe got an apartment, and down in the basement was a piano.\n\nA kid there liked to play it, and it was driving Carlos nuts.\n\nHe had become Joe in order to please la Gorda, whose job was to annoy the hell out of him whenever possible.\n\nI sure hope that was a paying job.\n\nBecause Cholita has the same occupation.  Annoying the hell out of me, for my own good.\n\nBut la Gorda did so by ordering Carlos to do things that sorcerers have to do anyway.\n\nThe way Taisha became a homeless woman for a year.\n\nCarlos was there as Joe, to perfect his silence.  Free from the connections back at home that would inevitably stir it up.\n\nForeign travel can do the same thing.\n\nSo Carlos was having trouble reaching the deepest levels of silence with all that piano noise, and don Juan suggested he should just \"intend the basement to be flooded\".\n\nAnd it did.\n\nElsewhere there's something even more startling.\n\nSomething I've been coming to suspect for a long time now.\n\nSorcerers are a LOT more powerful than we were led to believe.\n\nIt says that Juan Tuma could change any aspect of reality, but that he always kept track of what things would have been, had he not changed it.\n\nThat's off the top of my head so if it's significantly wrong, anyone is welcome to post the original quote.\n\nSo back to the topic of \"Emanation Tweaking\".\n\nWe learned the basis of this in our Tensegrity forms.\n\nYou tickle the emanations in front of you with your fingers shaped like a relaxed claw.\n\nJust claw the air \"all over\" in front of you.\n\nNot much fun at a workshop. So Kylie made it fun, the first time it was taught.\n\nAnd also not much fun when Cholita is doing it, to modify your own reality.  She's capable of standing upright inside a car, even if it's impossible to do that, in order to wiggle her fingers and alter reality.\n\nI have no idea if it works.  Maybe it's like those sci-fis where the present is changed in the past, and no one knows it because that's the new timeline.\n\nBut in darkroom at advanced stages, the air is FILLED with stuff to tickle.\n\nIf you can expose the \"red\" emanations, you're on the verge of flying!\n\nThose are used by sorcerers to travel through the air freely.\n\nAnd if you disturb the emanations with your tickling, don't forget to \"fan\" it all into your V spot.\n\nThat also deals with the emanations in front of you becoming visible.\n\nBut back to \"emanation tweaking\".\n\nIt's a Silent Knowledge activity.\n\nYou run into some \"problem\" during darkroom, while making use of your double to enjoy what you have assembled (alternate realities or phantom rooms).\n\nAnd if you sit in perfect silence in Silent Knowledge and something is \"bothering you\", as long as it's very faint, silent knowledge tells you how to fix it.\n\nYou get a version of the thing which animates, and a voice explains how to manipulate it.\n\nIn the case of manipulating the emanations with your fingers, the voice will instruct you to color match the hues and the intensity of them, by using your fingers.\n\nRemember, any reality is just a small sample of the emanations possible at that assemblage point position.\n\nThere's perhaps as many as 10,000 alternatives, right in front of you. So naturally it's possible to slightly alter which ones are active with the glow of awareness.\n\nSo that you can directly alter a reality you \"skimmed\" during darkroom.\n\nReduce the aggressiveness of phantoms in a phantom reality for example.\n\nOr open a door that's locked to you.  Unlock it, in the emanations.\n\nRemove the ceiling.\n\nCan you do that in the normal world?\n\nIt seems as if that might be so.\n\nBut as I like to say often, who cares?\n\nIt's pretty darned cool to do it during darkroom.\n\nWho the hell else can do that?\n\nNo one.\n\nJust sorcerers.\n\nAnd don't forget, other \"saints\" have to sit with their eyes closed, grinning.  Just to see a few lame visions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e83veyva6nia1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b8589e8cb5c112109d3ee14fd7f75287192a969", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Emanation Tweaking Mode", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 125, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"e83veyva6nia1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e83veyva6nia1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e907c106f6e010f12a281a3a38f4736c4921259"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e83veyva6nia1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6862e95b0ca9f78acc056858383c1769d09ff735"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e83veyva6nia1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3fc70c0c1762b02cb89568458ed8fd2d0a7421c"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e83veyva6nia1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=451beffcc1f98399017212f9734640f11a492b76"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e83veyva6nia1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b39629b410ca3d2e1f036b3723e2fe2b6fc56c60"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e83veyva6nia1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b520cf8ae1e12ffb7069a606ad387c233ae06394"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e83veyva6nia1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b8589e8cb5c112109d3ee14fd7f75287192a969"}, "id": "e83veyva6nia1"}, "5tx4tc33hmia1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 96, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5tx4tc33hmia1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa355a9ae6fc41d7b1022f013048aeee59381e3a"}, {"y": 193, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5tx4tc33hmia1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82b0f71968400563b6c47562e30567722eaa1b00"}, {"y": 287, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5tx4tc33hmia1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ea59fa030062669e8ae1c2d3168087977b94554"}], "s": {"y": 488, "x": 544, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5tx4tc33hmia1.png?width=544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=035bbaa8e9c7bb0efe7831f40d38adfee1ada204"}, "id": "5tx4tc33hmia1"}}, "name": "t3_1142ncl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/RVMQr9OOclruHcUa5bH6dqVpCFMncdvccezAyCrgyVc.jpg", "edited": 1676593016.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1676585415.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5tx4tc33hmia1.png?width=544&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=035bbaa8e9c7bb0efe7831f40d38adfee1ada204\"&gt;Not a perfect match to what you&amp;#39;ll see, but the feeling is right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have to make the picture, so here&amp;#39;s a post for this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to &amp;quot;practice&amp;quot; tweaking reality with your fingers, during darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s the point if it&amp;#39;s all in your head?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entities you see during darkroom can move solid objects.
